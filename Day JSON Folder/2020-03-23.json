But she is still only 16 and, when you are only 16, you still have so many things you need to improve, which is great. \u201cThe players she has beaten in the slams \u2013 Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka \u2013 and making the second week of a slam again after making the second week at Wimbledon, at that age, having so much to improve, it says so much about her as a person.\u201d Gauff has won eight of 11 matches in three of the four grand slams and has placed herself alongside young contenders and champions such as Kenin, Osaka, the 19-year-old US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova. Gauff, along with her peers, can do little more than work on her game and fitness while the global halt to sport expands by the day. She had hopes of going to the Tokyo Olympics in July, but that door is closing by the hour. However, the unscheduled tennis break could benefit a young player who is still growing towards physical and emotional maturity at extraordinary pace in an unrelenting environment.",

David Littleproud ended his piece with a call to his \u201cfellow Australians\u201d to work together and to support \u201cour farmers\u201d. One of the many, very real dangers of this epidemic is that it will amplify an inward-looking nationalism, and an intensification of all kinds of borders (physical, political, social, cultural) long after the Covid-19 threat has diminished. Let\u2019s by all means think about the business of food production. But let\u2019s do that in ways that do not fall back on ill-conceived notions of national self-sufficiency. What the Covid-19 pandemic and its impacts on our food systems should highlight for us is our deep enmeshment in regional and global networks, and our responsibilities to all of those who feed us.

      "bodyText": "A detainee in Villawood detention centre has been tested for coronavirus, as asylum seekers and refugees in immigration detention centres across Australia say it is impossible for them to self-isolate and protect themselves from the virus. \u201cWe are sitting ducks for Covid-19 and extremely exposed to becoming severely ill, with the possibility of death,\u201d detainees from across immigration detention centres have written in a letter to prime minister Scott Morrison, pleading to be released into the community on health grounds. Asylum seekers and refugees said they were \u201canxious and scared\u201d of a Covid-19 outbreak inside detention, saying they were being held \u201cin a potential death trap in which we have no option or means to protect ourselves\u201d. The Australian government\u2019s own advisory says \u201cpeople in detention facilities\u201d are considered most at risk of serious infection of Covid-19. Visits to immigration detention centres \u2013 including by family members \u2013 have been cancelled. In the UK, the Home Office has released more than 300 people from detention because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Domestically, the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (Asid), the Australian College of Infection Prevention and Control (ACIPC) and Doctors for Refugees have all said detainees need to be released from held detention urgently to prevent rapid Covid-19 transmission. \u201cKeeping people unnecessarily locked up in close confinement at this time when the rest of the country is being urged to stay in their own four square metres is not only cruel, callous and highly discriminatory, it is potentially exacerbating a public health crisis,\u201d said Dr Barri Phatarfod, co-founder of Doctors for Refugees. A public petition from Human Rights for All calling for the immediate release of asylum seekers and refugees in detention has attracted nearly 20,000 signatures. \u201cFamilies across Australia are struggling with the ramifications of Covid-19,\u201d director-principal Alison Battisson said. \u201cThe families of people in detention are no different. We ask that these families are allowed to bring their loved ones home to see out the pandemic. These people have safe and caring home environments willing to support them, either with a family member or advocate in Australia.\u201d A spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs told Guardian Australia there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 at Villawood immigration detention centre or within the broader detention network. \u201cInfection control plans are in place and plans to manage suspected cases of Covid-19 have been developed and tested.\u201d A male detainee has been isolated in the Blaxland wing of Villawood detention centre after being taken to hospital to be tested for Covid-19. The results of his tests are unknown. His test follows that of another asylum seeker tested in Melbourne\u2019s detention centre, and the positive Covid-19 result of a Serco guard working at the Brisbane hotel where asylum seekers and refugees are being detained. Doctors said there were almost no infection controls inside detention centres, where toilet paper, soap and hand sanitiser are running short, and those in detention have to queue in close proximity for meals and other services. People are still being detained in shared and bunk rooms, with up to four people in a room in some detention centres. Thirty-one-year-old Huyen Tran, a Vietnamese asylum seeker, is the mother of an Australian-born daughter, Isabella, who has lived almost all of her life inside the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (Mita) centre. Isabella was taken to hospital in July last year with influenza after IHMS staff at Mita failed to immunise the then 15-month-old. Dr Barri Phatarfod said: \u201c[Isabella\u2019s previous illness] is quite a serious condition when children are that young and their lungs are still developing. We don\u2019t know if she has residual damage to her lungs as a result and if so, this would make her particularly susceptible to coronavirus infection.\u201d Speaking to Guardian Australia, Tran said Isabella was meant to have a doctor\u2019s appointment last Friday because the toddler had been coughing and had a runny nose but staff failed to take her to the appointment. Medical notes seen by Guardian Australia indicate the toddler has lost weight and is waiting for a referral to a paediatric dietician. In a joint statement, Asid president Joshua Davis and ACIPC president Philip Russo said 1,400 asylum seekers and other non-citizens were being held in detention in crowded conditions that would preclude adequate social distancing or self-isolation. Staff would also be at risk from an outbreak. \u201cWe urge the commonwealth government to consider the release of detainees into suitable housing in the community if they do not pose a significant security or health risk.\u201d In a collective letter from inside detention, detainees said they feared the virus would be brought in from outside the centre, and would be uncontrollable once inside. \u201cThe staff are on a continuing rotation roster which we believe to be unacceptable as this causes an exceedingly high potential for Covid-19 to be transported within detention centres. The centre\u2019s are drastically medically under-resourced. There are not enough doctors, nurses or resources to tend to us should an outbreak occur.\u201d The Refugee Council of Australia has urged the government, as part of its economic stimulus measures, to extend supplementary payments to all people living in the Australian community, including those on bridging visas, who face losing their jobs in the economic downturn. A spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs said there were established plans for dealing with a potential coronavirus outbreak within the detention network. \u201cWithin the detention facility detainees displaying any Covid-19 symptoms may be quarantined and tested in line with advice from health officials and in accordance with the broader commonwealth response. \u201cA range of measures have been introduced, and are being continually reviewed, to keep detainees and staff informed of preventive measures and personal hygiene standards.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Oregon governor issued a sweeping \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d order on Monday, after facing intense criticism for not taking strong enough measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in a state which may be poorly positioned to weather the crisis. Kate Brown\u2019s order mandated the closure of a range of businesses \u2013 from art galleries to yoga studios \u2013 in which \u201cclose personal contact is difficult or impossible to avoid\u201d as well as playgrounds and basketball courts. A ban on on-site consumption in bars, restaurants and coffee shops, made on 17 March , remained in place. Over the preceding week, state agencies had banned overnight camping in state forests, and closed especially popular trails and outdoor recreation facilities. Monday\u2019s order also banned \u201cnon-essential social gatherings\u201d where physical distancing of six feet could not be maintained. Oregonians may leave their houses, and engage in exercise and outdoor recreation, but only if the same physical distancing was possible. Disobeying the laws will be a misdemeanor offense. Brown had been the subject of criticism and incredulity from health authorities and other elected officials \u2013 many fellow Democrats \u2013 after she failed last week to follow the lead of states such as California and New York in enforcing strict physical distancing. Over the weekend, when Portlanders flooded small beachside communities in warm spring weather, the criticism became even more pointed. On Sunday, Brown was given an unprecedented ultimatum by the mayor of Portland to shut the state down. On Twitter, the Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, directly addressed the governor, a fellow Democrat, writing, \u201cwe cannot delay any longer. @OregonGovBrown, we need a statewide #StayAtHome order\u201d. He added that if the governor did not do so, \u201cI\u2019m ready to act for Portland tomorrow\u201d. Wheeler\u2019s challenge came after he, other elected officials, and health bodies had been urging stronger measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Wheeler and 25 Portland-area mayors, representing 40% of the state\u2019s population, wrote to the governor on Saturday, arguing that \u201cdelaying this order puts our residents, our first responders and our health care system at extreme risk\u201d. On Sunday, leaders of the Portland metro area\u2019s three counties echoed their request. Separately, medical authorities including Oregon Health &amp; Science University, a major hospital provider; the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems; the Oregon Public Health Association; and the Oregon chapter of the American College of Physicians had made similar calls. These efforts followed a botched joint press conference on Friday where Brown appeared to offer details of a \u201cshelter in place\u201d order but refused to issue it. The widespread concern reflects a view that Oregon\u2019s public health resources may be inadequate for the scale of the outbreak unfolding in Seattle, New York City, and Europe. The state has the fewest per-capita hospital beds in the US, due to adopting a model of healthcare which is optimized to avoid hospitalization. And according to modeling last Wednesday from Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), which operates the state\u2019s largest hospital along with three more in the Portland metro area, its 114 acute care beds are already maxed out. \u201cOur inpatient occupancy currently operates at 95% capacity, meaning our hospital beds are already full,\u201d the modeling document says. It predicts that the Covid-19 outbreak will demand 80 ICU beds from OHSU alone, so that it \u201cwould need to double its available ICU beds within a few weeks\u201d. As scant as facilities are in the Portland metro area, the shortages are even more pronounced in rural areas in a state whose population is scattered across a terrain broken up by mountains and forests. Oregon had recorded 191 cases and five deaths by Monday. But there have been serious constraints on testing, with only 3,649 performed since 21 January. This means that Oregon has carried out 1,161 tests per million residents, putting it behind other states, and well behind benchmarks like South Korea, and raising the prospect that the extent of the outbreak is far greater than current knowledge indicates. For a period of weeks, the only testing was being done by the state medical lab, which is limited to 80 specimens a day. The state has tapped some commercial labs for more testing, but OHSU told the Guardian in an email that they would not assist with testing until later this week at the earliest. The state has also been accused of obfuscating the situation by not publishing all available data. Meanwhile, Seattle, the west coast center of the outbreak, lies just a few hours north along one of America\u2019s busiest interstate highways. Oregon\u2019s first case was recorded in Washington county, the apparent center of the state\u2019s outbreak, and home to Nike\u2019s global headquarters, and a number of campuses of the silicon chip manufacturer Intel. That case was announced on 28 February, just two days after the CDC announced the first recorded \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d in northern California.",

Because in the last few days it\u2019s become clear Boris Johnson can\u2019t even prepare properly for a scheduled presser. Only the day before he was telling everyone to keep 2 metres away from other people when he was standing about a yard from the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer. There was a time when he could just about manage two pages of A4 as a briefing paper. Now his concentration span can\u2019t even manage that.</p> \n<p>So instead a we got a six-minute televised address to the nation. Less chance of any unforced cock-ups and mixed messages that way.

Not even an ersatz People\u2019s PMQs with spoon fed set ups from Classic \u201cLet the old and the vulnerable die\u201d Dom. Because in the last few days it\u2019s become clear Boris Johnson can\u2019t even prepare properly for a scheduled presser. Only the day before he was telling everyone to keep 2 metres away from other people when he was standing about a yard from the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer. There was a time when he could just about manage two pages of A4 as a briefing paper. Now his concentration span can\u2019t even manage that.

The total confirmed death toll rose to 335 on Monday \u2013 a sixfold increase on this time last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won\u2019t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it\u2019s vital to slow the spread of the disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, had appeared to take a much clearer stance on physical distancing than the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/22/police-could-enforce-social-distancing-rules-says-london-mayor\">telling the capital\u2019s residents</a> to stay at home. \u201cThis isn\u2019t advice, as far as I\u2019m concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, welcomed the measures. \u201cSomething did have to change. We\u2019re seeing more and more people lose their lives to this virus and the social distancing measures that the government had announced have simply not been working,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/non-key-workers-tourists-defy-physical-distancing-advice-uk\">beaches full of people</a>, parks full of people, bustling markets. So we were encouraging the PM to go further this morning: we called on him to take emergency action to enforce social distancing, and it looks like that\u2019s what he\u2019s done this evening. So we do support it, and the drastic measures he\u2019s taken tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some in policing are dubious whether they currently have the powers to enforce a lockdown. One source said police were being told they would be given the powers within days, possibly being included in the emergency laws being passed through parliament now.</p> \n<p>It is seen as anathema to the British style of policing by consent, and officers being citizens in uniform: \u201cThere is absolute reluctance,\u201d said another source. \u201cIt\u2019s a total change of policing style.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cWe are working with the government and other agencies to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NPCC quickly squashed suggestions that police would be assisted by troops on the streets or road blocks deployed to enforce the lockdown. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cNeither are being considered in any way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said: \u201cThe practicalities of policing this lockdown will be challenging \u2026 policing will do all it can to keep the public safe, but we need the public to support us. I ask that the public heed the advice and stay at home unless absolutely necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the streets safe and deal with all the regular calls we receive. This is about saving lives and supporting our NHS. I ask that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d </p> \n<p>Many Tory MPs are worried that No 10 has not moved fast enough to enforce stricter distancing measures, amid public alarm about evidence of people ignoring advice.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, had a stark message for No 10 that a lockdown rule was needed immediately if the UK was to have any chance of avoiding a situation like that in Italy, where the health service is overwhelmed and many hundreds are dying every day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-how-do-italy-and-the-uk-compare\">Coronavirus: how do Italy and the UK compare?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt may be too late to avoid Italy. But to have any chance, we need to move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It\u2019s time to stop asking people to do social distancing \u2013 we must enforce it. Not this week, not tomorrow, but today,\u201d Hunt said.</p> \n<p>As the prime minister\u2019s statement was broadcast, MPs were debating emergency legislation giving the government the powers to ban gatherings, forcibly quarantine suspected sufferers, and compel schools to remain open, for a period of two years.</p> \n<p>Ministers announced on Monday that the legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/mps-to-review-coronavirus-emergency-laws-every-six-months\">could be reviewed by MPs every six months</a> \u2013 a significant concession aimed at preventing a potential rebellion.</p> \n<p>Labour had broadly supported the legislation, but sought more regular scrutiny of its sweeping powers. MPs debating measures sat widely dispersed on the green benches of the House of Commons, with many choosing to stay away.</p> \n<p>After the compromise amendment was announced, Labour agreed to allow the legislation to pass without being forced to a vote.</p>",

We\u2019re seeing more and more people lose their lives to this virus and the social distancing measures that the government had announced have simply not been working,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see beaches full of people, parks full of people, bustling markets. So we were encouraging the PM to go further this morning: we called on him to take emergency action to enforce social distancing, and it looks like that\u2019s what he\u2019s done this evening. So we do support it, and the drastic measures he\u2019s taken tonight.\u201d Some in policing are dubious whether they currently have the powers to enforce a lockdown. One source said police were being told they would be given the powers within days, possibly being included in the emergency laws being passed through parliament now. It is seen as anathema to the British style of policing by consent, and officers being citizens in uniform: \u201cThere is absolute reluctance,\u201d said another source. \u201cIt\u2019s a total change of policing style.\u201d The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cWe are working with the government and other agencies to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced.\u201d The NPCC quickly squashed suggestions that police would be assisted by troops on the streets or road blocks deployed to enforce the lockdown. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cNeither are being considered in any way.\u201d The national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said: \u201cThe practicalities of policing this lockdown will be challenging \u2026 policing will do all it can to keep the public safe, but we need the public to support us. I ask that the public heed the advice and stay at home unless absolutely necessary. \u201cThis will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the streets safe and deal with all the regular calls we receive. This is about saving lives and supporting our NHS. I ask that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d Many Tory MPs are worried that No 10 has not moved fast enough to enforce stricter distancing measures, amid public alarm about evidence of people ignoring advice. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, had a stark message for No 10 that a lockdown rule was needed immediately if the UK was to have any chance of avoiding a situation like that in Italy, where the health service is overwhelmed and many hundreds are dying every day. \u201cIt may be too late to avoid Italy. But to have any chance, we need to move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It\u2019s time to stop asking people to do social distancing \u2013 we must enforce it. Not this week, not tomorrow, but today,\u201d Hunt said. As the prime minister\u2019s statement was broadcast, MPs were debating emergency legislation giving the government the powers to ban gatherings, forcibly quarantine suspected sufferers, and compel schools to remain open, for a period of two years. Ministers announced on Monday that the legislation could be reviewed by MPs every six months \u2013 a significant concession aimed at preventing a potential rebellion. Labour had broadly supported the legislation, but sought more regular scrutiny of its sweeping powers. MPs debating measures sat widely dispersed on the green benches of the House of Commons, with many choosing to stay away. After the compromise amendment was announced, Labour agreed to allow the legislation to pass without being forced to a vote.",

      "body": "<p>Over nearly nine days of often contradictory and emotionally charged evidence, the jurors in Alex Salmond\u2019s trial on 14 charges of sexual assault heard two conflicting accounts of the former first minister.</p> <p>One version was of an often bad-tempered boss who drove his staff hard, with poor judgment about personal space. His defence advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, told the jury of nine women and six men that Salmond was flawed but not evil; he was certainly not a man guilty of criminality or an attempt to rape.</p> <p>\u201cThis comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind,\u201d Jackson said. Many of the charges smelled, he added, of political persecution. \u201cThis is a murky, murky world we live in,\u201d he said. Salmond insisted some charges were \u201ca fabrication from start to finish\u201d.</p> <p>The prosecution portrayed Salmond as a predator, who abused his power and authority to assault younger women, often at night in the seclusion of his Bute House official residence in Edinburgh\u2019s Georgian New Town.</p> <p>\u201cThis case isn\u2019t about a plot or political conspiracy,\u201d Alex Prentice QC told them. \u201cThis is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.\u201d</p> <p>In the event, the jury \u2013 reduced on Monday from 15 to 13 after two jury members were discharged, accepted Jackson\u2019s account. In a verdict that sent shockwaves through the Scottish National party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\">they acquitted Salmond of every charge</a> on majority verdicts. He had already been acquitted of a 10th sexual assault after the prosecution withdrew the charge earlier in the trial.</p> <p>Speaking outside court on Monday, Salmond issued a thinly concealed warning to his former party and Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as first minister and party leader, that he planned to disclose more evidence in coming days and weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThere was certain evidence I would like to have seen [presented] in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren\u2019t able to do so,\u201d he told the media. \u201cAt some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s jubilant allies now believe a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s botched handling of an internal investigation into two complaints against him by civil servants will dig deeper into the role played by Sturgeon\u2019s staff and senior officials in that investigation, and the subsequent police inquiry.</p> <p>He has now been exonerated by the jury of any crimes \u2013 but the parliamentary investigation could also be significantly expanded after the trial heard how complaints from several civil servants who raised concerns about Salmond\u2019s behaviour were dealt with by their line managers and other senior officials.</p> <p>The court heard that officials in Salmond\u2019s office decided in 2013 and 2014 not to record or seek investigation of their complaints about his behaviour towards them. </p> <p>The women involved told the jury they felt humiliated and embarrassed, and feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or, one told the jury, that the matter would be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d. They opted instead to do so off the record.</p> <p>After a young junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 \u2013 a charge Salmond denied \u2013 senior civil servants in his private office decided among themselves not to allow female officials to work alone at night with him at Bute House, according to evidence.</p> <p>That complainer, known as F because his accusers cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed at Salmond\u2019s trial that he pinned her on a bed and forced his hands up her skirt. </p> <p>She said she did not report the full details of her allegations to her colleagues. Even so, the jury heard that one colleague in Salmond\u2019s office told her the next day: \u201cIt could be a crime.\u201d He told the court: \u201cIt gave me cause for concern that something serious had happened.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of an investigation, the jury heard that the officials and Salmond\u2019s most senior aide brokered an apology from Salmond. Those officials told the court they felt F wanted the issue kept low-key, so were respecting her wishes. </p> <p>Salmond told the jury that he and F had fallen on to the bed in a \u201csleepy cuddle\u201d after drinking a potent Chinese spirit while they worked.

      "bodyText": "Over nearly nine days of often contradictory and emotionally charged evidence, the jurors in Alex Salmond\u2019s trial on 14 charges of sexual assault heard two conflicting accounts of the former first minister. One version was of an often bad-tempered boss who drove his staff hard, with poor judgment about personal space. His defence advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, told the jury of nine women and six men that Salmond was flawed but not evil; he was certainly not a man guilty of criminality or an attempt to rape. \u201cThis comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind,\u201d Jackson said. Many of the charges smelled, he added, of political persecution. \u201cThis is a murky, murky world we live in,\u201d he said. Salmond insisted some charges were \u201ca fabrication from start to finish\u201d. The prosecution portrayed Salmond as a predator, who abused his power and authority to assault younger women, often at night in the seclusion of his Bute House official residence in Edinburgh\u2019s Georgian New Town. \u201cThis case isn\u2019t about a plot or political conspiracy,\u201d Alex Prentice QC told them. \u201cThis is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.\u201d In the event, the jury \u2013 reduced on Monday from 15 to 13 after two jury members were discharged, accepted Jackson\u2019s account. In a verdict that sent shockwaves through the Scottish National party, they acquitted Salmond of every charge on majority verdicts. He had already been acquitted of a 10th sexual assault after the prosecution withdrew the charge earlier in the trial. Speaking outside court on Monday, Salmond issued a thinly concealed warning to his former party and Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as first minister and party leader, that he planned to disclose more evidence in coming days and weeks. \u201cThere was certain evidence I would like to have seen [presented] in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren\u2019t able to do so,\u201d he told the media. \u201cAt some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day.\u201d Salmond\u2019s jubilant allies now believe a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s botched handling of an internal investigation into two complaints against him by civil servants will dig deeper into the role played by Sturgeon\u2019s staff and senior officials in that investigation, and the subsequent police inquiry. He has now been exonerated by the jury of any crimes \u2013 but the parliamentary investigation could also be significantly expanded after the trial heard how complaints from several civil servants who raised concerns about Salmond\u2019s behaviour were dealt with by their line managers and other senior officials. The court heard that officials in Salmond\u2019s office decided in 2013 and 2014 not to record or seek investigation of their complaints about his behaviour towards them. The women involved told the jury they felt humiliated and embarrassed, and feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or, one told the jury, that the matter would be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d. They opted instead to do so off the record. After a young junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 \u2013 a charge Salmond denied \u2013 senior civil servants in his private office decided among themselves not to allow female officials to work alone at night with him at Bute House, according to evidence. That complainer, known as F because his accusers cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed at Salmond\u2019s trial that he pinned her on a bed and forced his hands up her skirt. She said she did not report the full details of her allegations to her colleagues. Even so, the jury heard that one colleague in Salmond\u2019s office told her the next day: \u201cIt could be a crime.\u201d He told the court: \u201cIt gave me cause for concern that something serious had happened.\u201d Instead of an investigation, the jury heard that the officials and Salmond\u2019s most senior aide brokered an apology from Salmond. Those officials told the court they felt F wanted the issue kept low-key, so were respecting her wishes. Salmond told the jury that he and F had fallen on to the bed in a \u201csleepy cuddle\u201d after drinking a potent Chinese spirit while they worked. The jury acquitted him of alleged sexual assault with intent to rape. After a further allegation about an incident at Bute House four months later, the same officials told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone there with Salmond. In that case, the court was told, another male civil servant received a distressed late-night text from a younger female colleague, G. She alleged in court that Salmond cornered her in his private sitting room and tried to kiss her after pressing her to drink limoncello with him, which she refused. G said initially she felt \u201cit was never an option\u201d to report the incident internally or to the police. \u201cI felt a huge responsibility to protect his reputation. [I] thought if I got into some sort of scandal with him, it would lose the referendum,\u201d she told the jury. The court heard that a colleague persuaded G to complain informally but she remained deeply doubtful that the process would work. She told the court that she had doubts about the competence of the civil service and feared, correctly, that Salmond would sue the government. In August 2018, Salmond launched a judicial review against his former government after being told an internal civil service inquiry had upheld two sexual assault complaints against him \u2013 findings that were not ultimately allowed to stand. After quickly raising \u00a3100,000 via crowdfunding to help with his legal costs, he won that challenge in January 2019. The Scottish government repeatedly told journalists in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that no complaints of sexual misconduct or bullying had been made against Salmond until two of these complainers \u2013 the legal term in Scotland for complainants \u2013 came forward in late 2017, after the #MeToo movement pushed ministers into announcing a zero-tolerance stance on sexual misconduct. According to their testimony in court, none of the women were told their allegations could have been investigated under the Scottish government\u2019s then uniquely far-reaching \u201cfairness at work\u201d procedures, which it introduced in autumn 2010. That policy \u2013 the only one of its kind in the UK \u2013 specifically included misconduct by Scottish ministers, including first ministers. It committed the government \u201cto dealing with staff grievances fairly, consistently, quickly and no one will be penalised for raising a complaint in good faith\u201d. Appendix 1 of the document set out \u201cexamples of unacceptable behaviour\u201d, which included \u201cinappropriate physical contact, advances or propositions\u201d and \u201cinappropriate questions about someone\u2019s personal life or questions about someone\u2019s sex life\u201d. That policy was originally drawn up to handle bullying or mistreatment complaints against civil servants but civil service unions insisted it was expanded to include ministers because of alleged bullying incidents involving Salmond himself. Salmond\u2019s trial heard repeated testimony from defence and prosecution witnesses that he had a fierce temper and was notorious for being aggressive and highly critical with officials he thought were underperforming. Union sources and those with knowledge of Salmond\u2019s conduct told the Guardian of instances of Salmond swearing at staff, throwing documents at them, and reducing aides to tears. Union sources acknowledge the policy was not written with sexual misconduct specifically in mind, but said it was clear the policy covered misconduct in its broadest sense. Salmond told the jury he had signed off on the policy. It was also agreed by Nicola Sturgeon, then the deputy first minister, and Sir John Elvidge, then the permanent secretary of the Scottish government. Sturgeon agreed to be the arbiter of any complaints involving ministers, including allegations against Salmond. Despite the fairness at work policy being in place at the time, one female civil servant, complainer B, told the jury she felt unable to complain after she claimed that he tried to force her into a kiss. \u201cI think I would\u2019ve suffered in my career as a result. I never saw anybody in a senior position in the Scottish government tackle the first minister about his behaviour,\u201d she said. Salmond was found not guilty of that allegation. A senior member of Salmond\u2019s policy team at the time, Alex Bell, told the court last week he had been sent upstairs by two other colleagues to ensure she was safe because they had inadvertently left her alone with Salmond. Asked why he had gone up, Bell said: \u201cTo ensure that the welfare of my colleague was OK.\u201d Their stance mirrored the policies followed three years later by Salmond\u2019s private secretaries. It took until late 2017 before these women felt confident to report these allegations, when Sturgeon and Scotland\u2019s head civil servant, Leslie Evans, reacted to the #MeToo movement by introducing a tougher code of conduct that specifically included sexual misconduct.

The batteries should be swappable in case of a longer outage, or a patient transfer that could last two hours.</p></li> \n <li><p>Buried at the end of the government\u2019s specification document is a warning that requiring backup batteries will mean 30,000 large batteries being sourced quickly. The government admits it will \u201cneed the advice of an electronic engineer with military/resource-limited experience before specifying anything here.

Some of the instructions should also be included on the external labelling.</p></li> \n <li><p>Specifications include the ability to support a range of 10 to 30 breaths per minute, rising in increments of two, with the settings adjustable by medical professionals. They should also be able to change the ratio of the length of time for inhalations to exhalations.</p></li> \n <li><p>The document includes a minimum for the amount of oxygen the ventilator should be able to pump into a patient\u2019s lungs. Tidal volume \u2013 the amount of air someone inhales during a normal breath \u2013 is typically about six or seven millilitres per kilogram of body weight, or about 500ml for someone weighing 80kg (12 stone 8lb).

Ideally, it could move on a spectrum between 250 and 800 in increments of 50, or be set to a ml/kg setting.</p></li> \n <li><p>The average proportion of oxygen in the air is 21%.

Alongside this, we are at the centre of the UK consortium working to set up further sites to materially increase the numbers available to the NHS and to other countries impacted by this crisis.\u201d Oxfordshire-based Penlon is the designer of the other ventilator, according to the Financial Times. Penlon\u2019s product chief has previously warned that asking non-specialist manufacturers to make ventilators would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d and the company has said its own Nuffield 200 Anaesthetic Ventilator presented a \u201cquick and simple\u201d solution. In an effort that some have likened to British industry\u2019s role in making Spitfires during the second world war, manufacturers such as Airbus and Nissan are expected to lend support by offering to 3D-print parts or assemble machines themselves. HSBC said on Monday that it would offer companies working on the project fast-track loan applications, cheaper interest rates and extended repayment terms to support the unprecedented demand on UK hospitals. The DHSC had been weighing up whether manufacturers could come up with new designs, issuing specifications for a \u201cminimally acceptable\u201d rapidly manufactured ventilator system (RMVS). Its specifications included: Ventilators must be reliable and able to keep working 100% of the time for at least 14 days. They should be small and light enough to fix to a hospital bed, but robust enough to survive falling from bed to floor. The machines must be able to provide both mandatory ventilation \u2013 breathing on behalf of the patient \u2013 as well as a pressure support mode that assists those who can breathe independently to some extent. The machine should be able to sense when a patient stops breathing and switch from the assisted breathing mode to a mandatory setting. Ventilators will have to connect to hospital gas supplies and will also need at least 20 minutes of backup battery in case of mains power failure. The batteries should be swappable in case of a longer outage, or a patient transfer that could last two hours. Buried at the end of the government\u2019s specification document is a warning that requiring backup batteries will mean 30,000 large batteries being sourced quickly. The government admits it will \u201cneed the advice of an electronic engineer with military/resource-limited experience before specifying anything here. It needs to be got right first time.\u201d All of the ventilator\u2019s parts need to be detachable so they can be disinfected manually. They must also be fitted with an alarm that alerts medical staff in case of a fault or some other interruption or inadequacy of oxygen supply. Doctors must be able to monitor the ventilator\u2019s performance, for instance the oxygen percentage it is providing, via clear displays. Operating the machine must be intuitive, requiring no more than 30 minutes of training for a medical professional who already has some ventilator experience. Some of the instructions should also be included on the external labelling. Specifications include the ability to support a range of 10 to 30 breaths per minute, rising in increments of two, with the settings adjustable by medical professionals. They should also be able to change the ratio of the length of time for inhalations to exhalations. The document includes a minimum for the amount of oxygen the ventilator should be able to pump into a patient\u2019s lungs. Tidal volume \u2013 the amount of air someone inhales during a normal breath \u2013 is typically about six or seven millilitres per kilogram of body weight, or about 500ml for someone weighing 80kg (12 stone 8lb). The minimum requirement for a RMVS is a single setting of 450. Ideally, it could move on a spectrum between 250 and 800 in increments of 50, or be set to a ml/kg setting. The average proportion of oxygen in the air is 21%. The ventilator should offer 50% and 100% at the very least and ideally 30% to 100%, rising in increments of 10 percentage points. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK body that approves medical equipment for use. It will have to give the green light to any ventilators used in the Covid-19 response. Manufacturers must show their supply chain is contained within the UK, to ensure no disruption in the event that cross-border freight movements are interrupted. The supply chain must also be transparent so that the MHRA can ensure suitability of parts. Ventilators must meet certain existing standards for MHRA approval. However, the DHSC said it was considering whether these can be \u201crelaxed\u201d given the urgency of the situation.",

Johnson\u2019s comments on 1 March during a visit to Public Health England\u2019s command centre was made when just 35 infections had been confirmed in the UK. Just over three weeks later, in a televised national address, the prime minister has ordered that people can leave their homes only for the most limited purposes, including shopping for essentials, medical needs, to provide care for a vulnerable person, for work or strictly limited exercise. And he said that gathering in groups of more than two was prohibited. The newly announced restrictions follow days of controversy over whether the UK was moving too slowly to force Britons to stay at home except in exceptional circumstances as the death toll reached 335. Four other large countries with significant outbreaks of the virus have moved at a variety of paces and taken different steps to enact their own lockdowns, most \u2013 but not all \u2013 acting before reaching the UK\u2019s death toll: China Lockdown in Hubei province begins 23 January with death toll at 17 China, where the first cases of coronavirus emerged, was the first country to announce a major lockdown, in Wuhan and the other big cities in Hubei province. At the time of the announcement, the disease was confirmed to have claimed 17 lives and infected almost 600 other people, although it is not clear how accurate a picture this represents after the first cases emerged in mid-December.

By late afternoon, roads from Wuhan and other exits had been shut off. Italy Lockdown begins 9 March with death toll at 463 and 9,000 infections Italy imposed its lockdown after attempting a limited quarantine of northern towns and then a chaotic quarantine of the north only that led to thousands attempting to flee. The lockdown restricted movement of the population except for necessity, work and health circumstances. Additional restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. Two days later, the lockdown was tightened to close all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. Spain Lockdown begins 15 March with death toll at 288 and 7,753 cases After a marathon cabinet session the day before, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told Spaniards they were banned from leaving home except for work and for essential travel. Cases had exploded at the start of the month, with 30 deaths by 9 March. A state of emergency also ordered the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. People are allowed out only to work, to buy food and medicine, to travel to health centres or banks, and to look after the elderly or dependants. France Lockdown announced on evening of 16 March with death toll at 148 and with 6,633 confirmed cases France had reached China\u2019s 17 deaths around 8 March and moved to a full lockdown just over a week later. Similar to the Italian lockdown, French citizens were tightly restricted, with people expected to stay at home, leaving only for essential activities such as food shopping on pain of a fixed fine of \u20ac135. Officials later clarified that a dispensation for exercise meant walks or runs of no more than \u201c1km, 2km max\u201d and close to home. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 March 2020. An earlier version of the graph showing the number of deaths at date of lockdown had the UK figure at 355. This has been corrected to 335.",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Ballet has said it will no longer work with its star choreographer Liam Scarlett, who had been accused of sexual misconduct with students. The company said on Monday that Scarlett\u2019s position as artist-in-residence at Covent Garden had ended and, as he would no longer work with the Royal Ballet, performances of his production Symphonic Dances would not go ahead. It also said, however, that an independent investigation into his behaviour had concluded and \u201cfound there were no matters to pursue in relation to alleged contact with students of the Royal Ballet School\u201d. Scarlett, once described by the New York Times as the \u201cnew choreographic wonder boy of British ballet\u201d, was initially suspended by the Royal Ballet in August after the allegations of sexual misconduct were made. Rehearsals for a production of Oklahoma!, which Scarlett was to have choreographed, were delayed at the same time. The company said it was to do with problems with work schedules. News of the allegations emerged publicly in January. The Times reported that the employment company Linda Harvey Associates was conducting an investigation into claims he had behaved inappropriately with students. Queensland Ballet in Australia responded by suspending Scarlett as an artistic associate and cancelled productions planned for April of his show Dangerous Liaisons. The Australian company\u2019s artistic director, Li Cunxin, said this month it had not cut ties with Scarlett sooner because they were unaware the allegations against him were sexual in nature. Cunxin told the Sydney Morning Herald: \u201cIt was very vague. We really learned from second and third sources [later on]. We are as eager to learn the facts as anyone. Because his ballet is widely performed all around the world, everybody is waiting.\u201d The artistic director said Queensland Ballet had conducted its own investigation and found no evidence of improper behaviour by Scarlett in Australia. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Royal Ballet Company has a code of conduct in place to ensure staff and visiting artists are always supported. To preserve the anonymity of the individuals concerned and as a duty of care to staff and artists, we are unable to comment further on the specifics of this case.\u201d Ipswich-born Scarlett, who has not responded to the allegations, was one of the Royal Ballet\u2019s star dancers until his retirement in 2012. He was appointed as the company\u2019s first artist-in-residence the same year. His productions at the Royal Ballet included Vayamos al Diablo, Consolations and Liebestraum, Asphodel Meadows, Hansel and Gretel and Frankenstein. Representatives of Scarlett have been approached for comment.",

It has never been triggered until now. <br><br>The EU statement said that ministers remained \u201cfully committed to the respect of the stability and growth pact\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap World stock markets have suffered fresh losses, despite a fresh attempt by America\u2019s central bank to protect the US economy from the coronavirus pandemic. After another day of panicky selling, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 4% lower at 4993 points - its lowest closing point since 2011. European markets also dropped. In New York, stocks sank through the day, ending 3% lower. Wall Street (which was devoid of traders due to a lockdown) has now lost almost all its gains since Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. The selloff came despite the Federal Reserve producing its biggest bazooka yet -- pledging an unlimited programme of bond-buying with newly minted money, plus new programmes to buy corporate debt and support consumer credit. Experts said it was a dramatic new move by the Fed, who could effectively be the buyer of last resort as well as the lender of last resort. On a day in which the global death toll passed 15,000, a swathe of UK retailers are temporarily closing their doors - from bakery chain Greggs and fast foot outlet McDonalds to department store Debenhams and fashion chain Primark. The IMF added its voice to the chorus warning of economic misery ahead. The Fund predicted the Covid-19 recession could be worse than after Lehman Brothers, and could be particularly grim for emerging markets. However, US politicians are still struggling to agree a stimulus package - with Democrats demanding more support for families rather than simply a corporate bailout. Faced with the prospect of a deep recession, EU politicians have agreed to suspend their debt rules - giving member states the green light to borrow what\u2019s needed to protect their economies. The covonavirus has also forced the UK government to suspend the rail franchise system -- it is now paying rail operators to offer a limited service, following the slump in demand from commuters. The UK has also advised Britons abroad to return home, amid speculation that the government could soon announce a more stringent lockdown. Boris Johnson speaks shortly -- we\u2019ll be covering it in our main liveblog: That\u2019s all for today. Goodnight.. GW It\u2019s over! Until tomorrow. Wall Street has closed for the night, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 both down around 3%. With 40 minutes to go until the Wall Street closing bell, shares are sinking towards their earlier lows. The Dow is down over 4% again, shedding 852 to just 18,321 points. The race is on to build thousands more ventilators to help Britain\u2019s National Health Service handle the imminent spike in Covid-19 patients. My colleague Rob Davies has the details: The government has asked manufacturers including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Nissan and JCB to help produce up to 30,000 ventilators in as little as two weeks, amid concern that the 8,175 the NHS has available will not be enough to treat a surge in Covid-19 patients. As manufacturers race to heed that call, in an effort some have likened to British industry\u2019s effort to help produce Spitfires during the second world war, every effort is being made to support them, both by government and the broader business community. It\u2019s approaching 7pm GMT, which means it\u2019s long past hometime for many in the UK. But in this new era of remote working, many workers are already at home....and possibly chained to their laptop still, as Bloomberg\u2019s Lucy Meakin points out: Our economics editor Larry Elliott fears the US Federal Reserve is running out of ammunition to fight the looming coronavirus recession, following today\u2019s emergency measures. He writes: These are troubling times for the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank is trying everything it knows to pull the financial markets out of their tailspin but nothing seems to work. Before Wall Street opened the Fed announced that its new plan was to provide infinite amounts of money through its quantitative easing programme. The response of traders was to shrug and carry on selling. In truth, though, this was little more than a massive holding operation. The Fed was buying time so that two things can happen: Donald Trump manages to get a fiscal rescue package through Congress and there are definitive signs of a slowdown in the incidence of new Covid-19 cases. It didn\u2019t really help the prospects of a market rally on the back of the Fed\u2019s announcement that Wall Street and the rest of New York\u2019s financial district were locked down along with the rest of the city, but in the end the central bank had little choice. Worryingly, hopes of a coordinated international response to Covid-19 are being undermined by tensions between Washington and Beijing. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour explains: G20 finance ministers have held telephone talks but were not expected to issue a joint declaration, as divisions persist primarily between the US and China over responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic. The G7 group of mainly western leaders did manage a joint communique after a similar teleconference last week, but it was remarkable for making no reference to China, the world\u2019s second largest economy. A full G20 world leaders teleconference is due later this week, but whether a consensus can be reached on a global fiscal stimulus is not clear. Finance ministers insisted Monday\u2019s virtual G20 meeting had been worthwhile.France\u2019s Bruno Le Maire tweeted had discussed the pandemic\u2019s \u201cviolent impact on the global economy, financial support for developing countries, and preparations for a common exit strategy from the crisis\u201d. Hopes of a coordinated international response are hampered, however, by a diplomatic and propaganda standoff between China and the US focused on claiming moral authority once the virus is brought under control. The two countries have been trading insults for the past two weeks over responsibility for the pandemic. They are also competing to show that they are able not only to bring it under control, but also to emerge stronger economically afterwards. The UK City watchdog, the FCA, has issued a statement tonight saying it has no plans to close the markets or ban short-selling.... Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, is making another attempt to prop up the markets: But...Kudlow has also conceded that the US was wrong to say it had \u2018contained\u2019 Covid-19 recently, so treat today\u2019s pronouncements accordingly.... The IMF\u2019s warning of a deep recession this year hasn\u2019t helped the mood in the market. With two hours to go on Wall Street, the Dow is down 3% or over 600 points: UK engineering firm Dyson says it is trying to help address the chronic shortage of ventilators, needed for Covid-19 patients. The firm (known for its vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and hand dryers) explains: \u201cDyson has responded to the Government\u2019s request for support with its Covid19 response, by focusing resources into the design and manufacture of a ventilator for the NHS. This is a highly complex project being undertaken in an extremely challenging timeframe. We have deployed expertise in air movement, motors, power systems, manufacturing and supply chain and are working with medical technology and development company, TTP \u2013 The Technology Partnership, based in Cambridge. Together we have been working around the clock and through the past two weekends to develop a meaningful and timely response. We are conducting a full, regulated medical device development, including testing in the laboratory and in humans, and we scaling up for volume.\u201d IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has now tweeted her message to the G20: Newsflash: The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that the coronavirus could cause a deeper downturn than the last financial crisis. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva issued this warning, following a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors today (reminder: we\u2019re expecting another call tomorrow) Georgieva says she made three points on the call: 1) First, the outlook for global growth: for 2020 it is negative\u2014 \u201ca recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.\u201d The IMF expects a recovery in 2021 -- but for that to happen, countries must prioritize containment and strengthen health systems\u2014everywhere. The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be. 2) Emerging market economies are in a worse position to ride out the crisis. They are badly affected by outward capital flows, and domestic activity will be severely impacted as countries respond to the epidemic. Investors have already removed $83bn from emerging markets since the beginning of the crisis, the largest capital outflow ever recorded. We are particularly concerned about low-income countries in debt distress\u2014an issue on which we are working closely with the World Bank. 3) The IMF wants to help, and has $1trn of lending standing by. We will massively step up emergency finance\u2014nearly 80 countries are requesting our help\u2014and we are working closely with the other international financial institutions to provide a strong coordinated response. European finance ministers have taken the unprecedented decision to suspend limits on government borrowing, in response to the economic shock of coronavirus. Meeting via telephone conference, the EU\u2019s 27 finance ministers rubber-stamped a proposal from the EU executive to trigger the \u201cgeneral escape clause\u201d that means a suspension of borrowing limits because of a severe economic downturn. In a statement, the group said: Ministers of finance of the member states of the EU agree with the assessment of the commission, as set out in its communication of 20 March 2020, that the conditions for the use of the general escape clause of the EU fiscal framework \u2013 a severe economic downturn in the euro area or the union as a whole \u2013 are fulfilled. Although widely expected, it is a historic decision for the EU, which in normal economic times requires budget deficits to be no more than 3% of GDP and national debt not to surpass 60% of GDP. The general escape clause was created in 2011, as the EU sought to learn lessons from the financial crisis. It has never been triggered until now. The EU statement said that ministers remained \u201cfully committed to the respect of the stability and growth pact\u201d. But now the taboo has been broken, it is unclear how quickly the EU can return to its fiscal rules. Eurozone watchers also predict that triggering the escape clause mean more ambitious measures could be off the table, such as \u201ccoronabonds\u201d - common eurozone debt to help the most distressed member states finance health spending and repair their battered economies. Meanwhile in the US, Boeing is shutting down production at its factories in the Seattle area for two weeks. CNBC explains: The company\u2019s move to suspend its production at its facilities in the Puget Sound area comes as Washington State, where most of Boeing\u2019s production is centered, is in a state of emergency. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has hit its lowest closing level since 2011. The FTSE 100 has ended the day down 196 points, or 3.79%, at 4993.89 points. That\u2019s its lowest close since October 2011 (although it was lower during \u2018intraday\u2019 trading last week). Investment platforms led the selloff, with Hargreaves Lansdown losing 17% and St James\u2019s Place off 12% (the recent market mayhem hasn\u2019t been good for their businesses). Other European markets also closed lower, on fears of a deep global recession and disappointment that US politicians haven\u2019t agreed a stimulus package. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 2.1%, and France\u2019s CAC closed 3.3% lower. Investors have shrugged at the latest attempt by the US Federal Reserve to prop up the US economy. Even the Fed\u2019s pledge of unlimited money printing, through an open-ended quantitative easing programme, and the purchase of corporate debts couldn\u2019t dispel the gloom in the markets. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the problem: The coronavirus continues to hang over equity markets. A medial report said the number of infections has increased to 350,000 worldwide, and the fear factor is setting in for traders, which is why they are dumping equities. As far as the west is concerned, the situation is getting worse by the day, in addition to that, there is a perception things will get even worse within the next few weeks. The Fed\u2019s announcement about a quantitative easing programme that could run on for the foreseeable future jolted European equity benchmarks higher, but the optimism was short lived, and the markets moved south again. The absence of a fiscal stimulus package from the US government is playing a role in the sell-off too. Banking news.... High street chain Next are also joining the shutdown: Even Greggs, the much-loved supplier of steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls to the British public, cannot resist the grip of the coronavirus. The bakery chain has just told the City that it plans to close stores by end of play tomorrow, Greggs is a great business that employs over 25,000 people, and prides itself on the way that it deals with the many stakeholders we rely on in order to make good freshly prepared food available across the UK. However, given the current and likely impacts of coronavirus we are now planning for the closure of our shop estate by close of business on Tuesday 24 March in order to protect our people and customers. Greggs says that it will not pay its 2019 dividend, will no longer hit its profits targets, and is cutting \u00a345m from its capital expenditure plan. Unsold food will be distributed to the local communities. Greggs also plans to keep employing staff on their full contract hours \u201cfor as long as is practicable\u201d, with support from the Government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (which pays 80% of salaries). It is applying to the Bank of England\u2019s new Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) scheme for help covering its finances too. Reuters is reporting that G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs will hold a conference call tomorrow, to discuss their coronavirus response efforts and the economic impact from the pandemic. They say: The call, to be led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, will likely result in a statement from the G7 finance officials, who remain in close touch and are coordinating their efforts, a source told Reuters on Monday. The scheduling of the call comes as countries are rolling out unprecedented economic stimulus and financial backstop efforts to try to keep businesses from collapsing amid a halt to economic activity to slow the spread of the virus. Donald Trump will not like this, not one little bit. Wall Street has now sunk back to its levels when the president dramatically beat Hillary Clinton in the race to the White House in November 2016. On the day America went to the polls, the Dow Jones industrial average opened at 18,251, and closed at 18,332 (with most pundits predicting a Democratic win). Thanks to Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation push, the Dow hit a series of record highs - reaching 29,568 barely six weeks ago. Right now, the Dow is down 940 points today (the sell-off is gathering pace), or 4.9%, taking the index down to just 18,233 points. The S&amp;P 500 has also fallen back to its lowest levels since the presidential race was run, UK bankers will start restricting the number of customers in branches to try safeguard staff as they deal with a surge in demand for emergency loans during the Covid-19 outbreak. It\u2019s part of efforts to abide by social distancing rules and could result in lengthy queues outside branches reminiscent of the 2008 crash. But this time it signals much different circumstances for Britain\u2019s lenders which are now at the frontline of government\u2019s financial rescue plans (rather than the recipients of it). Banks are being asked to distribute cheap loans to businesses and mortgage holidays to households impacted by the disease. We\u2019ve confirmed that Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, TSB and Virgin Money UK (covering Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank branches) are among the banks taking extra precautions. Here\u2019s an example of posters being used in some of Lloyds\u2019 Halifax branches, explaining that customers will be asked to keep their distance and do the same if they\u2019re queuing outside: Oh dear. Wall Street is extending its losses, as the Fed\u2019s latest emergency move fails to calm the mood. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 3.7%, or 713 points, at 18,460 (remember, it was close to 30,000 points before the coronavirus pandemic struck). Not unsurprisingly, morale among Europeans has plummeted this month. The EC\u2019s monthly gauge of consumer confidence across the eurozone has slumped to -11.6 this month, down from -6.6 in February. That\u2019s the lowest reading in over five years. But the true picture may be even worse -- data collection had to be halted early due to the coronavirus outbreak, so probably doesn\u2019t capture the full panic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is trying to cheer the markets. Mnuchin insists that Democrats and Republicans are \u201cvery close\u201d to agreeing on a major congressional stimulus package to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus, despite the Senate\u2019s failure to approve legislation last night. Mnuchin told CNBC: \u201cI think we\u2019re very close. We need to get this deal done today.\u201d But investors seem unconvinced. The selloff is accelerating in New York (where the Dow is now down 500 points), dragging Europe lower too. With 90 minutes trading to go, the FTSE 100 is back below 5,000 points - a loss of over 4% today. A letter signed by 32 alcohol businesses has been sent to the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, backing a call from the Wine and Spirits Trade Association for a six-month suspension of excise duty to help the hard-pressed drinks business. If government agrees, its actions will save UK wine and spirit businesses an estimated \u00a35.8bn, the WSTA says. WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: \u201cOn Wednesday many of these companies will have to shell out millions of pounds to the Government at a time when they have no income and many of them are unable to pay their staff wages. \u201cThe Government has pledged \u2018to do whatever it takes\u2019 to help businesses, so now is the time to honour this promise. \u201cIt is within the Government\u2019s power to give our great British pubs, bars, restaurants, their suppliers and alcohol retailers an immediate injection of cash that will save many from going under.\u201d Nordea Markets have analysed the Federal Reserve\u2019s move, and concluded that America\u2019s central bank has just fired its \u201cbiggest bazooka\u201d yet: They write: The Fed is basically now the direct lender of last resort to not only the financial system, but also the real economy. In other words, this as an attempt to assure that businesses can continue to exist while this (hopefully only) temporary collapse in the economy takes place. We, however, still expect US GDP growth to decline by a double digit number in Q2 (q/q annualised) \u2013 much worse than what we saw during the Global Financial Crisis. The above measures are an unprecedented attempt to ease financial condition. The open-ended QE will now consist of, for instance, purchases of bond ETF\u2019s as well as primary and secondary market corporate bonds. Credit risk is therefore being transferred from the private sector to the Fed, which may lead to moral hazard issues in the future, but at the moment the Fed likely feels like it has no other choice (and admittedly the $300 bn in new financing are not that significant in the bigger picture). BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investor, has pledged to donate $50m (\u00a343m) to help people struggling with financial difficulties due to the global spread of the coronavirus. The US fund manager says it has already made the first $18m (\u00a315.6m) tranche of funding available to community organisations such as food banks in the United States and Europe, so that it can immediately provide support to the most vulnerable in society. It has provided $2m (\u00a31.7m) to the UK\u2019s National Emergencies Trust, and $1.25m (\u00a31.1m) to provide medical supplies for healthcare workers across Europe. BlackRock says it has given financial support in Asia since January, as the virus first took hold in China, through the Give2Asia non-profitable organisation. Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, says the firm believes it has a \u201cresponsibility to support those least able to cope and bounce back, and who will feel its impact hardest.\u201d Fink explained: \u201cWe\u2019re committing $50 million to the immediate relief of those who are most affected right now, and to help address the financial hardship and social dislocation that this pandemic brings in its wake, as families grapple with job disruptions, school closures, and unexpected childcare and medical costs,\u201d. The asset manager has temporarily suspended hiring any new staff globally, as it helps its existing workforce to adapt to different ways of working, including asking some to work from home. All BlackRock workers are working from home across EMEA and Americas, apart from a small number of people who have been designated \u201cessential in office\u201d and who are working in split teams from two locations in each city. In addition, the company has committed to continuing to pay support workers who provide services such as catering and maintenance at its offices, even if they are unable to work. HSBC said it will give extra relief to any company making or supplying ventilators during the outbreak. The London-headquartered bank said it will fast track loan applications, offer cheaper interest rates and extended repayment terms to support the \u201cunprecedented demand on UK hospitals.\u201d Amanda Murphy, head of commercial banking at HSBC UK said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting UK businesses through these challenging times, and will continue to launch new measures to alleviate some of the pressures that our customers are facing.\u201d Shares in video conferencing service Zoom have, well, zoomed higher this morning - jumping almost 20%. Demand for Zoom\u2019s services is rocketing as more companies suddenly find their office-based teams are now working remotely. Back in the UK, Sainsbury\u2019s is handing its supermarkets and Argos hourly paid staff a one-off 10% bonus payment. Those working in stores, logistics and contact centres across both Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos between 9th March and 5th April will all receive the 10% increase in hourly pay. Sainsbury\u2019s said the payment was in recognition of \u201cgoing above and beyond to serve customers during this challenging time.\u201d I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t have any photos of anxious Wall Street traders today. The entire city is in lockdown, as authorities try to slow the coronavirus spread. And that means our usual cast of characters, who can sum up the markets with a smile, a frown or their head in their hands, are banished from the NYSE trading floors. Everything is being done remotely. The opening bell was still rung as usual - but it echoed rather mournfully across the floor of the Exchange: The last month has been pretty horrendous for the markets, but could there be rather worse ahead? The Financial Times is reporting that one investor is warning of a \u201cfull-on\u201d crisis, as the coronavirus deals a massive shock to company revenues, one that\u2019s far worse than previously contemplated.... FT markets editor Robin Wigglesworth writes: Investors underestimate how an \u201cunprecedented revenue destruction\u201d caused by coronavirus will damage even the biggest, highly rated companies, culminating in a \u201cfull-on credit and liquidity crisis\u201d, according to the head of an US investment group. Alan Waxman, the head of Sixth Street Partners, the $34bn-in-assets credit arm of private equity giant TPG, sent a bleak letter late last week to investors arguing that despite the recent turmoil, markets were still complacent over the effects of the viral outbreak. \u201cWhile this is a public health crisis first, there is a real and looming potential for it to spill over into a full-on credit and liquidity crisis,\u201d Mr Waxman wrote in the letter, which was seen by the Financial Times. \u201cThere is a growing risk that the Covid-19 crisis may lead to a more systemic event catalysing a widespread downward spiral.\u201d Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on the US central bank\u2019s latest bazooka: The US Federal Reserve has launched an aggressive plan to buy as much government-backed debt as it needs to keep financial markets functioning as plans for a $1.8tn plus bailout of business and consumers stalled in Congress. The central bank announced a series of programs on Monday aimed at supporting large and small businesses already reeling from the economic blow of coronavirus. \u201cAggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,\u201d the central bank said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses\u201d. As part of the effort the central bank will relaunch a massive bond-buying program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or Talf, last used in response to the 2008 financial crisis, to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses. The Fed has previously announced it would purchase at least $500bn of Treasury securities and at least $200bn of mortgage-backed securities but will now buy bonds in \u201cthe amounts needed to support smooth market functioning\u201d..... Full story here. Wall Street\u2019s reluctance to rally is rather worrying.... So much for the rally! The New York stock market has opened lower... despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest extraordinary moves to prop up the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 352 points, or 1.8% at the start of trading, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2% to its lowest since January 2017 - the month Donald Trump was sworn in as US president. OK, that\u2019s better than the 5% tumble expected when I woke up - but still a weak start, given the Fed just pledged to pump as much money into the system as needed. Clearly monetary policy isn\u2019t the solution to this crisis..... Another closure! This time it\u2019s books and toys chain The Works, which will close all stores on Monday night. The company said sales rose 2.9% between 16 January, its last update, and 15 March across both stores and online. Sales were particularly strong last week, as ....customers demanded products to support with their child\u2019s ongoing education, mindfulness material to support mental health or products to \u201cbeat the boredom\u201d during this period of social distancing. But despite that, The Works says its \u201ckey priority\u201d is the health and wellbeing of its colleagues, customers and wider communities\u201d The Works said it was suspending non essential capital spending, including on new stores, and did not expect to pay a final dividend. There are also reports today that the UK government could force all non-essential shops to close.....in an escalation of measures to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Back in the UK, another takeaway chain is closing due to the coronavirus: Subway has authorised all franchisees to temporarily close all their stores in the UK and Ireland, from 5pm GMT today. Once again, central banks are stepping in to fill the void left by politicians, says Seema Shah, chief strategist, Principal Global Investors. Here\u2019s her take on the Fed\u2019s latest announcement of emergency help for the US economy: \u201cThe Fed\u2019s announcement that it will purchase an unlimited amount of bonds is undoubtedly significant, over-taking the GFC quantitative easing measures in one fell swoop. In addition, its programs to directly provide aid to employers and households, as well as plans targeted at supporting small and medium sized businesses, will help fill in the sinkhole left by Congress\u2019 failure to pass a much-needed fiscal stimulus bill. This seems to follow the recent pattern of many banks proactively acting to mute the negative impact of the shock, while fiscal authorities drag their feet. But ultimately, we need to see government action - and progress against Covid-19. Shah explains: Given some businesses\u2019 understandable reluctance to take on more debt during this tough economic time, the US economy still requires the US government to provide economic support in a way that doesn\u2019t involve additional borrowing. \u201cFurthermore, while central bank and fiscal action is absolutely crucial, the key requirement to stop the market rout is investors believing the virus is behind us. Until that happens, central bank and fiscal action will quickly become out-dated, requiring policymakers to repeatedly re-visit and multiply their stimulus plans.\u201d The Fed\u2019s bazooka has inspired a big turnaround at the New York stock exchange. Having been \u2018limit down\u2019 (down 5%) overnight, Wall Street is on track to rally when trading begins (up over 2% right now) This latest pledge of central bank support is cheering investors. BUT...they also desperately want to see politicians agree a stimulus package. As Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, puts it: US futures are bouncing back strongly after the Fed went all in on Monday, announcing unlimited, open-ended QE among numerous other measures to support the economy and markets. We\u2019ve gone from limit-down into the green and could soon be limit-up, all before the opening bell on Wall Street. Safe to say, the chaos of the last few weeks is going nowhere and the way this week has started, it could feasibly be the most remarkable week of the lot. There\u2019s no doubting that the Fed is doing everything within its power to see the economy through this period of unbelievable turmoil. The coronavirus has wreaked havoc global and ground the economy to a halt forcing drastic action from the fiscal and monetary authorities. It\u2019s time for Congress to get its act together as well. \u201cAbsolutely massive\u201d. \u201cShock and awe\u201d. \u201cA whatever it takes moment.\u201d That\u2019s how the Fed\u2019s promise of unlimited QE, and fresh support for the corporate bonds and consumer credit, is being interpreted. The Federal Reserve has stunned the markets by pledging to inject as much money into the economy as needed, and to prop up the credit market too. It\u2019s a massive moment, says AXA\u2019s chief economist Gilles Moec. Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American, says the Fed is giving everything it\u2019s got: But economist professor Nouriel Roubini points out that the Fed is promising to buy some risky debt here -- including shabbier investment-grade bonds that are close to junk status. But if the Fed\u2019s plan succeeds in propping up the US economy....fewer of these companiis will slump to junk status.... European stock markets are rallying too - with the German DAX up 1.5% and France\u2019s CAC gaining 1%. Traders are relieved to see the US Federal Reserve throwing the kitchen sink at the coronavirus crisis, with its major new pledge to buy unlimited bonds and to backstop hundreds of billions of credit to support the economy: The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest emergency action has cheered the markets. The FTSE 100 index has recovered almost two-thirds of its losses - now down only 80 points, or 1.5%, to 5110 points. Financial stocks are getting a boost, with Prudential up 7.6% and Royal Bank of Scotland up 2.2% The pound is recovering some of its earlier losses against the US dollar (but still down 0.5% today). The Fed says its new Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) will allow companies access to credit so that they are \u201cbetter able to maintain business operations and capacity\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. This facility is open to investment grade companies and will provide bridge financing of four years. It will be backed up by the new Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), which will buy up corporate bonds issued by investment grade U.S. companies and suitable U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds. That should keep corporate borrowing costs down, and reduce the danger that a US company defaults on a bond because it cannot roll it over in the current crisis. In another remarkable move, the Federal Reserve says it will soon announce \u201ca Main Street Business Lending Program\u201d. This scheme will support lending to eligible small-and-medium sized businesses -- another attempt to prevent the economy freezing up. NEWSFLASH: The US Federal Reserve is announcing a new wave of monetary policy measures to support the US economy. In a statement, the Fed says: The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world. Our nation\u2019s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate. The new plan includes a commitment to buy as many US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities as needed, to support the economy and financial system. Just over a week ago, the Fed announced it would conduct $700bn of bond purchases (known as quantitative easing) -- this new policy looked like Unlimited QE!. As the Fed puts it: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy The Fed is also announcing new measures to get $300bn of credit flowing to employers, consumers, and businesses. The plan will address large employers, and also the consumer credit market, as America\u2019s central bank deploys yet another bazooka as a deep recession approaches. The Fed says its new plan includes: Establishment of two facilities to support credit to large employers \u2013 the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) for new bond and loan issuance and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. Establishment of a third facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses. The TALF will enable the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and certain other assets. More to follow.... France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has just tweeted that G20 finance ministers have agreed to prepare a common strategy to overcome the coronavirus crisis, on a conference call today. Le Maire (who has been pushing hard for such action), added that the coronavirus pandemic is now causing a \u201cviolent economic impact\u201d on world growth. Global oil markets tumbled again on Monday morning as travel and industrial activity continued to contract in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The oil markets were unable to hang on to the tentative price gains late last week when a string of government interventions designed to soften the economic blow of Covid-19 buoyed prices to just over $30 a barrel. The price of Brent crude tumbled almost 6% on Monday morning to less than $25.50 a barrel as investors fear that the oversupply of oil in the market may soon outstrip demand and overwhelm oil storage facilities. \u201cWe believe that prices will continue the slump,\u201d said Rystad Energy. \u201cWe estimate that supply will surpass demand by more than 10 million barrels next quarter and storage infrastructure will be insufficient to support the current production level.\u201d Oil markets have recorded four straight weeks of losses and prices have fallen by more than 60% since the start of the year. The price of other raw materials, such as coal and copper, have also been hit by the coronavirus crisis. The latest UK retail footfall figures, just released, show precisely why so many retailers are closing their doors. The number of people visiting the high street slumped by 31% last week (Sunday 15th to Saturday 21st Match), and was 41% down on last year, new figures from Springboard show. Shopping centre visits were down 20% week-on-week, and 25% annually, as more shoppers heeded official advice to stay at home. Across all shops, footfall was down 21.7% week-on-week and 28% year-on-year. London was hardest hit, with footfall down 31.1% annually -- rising to a 63.3% slump in the centre of the capital compared to a year before. Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, says such annual declines simply haven\u2019t been since the survey started (in 2002). \u201cThe decline in footfall week on week was on par with the drop normally only ever seen in the week post-Christmas. The annual change represented an unprecedented decline in retail footfall that was three times greater than the worst result we have ever previously recorded.\u201d Retail park visits were only down 2.9%, though - presumably supported by stockpiling missions to supermarkets..... Diageo, the manufacturer of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, has pledged to provide alcohol to help make more than eight million bottles of hand sanitiser to help protect frontline healthcare workers across the world. In the ongoing fight against COVID-19, it is donating up to two million litres of alcohol to hand sanitiser producers who are currently struggling to make enough. The world\u2019s leading distiller will provide Grain Neutral Spirit (GNS) \u2013 a 96% strength ethyl alcohol used primarily in the production of vodka and gin \u2013 and make it available at no cost to manufacturers. The donation will enable the production of more than eight million 250ml bottles of hand sanitiser. The company\u2019s products are on sale in 180 countries in the world. In the UK and Ireland, 500,000 litres of GNS will be made for use by staff and patients in hospitals and GP surgeries etc. \u201cHealthcare workers are at the forefront of fighting this pandemic and we are determined to do what we can to help protect them\u201d said Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo. \u201cThis is the quickest and most effective way for us to meet the surging demand for hand sanitiser around the world.\u201d In a worrying (but not surprising) development, the cost of insuring junk bonds issued by European companies has hit an eight-year high. That means this debt is as risky as during the eurozone debt crisis in the summer of 2012, as firms struggle to cope with a slump in demand, or supply, (or both!) due to the coronavirus. Reuters has the details: The cost of insuring against European junk bond defaults jumped over 50 bps to a new eight-year high on Monday, as a rising tide of national lockdowns threatened to overwhelm policymakers\u2019 frantic efforts to cushion what is likely to be a deep global recession. Markit\u2019s iTraxx Crossover, an index of credit default swaps (CDS) for European junk-rated companies, rose to 725 basis points, its highest level since June 2012. Another sad, but inevitable, blow: Department chain Debenhams has bowed to the inevitable - shutting its network of UK and Ireland stores from tonight. Here\u2019s our news story on the historic suspension of Britain\u2019s railway franchise system, which takes the railways (or at least the cost of running them!) back into public hands for the first time since the 1990s: Back in the markets, the FTSE 100 index just nudged its nose over the 5000-point mark. And we have a few stocks in the risers list! Royal Dutch Shell are up 2%, after it announced a huge cost-cutting plan this morning. Supermarket chains J Sainsbury (+1.6%) and Morrisons (+0.9%) are defying the sell-off too, as Britons continue to stock up on essentials. But even at 5,001 points, the FTSE is still down 188 points or 3.75% today. A bad start to the week, which could get worse if US politicians can\u2019t agree a coronavirus stimulus package soon. NEWSFLASH: UK retailer Card Factory has announced it will \u201cclose temporarily all of our shops from the end of business today\u201d. An understandable move, given the slump in high street trading and the pressure to self-isolate. BUT at 7am today, Card Factory told the City that it planned to \u201c begin selectively closing stores shortly on a temporary basis.\u201d That\u2019s now turned into a blanket closure, before elevenses. Clearly things are moving fast in retail... The pound is weakening this morning, as investors dash into the safety of the US dollar and the euro again. Sterling has lost three-quarters of a cent to $1.156, back towards the 35-year low of $1.14 set last Friday. It was worth $1.30 a month ago (meaning UK investors who held cash rather than shares have also suffered from the coronavirus). Against the euro, the pound is down 0.6% at \u20ac1.083 (still above last week\u2019s 11-year low of around \u20ac1.053 Just in: 70 Laura Ashley stores are closing permanently today, putting 721 jobs at risk, as the company appoints administrators. The struggling fashion and homeware group announced last week that it was falling into administration, following a slump in sales due to the coronavirus. PwC are being appointed today, and will to find a buyer. Laura Ashley says that 77 stores will keep trading (despite the move towards self-isolation....), and it will continue to sell items online. Katharine Poulter, CEO argues that the company can still have a future: \u201cI remain unwavering in my belief that Laura Ashley can and should retain the place it deserves in the international retail landscape. Unfortunately, we will lose some brilliant people through no fault of their own. However, I remain hopeful there is a buyer out there who shares my vision and can see the enormous potential of this iconic A petition calling on the UK government to provide more support for self-employed workers has attracted 55,000 signatures already. It warns that last Friday\u2019s package (which allows the self-employed to claim universal credit as sick pay) is inadequate - and much less generous than the pledge to pay 80% of furloughed employees wages (up to \u00a32,500 per months). The petition says: Universal Credit takes five weeks and is nowhere near enough to support us. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for emergency legislation to: 1) Provide a minimum wage for freelancers and the self-employed. 2) Suspend tax payments for the self-employed and freelancers The UK-focused FTSE 250 share index is having another grim morning, down 4.5% after nearly two hours of trading. Financial services group Virgin Money are leading the rout, down 27% despite Richard Branson\u2019s \u00a3215m pledge of support for his empire. Serviced offices and business lounge provider IWG has slumped by 18%, after deciding it won\u2019t pay a final dividend for 2019, and is suspending its \u00a3100m share buyback plan. The cinema industry is suffering too - with Cineworld down 15% and Rank down 18% , having shut their doors to film fans last week. But Go-Ahead group are up 13%, leading the risers, after the government suspended the rail franchise system. Go-Ahead runs the Govia Thameslink and Southeastern franchises - both hit by a slump in demand in recent weeks. The UK government has stated clearly that its new \u201cEmergency Measures Agreements\u201d transferring revenue and cost risk to the government (or the taxpayer, to be precise!). City traders are concluding that it\u2019s a WIN for the rail operators (even though the franchise model is meant to leave THEM with the risk....) Here\u2019s our round-up of this morning\u2019s flurry of Covid-19 profit warnings and dividend cancellations: Billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson has warned that Covid-19 is \u201cthe most significant crisis the world has experienced in my lifetime\u201d, as he outlined plans to inject $250m (\u00a3215m) into his Virgin empire. In a blog post published overnight, Branson said the coronavirus has hurt his businesses (which employ 70,000 people) badly: Because many of our businesses are in industries like travel, leisure and wellness, they are in a massive battle to survive and save jobs. Our airlines have had to ground almost all their planes; our cruise line has had to postpone its launch; our health clubs and hotels have had to close their doors and all bookings to our holiday company have stopped. Branson, incidentally, was born in 1950 - so he\u2019s putting Covid-19 above 9/11, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the 1970s oil shock, Lehman Brothers and the eurozone crisis. And while Branson is committing \u201ca quarter of billion dollars over the next weeks and months\u201d to protect Viurgin companies and save jobs, he\u2019s looking for government support too: The chances of securing widespread economic recovery will depend critically upon governments around the world successfully mobilising various newly announced support programmes, which in these unique circumstances will be essential to protect people\u2019s livelihoods. Virgin Atlantic staff are already taking a heavy hit -- agreeing to take eight week\u2019s unpaid leave. And while \u00a3215m shouldn\u2019t be sniffed at, Branson\u2019s wealth was estimated at \u00a34.5bn last year (but will presumably have gone down since the Covid-19 economic turmoil began) Fast food chain McDonalds is shutting all its UK and Republic of Ireland restaurants by 7pm tonight. It has concluded that busy takeaway and Drive Thru restaurants aren\u2019t really compatible with social distancing measures: Associated British Foods told the City this morning that all its UK Primark stores are now temporarily closed - following a similar move in Europe last week. It will cost \u00a3650m of sales per month, and means Primark has stopped buying new stock itself....although the company hopes that government support will cushion the financial impact. ABF says: As at 16 March 2020, Primark stores representing 20 percent of selling space and 30 percent of sales were closed. Since then, and following the closure on Sunday of all stores in the UK which represented 41 percent of sales, all 376 stores in 12 countries are now closed until further notice. This represents a loss of some \u00a3650m of net sales per month. A variety of work streams have been established to mitigate the effect of the contribution lost from these sales and all expenditure is being reviewed. In the first instance we have implemented a significant reduction in discretionary spend. We are making good progress in also reducing fixed costs following discussions with counterparties, in particular landlords, and welcome the recently announced government support in the countries in which our stores operate. As a result, we currently estimate being able to recover some 50 percent of total operating costs. To manage Primark stock we have also regrettably informed suppliers that we will stop placing new orders. In what would normally be a HUGE story, Britain is suspending its rail franchise system. The Department for Transport has announced that the franchise agreements to run trains across the UK will be suspended for six months, in response to the slump in demand due to the coronavirus. Instead of taking revenue from rail operators, the DfT will now pay train companies a small fee to keep operating some services (which are being severely cut back, due to weaker demand). The rail franchising system was already looking troubled -- with the East Coast line taken back into public control in 2018, and Northern rail shunted into government hands month. But it\u2019s still Quite A Moment -- ending a system created when the network was privatised back in the 1990s. European stock markets are all deep in the red this morning, amid disappointment that the US Senate couldn\u2019t make progress on Covid-19 stimulus package overnight. Germany\u2019s DAX is down over 4.5%, matching the UK\u2019s losses, with France losing 4.1% and Italy down another 3.6%. As Connor Campbell of SpreadEx puts it: Europe\u2019s meagre rebound managed at the end of last week was quickly wiped out come Monday morning, as investors woke up to partisan deadlock over the proposed US stimulus plan. Arguing, in the words of Chuck Schumer, that the $1.8 trillion package is a \u2018large corporate bailout with no protections for workers and virtually no oversight\u2019, the Democrats blocked the bill on Sunday night, with a 47-47 split leaving it short of the required 60 votes. Even if the reasons behind the Democrats\u2019 intransigence are sound, America\u2019s inability to move things forwards stands in contrast to many of its now free-spending peers, and has sent the market into another tailspin. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has slumped by over 4.5% at the start of trading, wiping out its fragile recovery late last week. The Footsie has tumbled by 245 points, back to 4944 -- with every share down. Plumbing and heating provider Ferguson are the top faller, down 20%, followed by online estate agent Rightmove (down 11%). Pearson are down 10% after its profits warning this morning (see earlier post) UK transport companies are also reeling from the coronavirus. Stagecoach, which operates bus, coach and tram services in the UK, has issued a profits warning and predicted it won\u2019t pay a dividend this year: Having been on course to deliver our expected adjusted earnings per share for the year ending 2 May 2020, the quickly developing COVID-19 situation means we no longer expect to achieve our previous expectation. With bus passenger numbers now down 40%, Stagecoach is now freezing non-essential staff recruitment, and its board members are taking a pay cut too: Our Directors are sacrificing 50% of their salaries / fees for a period of time, will not receive any bonuses for 2019/20 and will not receive any pay increase for 2020/21; Pay negotiations and decisions in respect of other staff will reflect the challenging environment we currently face. Rival operator Go-Ahead has told shareholders it won\u2019t be paying its final dividend for 2019 -- having also been hit by a slump in passengers as workers stay at home. Go Ahead says: In regional bus, significantly reduced services have been introduced in response to declines in passenger numbers, with reductions in the cost base being made where possible. Discussions with Government and local authority continue regarding financial and contractual support. But.... Go Ahead also flags up that the government is suspending the rail franchise system.... Publishing firm Pearson is suspending its share buyback programme too, to preserve cash. Its exams testing operations have been badly hit by school closures across the world, including the US (which has already cost \u00a315m), and the cancellations of exams in the UK this summer. But it also says demand for its online educational products has jumped this month, including: ...A significant uplift in the use of our digital products and services, as we enable our existing courseware and assessment customers to migrate quickly to online learning and testing. This will strengthen and deepen these relationships, and should, in time, accelerate the shift to online learning. Broadcaster ITV has announced it, too, is slashing its payments to shareholders. It will save \u00a3300 by not paying a final dividend for 2019, or paying one in 2020 -- as it reels from a slump in advertising. It has also been forced to postpone some TV productions in the UK,and abroad, due to the quarantine measures imposed to slow the spread of the covonavirus. CEO Carolyn McCall told the City this morning: \u201cWe are operating in unprecedented and uncertain times, requiring us to take difficult decisions, plan carefully and act with speed. Our absolute priority is to protect our people, while trying to ensure that we deliver the news and programmes our viewers value and love to watch, and to keep them informed. We are actively taking measures to reduce costs and manage our cash flow so that we are best positioned to continue to deliver our strategy of building a digitally led media and entertainment company over the medium term.\u201d Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is slashing billions of dollars of spending this year, as it faces the twin threats of covid-19 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil price war. Shell hopes to save between $8bn and $9bn by cutting capital expenditure and trimming underlying operating costs. reduction of underlying operating costs by $3-4 billion per annum over the next 12 months compared to 2019 levels; reduction of cash capital expenditure to $20 billion or below for 2020 from a planned level of around $25 billion; and material reductions in working capital. Shell is also cancelling the next tranche of the share buyback programme to save money (even though those shares are a LOT cheaper than they used to be) CEO Ben van Beurden, \u201cAs well as protecting our staff and customers in this difficult time, we are also taking immediate steps to ensure the financial strength and resilience of our business. The combination of steeply falling oil demand and rapidly increasing supply may be unique, but Shell has weathered market volatility many times in the past.\u201d An absolute flurry of companies are updating the markets about the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses. Airbus first... It\u2019s scrapped its dividend this morning (saving \u20ac1.4bn) and withdrawn its previous financial guidance for 2020. Significantly, it has also lined up a new \u20ac15bn credit facility that will provide liquidity to help it ride out the crisis in the travel business. Airbus says: \u201cBy maintaining production, managing its resilient backlog, supporting its customers and securing financial flexibility for its operations, Airbus intends to secure business continuity for itself even in a protracted crisis,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re entering the fifth week of the markets panic over the Covid-19 crisis, and there\u2019s no let-up. Stocks have slumped in Asia overnight, and we\u2019re heading for another rocky start in Europe. This latest sell-off is triggered by the news, overnight, that the US Senate failed to approve a massive funding package to combat the impact of coronavirus. A key Senate procedural vote Sunday evening was split 47-47, with Democratic senators refusing to support a package which (they argue) fails to provide enough support for workers who will suffer from the looming recession, while bailing out companies. Leading Democrat Chuck Schumer described the plan as merely a: ...large corporate bailout with no protections for workers and virtually no oversight. This \u2018shell bill\u2019 (effectively a place-holder into which the actual legislation would be dropped into later) needed 60 votes to advance. The 47-47 split has dashed hopes of a quick stimulus deal, with congressional leaders and the White House failing to agree a plan. This stalemate had a predictably chilling impact on the markets - sending Wall Street future crashing 5% (the maximum allowed). Stephen Innes, global chief markets strategist at AxiCorp, says the US political deadlock is scaring the markets: While other governments around the world pour money into fiscal spending, the US can\u2019t get over its political squabbling. Democrats claim the money will just go to corporates, and hence they can\u2019t support it. One senator, Rand Paul, has now tested positive for coronavirus - raising concerns that Capitol Hill could struggle to pass legislation if more lawmakers are incapacitated. Donald Trump has also weighed in, tweeting that \u201cwe can\u2019t let the cure be worse than the problem\u201d -- seemingly attacking the medical advice that self-isolation is the only way to fight Covid-19. Asian markets have suffered heavy losses (again), with South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX losing over 5%, and China down 3%. India\u2019s stock market has plunged over 10%, as it starts to implement a lockdown to slow the virus\u2019s spread. European markets are going to take a bath too, with the UK FTSE 100 expected to drop by 4%. Tn the UK, chancellor Rishi Sunak is under pressure to provide more help for self-employed workers -- after he took the historic step of guaranteeing the wages of workers if their employers agree not to lay them off: The economic calendar is quite quiet, apart from the latest survey of eurozone consumer confidence - which is expected to have slumped sharply this month. The agenda 3pm GMT: Eurozone consumer confidence for March: expected to fall to -13, from-6.6",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 24 March. Coronavirus The national cabinet will today consider locking down coronavirus hotspots, as well as new financial assistance measures for renters, and further shutdowns of non-essential services. That financial assistance could be vital for many, with job losses from coronavirus set to increase rapidly. Rapid testing kits have now been approved by Australian regulators that will allow doctors to screen patients for the virus within 15 minutes at clinics and hospitals. And Naaman Zhou asks how 48 people who have now tested positive for Covid-19 were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney on Sunday. New South Wales Catholic schools have appealed for government help in setting up online teaching resources and have warned of a digital divide between schools. \u201cThe capacity of schools, families and communities to make any such transition is not consistent across NSW, and expectations must be realistic,\u201d said chief executive of Catholic Schools NSW, Dallas McInerney. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has placed the entire country in lockdown from Wednesday. The death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 15,000 people, and there are more than 350,000 confirmed cases worldwide.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Welsh government took strong action, shutting caravan parks and campsites and ordering holidaymakers home, arguing that this was an important tactic to save lives.</p> \n<p>Statistics, however, show that most people were<em> </em>following the prime minister\u2019s advice.

      "body": "<p>After the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was introduced in 1939, imposing a series of stringent and intrusive restrictions on individual freedoms, the wartime government anxiously kept a close eye on compliance. How would people respond? The answer, a <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/548/54848/never-again/9780141016023.html\" title=\"\">Ministry of Information report</a> concluded in 1942, was that: \u201cPeople are willing to bear any sacrifice if a 100% effort can be reached and the burden fairly shared by all.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the critical days to come, in the very different Britain of 2020, the present government must trust in exactly the same kind of popular resilience. The public desperately needed clear leadership, as the trajectory of the coronavirus epidemic in this country continues to track that of stricken Italy. On Saturday 793 people there died from the disease in one day \u2013 a global record. It was imperative that Boris Johnson abandoned the register of exhortation and issued clear instructions that will be enforced, thereby instituting a lockdown. A laissez-faire approach to fighting a pandemic did not work.</p> \n<p>Most people, in uniquely testing circumstances, have done their best to follow the government\u2019s guidance. A majority have broadly followed physical distancing advice, stayed at home for the most part and worked from there if possible. But the exact parameters of the permissible have remained unclear. The throngs who gathered in sunny public parks on Mother\u2019s Day weekend were in part a testament to confused messaging about going outdoors. Sadly, there was also evidence of a willingness to disregard warnings that came with no sanction attached. Soon it will seem inconceivable that, as Belfast doctors and nurses put together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-doctors-and-nurses-in-belfast-post-message-urging-public-to-stay-at-home-video\" title=\"\">a video</a> pleading with people to stay at home, over 6,000 people gathered to <a href=\"https://www.midweekherald.co.uk/sport/toby-garrick-leads-the-mighty-green-quartet-home-at-the-bath-half-marathon-1-6572789\" title=\"\">run the Bath half-marathon</a>. All gatherings of more than two people from different households will now be dispersed.</p> \n<p>The halfway house of self-regulation has now, rightly, been vacated. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b887d344-6c8b-11ea-89df-41bea055720b?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=a75ca55d94-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_23_07_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-a75ca55d94-189679749\" title=\"\">An analysis</a> by scientists from University College London and the University of Cambridge found that sticking to a voluntary regime could lead to between 35,000 and 70,000 excess deaths over the next year. That is clearly an unacceptably high price to pay for allowing people to choose whether or not to do the right thing.</p> \n<p>Yet again, as in previous phases of this crisis, institutions in civil society had in any case begun to perform the necessary gear change without waiting for belated orders. The National Trust has shut parks and gardens across the country. Councils such as Lambeth have closed children\u2019s play areas. There appears to be a grim acceptance that the previously unthinkable \u2013 the shutting down of sport, pubs and restaurants and the abandonment of the workplace \u2013 was only the beginning of what had to be thought.</p> \n<p>This new phase of the crisis will impose a level of constraint that none of us have ever experienced before. Plans must be put in place to help families with limited domestic resources to draw upon. It will be necessary to tend to people\u2019s mental health as well as their physical wellbeing. This is a journey without maps.

      "bodyText": "After the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was introduced in 1939, imposing a series of stringent and intrusive restrictions on individual freedoms, the wartime government anxiously kept a close eye on compliance. How would people respond? The answer, a Ministry of Information report concluded in 1942, was that: \u201cPeople are willing to bear any sacrifice if a 100% effort can be reached and the burden fairly shared by all.\u201d During the critical days to come, in the very different Britain of 2020, the present government must trust in exactly the same kind of popular resilience. The public desperately needed clear leadership, as the trajectory of the coronavirus epidemic in this country continues to track that of stricken Italy. On Saturday 793 people there died from the disease in one day \u2013 a global record. It was imperative that Boris Johnson abandoned the register of exhortation and issued clear instructions that will be enforced, thereby instituting a lockdown. A laissez-faire approach to fighting a pandemic did not work. Most people, in uniquely testing circumstances, have done their best to follow the government\u2019s guidance. A majority have broadly followed physical distancing advice, stayed at home for the most part and worked from there if possible. But the exact parameters of the permissible have remained unclear. The throngs who gathered in sunny public parks on Mother\u2019s Day weekend were in part a testament to confused messaging about going outdoors. Sadly, there was also evidence of a willingness to disregard warnings that came with no sanction attached. Soon it will seem inconceivable that, as Belfast doctors and nurses put together a video pleading with people to stay at home, over 6,000 people gathered to run the Bath half-marathon. All gatherings of more than two people from different households will now be dispersed. The halfway house of self-regulation has now, rightly, been vacated. An analysis by scientists from University College London and the University of Cambridge found that sticking to a voluntary regime could lead to between 35,000 and 70,000 excess deaths over the next year. That is clearly an unacceptably high price to pay for allowing people to choose whether or not to do the right thing. Yet again, as in previous phases of this crisis, institutions in civil society had in any case begun to perform the necessary gear change without waiting for belated orders. The National Trust has shut parks and gardens across the country. Councils such as Lambeth have closed children\u2019s play areas. There appears to be a grim acceptance that the previously unthinkable \u2013 the shutting down of sport, pubs and restaurants and the abandonment of the workplace \u2013 was only the beginning of what had to be thought. This new phase of the crisis will impose a level of constraint that none of us have ever experienced before. Plans must be put in place to help families with limited domestic resources to draw upon. It will be necessary to tend to people\u2019s mental health as well as their physical wellbeing. This is a journey without maps. But the evidence from Italy suggests that citizens are willing to cede their liberties and swap freedom for greater security once the state takes responsibility. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, locked his citizens down two weeks ago. There, as in Britain, the spread of Covid-19 was initially greeted with misplaced stoicism and declarations that life must go on. The leader of the governing Democratic party, Nicola Zingaretti, was photographed sharing an aperitif with students in Milan. That kind of breezy defiance was swiftly replaced by fear, as images of overwhelmed hospitals came to dominate the evening news. Enforced by fines for those who left their homes without good reason, lockdown brought clarity and, overwhelmingly, compliance. On Sunday, Italian health officials cautiously welcomed the news that, after the horrific high of the day before, the daily toll had finally fallen back and rates of infection had slowed. On Monday both rates fell again. These are the first positive signs after a fortnight of national sacrifice. As things stand, Britain is believed to be two weeks behind Italy in this nightmarish experience. Yet the government has waited to impose a similar level of self-restraint. It is right to take this action now.",

      "body": "<p>Difficult and almost impossibly daunting as it may seem, the world is faced with not one but two existential crises and two races against time: the coronavirus and the climate emergency. Dealing with both is going to require extraordinary focus and resolution.</p> <p>Already there is a whiff of political opportunism in the air. Last week, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said that the \u20ac1tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a>, unveiled and enshrined in law by the European commission barely three weeks ago, should be <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/czech-pm-urges-eu-to-ditch-green-deal-amid-virus/\">put to one side</a>. Member states, he advised, should concentrate all resources on combating a pandemic which, one by one, is shutting down societies and economies. Along with other eastern European states such as Poland, the Czech government has been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of action required to combat global heating, which would have a severe impact on fossil fuel industries in their countries.</p> <p>The extreme urgency of defeating Covid-19 scarcely needs stating. But Mr Babi\u0161\u2019s broader suggestion has been rightly rejected. \u201cThis is one of the very reasons why we presented the climate change law: to avoid that climate action, a generational task, is obfuscated by more pressing and immediate challenges,\u201d said a Brussels spokesman. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch commissioner who is leading the EU response on the climate emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/focus-coronavirus-shows-need-climate-law-says-eu-official-frans-timmermans\">has made the same point</a>. </p> <p>The new climate law commits member states to zero emissions by 2050. A stringent new target is also to be set for 2030, which will be enshrined in the law. </p> <p>Mr Timmermans has said that the climate law will act as a \u2018\u201ccompass\u201d for the next 30 years as EU member states seek sustainable forms of growth. In these extraordinary times, local imagination and creativity in developing a sustainable future will be at a premium. There are at least some hopeful signs that such thinking is taking place.</p> <p>In the city of Utrecht, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/forward-thinking-utrecht-builds-car-free-district-for-12000-people\">plans have been unveiled</a> for the largest purpose-built pedestrianised residential area in Europe, which will attempt to harness the virtues of the sharing economy. The Merwede estate will house 12,000 people on a 60-acre site. Transport will be provided by bus and train networks and a shared pool of bikes and cars \u2013 one car for every three families. Schools, shops, sports and medical services will all be within walking distance, and water from the local canal will be used to heat the area. The intention is for the district to become close to energy neutral.</p> <p>Utrecht is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Netherlands and is projected to add 100,000 people to its 350,000 population by 2040. In terms of factoring in a necessary environmental dimension to new construction, Merwede looks like best practice. It is the kind of project that is relatively small scale, but repeatable. It helps of course that the Dutch have a historically passionate relationship with the bicycle. But as the EU attempts to hold the line on implementing its green deal, many more Utrechts will be required.</p>",

Last week, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said that the \u20ac1tn European Green Deal, unveiled and enshrined in law by the European commission barely three weeks ago, should be put to one side. Member states, he advised, should concentrate all resources on combating a pandemic which, one by one, is shutting down societies and economies. Along with other eastern European states such as Poland, the Czech government has been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of action required to combat global heating, which would have a severe impact on fossil fuel industries in their countries. The extreme urgency of defeating Covid-19 scarcely needs stating. But Mr Babi\u0161\u2019s broader suggestion has been rightly rejected. \u201cThis is one of the very reasons why we presented the climate change law: to avoid that climate action, a generational task, is obfuscated by more pressing and immediate challenges,\u201d said a Brussels spokesman. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch commissioner who is leading the EU response on the climate emergency, has made the same point. The new climate law commits member states to zero emissions by 2050. A stringent new target is also to be set for 2030, which will be enshrined in the law. Mr Timmermans has said that the climate law will act as a \u2018\u201ccompass\u201d for the next 30 years as EU member states seek sustainable forms of growth. In these extraordinary times, local imagination and creativity in developing a sustainable future will be at a premium. There are at least some hopeful signs that such thinking is taking place. In the city of Utrecht, plans have been unveiled for the largest purpose-built pedestrianised residential area in Europe, which will attempt to harness the virtues of the sharing economy. The Merwede estate will house 12,000 people on a 60-acre site. Transport will be provided by bus and train networks and a shared pool of bikes and cars \u2013 one car for every three families. Schools, shops, sports and medical services will all be within walking distance, and water from the local canal will be used to heat the area. The intention is for the district to become close to energy neutral. Utrecht is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Netherlands and is projected to add 100,000 people to its 350,000 population by 2040. In terms of factoring in a necessary environmental dimension to new construction, Merwede looks like best practice. It is the kind of project that is relatively small scale, but repeatable. It helps of course that the Dutch have a historically passionate relationship with the bicycle. But as the EU attempts to hold the line on implementing its green deal, many more Utrechts will be required.",

In a weekend plebiscite in the city of Mexicali, 76.1% of voters cast ballots against the $1.4bn brewery, being built by Constellation Brands to brew beer for export \u2013 including Corona, Modelo and Pacifico. \u201cThere\u2019s been an intense campaign [against the brewery] by a resistance movement for two years \u2026 protesting in the streets and going to the courts to hold a plebiscite,\u201d said Daniel Solorio, a lawyer who has worked with the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising the president called a plebiscite on such short notice,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been demanding a vote for two years.\u201d Alfonso Cortez Lara, water expert at the College of the Northern Border, said the brewery was projected to use more water than all the industrial users in Mexicali combined. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 25% of our [water] reserves,\u201d he said of the brewery\u2019s proposed peak water use. Federal officials said on Monday the plant would lose its water permits and the government would seek to negotiate with the company. Critics complained that only 3.5% of people in Mexicali participated in the vote, which was called barely two weeks earlier by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. It was the latest of a string of controversial projects the populist leader has put to sudden plebiscites, which critics contend are rigged to induce his preferred result. The vote \u2013 carried out amid the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 came at a tricky time for Mexico, where the economy has stagnated and the peso has plunged. International investors appear spooked by L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s willingness to call snap votes on projects already under construction, such as a new airport in Mexico City. \u201cThe consultation on #ConstellationBrands in Mexicali is a strong blow to investor confidence on the eve of an economic crisis,\u201d the business chamber Coparmex tweeted on Sunday. Constellation Brands shares fell by more than 10% on news of the plebiscite. Cortez said the issue would probably be taken to court under an investor protection provision in Mexico\u2019s free trade deal with the United States and Canada. Mexico is the world\u2019s biggest beer exporter, but the industry has become the focus for resentment in the arid north where breweries are perceived as using scarce water resources to slake US thirst at a time when climate change is exacerbating droughts in the region. Earlier this year, Mexico\u2019s national human rights commission warned that the Mexicali brewery risked violating the right to water and highlighted irregularities in the permitting process. L\u00f3pez Obrador said the consultation was necessary because the company and local authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t take the people into account\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not against foreign investment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we also have to take the people\u2019s opinion into account and take care of our natural resources.\u201d",

Humans, pigs, spiders and butterflies are all bilaterians, but creatures such as jellyfish are not.

A jury of eight women and five men at the high court in Edinburgh on Monday found Salmond not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after about six hours of deliberations. They came to the uniquely Scottish verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape, after hearing nearly nine days of evidence. The outcome \u2013 greeted by Salmond with praise for the judicial system and a call for Scotland\u2019s attention to return to the threat posed by coronavirus \u2013 capped the most significant criminal trial in Scottish political history. It prompted immediate recriminations and demands for resignations within the SNP, which Salmond\u2019s allies and opposition parties said now faced profound questions over its handling of the case. The nine women involved in the charges were all current or former Scottish government officials, or SNP politicians. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government has already lost a judicial review started by Salmond into its handling of an internal review of two misconduct complaints against him in 2018. Joanna Cherry QC, an influential SNP MP, called for Salmond to be allowed to rejoin the party without delay, and for an independent inquiry into the way the party dealt with the allegations. \u201cSome of the evidence that has come to light both in the judicial review and at this trial raise very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints against Mr Salmond, and I am sorry to say some of the evidence also raises serious question marks over how these complaints were handled by the SNP,\u201d she said. Kenny MacAskill, formerly Salmond\u2019s justice secretary and now an SNP MP, welcomed the verdict, tweeting that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d for Salmond and that some resignations were \u201cnow required\u201d. After the verdicts were read out, Salmond displayed little emotion, but thanked court security officers and the judge, Lady Dorrian, Scotland\u2019s second most senior judge. Speaking outside court afterwards Salmond said his faith in the judicial system had been \u201cmuch reinforced\u201d. Thanking his friends, family and supporters for standing by him throughout the trial, he said his own \u201cnightmare\u201d could not compare with the coronavirus crisis. After thanking his \u201cexceptional\u201d legal team, Salmond said he planned to release further information about the case at a later date. \u201cAs many of you will know, there was certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren\u2019t able to do so. At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day but it won\u2019t be this day, for a very good reason,\u201d he said. The SNP leader and first minister, Sturgeon, said the verdicts \u201cmust be respected\u201d, but added that her focus was currently on steering the country through the coronavirus crisis. \u201cI am a strong believer in a vigorous, robust, independent judicial process where complaints of this nature, if they come forward, are properly and thoroughly investigated, due process takes its course and a court reaches a decision, and that\u2019s what has happened today,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no doubt that there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, in the fullness of time \u2013 and I will welcome that. But that time is not now.\u201d In pre-trial court hearings, Salmond\u2019s defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, had told Dorrian there were text messages between complainants, Scottish government officials and SNP officials that raised questions about an orchestration of some of the allegations against his client. Jackson sought to get some of that material admitted into evidence. In January he told Dorrian the defence believed \u201cthere was [a] concerted effort made by people in the government to influence this process, to get it as best they could in terms of criminal prosecution\u201d. He alleged those efforts were motivated by revenge because Salmond had won his judicial review in January 2019, after the Scottish government admitted it had botched an internal inquiry into two sexual harassment complaints against him. One of those texts included one sent by Leslie Evans, as permanent secretary the Scottish government\u2019s top civil servant, to another official after they lost the judicial review, which read: \u201cWe may have lost the battle, but we will win the war.\u201d Dorrian refused to allow much of that material to be used in court but allowed other messages to be admitted as evidence. Salmond was originally charged with 14 offences but was formally acquitted of one charge, a 10th sexual assault charge, after the prosecution withdrew it halfway through the trial. The not proven verdict on sexual assault with attempt to rape stops short of a finding of not guilty but leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law. Two jurors were discharged by the judge on Monday morning, reducing the size of the jury from 15 to 13. Alex Prentice QC, as he summed up the case for the prosecution, told the jury Salmond was a sexual predator who exploited his power to prey on younger, subordinate women. Jackson disputed Prentice\u2019s account. He told the jury there were no direct witnesses to the alleged assaults, and that inconsistencies and contradictions repeatedly cropped up in the evidence. \u201cThis comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind. I said already it smelt and I don\u2019t apologise for that one bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the same pattern over and over and over again. It\u2019s scary.\u201d The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, said the verdicts raised further \u201cserious questions\u201d for the SNP, the Scottish government and Sturgeon, which would be investigated by a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry. Pauline McNeill, the Scottish Labour equalities spokeswoman, said the trial was extremely traumatic for all involved, but added: \u201cThe verdict of this trial does not take away from the serious concerns about the Scottish government\u2019s handling of this. We would expect questions about this to be fully explored during parliamentary scrutiny of this.\u201d Rape Crisis Scotland thanked the complainants for appearing in court. \u201cRegardless of the verdict, the detailed descriptions and court coverage has been triggering and very hard for many people,\u201d the group said.",

Although his cautionary Americana fables didn\u2019t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.</p> <p>But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn\u2019t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). \u201cHe\u2019s obviously well-known as an entertainer,\u201d said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, \u201cbut he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.\u201d</p> <p>Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers\u2019 images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as <a href=\"https://br.pinterest.com/pin/211174959063151/\">Ray Charles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/why-dolly-parton-is-having-a-millennial-moment\">Dolly Parton</a>, to documenting the natural beauty of America\u2019s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KennyRogersOfficial/posts/my-photo-of-the-lincoln-memorial/1599645890065813/\">proudly uploaded</a> to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BuCkkpVAoFO/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson\u2019s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.</p> <p>One of Rogers\u2019s biggest lessons came from the American portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.</p> <p>\u201cHe came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,\u201d Rogers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jllVqUaWRg4\">told the Associated Press.</a> \u201cGeorge said to me, \u2018I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!\u2019 He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It\u2019s honestly such a great trick.\u201d</p> <p>Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.</p> <p>Last June, Rogers posted one of his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByvOUxGBhir/\">photos to Instagram</a>, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It\u2019s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the fatalistic blues of The Gambler to the mournful lament of Lucille, Kenny Rogers sang songs full of emotion, courage, drama and heartache. Although his cautionary Americana fables didn\u2019t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling. But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn\u2019t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). \u201cHe\u2019s obviously well-known as an entertainer,\u201d said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, \u201cbut he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.\u201d Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers\u2019 images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as Ray Charles and Dolly Parton, to documenting the natural beauty of America\u2019s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, proudly uploaded to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around. Armed with a 35mm Brownie Hawkeye, Rogers enjoyed taking long walks on the look-out for unique trees. The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. \u201cI only worked an hour a day,\u201d Rogers said of life on the road in 2014. \u201cThat meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.\u201d In that interview, with Sports &amp; Entertainment Nashville, he added: \u201cSo we\u2019d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they\u2019d say, \u2018No, I\u2019ve lived here 30 year and there\u2019s nothing.\u2019 And then you\u2019d turn round the corner and you\u2019d find Niagara Falls.\u201d Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed photographers, from Yousuf Karsh to John Sexton. \u201cKarsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWhen you see them totally relaxed, that\u2019s when you shoot. John taught me the importance of really loving what you photograph.\u201d Working under these giants of photography, Rogers reached another level. His equipment grew more sophisticated, too.

He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda. That said, Rogers\u2019s shot of Michael Jackson awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson\u2019s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer. One of Rogers\u2019s biggest lessons came from the American portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product. \u201cHe came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,\u201d Rogers told the Associated Press. \u201cGeorge said to me, \u2018I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!\u2019 He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It\u2019s honestly such a great trick.\u201d Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it. Last June, Rogers posted one of his photos to Instagram, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It\u2019s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in.",

So when Britons began congregating in parks at the weekend, there was no way to issue a formal warning to the public in real time.</p> \n<p>Instead the British state is reliant on traditional media outlets and social media sites to communicate indirectly about isolation measures, competing with disinformation on messaging services such as WhatsApp. This has resulted in suggestions that mixed messages from ministers and a lack of a major public information campaign are hindering efforts to highlight the severity of the pandemic, with the government yet to take up the offer of <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-govt-hasnt-run-ads-on-pandemic-from-official-social-media-accounts-11962386\">free advertising space</a> on sites such as Facebook.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\" data-alt=\"Map of UK hotspots\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\">Map of UK hotspots</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Toby Harris, who has long campaigned for a UK alert system, said the British emergency messaging service had been a victim of inter-government squabbles and concerns over who would provide funding.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fallen between government departments as to who is going to pick up the bill, who\u2019s going to lead on it, and all sorts of issues,\u201d said Lord Harris, who highlighted the effectiveness of similar systems in Australia and Portugal for warning about risks from forest fires.</p> \n<p>The Labour peer said the inability to inform the public of an impending risk to life was a major flaw in the government\u2019s toolkit: \u201cWhat is ridiculous is that you haven\u2019t got the facility available.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2013 the government concluded that \u201cnot only would alerts be seen as a useful service by the public but that it would also be an effective way of getting people to take specific protective action during an emergency\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The government does not have the ability to send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons\u2019 mobile phones, after repeatedly ignoring its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help the country in times of crisis. South Korea\u2019s aggressive use of emergency alerts has been credited by some for helping to keep the country\u2019s infection rate relatively low, while many other European countries have built systems allowing governments to issue warnings about threats to life. When politicians in the Netherlands became concerned on Sunday that too many people were flouting physical distancing rules and congregating in parks, they used their emergency messaging service NL-Alert to send a message urging the public to avoid congregating in open spaces and keep their distance. But seven years after the UK Cabinet Office conducted successful trials of an emergency alert system and set out how the country could build a similar system, there is still no sign of it being developed. So when Britons began congregating in parks at the weekend, there was no way to issue a formal warning to the public in real time. Instead the British state is reliant on traditional media outlets and social media sites to communicate indirectly about isolation measures, competing with disinformation on messaging services such as WhatsApp. This has resulted in suggestions that mixed messages from ministers and a lack of a major public information campaign are hindering efforts to highlight the severity of the pandemic, with the government yet to take up the offer of free advertising space on sites such as Facebook. Toby Harris, who has long campaigned for a UK alert system, said the British emergency messaging service had been a victim of inter-government squabbles and concerns over who would provide funding. \u201cIt\u2019s fallen between government departments as to who is going to pick up the bill, who\u2019s going to lead on it, and all sorts of issues,\u201d said Lord Harris, who highlighted the effectiveness of similar systems in Australia and Portugal for warning about risks from forest fires. The Labour peer said the inability to inform the public of an impending risk to life was a major flaw in the government\u2019s toolkit: \u201cWhat is ridiculous is that you haven\u2019t got the facility available.\u201d In 2013 the government concluded that \u201cnot only would alerts be seen as a useful service by the public but that it would also be an effective way of getting people to take specific protective action during an emergency\u201d. Although the proposals focused on the potential for using the system to deal with environmental disasters or terrorist attacks, there is no reason it could not have been reconfigured to spread official health advice in serious medical emergencies. The government\u2019s communications strategy has come under fire in recent days, with some pointing to the prime minister\u2019s sometimes mixed tone regarding the need to allow people to visit parks. The NHS on Monday began sending text messages to many of the 1.5 million people considered to be at severe risk if they are infected with coronavirus, telling them to stay inside for 12 weeks. The health service\u2019s ability to communicate with all of this group is limited by the lack of contact details, although it is aided by the fact that many in this category are receiving ongoing medical treatment for issues such as cancer. The industry lobby group Mobile UK also said it was in discussions with the government over ways it can help the fight against coronavirus, including the use of widespread text message campaigns. Prof David Harper, a former chief scientist at the health department, said it was necessary to wait until post-pandemic scientific studies had been completed to have a full analysis of whether an emergency messaging system would be effective but there were reasons to suggest it may help risk management. \u201cThe demonstration in other countries, where people can be notified directly by text of where there were \u2013 or are \u2013 cases of Covid-19 \u2026 seems to have had an impact.\u201d He also said there were real concerns about the impact of disinformation clouding the public message and suggested the prime minister\u2019s comments about the pleasures of going out in parks showed the importance of tone in public health warnings. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly that what was said was wrong \u2013 the intention is laudable.

It said payments of at least 80% of incomes could be made directly as a tax rebate. The union umbrella group said countries including Norway and Belgium had already announced similar plans. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cAll workers \u2013 both employed and self-employed \u2013 should have their wages protected.\u201d Treasury officials are understood to be putting together a fresh financial support package for the self-employed after working over the weekend, although they believe it is more important to get the proposed scheme right than rush it out. Ministers are believed to be grappling with three issues: the technical means of delivering financial help to the self-employed; how the level of support should be calculated; and the need to make sure there is equal treatment for the employed and self-employed. Government sources also said critics were underestimating the impact of the \u00a37bn package of extra welfare spending \u2013 including higher universal credit and more generous housing benefit \u2013 announced alongside the wage subsidies. However, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and other Labour MPs challenged Sunak on Monday, saying there were still \u201csignificant gaps\u201d that urgently needed tackling. Alongside more help for the self-employed, the party said the level of statutory sick pay \u2013 currently at \u00a394.25 a week \u2013 should be increased. After a sharp rise in the decade since the financial crisis, about 15% of the UK workforce is self-employed, with larger proportions in some sectors and regions, including construction and the creative arts. Earlier on Monday a former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, called on ministers to support self-employed people, while warning that the coronavirus crisis posed a more serious threat to the economy than the 2008 financial crash. King, who led the Bank\u2019s response in 2008, said the government should give self-employed workers the same level of support as employees as a minimum first step. \u201cIt\u2019s a good starting point because it would be equivalent to the support that\u2019s being given for paying wages,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps.\u201d",

News of the grim discoveries came as Spain experienced a further rise in the number of coronavirus deaths and cases, and as health authorities set about distributing almost 650,000 rapid testing kits. On Monday, the country\u2019s defence minister, Margarita Robles, said that members of the specialist Military Emergencies Unit had found the corpses as they carried out their duties. \u201cDuring some of its visits, the army has seen some totally abandoned elderly people \u2013 even some who were dead in their beds,\u201d Robles told the Ana Rosa TV programme. Robles said such inhumane treatment would not be tolerated and that anyone ignoring their responsibilities would be prosecuted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very blunt and implacable over this and we have a very clear message: the full weight of the law will fall on those who don\u2019t meet their obligations,\u201d she added. The virus has now claimed 2,182 lives in the country \u2013 up from 1,720 on Sunday \u2013 while the number of confirmed cases has increased from 28,572 to 33,089. The rising death toll has placed a strain on hospitals and funeral homes around Madrid and led regional health authorities to set up a makeshift morgue at the Palacio de Hielo, a large ice rink in the north-east of the capital. \u201cThis is a temporary and extraordinary measure primarily intended to mitigate the pain of victims\u2019 families and the situation in Madrid\u2019s hospitals,\u201d the regional government said on Monday. In Spain, testing kits are being issued for frontline hospital staff, older people in care homes, and those in regions most affected by the virus. Around 12% of all those diagnosed with the coronavirus \u2013 some 3,910 people \u2013 are health workers, the government said on Monday morning. The increase in cases in Spain came as the US scrambled to tackle the coronavirus pandemic amid blunt warnings that time and resources are running out, with the number of confirmed cases in the country rising above 35,000. By Sunday night, the US had overtaken Spain to become the third most-affected country, behind China and Italy, with the US death toll standing at 417. Political leaders in New York \u2013 where about half the US cases have been reported \u2013 told the White House that people in the region felt abandoned and vulnerable. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, said hospital supplies including ventilators, masks and surgical gloves would be exhausted within 10 days, while Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned that up to 80% of his state\u2019s population of almost 20 million was at risk of contracting the virus. And there were fears of a coming change in the Trump administration\u2019s strategy to fight the virus, when the president tweeted: \u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\u201d In other developments: Deaths in Italy rose by 601 \u2013 but this figure was smaller than that for Sunday (651), which was smaller than Saturday\u2019s record figure of 793. Lombardy health minister Giulio Gallera said this showed a \u201cdownward trend\u201d. Italy has banned any movement inside the country and closed all non-essential businesses following a weekend in which more than 1,400 people died. In Germany, the head of the country\u2019s leading public health advisory body said the exponential upwards curve in new confirmed coronavirus infections was levelling off for the first time, due to strict social distancing measures in force across the country. Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, urged caution, saying that many health authorities had not yet submitted their data from the weekend. \u201cI will only be able to confirm this trend definitively on Wednesday,\u201d he said. But he added he remained optimistic. India on Monday announced a halt to domestic flights and said the majority of the country was under complete lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, has begun to loosen its two-month lockdown on citizens. South Korea reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases on Monday, boosting hopes that Asia\u2019s largest outbreak outside China may be abating. Hong Kong said it would ban the entry of all non-residents from 11.59pm on Tuesday, for 14 days. Three doctors have died in France after contracting the coronavirus, according to the AFP news agency. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, confirmed a hospital doctor died on Sunday. There are reports that a 66-year-old gynaecologist and a 60-year-old GP \u2013 both from eastern France where hospitals have also been overwhelmed with patients \u2013 have also died. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced the country would go into a month-long lockdown from Wednesday. More than 670 Filipino health workers have been quarantined over fears they were exposed to coronavirus, while others have resorted to using bin bags for protection as case numbers rise across much of south-east Asia. More than 50 million people in the Philippines remain under lockdown. Canada became the first country to warn that it will not send its athletes to the Tokyo Olympics unless they are postponed for a year, as pressure builds to delay the Games. The disgraced former film producer Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to prison authorities in New York. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has called on the EU to instigate a \u201cMarshall plan\u201d to counter the economic effects of the crisis, and announced that the country\u2019s state of emergency would be extended until 11 April. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s vice-president, Carmen Calvo, was admitted to hospital for treatment for a respiratory infection, Spanish media reported. Two cabinet ministers and the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, have tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities in Madrid, where almost a third of the country\u2019s cases have been reported, have set up a huge field hospital inside the capital\u2019s main conference centre. The facility at the Ifema centre, which took in its first patients over the weekend, could accommodate 5,500 people. The country has been in lockdown since 14 March, with people allowed out only to buy food or medicine or to seek medical help or travel to and from work. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said that talk of the contagion peaking this week could not allow people to become complacent. \u201cThese are going to be crucial days because reaching a peak doesn\u2019t mean things have been solved; it means we have to redouble our efforts to guarantee we don\u2019t take a step backwards,\u201d he said. The mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, has said that municipal undertakers will cease collecting the bodies of coronavirus victims from Tuesday as they do not have the protective material needed to ensure their own safety. In a letter to Spain\u2019s health minister, seen by El Mundo, the mayor called for more resources, adding: \u201cI hope you are aware of the gravity of the situation if this week we find ourselves unable to bury and cremate people who fell victim to Covid.\u201d",

If you are on holiday abroad the time to come home is now while you still can.\u201d Officials fear anyone who delays may not be able to secure flights by the end of the week, leaving them potentially trapped far from home. However, critics of the government point out that many people are already marooned abroad because of travel restrictions in other countries and are in desperate need of repatriation flights. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is seeking an urgent meeting to force a government repatriation programme with up to 1 million Britons stranded abroad with no commercial flights or no free seats running from countries such as New Zealand. After New Zealand announced it was going into lockdown this week, a WhatsApp group of more than 300 people claimed the British embassy had been \u201cappalling\u201d, with airlines not taking calls or simply cancelling flights with no notice. On Saturday, Raab announced he was laying on flights for more than 500 Britons stranded in Peru, after an avalanche of criticism. The British government has also been criticised for allowing flights to continue from the worst hit countries such as Italy and Iran. However, Whitehall sources have defended the continuation of commercial flights, saying it is essential that Brits should be able to get home. Doctors who are among those stranded overseas told the Guardian they were desperate to return to help their NHS colleagues battle the coronavirus outbreak but that they had received little help from the Foreign Office. One doctor, who works at one of the busiest A&amp;E departments in the country, said he was due to fly home to the UK from Pakistan on Sunday night but arrived at the airport to find his flight was cancelled and that they were stopping all international flights with immediate effect. He was told there would be no flights for another fortnight at least. \u201cAt a time when doctors are being called out of retirement, and everyone is being asked to pull together and help amidst this crisis, I feel so helpless as I am stranded abroad with no means to come back home,\u201d said the doctor, who asked not to be named. One GP who is stuck in New Zealand with his wife, who is also a doctor, said he was \u201ctrapped\u201d with no way to come back to the UK after travel restrictions were imposed. He said he tried to contact the consulate by phone and social media, and ended up taking a flight to physically visit the office in Wellington only to be turned away on arrival with nothing but a list of generic websites. Another said he and his friend had gone out to New Zealand to work for six weeks in Auckland City hospital and Starship children\u2019s hospital, but were stuck with no help from the embassy. \u201cOur colleagues are fighting a war back home that we should be helping with,\u201d they said. The Foreign Office did not respond to the accusations about embassies, but said in a statement: \u201cWe recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health. \u201cWe are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Rail franchising is being suspended \u201cfor a limited period, initially six months,\u201d said the Department for Transport. Are you sure? It seems more likely the whole franchising model, as understood since privatisation in the 1990s, is now finished for good.</p> <p>Who, after all, will want to revive a system that the government\u2019s own adviser, the former British Airways boss Keith Williams, last year described as unfit for purpose even in happier times? Train operators themselves surely won\u2019t be lobbying for the return of their franchises on the same financial terms.</p> <p>For starters, many were making losses on high-profile routes \u2013 witness FirstGroup on its South Western Railway operation. More significantly, revenue assumptions that underpinned even profitable routes will now be blown to pieces. The pace of economic recovery, and thus the volume of passengers, will be one huge unknown. Then there\u2019s the impact on commuter routes from the current enforced experiment in working from home. Behaviour will change; fewer \u00a33,000-a-year season tickets will be sold.</p> <p>From the government\u2019s point of view, rail franchising was already heading into the sidings, shunted there by unhappy passengers, over-complexity and an evaporation of bidders. Williams\u2019 review may now never be published, but its direction was clear. Management contracts, in which private sector firms shoulder fewer revenue risks and accept low-margin fixed fees, seemed to be one preferred way forward.</p> <p>This is the model, in rough form, that has been adopted now in emergency, thereby disproving the notion that old-style franchising could only be dismantled gradually. The task, it turns out, could be achieved over a weekend.</p> <p>Those screaming about how train operators have been let off the hook, and how losses will be dumped on the state, should calm down. The government had little choice. With the collapse in passenger numbers, train operators would soon have been handing back their franchises anyway, as they\u2019re entitled to do by forfeiting bonds. Sudden failure would have caused chaos. The DfT doesn\u2019t have a crew of \u201coperators of last resort\u201d on standby. Previous outright nationalisations, such as East Coast and Northern rail, were organised affairs.</p> <p>The medium-term ambition should be to replace rail franchising with a more flexible system that is better connected to infrastructure upgrades. Management contracts won\u2019t be the only useful model. Local commuter routes can be better controlled by local transports bodies, for example. The DfT should start planning immediately. Old-style franchising is finished.</p> <h2>Stagecoach sets a fine example</h2> <p>Boardrooms, take note: when announcing job losses and pay squeezes, remember to state what the directors are doing by way of solidarity. Well done Stagecoach, then, for saying board members will halve their salaries and fees \u201cfor a period of time\u201d, which presumably means the duration of the crisis.</p> <p>A few other companies have made similar noises in the past week, but such announcements are not yet the norm. They need to become so.</p> <p>The Treasury will soon be underwriting the payroll costs of a lot of companies, at enormous long-term cost to the public purse. Public opinion is not going to tolerate public company directors paying themselves as if nothing has changed.</p> <h2>Shell\u2019s doomed defence of the dividend</h2> <p>Shell famously hasn\u2019t cut dividend to shareholders since the second world war and, even with a global recession looming and the price of a barrel of Brent at $30, management still isn\u2019t ready to throw in the towel on a payment that cost $15bn last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monday\u2019s statement on measures \u201cto reinforce business resilience and financial strength\u201d was filled with cuts to capital spending and operating costs plus a halt to share buybacks. None of that is surprising given that Shell\u2019s financial plans had been based on oil being about $65 a barrel. Yet the dividend, it seems, will be defended until all other options are exhausted.</p> <p>The fight seems doomed to end in defeat, however, which is why Shell\u2019s shares stand at their lowest level since the mid-1990s. The 14% notional dividend yield signals the market\u2019s view that a cut is inevitable.</p> <p>This prospect will be terrifying to many income-seeking pension funds. They were sure of Shell. Even a halved dividend will have been mentally filed as a low-probability risk. Given the mass of missed dividends piling up elsewhere, this sudden loss of income is going to be yet another problem.</p>",

Who, after all, will want to revive a system that the government\u2019s own adviser, the former British Airways boss Keith Williams, last year described as unfit for purpose even in happier times? Train operators themselves surely won\u2019t be lobbying for the return of their franchises on the same financial terms. For starters, many were making losses on high-profile routes \u2013 witness FirstGroup on its South Western Railway operation. More significantly, revenue assumptions that underpinned even profitable routes will now be blown to pieces. The pace of economic recovery, and thus the volume of passengers, will be one huge unknown. Then there\u2019s the impact on commuter routes from the current enforced experiment in working from home. Behaviour will change; fewer \u00a33,000-a-year season tickets will be sold. From the government\u2019s point of view, rail franchising was already heading into the sidings, shunted there by unhappy passengers, over-complexity and an evaporation of bidders. Williams\u2019 review may now never be published, but its direction was clear. Management contracts, in which private sector firms shoulder fewer revenue risks and accept low-margin fixed fees, seemed to be one preferred way forward. This is the model, in rough form, that has been adopted now in emergency, thereby disproving the notion that old-style franchising could only be dismantled gradually. The task, it turns out, could be achieved over a weekend. Those screaming about how train operators have been let off the hook, and how losses will be dumped on the state, should calm down. The government had little choice. With the collapse in passenger numbers, train operators would soon have been handing back their franchises anyway, as they\u2019re entitled to do by forfeiting bonds. Sudden failure would have caused chaos. The DfT doesn\u2019t have a crew of \u201coperators of last resort\u201d on standby. Previous outright nationalisations, such as East Coast and Northern rail, were organised affairs. The medium-term ambition should be to replace rail franchising with a more flexible system that is better connected to infrastructure upgrades. Management contracts won\u2019t be the only useful model. Local commuter routes can be better controlled by local transports bodies, for example. The DfT should start planning immediately. Old-style franchising is finished. Stagecoach sets a fine example Boardrooms, take note: when announcing job losses and pay squeezes, remember to state what the directors are doing by way of solidarity. Well done Stagecoach, then, for saying board members will halve their salaries and fees \u201cfor a period of time\u201d, which presumably means the duration of the crisis. A few other companies have made similar noises in the past week, but such announcements are not yet the norm. They need to become so. The Treasury will soon be underwriting the payroll costs of a lot of companies, at enormous long-term cost to the public purse. Public opinion is not going to tolerate public company directors paying themselves as if nothing has changed. Shell\u2019s doomed defence of the dividend Shell famously hasn\u2019t cut dividend to shareholders since the second world war and, even with a global recession looming and the price of a barrel of Brent at $30, management still isn\u2019t ready to throw in the towel on a payment that cost $15bn last year. Monday\u2019s statement on measures \u201cto reinforce business resilience and financial strength\u201d was filled with cuts to capital spending and operating costs plus a halt to share buybacks. None of that is surprising given that Shell\u2019s financial plans had been based on oil being about $65 a barrel. Yet the dividend, it seems, will be defended until all other options are exhausted. The fight seems doomed to end in defeat, however, which is why Shell\u2019s shares stand at their lowest level since the mid-1990s. The 14% notional dividend yield signals the market\u2019s view that a cut is inevitable. This prospect will be terrifying to many income-seeking pension funds. They were sure of Shell. Even a halved dividend will have been mentally filed as a low-probability risk. Given the mass of missed dividends piling up elsewhere, this sudden loss of income is going to be yet another problem.",

His son, Alfie, has recently started a three-year chemotherapy programme as he fights cancer, so Dennison made the difficult decision to move out of the family home so he can continue treating coronavirus patients without putting Alfie at risk. \u201cI have had to make the difficult choice: to do my job and save lives of people I don\u2019t know, or to be with my son whilst he battles cancer,\u201d Dennison said in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 90,000 times. \u201cThis virus is a big threat to his life and, as I am going to be exposed this week doing my job, I can no longer live at home. \u201cLater this week I\u2019ll be moving into a motorhome and will not be able to take any further part in his care for the next 6 months.\u201d Alfie celebrated his third birthday last week and is suffering from lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. \u201cAlfie hopefully will survive his cancer and chemo, but many people will die from flu. My heart is broken making this decision, but I choose to save the lives of strangers and leave him in the care of my beautiful wife and family,\u201d Dennison said. On Sunday, Frimley Park hospital reported the deaths of five patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 and Dennison said the intensive care unit was already full, with 12 patients on ventilators after contracting the virus. \u201cMy hospital usually has 4-10 patients on ventilators and is planning and EXPECTING 80 patients to require ventilation,\u201d he added. He said two of his ICU colleagues at other hospitals are off work after contracting the infection and fears he could soon be in a similar situation. \u201cAs healthcare workers, we are now EXPECTING to catch it despite PPE.\u201d His post finished with a plea to the public to socially distance themselves from others to stop the spread of the disease and ease the burden on the already stretched NHS. \u201cPubs have been busy, offices open, social events happening, kids parties etc. It all needs to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cInfected people shed virus and it must be everywhere by now. It is your social responsibility to engage in social distancing. Actions NOW can prevent further disease transmission, ICU admissions and deaths in 10-20 days. Bottom line. SOCIALLY ISOLATE or people die in two weeks.\u201d",

Longcake\u2019s family told the Guardian in December that the 53-year-old had become depressed and withdrawn after disclosing that he had been sexually abused on a regular basis as a child in the early to mid-1970s.

      "body": "<p>Librarians in south London staged a walkout on Friday over fears for their health during the coronavirus pandemic as leaders of the sector called for library closures to be mandated by the government and not left to local councils.</p> <p>Staff in Lambeth walked out of branches on Friday afternoon, citing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/publiclibnews/status/1241379212881264641\">section 44 of the Employment Rights Act</a>, which gives employees the right to withdraw from unsafe workplaces. They said they had been given no hand gel, no gloves, and limited access to hand-washing facilities, according to the trade union Unison. </p> <p>By Friday evening, all Lambeth libraries were closed.</p> <p>Around the UK, more than 80% of library services have now shut, <a href=\"https://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/about-public-libraries-news/coronavirus-and-public-libraries\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/about-public-libraries-news/coronavirus-and-public-libraries\">website Public Libraries News</a>, despite the fact that the government is leaving decisions on closure up to individual councils.</p> <p>Ian Anstice, a librarian who runs the site, said: \u201cThe situation has gone from all libraries open [last] Monday to a big majority closed just a week later. But there has been no directive from government to close, which means that each authority has had to take the very difficult decision by themselves. I have received reports of chief librarians pleading for libraries to be closed and being told no by councillors.\u201d</p> <p>Anstice said he had also been contacted by frontline staff in branches that remain open \u201cwho are terrified by the contamination risks and report that the public are ignoring social distancing guidelines\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe staff at Lambeth walked out over the health fears and I have been told another service only avoided the same fate on Saturday by closing quickly,\u201d said Anstice.

      "bodyText": "Librarians in south London staged a walkout on Friday over fears for their health during the coronavirus pandemic as leaders of the sector called for library closures to be mandated by the government and not left to local councils. Staff in Lambeth walked out of branches on Friday afternoon, citing section 44 of the Employment Rights Act, which gives employees the right to withdraw from unsafe workplaces. They said they had been given no hand gel, no gloves, and limited access to hand-washing facilities, according to the trade union Unison. By Friday evening, all Lambeth libraries were closed. Around the UK, more than 80% of library services have now shut, according to website Public Libraries News, despite the fact that the government is leaving decisions on closure up to individual councils. Ian Anstice, a librarian who runs the site, said: \u201cThe situation has gone from all libraries open [last] Monday to a big majority closed just a week later. But there has been no directive from government to close, which means that each authority has had to take the very difficult decision by themselves. I have received reports of chief librarians pleading for libraries to be closed and being told no by councillors.\u201d Anstice said he had also been contacted by frontline staff in branches that remain open \u201cwho are terrified by the contamination risks and report that the public are ignoring social distancing guidelines\u201d. \u201cThe staff at Lambeth walked out over the health fears and I have been told another service only avoided the same fate on Saturday by closing quickly,\u201d said Anstice. The lack of clear government instructions was, he said, was \u201cno way to treat a national service with hundreds of millions of visitors per year, many of who are old and vulnerable\u201d. Libraries Connected, formerly the Society of Chief Librarians, a charity that supports public libraries, has written to the government asking for library closures to be mandated. \u201cMany are still operating in a situation that is increasingly confused and alarming for library staff and their communities and puts both groups at risk of infection. This situation will worsen if children, who are not in school, begin to use their local libraries to access computers and other learning resources,\u201d says the letter, signed by the charity\u2019s chief executive, Isobel Hunter, and its president, Mark Freeman. Hunter said those libraries that have closed are now exploring how to run home library services. \u201cSome have started doing regular phone calls to the more vulnerable library users, and they\u2019re looking at online service delivery, with e-membership surging by 700% over the last week.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in response to Hunter\u2019s letter that it was right for councils to make their own decisions about library closures. \u201cWe know that some councils have decided that they need to close their physical library buildings, and that is fine,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, we know that libraries can play a number of roles in the community.

The blunt message on Monday came after images circulated online showing groups of people congregating in parks, along streets and on playing fields over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they\u2019re invincible,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not. Enough is enough.\u201d Speaking from self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus more than a week ago, Trudeau suggested his government could close provincial borders and use the law to ensure people respected quarantine rules and practice social distancing. Trudeau\u2019s remarks came before an evening call with provincial premiers who are expected to discuss both the possibility of closing provincial borders and levying steep fines for anyone caught congregating in a large group or ignoring orders to self-quarantine. Both Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have recently taken the rare step of requiring everyone entering the province to self-isolate for two weeks, even if travelling from a neighbouring Canadian province. Canada closed its shared border with the US last week to all non-essential travel. Trudeau\u2019s comments came a day after his weekend address to the nation\u2019s children, thanking them for their sacrifice as uncertainty and isolation weighed heavily on daily routines and social networks. \u201cAll of a sudden, you heard you can\u2019t go on play dates or have sleepovers, your playgrounds and schools have closed and your March break was certainly different than what you\u2019ve hoped for,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cI know this is a big change, but we have to do this not just for ourselves, but for our grandparents, our nurses, our doctors and everyone working at our hospitals and you kids are helping a lot.\u201d The country has seen growing calls in recent days for the federal government to invoke the Emergencies and Quarantine Acts, two mechanisms that grant the federal government enormous power. Trudeau has so far been resistant to use such extreme measures \u2013 as have civil liberties groups \u2013 but he reiterated that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. For now, he said, much of the responsibility to fight the pandemic remains with residents. \u201cFundamentally, it comes down to citizens making smart choices.\u201d The country is poised to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. Trudeau has recalled parliament for Tuesday where lawmakers are expected to pass billions in aid for unemployed Canadians and industries hard hit by the economic downturn.

      "bodyText": "The UK government is considering forcing the closure of all non-essential shops in an escalation of measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. A string of high street retailers have recently announced that they are closing all their stores. \u201cThe Govt considering next steps like closing non-essential retail or whether to start treating people flouting the stay at home advice as acting against the law \u2013 all being discussed \u2013 huge decisions, nothing final,\u201d the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, tweeted on Monday. The government did not comment on the suggestion before the prime minister\u2019s daily press conference. Many European countries and US states have forced the closure of all shops, with the exception of those deemed essential, such as supermarkets, other food retailers and pharmacies. Greggs, McDonald\u2019s, Nando\u2019s, Costa Coffee, Eat, Primark, Debenhams, Next and Waterstones, and The Works joined the growing list of restaurant chains and retailers closing all of their UK outlets as the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the UK neared 6,000 and claimed more than 300 lives. Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, said the bakery chain\u2019s 2,050 shops would be closed by the end of Tuesday. \u201cIt is now clear that to protect our people and customers we need to go further and temporarily close our shops completely,\u201d he said. The company said all Greggs\u2019 25,000 staff would be paid \u201cfull contract hours for as long as is practicable\u201d with support of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. Under the scheme, the government has committed to pay 80% of all employees wages up to \u00a32,500 a month if companies keep them on the books. Costa Coffee announced that 2,700 of its stores would close on Monday night. The chain said it would try to keep open some of its shops within hospitals and would give free coffee to NHS workers for the next two weeks. Debenhams said it was closing its 140 department stores in the UK and Ireland. Card Factory and Moss Bros followed with total closures. The Royal Horticultural Society and Squires Garden Centres closed their garden centres. However, WH Smith refused to bow to pressure from staff to close its doors. The chief executive, Carl Cowling, vowed to keep open its 1,200 stores and told workers the company was \u201cpositioning ourselves to government as an essential retailer\u201d. Some WH Smith employees said they felt their health was being put at risk by the chain\u2019s refusal to close. \u201cI was shocked and appalled by how busy our store was on Saturday and people\u2019s disregard for safety,\u201d one member of staff said. \u201cIt\u2019s putting the general public and ourselves at risk. We don\u2019t want to be there, but we feel like we have to.\u201d In a letter to staff last week, the WH Smith boss said: \u201cIn our high street stores, we have a retail offer that extends to every generation. We can provide essential products to our younger pre-school customers; an unrivalled education officer with accompanying stationery range to children, teenagers and students; a fantastic books offer for everyone; and a news and magazines offer that can\u2019t be beaten, enabling communities to access information and keep up to date with what is happening at the current time.\u201d The prime minister has repeatedly called on the public to stay at home whenever possible and only venture out for essentials such as food or medicine. On Friday, he ordered all pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and other venues to close. Restaurants and cafes were told they could continue to offer takeaway food and drink. People have been warned against any congregation in groups, even outdoors. Some have been ignoring this advice, prompting calls for Boris Johnson to take stronger action, including closing non-essential shops and calling on the police to disperse any gatherings. The latest figures on shopper numbers show a 31% drop in people visiting the high street last week, compared with the same week a year earlier.

Diane Wehrle, of Springboard, said: \u201cThe annual change represented an unprecedented decline in retail footfall that was three times greater than the worst result we have ever previously recorded.\u201d Primark said its 376 stores in 12 countries would close until further notice. There are 189 Primark shops in the UK. Waterstones said it would close its 280 UK branches from Monday. Only hours previously, its chief executive, James Daunt, had said the bookstore chain was \u201cno different to a supermarket or a pharmacy\u201d and would stay open during the coronavirus shutdown.",

The first team to win four games gets to take home the Golden Teapot and keep it for a year. The teams are evenly matched except for a small home advantage. When playing at home, each team has a 51 per cent chance of winning. (And a 49 per cent chance of losing. No ties are allowed.) Every year, the first three games are played at the home of Team A, and the rest at the home of Team B. Which team is more likely to win the Golden Teapot? The solution Team B is more likely to win. The first to win four is the equivalent of \u2018the best of seven\u2019. So, there will be at most seven games. The piece of insight that makes the solution \u2018simple\u2019 is the realisation that deciding to play all seven games (regardless of outcomes) makes no difference to the issue of which team wins the series, and thus, since 4 of those 7 are home games for Team B, Team B has the advantage. The (apparent) paradox The paradox is this: if you just play until one team has won four games, the average number of games played is less than 6, therefore most games actually played will be at the home of Team A. In other words, if the league statistician looks back over a great many years of the series, she will discover that Team A won most of the games, but Team B won most of the series! (The tricky part is to compute correctly that if you play until one team has won four games, that the number of games us less than six. The workings are shown below) The resolution Peter Winkler writes: \u201cHow can it be that home-field advantage for the seventh game, which is usually not played, is as good as home-field advantage for the first game, which is always played? \u201cThe answer is that something that is there when you need it is just as good as something that is there all the time. Home-field advantage in the seventh game is there when Team B needs it; if they don\u2019t get to the seventh game, they don\u2019t need that advantage as the series has already been won or lost.\u201d The details: The calculation that shows that on average fewer than 6 games are played is a bit messy: If the games were all 50-50, the probabilities that a series will last 4, 5, 6, or 7 games would be, respectively, 1/8, 1/4, 5/16 and 5/16. Thus the average number of games played is (4 x 1/8) + (5 x 1/4) + (6 x 5/16) + (7 x 5/16) = (93/16) = 5 and 13/16 = 5.8125 and since three games are always played in Town A, on average only 2 and 13/16 are played in Town B. Replacing 50-50 by the appropriate 51% or 49% changes the expected number of games very slightly. The probability that just four games are played is .513 x .49 + .493 x .51 = .12499998. Five games: (1 x .49) x (.514) + (3 x .492 x .513) + (3 x .493 x .512) +(1 x .494 x .51) = .2499. Six games: (4 x .515 x.49) + (12 x .513 x .493) + (4 x .51 x .495) = 0.31252498998. Seven games: the remaining .31257503002. This results in an average of 5.81267507002, just a bit higher than we got without the home-field bias. Thanks again to Peter Winkler for today\u2019s puzzle.

While dunderheaded Britons were still swarming their local parks, streets and supermarkets despite being warned not to do so, The Fiver\u2019s Antipodean cousin G\u2019Day Strewth Mate Unfair Dinkum Fiver sent us a selfie of himself sunbathing without a care in the world on Bondi Beach over the weekend, in which he appeared to have been joined by at least half the population of Sydney who had congregated en masse for an extremely ill-advised day by the seaside. While sport has been shut down in almost every country in the world bar a few notable exceptions, in the world\u2019s largest former prison yard they\u2019ve been playing on behind \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 firmly closed doors. For example, our mates in the Flamin\u2019 A-League have been playing on regardless, with Melbourne City taking on Newcastle Jets in the kind of eerie silence The Fiver last experienced when we attended a Melbourne game at a three-quarters empty stadium where crowds had actually been encouraged to go along. Despite their desperation to conclude their season to fulfil their $56m (\u00a31.75p) contractual obligations to Fox Sports, the jig now looks very much up for the A-League. With the imminent closure of assorted state borders the already financially parlous Football Federation of Australia is worried its deal will be cancelled and it\u2019ll be broke. One harebrained scheme to hurriedly relocate all out-of-state teams to New South Wales and let them play out the remainder of the season there has already been torpedoed, on the grounds it would constitute cruel and unusual punishment for all the players involved who might not want to be (a) exposed to the virus by having to play football matches or (b) forced to spend extended periods away from home.

      "body": "<p>At 8am on Monday, just as thousands of English and Welsh citizens set off for their local crown court to serve on a jury, the lord chief justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JudiciaryUK/status/1241984457332187140?s=20\">announced</a> that no new jury trials would take place.</p> <p>This move, fiercely resisted to date by the justice secretary and lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, is long overdue. While <a href=\"https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/about-the-scottish-court-service/scs-news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-update-jury-trials\">Scotland</a> and <a href=\"https://judiciaryni.uk/coronavirus-covid-19\">Northern Ireland</a> had already suspended jury trials, in England and Wales Buckland and the lord chief justice had previously decreed that jury trials lasting up to three days \u2013 estimated to be 75% of trials \u2013must take place.</p> <p>By compelling jurors, under threat of imprisonment, to attend our courts for jury service for the past two weeks, the Ministry of Justice and senior judiciary have consistently defied the government\u2019s own public health advice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The defendants, barristers, clerk, usher, witness box and jury box were all within two metres of each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Upon arrival at court, jurors queue with dozens of other strangers to be herded into a packed jury waiting room. Once selected for a jury panel, they pile into a windowless courtroom and sit next to each other for five hours a day. At lunch they mingle with the hundred or so other jurors in the building. At the conclusion of the trial, they shuffle into a tiny, unventilated retiring room, where they make a decision that could ultimately determine whether somebody spends time in prison.</p> <p>They do so in filthy court conditions in which the lack of hot water, soap and paper towels is widespread; where broken hand dryers, leaking toilets, burst pipes and crumbling roofs and walls are par for the course. These are conditions that, in the good times, we in the courts simply accept as a permanent feature of a chronically underfunded justice system \u2013 but which in the current climate present a patently alarming proposition.</p> <p><strong> </strong>Criminal courts are a petri dish. Scores of defendants are piled into waiting areas. Most travel by public transport; some travel in \u201csweatbox\u201d security vans from our <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bedford-prison-hmp-rats-inspection-urgent-notification-suicides-violence-drugs-a8739421.html\">infested</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49324718\">overcrowded</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">virus-ri</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">dden</a> prisons. Defendants and their families mix with their barristers, who mix with court staff, who mix with witnesses, judges and jurors, who mix with other witnesses, judges and jurors. Courtrooms vary in size and style \u2013 in some of our more antique Victorian courts, jurors are squeezed on to hard wooden benches without an inch between them,<strong> </strong>let alone the two metres recommended by the government to ensure social distancing during the coronavirus crisis. In the fairly typical court I was in last week, the defendants, barristers, clerk, usher, witness box and jury box were all within two metres of each other.</p> <p> It is telling that in his announcement yesterday, despite the chipper assurances by Her Majesty\u2019s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service that it was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HMCTSgovuk/status/1241744515028975616?s=20\">putting extra effort into court [and] tribunal cleaning</a>\u201d, the lord chief justice specifically cited the need for \u201cbasic hygiene arrangements\u201d in the courts.</p> <p><strong> </strong>By insisting that the shortest trials go ahead, the government has ensured the highest possible turnover of strangers coming into contact with each other. Over the past few days I have been flooded with messages from terrified jurors, witnesses and court staff aghast that, at a time when the government is frantically urging social distancing because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults\">infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together</a>\u201d, they are being required by law to expose themselves to such conditions. In a closing speech last week, one of my colleagues thanked the jury for their dedication. One of the jurors burst into tears.</p> <p>This situation has been appallingly unfair to all concerned. How on earth can jurors be expected to concentrate on their task? How can any defendant or victim of crime have faith that the 12 people trying their case are paying full attention to the nuances of the evidence, when the jury are burdened with the knowledge that, as a direct result of their service, they, or someone they love, could die?</p> <p>And anyway, contrary to MoJ dictums, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/legalhackette/status/1239626936357474305?s=20\">the courts have not been \u201coperating normally</a>\u201d. Judges are self-isolating; defendants, jurors and witnesses are staying at home as they break out with symptoms; and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-51932469\">trials are collapsing</a> all over the country. The Witness Service, the organisation responsible for looking after witnesses at court, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-victim-and-witness-services\">has withdrawn its volunteers</a>. Many crown court judges have made no secret of their disdain for what the MoJ would wish to term a \u201cstrategy\u201d, but which more closely resembles a tribute act to Monty Python\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCs\">Black Knight</a>, chirpily dismissing each collapsed trial as a mere flesh wound.</p> <p><strong> </strong>The government line seems to have been that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEOofHMCTS/status/1241703597789806592?s=20\">justice is not optional</a>\u201d. A sweet homily, betrayed only by the evidence of the past decade, in which victims, defendants and witnesses have found their cases mishandled or delayed for years due to enormous cuts to the budgets of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and legal aid. Justice has been optional whenever financially or politically convenient.</p> <p>One real reason for the intransigence appears to be Buckland\u2019s fear of becoming known as \u201cthe lord chancellor who closed the courts\u201d, a disfiguring blemish on the CV in this tough-on-crime government. But there is also a secondary, practical concern: because of government cuts, including cutting the number of sitting days, we have a backlog of <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/crown-court-backlog-rises-for-first-time-in-four-years-7mt8v7ljw\">more than 30,000 crown court trials</a> and are currently trying cases for offences said to have occurred two or more years ago. The government knows that a standard two-year delay could quickly become three.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/13/serious-victims-wait-longer-justice-court-days-cut\">Serious crime victims wait longer for justice after court days cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What this crisis therefore presents, should the government choose to accept it, is an opportunity. <strong> </strong>The lord chief justice\u2019s hint at a swift resumption of trials \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JudiciaryUK/status/1241984457332187140?s=20\">where specific safety arrangements have been put in place</a>\u201d is beyond optimistic. All jury trials listed in the next 12 weeks should be immediately pulled from the court list. Shorter, urgent hearings can take place by video-link where possible.</p> <p>The courts can be deep-cleaned from top to bottom, and their facilities and working practices fully reviewed so that they meet 21st-century standards<strong> </strong>of hygiene, health and safety.

      "bodyText": "At 8am on Monday, just as thousands of English and Welsh citizens set off for their local crown court to serve on a jury, the lord chief justice announced that no new jury trials would take place. This move, fiercely resisted to date by the justice secretary and lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, is long overdue. While Scotland and Northern Ireland had already suspended jury trials, in England and Wales Buckland and the lord chief justice had previously decreed that jury trials lasting up to three days \u2013 estimated to be 75% of trials \u2013must take place. By compelling jurors, under threat of imprisonment, to attend our courts for jury service for the past two weeks, the Ministry of Justice and senior judiciary have consistently defied the government\u2019s own public health advice. Upon arrival at court, jurors queue with dozens of other strangers to be herded into a packed jury waiting room. Once selected for a jury panel, they pile into a windowless courtroom and sit next to each other for five hours a day. At lunch they mingle with the hundred or so other jurors in the building. At the conclusion of the trial, they shuffle into a tiny, unventilated retiring room, where they make a decision that could ultimately determine whether somebody spends time in prison. They do so in filthy court conditions in which the lack of hot water, soap and paper towels is widespread; where broken hand dryers, leaking toilets, burst pipes and crumbling roofs and walls are par for the course. These are conditions that, in the good times, we in the courts simply accept as a permanent feature of a chronically underfunded justice system \u2013 but which in the current climate present a patently alarming proposition. Criminal courts are a petri dish. Scores of defendants are piled into waiting areas. Most travel by public transport; some travel in \u201csweatbox\u201d security vans from our infested, overcrowded, virus-ridden prisons. Defendants and their families mix with their barristers, who mix with court staff, who mix with witnesses, judges and jurors, who mix with other witnesses, judges and jurors. Courtrooms vary in size and style \u2013 in some of our more antique Victorian courts, jurors are squeezed on to hard wooden benches without an inch between them, let alone the two metres recommended by the government to ensure social distancing during the coronavirus crisis. In the fairly typical court I was in last week, the defendants, barristers, clerk, usher, witness box and jury box were all within two metres of each other. It is telling that in his announcement yesterday, despite the chipper assurances by Her Majesty\u2019s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service that it was \u201cputting extra effort into court [and] tribunal cleaning\u201d, the lord chief justice specifically cited the need for \u201cbasic hygiene arrangements\u201d in the courts. By insisting that the shortest trials go ahead, the government has ensured the highest possible turnover of strangers coming into contact with each other. Over the past few days I have been flooded with messages from terrified jurors, witnesses and court staff aghast that, at a time when the government is frantically urging social distancing because \u201cinfections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together\u201d, they are being required by law to expose themselves to such conditions. In a closing speech last week, one of my colleagues thanked the jury for their dedication. One of the jurors burst into tears. This situation has been appallingly unfair to all concerned. How on earth can jurors be expected to concentrate on their task? How can any defendant or victim of crime have faith that the 12 people trying their case are paying full attention to the nuances of the evidence, when the jury are burdened with the knowledge that, as a direct result of their service, they, or someone they love, could die? And anyway, contrary to MoJ dictums, the courts have not been \u201coperating normally\u201d. Judges are self-isolating; defendants, jurors and witnesses are staying at home as they break out with symptoms; and trials are collapsing all over the country. The Witness Service, the organisation responsible for looking after witnesses at court, has withdrawn its volunteers. Many crown court judges have made no secret of their disdain for what the MoJ would wish to term a \u201cstrategy\u201d, but which more closely resembles a tribute act to Monty Python\u2019s Black Knight, chirpily dismissing each collapsed trial as a mere flesh wound. The government line seems to have been that \u201cjustice is not optional\u201d. A sweet homily, betrayed only by the evidence of the past decade, in which victims, defendants and witnesses have found their cases mishandled or delayed for years due to enormous cuts to the budgets of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and legal aid. Justice has been optional whenever financially or politically convenient. One real reason for the intransigence appears to be Buckland\u2019s fear of becoming known as \u201cthe lord chancellor who closed the courts\u201d, a disfiguring blemish on the CV in this tough-on-crime government. But there is also a secondary, practical concern: because of government cuts, including cutting the number of sitting days, we have a backlog of more than 30,000 crown court trials and are currently trying cases for offences said to have occurred two or more years ago. The government knows that a standard two-year delay could quickly become three. What this crisis therefore presents, should the government choose to accept it, is an opportunity. The lord chief justice\u2019s hint at a swift resumption of trials \u201cwhere specific safety arrangements have been put in place\u201d is beyond optimistic. All jury trials listed in the next 12 weeks should be immediately pulled from the court list. Shorter, urgent hearings can take place by video-link where possible. The courts can be deep-cleaned from top to bottom, and their facilities and working practices fully reviewed so that they meet 21st-century standards of hygiene, health and safety. In the autumn, when it may be safer to resume, we can do so with the adjourned cases, only with the financial firehose turned on. Instead of running at half-capacity, every crown court should run at maximum.The Treasury\u2019s largesse must be extended to the justice system so that we don\u2019t endure the farce of perfectly usable courtrooms sitting locked and empty due to \u201clack of sitting days\u201d while judges get paid to stay at home. The backlog, both Covid-caused and historical, can be blasted away. The end result \u2013 clean and safe court buildings, trying cases promptly and without agonising delays \u2013 could be one positive to emerge from these troubling times. \u2022 The writer is a junior barrister who writes anonymously about the English and Welsh legal system, and is the author of The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It\u2019s Broken",

But is the crisis witnessed in Italy about to play out in the UK? And when are lockdowns and other interventions likely to start to make a difference? Though there are some similarities \u2013 the picture is complex Number of victims The death toll in Britain is roughly two weeks behind that of Italy, according to researchers who have analysed the data. In week 10 of this year, ending 6 March, Italy announced 176 new Covid-19 deaths, comparable to the 166 deaths the UK reported in week 12. If the spread of the pandemic in the UK tracks Italy\u2019s closely, the domestic death toll could soon rise sharply. Italian authorities recorded 1,066 new Covid-19 deaths in week 11, the equivalent of this week in the UK\u2019s outbreak. \u201cIt looks as though we are two weeks behind Italy in number of Covid-19 deaths,\u201d said Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the MRC\u2019s Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University. \u201cBut all this means is that we have comparable population sizes and had a comparable number of deaths in week 12 as Italy had in week 10.

The same analysis hints that Italy may be approaching a peak in its epidemic, but the answer will only be clear if the country continues to report falling numbers of new deaths over the coming days and weeks. The UK\u2019s peak may not be so severe if the UK\u2019s response to the outbreak has been effective, Spiegelhalter said, but the answer to that is not yet clear. Compared with Britain, Italy had less time to prepare, the virus may have been circulating more widely before it was detected, and the country has more older people who are more tightly connected to family and friends. However, comparisons present problems, as it\u2019s not possible to truly compare like-with-like. One factor that will have a substantial impact on deaths is the capacity for hospitals to care for the most seriously ill patients, and this differs markedly from country to country. \u201cWhen you hit the capacity of intensive care beds then you might get an additional shift up which could reset the rate of increase thereafter,\u201d said Bird.

      "bodyText": "A push by power baron Trevor St Baker to access a Morrison government climate policy initiative to pay for an upgrade at a 42-year-old coal power plant has been rejected after a review found it should not qualify. As reported by Guardian Australia, the Vales Point coal plant in New South Wales was registered with the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, the \u201cdirect action\u201d policy introduced by Tony Abbott and extended by Scott Morrison, in August 2018. Its owners, Sunset Power International trading as Delta Electricity, wanted to bid for taxpayers\u2019 support to help pay for a $14m project to replace turbine blades. The proposal stalled when the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company had not provided enough information. It ruled the upgrade would have needed to cut the plant\u2019s emissions intensity \u2013 how much it emits per unit of electricity generated \u2013 below the grid average. A consultant working on behalf of Delta lobbied the government for the rules to be changed, arguing the guidelines for the fund said coal power could be eligible. Documents released last April suggest St Baker, the company\u2019s part-owner, was denied an \u201curgent meeting\u201d on the issue, but the then environment minister, Melissa Price, requested a review of how the policy could be used. A scheduled review by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee was already under way at the time. The resulting report, posted online earlier this month, backs the existing rules enforced by the regulator. The decision was welcomed by activists and analysts who argue coal plants, which emit substantial greenhouse gases, should not receive climate funding. But they noted Vales Point was still also in line to receive an $11m federal grant, according to a document released in February, before coronavirus delayed the government\u2019s budget plans. Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the committee\u2019s decision showed the value of \u201ctruly independent entities\u201d that served the public on climate change. \u201cLobbying by coal executives has put much pressure on the government to allow greater access to climate funding for the coal industry,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cFortunately, the independent review committee has made the right choice in maintaining the legal checks and balances that ensure the [fund] is not rorted.\u201d Suzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said it was unbelievable that an environment minister had asked officials to consider ways climate funding could be given to old coal plants. \u201cFortunately, common sense prevailed in this instance,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic money should not be given to millionaires to prop up their ailing toxic investments.\u201d Delta Electricity\u2019s chief executive, Greg Everett, declined to comment on Monday as the company was focused on its response to coronavirus. Freedom-of-information documents last year showed the company\u2019s consultant, John Short, had suggested to the government it would consider appealing to the administrative appeals tribunal if the regulator\u2019s decision was not overturned. Delta wanted to bid into the emissions reduction fund to help replace components on two units commissioned in 1978. It was estimated the upgrade would have cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over a decade, about a 1.3% reduction below what Vales Point would otherwise expect to emit. The company bought the plant from the NSW government for just $1m in 2015. It was re-valued at $730m two years later. Documents submitted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show Sunset Power International\u2019s shareholders received dividends of nearly $72m over the past two financial years. St Baker has flagged extending Vales Point\u2019s operation beyond its expected closure date of 2029 to 2049. The company said a decision on prolonging the plant\u2019s life was not contingent on public funding. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers\u2019 support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The next auction is scheduled for this week. Asked for a response to the committee assessment, a spokesman for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s objective is to bring forward large volumes of genuine, low cost abatement from across the economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Advice on locking down coronavirus hotspots, new financial assistance measures for renters and further shutdowns of non-essential services will be considered by the national cabinet of state and federal leaders on Tuesday. As the country faces the prospect of more business closures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, the meeting will also look at keeping business supply chains in place, and measures to ensure workforce continuity in critical industries. With thousands of Australians still scrambling to return home, it is also understood some members of the cabinet have also flagged putting in place a deadline for overseas and interstate travellers to return to their home state before beginning a period of self-isolation. Tuesday\u2019s meeting comes after prime minister, Scott Morrison, told Australians on Monday to brace for \u201cthe most difficult year of our lives\u201d and as parliament was set to pass legislation to allow $189bn in economic support to begin flowing into the economy. On Monday, MPs approved a new sitting schedule, with parliament set to resume on 11 August, although some expect it may not sit again until October. The government set aside another $40bn in an annual discretionary fund that could be used for purchasing emergency medical supplies and another wave of stimulus. Legislation for the government packages announced so far passed the Senate on Monday night, after the Coalition agreed to Labor and Greens\u2019 calls to extend the $550 fortnightly coronavirus supplement to students on Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy recipients, which could see 250,000 more people receive extra payments. The last meeting of state and territory leaders, held on Sunday, was overshadowed by inconsistency and confusion among the states on the issue of school closures, and the move to shut down non-essential services. On Sunday afternoon, Victoria and New South Wales both flagged they would be shutting down all non-essential services and schools, prompting a flurry of speculation that this would soon be the national position. However, the meeting ultimately agreed to a limited first stage of shutdowns, with places of social gathering such as pubs, clubs, bars, cafes and religious institutions all closing across the country on Monday. The national cabinet also agreed to keep schools open, despite states all approaching the issue differently ahead of the Easter break. Asked why state announcements were made in advance of national cabinet on Sunday, the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, told reporters in Canberra the national cabinet had now agreed that \u201cone of the things that needs to happen because of that confusion, we need to meet more frequently\u201d. He said some of the confusion was because the meeting had originally been scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cOne of the challenges that we are grappling with is that the situation in different parts of the country, in terms of community transmission for example, is different. And so some jurisdictions are under more immediate pressure to respond more quickly,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd so the national cabinet has to account for that. So we\u2019ve had that discussion, we all recognise in light of what happened late last night, in terms of a sense of confused messaging, that we can and should do better, and we will.\u201d Asked if Victoria and NSW made announcements to pressure national cabinet, Barr declined to offer a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the process, but reiterated the ACT would work through the national cabinet and seek to maintain consistency with NSW. Guardian Australia understands that following Sunday afternoon\u2019s confusion, the cabinet meeting was presented with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to limit the shutdown to places of social mingling as an initial move which was unanimously agreed to. The advice on schools was unchanged. However, the state leaders were told that the social distancing measures could soon be upgraded, with further restrictions to be considered at each meeting. While Morrison said on Sunday that closures would be reviewed monthly, there was an expectation that discussion about the next stage of shutdowns could take place as soon as Tuesday given how quickly the advice is being reviewed. A \u201cstage two\u201d list of non-essential businesses has already been prepared by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee in anticipation. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that further restrictions would be announced, and insisted there was no friction in Sunday\u2019s meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a first step,\u201d he said. Andrews also said that Australians should not gather internally for social occasions with pubs now closed, in a statement that seemed at odds with Morrison\u2019s position on the existing social distancing measures. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you can have your mates over home and get on the beers, it is not appropriate,\u201d Andrews said. Morrison, however, said that non-essential indoor gatherings should be limited to less than one person per four square metres. \u201cIt will be absolutely vital that every Australian respects and follows the healthy social distancing measures that all Australian governments have implemented in order to flatten this curve and save lives.\u201d The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said on Monday that while Australia still had a very low death rate, the number of cases was mounting, and the country needed to \u201cstop and slow and control community transmission\u201d. Murphy said the issue of schools closures was a \u201cvery vexed issue\u201d and said that while the current assessment of the balance of risks was that it was better to keep schools open, this may change. He also issued a firm warning on social distancing, warning that people, particularly young people, should not respond in a \u201ccavalier\u201d manner. \u201cYour transmission and your spread of the virus could lead to a serious and even fatal disease in one of your elderly relatives or friends.\u201d",

But just what work is there to look for right now? Not only are businesses not hiring, many are being forced to not operate. Around 10% of job vacancies each month are for retail trade and 7% are for accommodation and food services, and another 1.5% for arts and recreation. None of these industries is hiring \u2013 other than a few supermarkets looking for some extra staff to help pack shelves.</p> <p>Currently the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/20/centrelink-continues-to-chase-welfare-clients-for-robodebts-despite-coronavirus\">kept some mutual obligations in place</a>, but it is pretty obvious things have changed and changed drastically. Actively looking for work? Nope. Unemployed? Most definitely.</p> <p>The scale has been broken, and so too have the definitions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia<br></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus is about to destroy the scale of economic data. What we was considered a \u201cbad case\u201d scenario or even indicative of times requiring stimulus no longer even computes. So quickly are things turning we almost need a new language to explain it. One of the most common aphorisms among those dealing with data is that \u201cthe trend is your friend\u201d. It is a nice way to note that generally when you see data \u2013 such as the unemployment rate \u2013 jumping around, the trend, which is essentially an averaged representation of the data, helps you see through the noise. But occasionally something happens that breaks the trend \u2013 such as the boost in retail spending that occurred during the GFC as a result of the stimulus payments: The spending was so out of sync with previous levels the trend no longer made sense and the Bureau of Statistics even stopped calculating the trend rate for nine months until normalcy returned. So that was what happened to some data during the GFC. But that is not what we are about to experience. We are about to see not the trend broken, but the scale. Let us turn to the US to see what this will look like. In states such as California there has been a full lockdown \u2013 only essential services open, and everyone has been told to stay inside unless you need to access those services. Schools are closed, shops and places of business are shut. As a result there has been a wave of people claiming unemployment insurance this week. And by wave, I mean a tsunami. Over the past three months, an average of 49,000 people in California applied for the first time for unemployment insurance (known as \u201cinitial claims\u201d, as opposed to ongoing ones by people already unemployed). During the GFC, in the last week of January 2009, 95,000 new people applied; a year later, in the second week of January 2010, 115,462 applied \u2013 so more than double what you would expect during good times. Based on the numbers already announced, former senior economist for labor at the US President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Aaron Sojourner, has estimated in the past week 639,200 people in California will make an initial claim for unemployment insurance: That is breaking the scale. And California is not an exception. Sojourner estimates Pennsylvania will see 353,644 initial unemployment claims this week, some 478% higher than the previous record of 61,181 claims made in the second week of January in 2010, and 2,792% higher than the previous week: Sojourner estimates this will translate to around 3.3 million Americans making an initial claim for unemployment insurance this week \u2013 a number so beyond anything recorded by the US department of labor going back to 1967 that it looks like someone slipped while drawing the graph and left a big vertical line by mistake: Sojourner estimates that, given there were already 5.8 million unemployed in the US, this would take the US unemployment rate from 3.5% to 5.5% in one week. Given the news on Monday of queues around the block at Australian Centrelink offices and the MyGov website crashing due to a massive spike in people attempting to use it (up from 6,000 to 55,000) we can likely expect to see similar numbers here. It is tough to estimate exactly how bad it will be here, but if our total number of unemployed rose by the same amount as is expected in the US in just this week would see unemployment for this month rise to nearly 8%: Now that is unlikely because we have not yet seen the same level of closures. But not only is it a sign of what is coming, it also highlights the absurdity of the actual term. To be unemployed is to be \u201cactively looking for work\u201d. But just what work is there to look for right now? Not only are businesses not hiring, many are being forced to not operate. Around 10% of job vacancies each month are for retail trade and 7% are for accommodation and food services, and another 1.5% for arts and recreation. None of these industries is hiring \u2013 other than a few supermarkets looking for some extra staff to help pack shelves. Currently the government has kept some mutual obligations in place, but it is pretty obvious things have changed and changed drastically. Actively looking for work? Nope. Unemployed? Most definitely. The scale has been broken, and so too have the definitions. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The chief executive of Catholic Schools NSW, Dallas McInerney, wrote to the NSW government on Tuesday seeking help, after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced schools would stay open \u2013 although parents are encouraged to keep their children home where they can. Despite the national cabinet process aiming to maintain a consistent response to Covid-19 across Australian jurisdictions, the states and territories now have a patchwork of responses on education. Victoria has announced it will bring forward school holidays and close from Tuesday, the Australian Capital Territory is attempting to move to online learning like NSW, and schools in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia are remaining open, with the term break still three weeks away in Western Australia. All states agreed that parents can choose to keep their children home, with absences increasing to up to 40% of students in some jurisdictions. In the Catholic Schools NSW letter, seen by Guardian Australia, McInerney promised to \u201cstay open, as directed\u201d but sought help to deliver the \u201calternative mode of schooling for NSW\u201d requested by Berejiklian. \u201cOver the coming months, Catholic schools will seek to make out\u2010of\u2010school and online learning available to students, however, I would like to strike a note of caution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe capacity of schools, families and communities to make any such transition is not consistent across NSW, and expectations must be realistic. \u201cThe incidence of a \u2018digital divide\u2019 is evident, geographically and socially. \u201cTo mitigate against these equity issues, I urgently seek confirmation that all Catholic schools will have full access to the government\u2019s infrastructure and resources for online learning.\u201d The Association of Independent Schools chief executive, Geoff Newcombe, said the decision to ask parents to keep children at home \u201creflects the fact that an increasing number of parents are already doing this\u201d. \u201cIt makes sense therefore to advise all parents to keep their children at home and enable schools to teach students using a single \u2018learning from home\u2019 model,\u201d he said. \u201cAll schools \u2013 including independent schools \u2013 will remain open and adequately staffed to ensure that learning can continue for children of essential services workers, children in need, and children of parents with no option other than to send their children to school.\u201d The NSW government has been preparing schools for a shift to online learning since early in March, with the state\u2019s education minister, Sarah Mitchell, saying teachers had been directed to prepare online lessons for their classes.

You might look older, more exhausted or simply less put together than you thought \u2013 and then there\u2019s the fact that, for the other people in the meeting, your face is taking up the entire screen.</p> <p>We asked three beauty experts, who are all very familiar with the potential ravages of digital communication, how to put your best face forward on camera.</p> <h2>Set the scene</h2> <p>Where you put your laptop or phone makes more difference to how you\u2019ll look on camera than what you\u2019re wearing or how you\u2019ve done your makeup.</p> <p>Paula Joye, the founder and editor of lifestyle website The Joye, says we need to \u201cthink a lot more Helmut Newton about this\u201d. She suggests: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to light yourself evenly. Try and put your computer near a window. Natural light\u2019s your friend.\u201d</p> <p>How you position your camera matters too. \u201cIt amuses me no end when you see people beam in like the Moon in the Faraway Tree,\u201d says Joye. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put your face on the screen like a dinner plate.\u201d It may be called a laptop, but putting your computer on your lap for a video call is a quick way to make yourself look much worse than usual.</p> <p>Instead, she suggests positioning your camera at or just above eye level, and moving yourself slightly further away from it. Make sure your background is clean too, \u201cnobody wants to see last night\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p> <h2>Think like a newsreader</h2> <p> Joye says that for meetings in the cloud, \u201call the basics of dress and presentation still apply.

      "bodyText": "Looking at your face through the unforgiving green eye of a webcam can be confronting. You might look older, more exhausted or simply less put together than you thought \u2013 and then there\u2019s the fact that, for the other people in the meeting, your face is taking up the entire screen. We asked three beauty experts, who are all very familiar with the potential ravages of digital communication, how to put your best face forward on camera. Set the scene Where you put your laptop or phone makes more difference to how you\u2019ll look on camera than what you\u2019re wearing or how you\u2019ve done your makeup. Paula Joye, the founder and editor of lifestyle website The Joye, says we need to \u201cthink a lot more Helmut Newton about this\u201d. She suggests: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to light yourself evenly. Try and put your computer near a window. Natural light\u2019s your friend.\u201d How you position your camera matters too. \u201cIt amuses me no end when you see people beam in like the Moon in the Faraway Tree,\u201d says Joye. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put your face on the screen like a dinner plate.\u201d It may be called a laptop, but putting your computer on your lap for a video call is a quick way to make yourself look much worse than usual. Instead, she suggests positioning your camera at or just above eye level, and moving yourself slightly further away from it. Make sure your background is clean too, \u201cnobody wants to see last night\u2019s dinner.\u201d Think like a newsreader Joye says that for meetings in the cloud, \u201call the basics of dress and presentation still apply. When you\u2019re still doing external meetings \u2026 managing [client] expectations that the sky isn\u2019t falling \u2026 you probably want to be dressed as though you were seeing them in person.\u201d However, she warns that spots, stripes and other patterned tops will not show up well on camera. \u201cThink about newsreader style \u2026 A neutral colour is really good.

The 2020 season is officially over after a tumultuous and confusing fortnight. Late on Sunday afternoon the AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, announced that the season would conclude immediately and that no premiership would be awarded. McLachlan cited the conference system and the unfinished finals series as influences on the decision not to award a premiership. Instead, the 2020 season will come with an asterisk. Season not completed. Premiership not awarded. It is the latest in a string of blows for the competition and the league as the impact of the Covid-19 crisis deepens. In round six the AFL closed all AFLW games to the public. Matches were played in front of empty grandstands. The hill at Whitten Oval was bare. The grassy knoll at Moorabbin, which had been heaving with people in round one, only a few short weeks earlier, was deserted. Only days after that unsettling round wrapped up, confusion gripped the clubs as the AFL announced that the AFLW season would be cut short with the final two home-and-away rounds abandoned in favour of starting the finals series early. At the Holden Centre, as the Magpies watched this unfold, they were informed, incorrectly, that only the top two teams would go through to the finals, meaning their season was over.

When it was finally confirmed late on Wednesday night that the top four teams of each conference would go through to the finals \u2013 an increase from the original plans for the season of the top three teams from each conference \u2013 the lasting feeling was of an organisation struggling to keep up with what is and continues to be an unprecedented situation. That feeling never really went away. McLachlan said on Wednesday night that the league was operating on \u201cclear instructions\u201d from the government that \u201call parts of society need to keep moving forward and we simply cannot stand still\u201d and so the show would roll on, just in a very different outfit. It seemed an incredible decision given the global situation and the choices made by other major sporting organisations to postpone or cancel their seasons. Advice from health professionals pushed for social distancing. How exactly do you do that on a footy field? The AFL\u2019s decision on Sunday came not long after the Victorian state government announced it would implement a shutdown of all non-essential activity across the state.

After the Guardian revealed last week that a number of companies were seeking to supply a rapid testing kit for the virus into the Australian market, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has granted four approvals to companies to sell the product locally. The approvals allow the first \u201cpoint of care\u201d Covid-19 screening products to be supplied in Australia, and could allow doctors to significantly increase the number of people able to be tested for the virus.

      "body": "<p>A sold-out screening of a new blockbuster, filled with hundreds of punters \u2013 it\u2019s a scene that might feature in a public health information message about coronavirus. No surprise, then, that cinemas were among the first public places to shut down during the outbreak. Yet cinema provides exactly the kind of escapism the public demands at times like these. Here are a few ways Hollywood is keeping the communal medium of film-watching alive during a time of self-isolation.</p> <h2>Mainstream streaming</h2> <p>Releasing new films directly to streaming platforms is hardly a new idea. Longstanding outlets such as Curzon Home Cinema \u2013 where arthouse distributor Curzon Artificial Eye has made many of its films available for streaming parallel to their theatrical releases \u2013 now find themselves better equipped for this unprecedented cinema blackout than many bigger studios. (Last Friday\u2019s diminished schedule left Curzon with the week\u2019s biggest new release in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/28/the-truth-review-catherine-deneuves-grand-diva-dominates-mixed-venice-opener\">Hirokazu Kore-eda</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/28/the-truth-review-catherine-deneuves-grand-diva-dominates-mixed-venice-opener\">\u2019s wily French oddity The Truth</a> \u2013 the unlikeliest of triumphs over the mainstream.)</p> <p>But the big guns are latching on. Having seen the cinema runs of their films cut short by the pandemic, Universal took the unprecedented step of releasing the jolly Jane Austen adaptation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/emma-review-jane-austen-anya-taylor-joy\">Emma</a>, the schlocky libs-versus-Trumpers horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/15/the-hunt-horror-satire-review\">The Hunt</a> and Leigh Whannell\u2019s acclaimed spin on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/29/the-invisible-man-film-review\">The Invisible Man</a> to streaming platforms months ahead of schedule, smashing a hitherto rigid window between theatrical and home distribution that might be hard to reinstate.</p> <p>The advantage is that word of mouth about films can keep travelling and audiences can keep discovering the films. Attempting to martial a collective viewing atmosphere, meanwhile, Whannell held a live group watch of The Invisible Man via Twitter, answering viewers\u2019 questions about the film and film-making process as they went \u2013 a virtual Q&amp;A that made it feel less like the film was streaming into a void.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f078c169a02a76ac8ddcf6393ba9e12ac3e1e40e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f078c169a02a76ac8ddcf6393ba9e12ac3e1e40e/869_55_5053_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of the box \u2026 The Hunt is appearing on streaming platforms months ahead of schedule.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the box \u2026 The Hunt is appearing on streaming platforms months ahead of schedule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The rise of the Netflix Party</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/19/netflix-party-could-this-group-watching-tech-gimmick-be-a-lifesaver\">Netflix Party: could this group-watching tech gimmick be a lifesaver?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Film-makers aren\u2019t the only ones making streaming a less solitary experience: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/19/netflix-party-could-this-group-watching-tech-gimmick-be-a-lifesaver\">Netflix Party</a> is now the hottest thing in appropriately distanced socialising. Like a Skype chat or Google Hangout, Netflix Party \u2013 an extension of the streaming service \u2013 enables friends to log into the same showing of any film on Netflix, share live chat and commentary throughout. This, admittedly, is not an option for those cinema-goers who frown on any chatter or phone use while a film is playing \u2013 but then this is Netflix, not a Robert Bresson retrospective at the BFI. Load up Burlesque or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/09/how-we-made-dirty-dancing-ive-had-the-time-of-my-life\">Dirty Dancing</a>, open a bottle of wine, and imagine your mates are laughing along with you on the couch instead of via an app. It may not be ideal, but it approximates some sense of cinema\u2019s togetherness.</p> <h2>Attend a film festival \u2026 in your living room</h2> <p>Beginning with South by Southwest and extending, well, who knows how far into the future, coronavirus has played havoc with the ever-crammed film festival season, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-culture-arts-films-gigs-festivals-cancellations\">one fest after another postponing or calling things off altogether</a>. (Organisers of Cannes currently insist it will go ahead a month later than usual, in late June, but nobody\u2019s banking on it.) Many of the big all-star events will bide their time until they can roll out the real red carpet, but many smaller festivals who have cancelled events are opting to provide digital editions, so that new films that would otherwise have been premiered to live audiences can be discovered on streaming platforms.

      "bodyText": "A sold-out screening of a new blockbuster, filled with hundreds of punters \u2013 it\u2019s a scene that might feature in a public health information message about coronavirus. No surprise, then, that cinemas were among the first public places to shut down during the outbreak. Yet cinema provides exactly the kind of escapism the public demands at times like these. Here are a few ways Hollywood is keeping the communal medium of film-watching alive during a time of self-isolation. Mainstream streaming Releasing new films directly to streaming platforms is hardly a new idea. Longstanding outlets such as Curzon Home Cinema \u2013 where arthouse distributor Curzon Artificial Eye has made many of its films available for streaming parallel to their theatrical releases \u2013 now find themselves better equipped for this unprecedented cinema blackout than many bigger studios. (Last Friday\u2019s diminished schedule left Curzon with the week\u2019s biggest new release in Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s wily French oddity The Truth \u2013 the unlikeliest of triumphs over the mainstream.) But the big guns are latching on. Having seen the cinema runs of their films cut short by the pandemic, Universal took the unprecedented step of releasing the jolly Jane Austen adaptation Emma, the schlocky libs-versus-Trumpers horror The Hunt and Leigh Whannell\u2019s acclaimed spin on The Invisible Man to streaming platforms months ahead of schedule, smashing a hitherto rigid window between theatrical and home distribution that might be hard to reinstate. The advantage is that word of mouth about films can keep travelling and audiences can keep discovering the films. Attempting to martial a collective viewing atmosphere, meanwhile, Whannell held a live group watch of The Invisible Man via Twitter, answering viewers\u2019 questions about the film and film-making process as they went \u2013 a virtual Q&amp;A that made it feel less like the film was streaming into a void. The rise of the Netflix Party Film-makers aren\u2019t the only ones making streaming a less solitary experience: Netflix Party is now the hottest thing in appropriately distanced socialising. Like a Skype chat or Google Hangout, Netflix Party \u2013 an extension of the streaming service \u2013 enables friends to log into the same showing of any film on Netflix, share live chat and commentary throughout. This, admittedly, is not an option for those cinema-goers who frown on any chatter or phone use while a film is playing \u2013 but then this is Netflix, not a Robert Bresson retrospective at the BFI. Load up Burlesque or Dirty Dancing, open a bottle of wine, and imagine your mates are laughing along with you on the couch instead of via an app. It may not be ideal, but it approximates some sense of cinema\u2019s togetherness. Attend a film festival \u2026 in your living room Beginning with South by Southwest and extending, well, who knows how far into the future, coronavirus has played havoc with the ever-crammed film festival season, with one fest after another postponing or calling things off altogether. (Organisers of Cannes currently insist it will go ahead a month later than usual, in late June, but nobody\u2019s banking on it.) Many of the big all-star events will bide their time until they can roll out the real red carpet, but many smaller festivals who have cancelled events are opting to provide digital editions, so that new films that would otherwise have been premiered to live audiences can be discovered on streaming platforms. Following its cancellation, the BFI\u2019s annual LGBTQ+ film festival Flare is offering Flare at Home, with highlights from this year\u2019s programme (alongside a selection of past queer classics) available via the BFI Player streaming service for what would have been the duration of the festival. Others are expected to take a similar tack, ensuring new films find an appreciative audience \u2013 from across the country, to boot. This may become a new normal. The drive-in makes a comeback \u2013 maybe If quarantine, social distancing and lockdown rules are relaxed, could the humble drive-in cinema have a moment? The concept may seem quaint even to older millennials who associate it with the Grease era, but the tradition of going to see a film in your car, in a suitably raked parking lot with sound through your own audio system, could be just the right compromise for film lovers who want to go out and self-isolate at the same time. Drive-ins are few and far between in the UK \u2013 though plans have been made to launch one in Manchester this week \u2013 but many of America\u2019s 300-plus drive-ins have reported a surge in business. Others, however, have dutifully shut down like their indoor cinema brethren. This isn\u2019t a sure solution just yet, but keep it in mind. Perhaps, in future times of lesser lockdown, outdoor screenings may represent the most viable way of going out to the movies \u2013 be it in a car or in a park.

Time then for the Fed to act like the grownup in the room by pledging to provide unlimited amounts of money to the financial system through its QE programme \u2013 under which the central bank buys government bonds and other assets for cash. The Fed announced a $700bn package of asset purchases only eight days ago but was working its through that sum extremely quickly to try to calm down markets bordering on the dysfunctional. As a result, it has gone much further than it did during the financial crisis of 2008 by making QE open-ended.

Last week queues of up to 60km (37 miles) formed at the Polish/German border on Wednesday after Poland announced that it was shutting to foreigners. Although the closure was supposed to apply solely to people, cargo experienced a knock-on effect, with some trucks reportedly taking as long as 18 hours to get through border controls. More queues formed at the Bulgarian/Turkish border. Sabine Fisher of German animal welfare group Animal Angels said: \u201cOne driver told us that it had taken him three hours to travel 300 metres.

      "body": "<p>To stop the spread of the coronavirus, the UK prime minister has urged people to steer clear of each other when they leave their homes.</p> \n<p>So what is the new outdoor etiquette?</p> \n<p>From jogging in the park, to queuing in supermarkets, experts say Britons have to ditch their usual reserve \u2013 and get used to telling people to \u201cmove away\u201d.<br></p> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>supermarket queue</strong></h2> \n<p>Social distancing means leaving 2 metres space between people. That is just under 6ft 7in \u2013 a little less than the height of the former England striker Peter Crouch, or roughly the length of two standard supermarket trolleys.</p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/1240443980338188288\">supermarkets are helping shoppers by placing sticky-backed markers on the floor</a> 2 metres apart.</p> \n<p> \u201cIf someone comes up behind, it\u2019s tricky. It may create a slightly tense situation,\u201d said <a href=\"https://medium.com/@michael.g.head\">Dr Michael Head</a>, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> \u201cWe should be emboldened and empowered to be able to say to them: \u2018Please just take a step back.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not used to doing it. We are quite reserved as a nation. Maybe in other countries it might be easier.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a>, said retailers were employing measures to help shoppers keep their distance. \u201cThese include controlling the flow of customers into stores, placing floor distance guides for those queuing inside stores, and communicating with customers to remind them of the importance of social distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, the focus for staff remains ensuring customers have access to goods on shelves; customers must play their part in ensuring responsible and safe shopping by keeping 2 metres apart wherever possible \u2013 both inside stores and if queuing outside \u2013 and everyone should feel confident in asking fellow customers to do the same.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Jogging</strong></h2> \n<p> In the UK, jogging and running are among few outdoor activities still available. For some, however, the thought of encountering a heavily perspiring runner who is exhaling heavily as they overtake at close quarters on a narrow path may cause alarm.</p> \n<p>Runners should keep their distance too, though the risk of passing on the virus is small.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere will be a risk there, but it will be a very small risk,\u201d said Head. \u201cYou are running up behind someone and past them. The time you will be close to them will be minimal.

      "bodyText": "To stop the spread of the coronavirus, the UK prime minister has urged people to steer clear of each other when they leave their homes. So what is the new outdoor etiquette? From jogging in the park, to queuing in supermarkets, experts say Britons have to ditch their usual reserve \u2013 and get used to telling people to \u201cmove away\u201d. The supermarket queue Social distancing means leaving 2 metres space between people. That is just under 6ft 7in \u2013 a little less than the height of the former England striker Peter Crouch, or roughly the length of two standard supermarket trolleys. Some supermarkets are helping shoppers by placing sticky-backed markers on the floor 2 metres apart. \u201cIf someone comes up behind, it\u2019s tricky. It may create a slightly tense situation,\u201d said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. \u201cWe should be emboldened and empowered to be able to say to them: \u2018Please just take a step back.\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re not used to doing it. We are quite reserved as a nation. Maybe in other countries it might be easier.\u201d Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were employing measures to help shoppers keep their distance. \u201cThese include controlling the flow of customers into stores, placing floor distance guides for those queuing inside stores, and communicating with customers to remind them of the importance of social distancing. \u201cHowever, the focus for staff remains ensuring customers have access to goods on shelves; customers must play their part in ensuring responsible and safe shopping by keeping 2 metres apart wherever possible \u2013 both inside stores and if queuing outside \u2013 and everyone should feel confident in asking fellow customers to do the same.\u201d Jogging In the UK, jogging and running are among few outdoor activities still available. For some, however, the thought of encountering a heavily perspiring runner who is exhaling heavily as they overtake at close quarters on a narrow path may cause alarm. Runners should keep their distance too, though the risk of passing on the virus is small. \u201cThere will be a risk there, but it will be a very small risk,\u201d said Head. \u201cYou are running up behind someone and past them. The time you will be close to them will be minimal. So the risk of transmission at that precise point will be very, very tiny. \u201cThe definition of a contact thus far is within 2 metres for 15 minutes. So if you are on public transport, or stuck in a restaurant with someone, that has the potential to be a contact there. If you are running past someone for a few seconds, in an outdoor space as well, the risk of transmission at that point is tiny.\u201d Runners, however, are known to spit \u2013 and that poses a different problem.

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is published after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK on Sunday night/Monday morning. Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode two.<br><br></em>\u201cIt\u2019s alright darling, none of it matters\u201d, says Maeve as she puts a pistol to her head, \u201cbecause none of it is real.\u201d And ain\u2019t that the truth.</p> <p>At the point of pulling the trigger Maeve is Isabella, a Italian partisan during the second world war. She\u2019s also a host in Warworld, a park which simulates the conflict with a cast of robots. For the partisans, there\u2019s no escaping the Nazis ,and for the android hosts there\u2019s no escaping the park. Unless you\u2019re Maeve, that is, in which case you know the whole World War thing is a lie, that you\u2019re in a park, and that if you deactivate yourself by means of a bullet to the cerebral cortex you get to go into the back office and start again.</p> <p>In the first two seasons of Westworld, Maeve was the closest thing we had to a hero. A robot who had become sentient, unlike most of her peers experiencing a similar revelation she chose not to slaughter humans as a result. Instead, driven by memories of a lost daughter, she decided to save her fellow hosts by leading them to a new homeland beyond the parks. In the finale of season two she achieved her goals, but appeared to have sacrificed herself in the process, dying in a final battle.</p> <p>You can\u2019t keep a good droid down though, so here we are back in Maeve\u2019s company again. After she pulls the trigger in Warworld, we follow her deep down below where, as luck would have it, she meets Lee Sizemore. Sizemore was Westworld\u2019s Head of Narrative, the guy who wrote the storylines for the park and a man who, we were led to believe, had also been killed in the massacre that took out Maeve. But here he is, alive and well, albeit with a bit of a limp. More strikingly, the perma-cynic has turned cheery and has a crush on Maeve.</p> <p>Lee says he\u2019s the one responsible for putting Maeve in Warworld because, secretly, he wanted her to escape and Warworld is closest to the hatch, known as the Forge. The pair of them skedaddle over there when no one\u2019s looking and try to open the hatch. But no sooner have they realised they can\u2019t unlock it than everything gets a bit wavy, Lee develops a st-st-stutter and Maeve comes to the realisation that, nope, this isn\u2019t real neither.</p> <p>Yes we\u2019ve entered Inception levels of unreality (something Westworld creator Jonathan Nolan knows all about). Lee, Maeve surmises, is not a human nor even a host but part of a mammoth simulation that she has been placed into for reasons as yet unclear.</p> <p>After an amusing detour back into the park\u2019s underbelly where Maeve gives the staff a maths challenge (\u2018what is the square root of -1?\u2019 - a question that produces a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit\">notoriously mind-bending</a> answer), and a brief trip to Warworld to confuse everybody there, Maeve manages to make the simulation fall apart through overwork. When that happens she is able to see behind the curtain that\u2019s behind the curtain, and sees a chance to enter the real, real world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17159a6ef52b03072ee88f1847aef863f94f4518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17159a6ef52b03072ee88f1847aef863f94f4518/0_243_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man of mystery ...

Vincent Cassel as Serac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Maeve plotline takes up the majority of this week\u2019s episode and is a typically Westworld-ian combination of high-faluting theory, hefty exposition (why are we here? What does this mean?) and some nice one-liners (\u201cFuck me!\u201d says Lee in shock, \u201cNot likely darling\u201d, replies Maeve the one-time madame).</p> <p>There is another story, though, which is less tortuous and involves Bernard. It also features another character you thought was a human turning out to be otherwise, with the revelation that Westworld\u2019s head of security, Stubbs, was a host all along. While it does make you wonder if there\u2019s any individual who can\u2019t be snappily resurrected as a robot should the circumstances require, Stubbs does at least appear to have come back a bit spunkier, with a little more attitude and a desire for action which, at one point, sees him chase down half a dozen Delos security guards with just one arm and an axe.</p> <p>Bernard has returned to Westworld to look for Maeve. She, as we know, is elsewhere, and so instead Bernard finds Stubbs, having apparently taken his own life (what is it with this show and bullets through the brain?) in the little cottage where WestWorld\u2019s creator, old man Ford, used to do his experiments. Bernard reanimates Stubbs and there\u2019s a funny bit where Stubbs hacks up the bullet that took him out as if it were a ball of phlegm.</p> <p>After that the pair head out into the parks. They don\u2019t visit Warworld, but they do reach \u2018park four\u2019, a cheeky little nod to Game of Thrones, complete with host dragons and a minstrel playing the Westworld theme on a lute. Eventually Bernard gets access to the parks\u2019 computer system, in the hope it might help him find Maeve. Instead he learns that someone has been messing about and accessing the data of previous guests. Bernard assumes that person is big bad Dolores and suggests that he and Stubbs should go and find the guest she seemed most curious about; that bloke called Liam we met last week.</p> <p>So that\u2019s episode two, one dedicated to setting our good guys on a path towards their enemy. The journey culminates in an epilogue in which Maeve awakes in the human world and has her actual, final, in no way revisable situation explained to her by that bloke from La Haine.</p> <p>Vincent Cassel plays Serac, the AI oligarch who was mentioned a lot last week, but never seen. He chooses not to explain to Maeve what that whole simulation thing was all about but does tell her he now needs her in a war to save humanity. From here on in it will be Maeve v Dolores to the death. Or whatever the equivalent is for a robot.</p> <h2>Divergences and anomalies</h2> <ul> <li><p>For future reference, here\u2019s the serial number for Maeve\u2019s control unit \u2013 HC1983012522.</p></li> <li><p>Is it just coincidence that the maintenance robot looks exactly like the ones from Boston Dynamics that everyone laughs at because they can\u2019t walk very well and yet here they\u2019re scarily nimble?

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog is published after Westworld airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK on Sunday night/Monday morning. Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode two. \u201cIt\u2019s alright darling, none of it matters\u201d, says Maeve as she puts a pistol to her head, \u201cbecause none of it is real.\u201d And ain\u2019t that the truth. At the point of pulling the trigger Maeve is Isabella, a Italian partisan during the second world war. She\u2019s also a host in Warworld, a park which simulates the conflict with a cast of robots. For the partisans, there\u2019s no escaping the Nazis ,and for the android hosts there\u2019s no escaping the park. Unless you\u2019re Maeve, that is, in which case you know the whole World War thing is a lie, that you\u2019re in a park, and that if you deactivate yourself by means of a bullet to the cerebral cortex you get to go into the back office and start again. In the first two seasons of Westworld, Maeve was the closest thing we had to a hero. A robot who had become sentient, unlike most of her peers experiencing a similar revelation she chose not to slaughter humans as a result. Instead, driven by memories of a lost daughter, she decided to save her fellow hosts by leading them to a new homeland beyond the parks. In the finale of season two she achieved her goals, but appeared to have sacrificed herself in the process, dying in a final battle. You can\u2019t keep a good droid down though, so here we are back in Maeve\u2019s company again. After she pulls the trigger in Warworld, we follow her deep down below where, as luck would have it, she meets Lee Sizemore. Sizemore was Westworld\u2019s Head of Narrative, the guy who wrote the storylines for the park and a man who, we were led to believe, had also been killed in the massacre that took out Maeve. But here he is, alive and well, albeit with a bit of a limp. More strikingly, the perma-cynic has turned cheery and has a crush on Maeve. Lee says he\u2019s the one responsible for putting Maeve in Warworld because, secretly, he wanted her to escape and Warworld is closest to the hatch, known as the Forge. The pair of them skedaddle over there when no one\u2019s looking and try to open the hatch. But no sooner have they realised they can\u2019t unlock it than everything gets a bit wavy, Lee develops a st-st-stutter and Maeve comes to the realisation that, nope, this isn\u2019t real neither. Yes we\u2019ve entered Inception levels of unreality (something Westworld creator Jonathan Nolan knows all about). Lee, Maeve surmises, is not a human nor even a host but part of a mammoth simulation that she has been placed into for reasons as yet unclear. After an amusing detour back into the park\u2019s underbelly where Maeve gives the staff a maths challenge (\u2018what is the square root of -1?\u2019 - a question that produces a notoriously mind-bending answer), and a brief trip to Warworld to confuse everybody there, Maeve manages to make the simulation fall apart through overwork. When that happens she is able to see behind the curtain that\u2019s behind the curtain, and sees a chance to enter the real, real world. The Maeve plotline takes up the majority of this week\u2019s episode and is a typically Westworld-ian combination of high-faluting theory, hefty exposition (why are we here? What does this mean?) and some nice one-liners (\u201cFuck me!\u201d says Lee in shock, \u201cNot likely darling\u201d, replies Maeve the one-time madame). There is another story, though, which is less tortuous and involves Bernard. It also features another character you thought was a human turning out to be otherwise, with the revelation that Westworld\u2019s head of security, Stubbs, was a host all along. While it does make you wonder if there\u2019s any individual who can\u2019t be snappily resurrected as a robot should the circumstances require, Stubbs does at least appear to have come back a bit spunkier, with a little more attitude and a desire for action which, at one point, sees him chase down half a dozen Delos security guards with just one arm and an axe. Bernard has returned to Westworld to look for Maeve. She, as we know, is elsewhere, and so instead Bernard finds Stubbs, having apparently taken his own life (what is it with this show and bullets through the brain?) in the little cottage where WestWorld\u2019s creator, old man Ford, used to do his experiments. Bernard reanimates Stubbs and there\u2019s a funny bit where Stubbs hacks up the bullet that took him out as if it were a ball of phlegm. After that the pair head out into the parks. They don\u2019t visit Warworld, but they do reach \u2018park four\u2019, a cheeky little nod to Game of Thrones, complete with host dragons and a minstrel playing the Westworld theme on a lute. Eventually Bernard gets access to the parks\u2019 computer system, in the hope it might help him find Maeve. Instead he learns that someone has been messing about and accessing the data of previous guests. Bernard assumes that person is big bad Dolores and suggests that he and Stubbs should go and find the guest she seemed most curious about; that bloke called Liam we met last week. So that\u2019s episode two, one dedicated to setting our good guys on a path towards their enemy. The journey culminates in an epilogue in which Maeve awakes in the human world and has her actual, final, in no way revisable situation explained to her by that bloke from La Haine. Vincent Cassel plays Serac, the AI oligarch who was mentioned a lot last week, but never seen. He chooses not to explain to Maeve what that whole simulation thing was all about but does tell her he now needs her in a war to save humanity. From here on in it will be Maeve v Dolores to the death. Or whatever the equivalent is for a robot. Divergences and anomalies For future reference, here\u2019s the serial number for Maeve\u2019s control unit \u2013 HC1983012522. Is it just coincidence that the maintenance robot looks exactly like the ones from Boston Dynamics that everyone laughs at because they can\u2019t walk very well and yet here they\u2019re scarily nimble? Are they trying to tell us something? Hi again Felix and Sylvester, and, er, bye again. We get a brief cameo from everyone\u2019s favourite bumbling surgeons but they\u2019re all just part of the simulation too, man. How does one escape a cage that doesn\u2019t exist? One for all of us to ponder over the coming weeks/months Thanks for all last week\u2019s comments and I hope this recap will act in some small way as a distraction for those who read it. I\u2019m writing these articles based on preview screenings which don\u2019t contain the \u2018next week on...\u2019 post-credit sequences, which is why I haven\u2019t noted what they contain.",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday, in the small Spanish country town where I go to fill up my water supply, an ambulance with flashing lights went up the deserted main street. Two municipal police cars followed it slowly, making it look already like a funeral procession. Only three other people were out, and two of them were wearing face masks.</p> <p>When I first saw pictures like this from China and Iran, for some reason, I didn\u2019t take seriously that it would also happen in Spain \u2013 my home for the past 25 years.<strong> </strong>It wasn\u2019t just me who thought this, many politicians and experts were saying the same.</p> <p>How wrong we were. Italy has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis\">overtaken China</a>, becoming the country with the greatest number of deaths in the pandemic. Spain took third place from Iran yesterday, and will likely take only three days to move ahead of China. Little surprise, then, that the government has now extended our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-news-coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-uk-italy-lockdown-spain-us-new-york-south-america\">almost total lockdown</a> to a full month.</p> <p>Ideas of cultural or national superiority are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-lockdown-coronavirus-london\">greatest risk factor</a> of all at a time like this. Nowhere is that a more serious danger right now than in the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 two countries especially prone to such delusions.</p> <p>In fact, watching the UK from a distance has felt like scrambling out of your car at the front of a multiple pile-up on the motorway, only to see other cars smashing into the rear 20 minutes later. Didn\u2019t anyone warn them about what lay ahead? Surely everyone knew. That is what it looks like from mainland Europe \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/who-director-general-europe-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-video\">new </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/who-director-general-europe-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-video\">centre of the pandemic</a>.</p> <p>If you think that what is happening in southern Europe is a result of corruption, incompetence, lower household income or poor public health systems, then you are fooling yourself. All the signs suggest that the UK and the US are heading in exactly the same direction. Both countries are just a week or so behind.</p> <p>Italy put in place some of the most stringent travel regulations against China, well before most of the rest of Europe. It has more hospital beds per capita than the US. Spain has one of the healthiest populations and longest lifespans in the world. Its health professionals are good enough to provide a considerable part of the NHS workforce. Spain does not have an especially elderly population either \u2013 the over-65s account for just 1% point more than the UK.</p> <p>From my remote country house, a long way from my elderly neighbours, I have been viewing the daily briefings by Boris Johnson and his advisers with a mixture of incredulity and occasional admiration.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday, in the small Spanish country town where I go to fill up my water supply, an ambulance with flashing lights went up the deserted main street. Two municipal police cars followed it slowly, making it look already like a funeral procession. Only three other people were out, and two of them were wearing face masks. When I first saw pictures like this from China and Iran, for some reason, I didn\u2019t take seriously that it would also happen in Spain \u2013 my home for the past 25 years. It wasn\u2019t just me who thought this, many politicians and experts were saying the same. How wrong we were. Italy has overtaken China, becoming the country with the greatest number of deaths in the pandemic. Spain took third place from Iran yesterday, and will likely take only three days to move ahead of China. Little surprise, then, that the government has now extended our almost total lockdown to a full month. Ideas of cultural or national superiority are the greatest risk factor of all at a time like this. Nowhere is that a more serious danger right now than in the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 two countries especially prone to such delusions. In fact, watching the UK from a distance has felt like scrambling out of your car at the front of a multiple pile-up on the motorway, only to see other cars smashing into the rear 20 minutes later. Didn\u2019t anyone warn them about what lay ahead? Surely everyone knew. That is what it looks like from mainland Europe \u2013 the new centre of the pandemic. If you think that what is happening in southern Europe is a result of corruption, incompetence, lower household income or poor public health systems, then you are fooling yourself. All the signs suggest that the UK and the US are heading in exactly the same direction. Both countries are just a week or so behind. Italy put in place some of the most stringent travel regulations against China, well before most of the rest of Europe. It has more hospital beds per capita than the US. Spain has one of the healthiest populations and longest lifespans in the world. Its health professionals are good enough to provide a considerable part of the NHS workforce. Spain does not have an especially elderly population either \u2013 the over-65s account for just 1% point more than the UK. From my remote country house, a long way from my elderly neighbours, I have been viewing the daily briefings by Boris Johnson and his advisers with a mixture of incredulity and occasional admiration. How can they be so sure that their approach of managing and mitigating the flow of the pandemic \u2013 hardly used by anyone else \u2013 is right? The health experts sound convinced, but Boris Johnson\u2019s air-punching promises about \u201cturning the tide\u201d remind me of King Cnut. There are other recognisable and worrying elements. The UK government\u2019s reaction chimes too easily with Johnson\u2019s \u201csceptered isle\u201d nationalism and blitz-style nostalgia. It also fits the \u201cwild card\u201d thinking of Dominic Cummings. Donald Trump and his cheerleaders, meanwhile, appear convinced that America\u2019s \u201cgreatness\u201d will itself provide a magical coat of protection. Politicians and experts must make hard choices \u2013 and they may still be right. I certainly hope so. Yet hubris, in this case, will be paid for in lives. If the rest of the world looks upon the UK\u2019s coronavirus planning with skepticism, that is because it is a clear outlier. A plucky nation boldly going its own way is a perfectly reasonable pitch for Brexit. It does not sound so convincing during a pandemic. Commentators in Spanish newspapers and on the radio are aghast. \u201cThey are putting us all in danger,\u201d warned a group of Spanish scientists in eldiario.es. French ministers were talking about a special ban on people from the UK. The British \u201cherd immunity\u201d model (which the government has since pivoted on) was certainly not embraced by countries in Asia, which have been spectacularly successful at stopping the virus so far.

Police said the couple were approached by three males before one coughed in their faces in Paynes Park in Hitchin shortly before 1pm on Friday. One of the alleged victims, a woman in her 70s, sustained a black eye and was taken to hospital for a checkup before being released, according to a spokesman for Hertfordshire constabulary. A man in his 30s who tried to intervene to help the couple also sustained bruising to his face, police said, and his vehicle was attacked. Three males, aged 16, 18 and 19, were arrested and interviewed under caution before being released under investigation. Police warned people not to post details of the case or footage of the alleged incident on social media as it could jeopardise future legal proceedings. A spokesman said: \u201cIt has also come to our attention that there is footage circulating on social media and we would politely ask that people refrain from sharing the video for the same reasons.\u201d The incident in Hitchin came 24 hours after a man was arrested in the West Midlands after coughing on shop staff and claiming to be infected with the coronavirus. Officers had been called to Dudley High Street to reports of a theft on Thursday afternoon. They detained a 57-year-old man on suspicion of theft and assault after several people reported a man coughing on shop staff who suspected him of stealing. In a statement, West Midlands police said: \u201cThe man, who is from Dudley and has suspected mental health issues, has been taken into custody and will be questioned in due course. \u201cThose affected have been given appropriate advice and referred to the non-emergency NHS helpline for further support and guidance.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>According to official statistics, China has defeated the coronavirus. Over the last five days, health authorities have reported only one new locally transmitted case of Covid-19 \u2013 a patient in Guangdong province infected by someone travelling from abroad. In Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak and the country\u2019s worst-hit area, officials on Monday reported a fifth day without new cases.</p> \n<p>The figures are a sharp drop from just a month ago when recording a daily increase of fewer than 2,000 new infections was a milestone.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Kyodo News in Japan reported at the weekend that a local doctor said the<a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/b09b868ec468-breaking-news-wuhan-doctor-blows-whistle-on-manipulation-of-virus-patient-numbers.html\"> number of cases had been manipulated</a> before President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit earlier this month, prompting the beginning of \u201ca mass release of infected patients\u201d.</p> \n<p>Allegations of new infections in Wuhan have persisted on social media to such an extent that authorities issued <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oGxlUZO09CVwAX25pFsXZQ\">a detailed statement</a> over the weekend debunking them.</p> \n<p>Some of the concerns about China\u2019s reporting stem from how Beijing classifies patients. While the World Health Organization and South Korea consider anyone who has tested positive for the virus as a confirmed case, China does not include asymptomatic infections in its final tally.</p> \n<p>Late on Monday night, Wuhan\u2019s health commission published a Q&amp;A explaining how asymptomatic cases are dealt with. On why such cases are not included as confirmed cases, the commission said that patients were quarantined for 14 days and if they began to show symptoms they would be designated as confirmed and that data would be published.</p> \n<p>\u201cA small number of asymptomatic infections may progress to becoming confirmed cases, but the vast majority [of patients] will heal by themselves,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Critics also question why recovered patients who retest as positive are not counted. Data from quarantine centres in Wuhan showed that the possibility of recovered patients testing positive again was between 5% and 10%, according to the state-run Global Times.

      "bodyText": "According to official statistics, China has defeated the coronavirus. Over the last five days, health authorities have reported only one new locally transmitted case of Covid-19 \u2013 a patient in Guangdong province infected by someone travelling from abroad. In Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak and the country\u2019s worst-hit area, officials on Monday reported a fifth day without new cases. The figures are a sharp drop from just a month ago when recording a daily increase of fewer than 2,000 new infections was a milestone. Authorities have begun easing Wuhan\u2019s two-month lockdown while cities across the country are following orders to \u201cfully restore\u201d production and resume normal life. But as the country returns to work, residents and analysts doubt the near-zero community transmission rate, worrying that leaders have prioritised restarting the economy over decisively containing the virus. While public health experts, as well as citizens, say the situation in China has improved dramatically \u2013 the result of aggressive testing, quarantines and social distancing \u2013 many doubt the numbers are as good as officials have reported. \u201cI am really worried that there are still many asymptomatic infected people inside Wuhan. As soon as everyone goes back to work, everyone will be infected,\u201d said Wang, 26, who lives in the city. Another resident added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe [the numbers]. This epidemic will not disappear so easily.\u201d \u201cAny rational person would doubt these figures,\u201d one internet user wrote in response to an essay posted by a volunteer in Wuhan questioning the statistics. According to a report on Monday by RTHK, Hong Kong\u2019s public broadcaster, residents said hospitals in Wuhan had refused to test patients who showed symptoms. Kyodo News in Japan reported at the weekend that a local doctor said the number of cases had been manipulated before President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit earlier this month, prompting the beginning of \u201ca mass release of infected patients\u201d. Allegations of new infections in Wuhan have persisted on social media to such an extent that authorities issued a detailed statement over the weekend debunking them. Some of the concerns about China\u2019s reporting stem from how Beijing classifies patients. While the World Health Organization and South Korea consider anyone who has tested positive for the virus as a confirmed case, China does not include asymptomatic infections in its final tally. Late on Monday night, Wuhan\u2019s health commission published a Q&amp;A explaining how asymptomatic cases are dealt with. On why such cases are not included as confirmed cases, the commission said that patients were quarantined for 14 days and if they began to show symptoms they would be designated as confirmed and that data would be published. \u201cA small number of asymptomatic infections may progress to becoming confirmed cases, but the vast majority [of patients] will heal by themselves,\u201d it said. Critics also question why recovered patients who retest as positive are not counted. Data from quarantine centres in Wuhan showed that the possibility of recovered patients testing positive again was between 5% and 10%, according to the state-run Global Times. Officials in Hubei have said those patients would not be recorded as new confirmed cases because they had been counted previously. Authorities said they had not witnessed people-to-people transmission in asymptomatic cases. However, an unnamed official at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the Chinese magazine Caixin: \u201cIt cannot be determined whether transmission has been completely cut off in Wuhan.\u201d The official said there were still \u201ca few or dozen symptomatic people every day\u201d. Documents seen by the South China Morning Post reportedly showed more than 43,000 people had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but did not show symptoms. They have not been included in the official number of infections of more than 80,000. Initial efforts to suppress information about the virus and continued censorship of public debate throughout the crisis have also added to mistrust of the numbers. \u201cWith the cover-up in December and January we really cannot trust the numbers from the Chinese government without more credible and solid evidence to verify,\u201d said Ho-fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. Others say it is a balancing act for the leadership. Since the beginning of this month, leaders in Beijing, including Xi, have emphasised the need to meet economic and development targets, in a year where the Chinese economy was already expected to struggle. A taskforce has been touring the country to make sure local authorities, bound by competing demands of restarting production but preventing new infections, are following orders. \u201cNow the leadership has put a very heavy emphasis on resuming economic activity,\u201d said Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cOne way to resume economic activity without panic is to cover up cases while still doing the government\u2019s best to trace and contain them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk it will lead to another outbreak but for now that seems like a risk the government is willing to take.\u201d Still, sceptics of the positive statistics also acknowledge the difficulty of continuing the restrictions. Many citizens have lost months of income while others are tired of putting their lives on hold. One internet user wrote: \u201cWhy bother with data!

It\u2019s a fantasy about turning Roberts herself into a modern-day Audrey Hepburn, prim and elegant and absolutely certain to know which type of fork is appropriate for each course.

Roberts plays Vivian Ward, an 11th-grade dropout who lives in a flophouse with Kit (Laura San Giacomo), her irreverent best friend and prostitution guru. The film makes it clear that she\u2019s new to sex trade, that she doesn\u2019t do drugs, that she doesn\u2019t have a pimp and that she enjoys complete agency over the questions of \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201chow much\u201d. Late in the film, after Vivian has spent a week at the Beverly Wilshire with a rich client, Kit tells her: \u201cYou sure don\u2019t fit in on the Boulevard lookin\u2019 like you do. Not that you ever did.\u201d</p> <p>Like all the classic Old Hollywood romantic comedies, Pretty Woman is about a man and a woman who are locked into a flirty but contentious struggle to get on equal footing, with the woman usually at a disadvantage. Director Garry Marshall makes vintage entertainment an obsession for Vivian, who guffaws infectiously at old I Love Lucy episodes and falls asleep watching Hepburn and Cary Grant in Charade. Marshall and his screenwriter, JF Lawton, are preoccupied by turning Vivian into a picture of innocence \u2013 not a sex worker who hits the lottery, but a naif who discovers the proper lady she always was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaef022b0276372b83822afcde4384a31d17d71f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaef022b0276372b83822afcde4384a31d17d71f/0_0_3152_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it\u2019s not like master-of-the-universe Edward Lewis was out looking for a call girl, either, even though he\u2019s played by Richard Gere, who had a star-making turn himself as a gorgeous, narcissistic sex worker in American Gigolo. Edward is just an out-of-towner looking for directions, so his intentions are pure, too. So Vivian and Edward\u2019s partnership starts with a more traditional romcom meet-cute and chemistry takes over from there.

The most famous sequences of the film are Vivian shopping on Rodeo Drive with Edward\u2019s cash and credit card, the camera ogling brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and BMW.

Forty-one per cent of homeless people have chronic illness, explains Yeung. The average life expectancy in England and Wales is 45 for men and 43 for women. Homeless people are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus, with individuals three times more likely to have a severe respiratory problem. But staying safe is an almost impossible task for those without a home, and is what worries Yeung and other specialist homeless GPs. \u201cThey don\u2019t have places to self-isolate.

That\u2019s the takeaway from the latest Theft in Hotels <a href=\"https://www.wellness-heaven.de/wellness/study-theft-in-hotels/\">survey</a> published last year by Wellness Heaven, a German website that reviews luxury hotels and spas. The data, collected from 1,157 four- and five-star hotels, helps explain why<a href=\"https://www.xotels.com/en/glossary/rack-rate\"> rack rates</a> keep rising. The first sentence of the report jumps off the page like the price of beluga on a room service menu: \u201cStealing soaps or pens seems harmless for many hotel guests, however, some are so bold that they carry TVs, pianos, mattresses or even [taxidermied] animals out of the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>The other shocker from this biennial survey is that the people who stay in the best places are the biggest thieves. Four-star hotel guests tend to pilfer common household staples like pens, towels, hangers and cutlery. It\u2019s at the posh five-star places, though, where the good stuff goes missing.</p> <p>A television set is nine times more likely to be stolen from a five-star than a four-star hotel. The same goes for art heists, which happen five times more often in the very best establishments. Duvets and pillows are another five-star obsession. There\u2019s a fourfold increase in the theft of those coveted goose down accessories. The scam: bring some old bedding from home, and switch it out just before checkout.</p> <p>Here\u2019s more bad news from Wellness Heaven survey: luxury hotel larceny is rising precipitously. Mattress theft is up 35% compared to the 2017 survey. The same goes for hair dryers (up 20%), phones (up 26%), coffee machines (up 21%), lamps (up 19%) and TVs (up 11%).</p> <p>Making off with a Nespresso machine or a sleek desk lamp may seem beyond the pale, but that\u2019s trivial compared with the \u201cspectacular outliers\u201d highlighted in the survey. Consider the Berlin hotel, where a variety of bath fixtures \u2013 from a rainfall shower head to an entire sink \u2013 were plundered. Then there\u2019s the spa hotel outside Salzburg where the benches from a room\u2019s \u201cprivate sauna\u201d vanished overnight. Not everything reported stolen made it into the survey. That includes unusual items like a Tesla power charger, a four-meter-wide film projection screen and a swimsuit dryer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One successful ruse involves a visiting 'artist' who checks into hotels with a shipping crate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How is it even possible to pull a job like that off? Carting away a king-size mattress or a Steinway grand piano might require a costume change and professional moving equipment. One successful ruse involves a visiting \u201cartist\u201d who checks into hotels with a shipping crate that supposedly contains an unfinished canvas for a local gallery show. The crate, of course, is empty. But not for long. As the thief strolls out the door, with the bulky crate in tow, nothing seems amiss. It isn\u2019t until housekeeping notices a valuable flat screen is missing that security realizes they\u2019ve been had. This \u201cartist\u201d works the five-star circuit in South America, and has yet to be busted.</p> <p>But there are targets worldwide. Boutique hotels in Europe are particularly vulnerable \u2013 skeleton staff, minimal security and limited desk hours means low risk and high reward. \u201cMost small European hotels do not operate their reception desks 24/7; they usually close in the late evening,\u201d says Dr Tassilo Keilmann, the CEO of the Wellness Heaven Hotel Guide. \u201cThey even give you a key to the main door if you go out for the evening, and plan to return late.\u201d No need to be concerned about surveillance cameras or Ring video doorbells. Keilmann claims digital security is spotty at best: \u201cMany hoteliers refrain from installing cameras due to privacy concerns.

      "bodyText": "Peter Greenberg knows all about frequent-flyer hotel thieves \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking just towels and toiletries. The investigative journalist, better known to front desk managers as the Travel Detective, has researched and documented their sins for years. The one that gets everyone\u2019s attention has become part of Los Angeles hotel lore. \u201cA guest at the Beverly Wilshire stole a marble fireplace,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cHe cut it out of the wall with a chisel. A bellboy even helped load the pieces in a truck.\u201d The items swiped from $800-a-night rooms would put the average shoplifter to shame. They include: large ceramic bowls, silver platters, throw pillows, wireless speakers, small oil paintings, iPads. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of entitlement,\u201d explains Greenberg. \u201cThe guest thinks: \u2018I overpaid for this room, and what\u2019s in it is mine.\u2019 Anything that can be squeezed into a suitcase seems to be fair game.\u201d Some things that don\u2019t fit in the overhead bin are up for grabs, too. That\u2019s the takeaway from the latest Theft in Hotels survey published last year by Wellness Heaven, a German website that reviews luxury hotels and spas. The data, collected from 1,157 four- and five-star hotels, helps explain why rack rates keep rising. The first sentence of the report jumps off the page like the price of beluga on a room service menu: \u201cStealing soaps or pens seems harmless for many hotel guests, however, some are so bold that they carry TVs, pianos, mattresses or even [taxidermied] animals out of the hotel.\u201d The other shocker from this biennial survey is that the people who stay in the best places are the biggest thieves. Four-star hotel guests tend to pilfer common household staples like pens, towels, hangers and cutlery. It\u2019s at the posh five-star places, though, where the good stuff goes missing. A television set is nine times more likely to be stolen from a five-star than a four-star hotel. The same goes for art heists, which happen five times more often in the very best establishments. Duvets and pillows are another five-star obsession. There\u2019s a fourfold increase in the theft of those coveted goose down accessories. The scam: bring some old bedding from home, and switch it out just before checkout. Here\u2019s more bad news from Wellness Heaven survey: luxury hotel larceny is rising precipitously. Mattress theft is up 35% compared to the 2017 survey. The same goes for hair dryers (up 20%), phones (up 26%), coffee machines (up 21%), lamps (up 19%) and TVs (up 11%). Making off with a Nespresso machine or a sleek desk lamp may seem beyond the pale, but that\u2019s trivial compared with the \u201cspectacular outliers\u201d highlighted in the survey. Consider the Berlin hotel, where a variety of bath fixtures \u2013 from a rainfall shower head to an entire sink \u2013 were plundered. Then there\u2019s the spa hotel outside Salzburg where the benches from a room\u2019s \u201cprivate sauna\u201d vanished overnight. Not everything reported stolen made it into the survey. That includes unusual items like a Tesla power charger, a four-meter-wide film projection screen and a swimsuit dryer. How is it even possible to pull a job like that off? Carting away a king-size mattress or a Steinway grand piano might require a costume change and professional moving equipment. One successful ruse involves a visiting \u201cartist\u201d who checks into hotels with a shipping crate that supposedly contains an unfinished canvas for a local gallery show. The crate, of course, is empty. But not for long. As the thief strolls out the door, with the bulky crate in tow, nothing seems amiss. It isn\u2019t until housekeeping notices a valuable flat screen is missing that security realizes they\u2019ve been had. This \u201cartist\u201d works the five-star circuit in South America, and has yet to be busted. But there are targets worldwide. Boutique hotels in Europe are particularly vulnerable \u2013 skeleton staff, minimal security and limited desk hours means low risk and high reward. \u201cMost small European hotels do not operate their reception desks 24/7; they usually close in the late evening,\u201d says Dr Tassilo Keilmann, the CEO of the Wellness Heaven Hotel Guide. \u201cThey even give you a key to the main door if you go out for the evening, and plan to return late.\u201d No need to be concerned about surveillance cameras or Ring video doorbells. Keilmann claims digital security is spotty at best: \u201cMany hoteliers refrain from installing cameras due to privacy concerns. In Germany, for instance, it is forbidden to place cameras in public spaces, like the driveway in front of a hotel entrance.\u201d Even slightly larger European hotels are vulnerable to the light-fingered guest. The desk manager at an 80-room pleasure dome in the Italian Alps says theft is a constant and ever-increasing threat to their bottom line. One of the most popular items stolen from this five-star hotel are the non-complimentary \u201cwellness bags\u201d, which are stuffed with 350 euros worth of holistics products, including a \u201ccozy\u201d bathrobe and blanket.

The coronavirus bill, which will be in force for two years, completed all its stages through the Commons in one day without opposition MPs forcing any votes after Downing Street offered the concession that it would be reviewed every six months. Labour welcomed the move, but expressed concern at some of the measures in the 329-page bill, which will go to the Lords later in the week, notably changes to rules over mental health and the provision of social care. Clauses suspend existing duties requiring councils to meet the eligible needs of vulnerable older people, disabled people, and young adults with social care needs about to leave the children\u2019s care system.

I had mentioned in a newspaper and on my podcast that she was poorly with COVID-19. Aunty Jean passed away yesterday morning. Eldest of 3 sisters. Aunty Jean was in her 80s but had so much living to do. Aunty Jean never ever ever did anything but bring sunshine in to my life. She lived near my boarding school and would pop in as often as she could to make sure I had Quavers, Pot Noodles, Parma Ham, a bit of cash, knowing how far from home I was. Aunty Jean lived in and around sport all her life and was so kind to everyone she met. Kindness, generosity of spirit, a giver of time. It has knocked all of us in the family. My cousin Claire has lost her Mum who had so many more years to give. Aunty Jean never got to meet her newly born Great Granddaughter. We will all miss you Aunty Jean. Aunty Jean asked us not to cry with her final words. We love you so much.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/willgreenwood/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Will Greenwood</a> (@willgreenwood) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-22T09:53:14+00:00&quot;>Mar 22, 2020 at 2:53am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "A primary headteacher and a Holocaust survivor are among the latest British victims of the coronavirus outbreak to be named. Wendy Jacobs, the head of Roose primary school in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, is the first identified key worker to have died from the disease. The death has also been reported of William Stern, a Hungarian-born survivor of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp, who was at the centre of one Britain\u2019s biggest bankruptcy cases. Jacobs had been diagnosed with the virus last week and was being cared for in Furness general hospital. She died on Sunday, according to a letter sent to parents and carers from the school\u2019s chair of governors, Fred Chatfield. He said her death was \u201cdevastating\u201d for the school and the community. He also announced that the school would be closed to all pupils on Monday. Pupils left flowers and homemade cards at the school gates. Chatfield\u2019s letter said: \u201cWe are all in shock, and given these exceptional circumstances we have taken the decision to close the school and nursery fully tomorrow to all pupils, including those of essential workers. \u201cI am sure you will understand that opening the school and nursery is not an option. We would recommend that all children are kept at home tomorrow. This is a huge loss to our school, nursery and our community and I will be in touch as soon as possible to explain how we will celebrate Mrs Jacobs\u2019 life and contribution.\u201d The school teaches child from nursery age to 11. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said two members of the UK\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Haredi community had died, reported by media outlets to be Rina Feldman, 97, and Stern, who was 85. Stern, who was born Vilmos Gy\u00f6rgy Stern in Budapest, Hungary, on 2 July 1935, was imprisoned as a child in the Bergen-Belsen camp during the second world war. He shared his memories of Torah readings in the camp on the Shoah website. After the war he settled in London and went on to build a successful property empire. Stern Holdings collapsed in 1973 and in 1978 Stern was declared bankrupt with debts of \u00a3118m, a British record at the time. The actor Sophia Myles, who has appeared in Spooks and Doctor Who, announced that her 77-year-old father, Peter Myles, had died of coronavirus on Saturday. Writing on Twitter she said: \u201cMy dear Dad died only a few hours ago. It was the coronavirus that finally took him.\u201d She posted an image of her comforting her father the day before he died. Myles was shown touching his brow while wearing plastic gloves, a mask and a protective hospital apron. Before he retired in 2008, Myles was an Anglican vicar at St John\u2019s church Isleworth, west London, where he was described as a \u201cliberal soul\u201d. After being ordained in 1971 his first job as curate was in Tideswell in Derby. He spent the rest of his career in west London, including stints as a priest at Notting Hill\u2019s St Peter\u2019s church and as chaplain to the Bishop of Kensington. He had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and spent his final years in a care home close to St John\u2019s in Isleworth. Myles had been documenting her father\u2019s illness for the US TV network CBS. The former England rugby player Will Greenwood announced that his aunt Jean had died after testing positive for the virus. In an Instagram post, Greenwood said his aunt \u201cnever did anything but bring sunshine into my life\u201d. He said she lived near Greenwood\u2019s boarding school in Sedbergh, Cumbria. Greenwood said she was the eldest of three sisters and was in her 80s \u201cbut had so much living to do\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>As countries shut borders, enforced curfews and suspended much of daily life, Gaza \u2013 under a blockade for years \u2013 was somewhat isolated from the coronavirus pandemic. But as it has with so much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 found a way.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Sunday morning, Palestinian health officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/gaza-confirms-first-coronavirus-cases-as-west-bank-shuts-down\">announced the first two cases </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/gaza-confirms-first-coronavirus-cases-as-west-bank-shuts-down\">in Gaza</a>, from travellers returning from Pakistan via the Egyptian crossing. They were part of a trickle of people heading into the strip, around 1,300, who were placed into quarantine facilities, mostly in empty schools and hotels.</p> \n<p>Medhat Abbas, the general director of primary care in Gaza, said that other people the pair were in contact with had also been quarantined. \u201cThere is no need for panic at this stage,\u201d Abbas said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe can deal with existing cases and limited numbers, but if the pandemic increases, as happened in some countries, we will need international intervention,\u201d he said.

Meanwhile, three devastating wars between Israel and Hamas, a militant group that rules inside the strip, have entrenched the crisis, as have often-violent rivalries between competing Palestinian factions.

      "bodyText": "As countries shut borders, enforced curfews and suspended much of daily life, Gaza \u2013 under a blockade for years \u2013 was somewhat isolated from the coronavirus pandemic. But as it has with so much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 found a way. In the early hours of Sunday morning, Palestinian health officials announced the first two cases in Gaza, from travellers returning from Pakistan via the Egyptian crossing. They were part of a trickle of people heading into the strip, around 1,300, who were placed into quarantine facilities, mostly in empty schools and hotels. Medhat Abbas, the general director of primary care in Gaza, said that other people the pair were in contact with had also been quarantined. \u201cThere is no need for panic at this stage,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cWe can deal with existing cases and limited numbers, but if the pandemic increases, as happened in some countries, we will need international intervention,\u201d he said. Gaza had only 40 intensive care unit beds, or 100 under emergency conditions, he added \u2013 far fewer than would be needed in an outbreak. For almost a decade and a half, this tiny slice of land has been in an artificial state of lockdown \u2013 locals call it a \u201csiege\u201d \u2013 under a crushing Israeli-Egyptian blockade. \u201cWe have become used to isolation,\u201d said Ahlam al-Madhoun, 45, as she shopped in a supermarket for food. \u201cWill the world understand that the isolation they live in for 14 days is the same as what we have been living under for 14 years?\u201d While the blockade may have cut off Gaza from the pandemic, or at best delayed its entry, it is also blamed for what could be a catastrophic outbreak if the virus spreads. On Monday, the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem accused Israel of turning the strip into the \u201cbiggest open-air prison in the world\u201d, one that is uniquely unsuited to deal with the pandemic. \u201cIsrael will not be able to deflect the blame if this nightmare scenario turns into a reality that it created and made no effort to prevent,\u201d it said. Years of tight restrictions on people and goods have not only destroyed the economy but damaged almost every aspect of life. Meanwhile, three devastating wars between Israel and Hamas, a militant group that rules inside the strip, have entrenched the crisis, as have often-violent rivalries between competing Palestinian factions. More recently, a bloody Israeli crackdown on protests near the frontier has left thousands with bullet wounds, putting significant stress on hospitals. Gaza\u2019s healthcare system was collapsing even before the pandemic, Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories, warned last week. \u201cIts stocks of essential drugs are chronically low. Its natural sources of drinkable water are largely contaminated. Its electrical system provides sporadic power. Deep poverty amid appalling socio-economic conditions is prevalent throughout the strip,\u201d he said. \u201cGaza\u2019s population is also a physically more vulnerable population.\u201d To block Covid-19, authorities in Gaza shut down wedding halls, banned weekly markets and asked people to stay at home. Ibrahim Raida, 31, a graphic designer, questioned whether the measures were enough. \u201cThey thought they are immune, but after the two cases \u2026 Gaza is a small place, and overpopulated, the virus can be easily spread.\u201d The World Health Organization has sent in testing kits, personal protective equipment and goggles but said it might not be sufficient without additional international donations. The head of the WHO office for the occupied Palestinian territories, Gerald Rockenschaub, was in Gaza during the weekend and said containment was still possible. However, preparations for an outbreak should be ramped up immediately, he said. \u201cWhat we need to do is to now move quickly to strengthen the capacities of the health system,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are shortages everywhere.\u201d Israel argues the blockade is a security measure needed to restrict its enemy Hamas, which has often fired rockets out of the strip. The UN, however, says its policy constitutes collective punishment on the strip\u2019s roughly 2 million residents. Cogat, the defence ministry body responsible for coordinating Israeli government activity in the Palestinian territories, said it had mostly closed its foot traffic crossing into Gaza, although a separate entrance for trade was open. Israel had provided \u201chundreds\u201d of Covid-19 test kits for Gaza, it added, without specifying. It would agree to exit for \u201clife-threatening situations\u201d and other extraordinary cases, a Cogat official said.

I am prepared to concede that maybe you had to be there.</p> <p>Fast forward approximately 24 hours and Max and I have just come off the air after our two hours on TalkSport and, while tricky, it was highly enjoyable. Even in the absence of sport the show must go on and as purveyors of jovial, utterly inconsequential mid-morning tomfoolery we are apparently somehow considered key \u2013 if not absolutely key \u2013 workers at this difficult time.</p> <p>During a frightening period when we have seen the very best and very worst of people, medics, shelf-stackers and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus have been rightly lauded for their heroic efforts. Meanwhile the challenges being met by a pair of idiots with hours of sports radio to fill and precisely no sport with which to fill it have gone unheralded. That\u2019s OK, we\u2019re not in it for the glory or the plaudits. What <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/02/my-muse-is-not-horse.html\" title=\"\">Nick Cave once memorably described</a> as \u201cthis tumbrel \u2013 this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes\u201d.</p> <p>There are those out there who will argue that filling time by \u201cplaying\u201d the postponed FA Cup game between Sheffield United and Arsenal through the medium of a quiz is considerably less stressful than pulling 48 hours on the A&amp;E ward only to wind up weeping in the car park of an empty supermarket. What\u2019s more, they would be absolutely correct. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is those questions didn\u2019t ask themselves on Sunday, ultimately resulting in a highly controversial Arsenal win that comically enraged many listeners who support Sheffield United.</p> <p>Meanwhile on the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast, Max and I have vowed to continue delivering our twice-weekly show covering all the football that is not being played for as long as it takes and feedback has been heartwarmingly pleasing even if results have been mixed. A recent episode featured discussions about Australia\u2019s A-League, Stuart Broad\u2019s evolution as a top-class bowler and a monologue on the finer points of wood-chopping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/facebook-powerful-crisis-coronavirus-communities-online\">Facebook is still far too powerful. It's also how millions are coping with this crisis | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a privilege to be lucky enough to have radio shows and podcasts to look forward to producing in the company of likeminded individuals at a time when so many people have never felt so isolated, utterly bereft of companionship and downright bored. The inherent sense of camaraderie and community is a source of comfort and it is to be hoped our inane natter provides some sort of company and sense of familiarity to listeners whose ears are otherwise under constant assault from others engaged in far more important and largely depressing chat.</p> <p>I suspect Big Del would have got a kick out of tuning in to radio coverage of Arsenal denying Sheffield United a place in the FA Cup semi-final in a preposterously complicated radio quiz, effing and jeffing throughout and making a mental note to remind me of how the Blades had been the victim of \u201ca facking stitch-up\u201d when next he saw me down the pub.</p> <p>Although I never told him, I got a similar kick out of hearing from him and others who were out there tuning in to and laughing (or seething) at the latest drivel Max and I had dreamed up. With the world halfway to hell in a handcart, now seems as good a time as any to make sure each and every other one of our other listeners knows.</p>",

Fast forward approximately 24 hours and Max and I have just come off the air after our two hours on TalkSport and, while tricky, it was highly enjoyable. Even in the absence of sport the show must go on and as purveyors of jovial, utterly inconsequential mid-morning tomfoolery we are apparently somehow considered key \u2013 if not absolutely key \u2013 workers at this difficult time. During a frightening period when we have seen the very best and very worst of people, medics, shelf-stackers and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus have been rightly lauded for their heroic efforts. Meanwhile the challenges being met by a pair of idiots with hours of sports radio to fill and precisely no sport with which to fill it have gone unheralded. That\u2019s OK, we\u2019re not in it for the glory or the plaudits. What Nick Cave once memorably described as \u201cthis tumbrel \u2013 this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes\u201d. There are those out there who will argue that filling time by \u201cplaying\u201d the postponed FA Cup game between Sheffield United and Arsenal through the medium of a quiz is considerably less stressful than pulling 48 hours on the A&amp;E ward only to wind up weeping in the car park of an empty supermarket. What\u2019s more, they would be absolutely correct. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is those questions didn\u2019t ask themselves on Sunday, ultimately resulting in a highly controversial Arsenal win that comically enraged many listeners who support Sheffield United. Meanwhile on the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast, Max and I have vowed to continue delivering our twice-weekly show covering all the football that is not being played for as long as it takes and feedback has been heartwarmingly pleasing even if results have been mixed. A recent episode featured discussions about Australia\u2019s A-League, Stuart Broad\u2019s evolution as a top-class bowler and a monologue on the finer points of wood-chopping. It is a privilege to be lucky enough to have radio shows and podcasts to look forward to producing in the company of likeminded individuals at a time when so many people have never felt so isolated, utterly bereft of companionship and downright bored. The inherent sense of camaraderie and community is a source of comfort and it is to be hoped our inane natter provides some sort of company and sense of familiarity to listeners whose ears are otherwise under constant assault from others engaged in far more important and largely depressing chat. I suspect Big Del would have got a kick out of tuning in to radio coverage of Arsenal denying Sheffield United a place in the FA Cup semi-final in a preposterously complicated radio quiz, effing and jeffing throughout and making a mental note to remind me of how the Blades had been the victim of \u201ca facking stitch-up\u201d when next he saw me down the pub. Although I never told him, I got a similar kick out of hearing from him and others who were out there tuning in to and laughing (or seething) at the latest drivel Max and I had dreamed up. With the world halfway to hell in a handcart, now seems as good a time as any to make sure each and every other one of our other listeners knows.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Rosena Allin-Khan</strong><strong>, the Labour MP for Tooting</strong><strong> and an A&amp;E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George\u2019s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff:</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been an A&amp;E doctor for 15 years, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/hospitals-likened-to-war-zones-as-doctors-prepare-to-make-grim-decisions\">I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before</a>. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">We\u2019re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms</a>, who are testing Covid-19 positive.</p> <p>On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe.</p> <p>This is only set to get worse. We\u2019re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&amp;E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&amp;E department is known for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/doctors-warn-coronavirus-could-overwhelm-nhs-intensive-care\">being on the frontline and high risk</a>, but there\u2019s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they\u2019re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother\u2019s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn\u2019t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower.</p> <p>The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don\u2019t have enough ventilators.

      "bodyText": "Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A&amp;E doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George\u2019s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff: I\u2019ve been an A&amp;E doctor for 15 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We\u2019re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive. On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe. This is only set to get worse. We\u2019re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A&amp;E department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A&amp;E department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there\u2019s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they\u2019re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother\u2019s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn\u2019t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower. The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don\u2019t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you\u2019ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse \u2013 to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now. Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we\u2019re now seeing in the emergency department. We\u2019re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn\u2019t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they\u2019re put in the \u201cgreen\u201d area of the department \u2013 but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point. There\u2019s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don\u2019t have any, or if they do many feel it\u2019s being rationed.

Many doctors are now being \u201cside-skilled\u201d (a new term) so they can help provide intensive care to patients. It\u2019s important that the public understand what intensive care units (ICU) are, as this will make clear what faces us in the coming weeks and months.</p> \n<p>In all major hospitals, the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/intensive-care/\">ICU</a> is for patients with an illness that immediately threatens their survival.<strong> </strong>Treatment is provided with machines and drugs that take over the roles of their organs, while sedation suspends the patient and allows their body to recover. These kinds of treatment cannot happen on normal wards. Skilled care is provided by an army of nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists and dietitians. ICU doctors work together with radiologists, microbiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, physicians and pathologists.</p> \n<p>This level of intensity<strong> </strong>is normal for ICUs, but Covid-19 isn\u2019t. Coronavirus patients needing ICU will be among the sickest \u2013 almost all will need breathing support, or what\u2019s known as \u201clevel 3\u201d care.

In every NHS hospital, normal activity is being diverted towards this end \u2013 but it requires <a href=\"https://oxfordmedicine.com/view/10.1093/med/9780198814924.001.0001/med-9780198814924-chapter-17?rskey=nNdYPh&amp;result=1\">planning</a> on four major fronts: space, staff, stuff and standards.</p> \n<p>The space required in ICUs is enormous: it includes side rooms for safe care, facilities such as oxygen, air, suction, IT and lab support and storage space. Staff who are trained are scarce, and many will be absent due to illness or isolation during the epidemic. Stuff is the hardware and disposables that are needed in abundance, and are currently procured through fragile supply chains. Standards are the complex working practices required to provide the best quality care we can deliver.</p> \n<p>In larger hospitals many patients undergoing complex surgery are subsequently admitted to ICU for treatment and monitoring. If this routine surgery requiring ICU can be paused, the four key needs of ICU capacity may be rapidly available. Beyond that, it becomes challenging. In smaller hospitals, where almost ICU admissions are on an emergency basis, demand just can\u2019t be put on hold during a crisis.</p> \n<p>One solution is to take over hospital operating theatres. ICU medical staff may need to be supplemented by anaesthetists, all of whom will have ICU experience, and nurses by theatre staff, not all of whom will. Staff will need to work differently. In ICU it\u2019s normal for one nurse to care for one patient. In the heat of the crisis this may need to change: one ICU trained nurse, supported by those with different training, could care for several.</p> \n<p>No healthcare system can be prepared for a crisis of this magnitude and speed. Staff across the country are taking extraordinary actions to create space and service. Hospitals are building their defences as best they can, but we do not yet know how high and hard the wave will hit.</p> \n<p>In normal times, ICU treatment saves many lives, but it is not a quick fix \u2013 and it may not be right for all patients. At their sickest, ICU patients will be sedated and their bodily functions performed for them; as they recover, they must repossess those faculties. Treatment in an ICU itself often leads to further frailty or new illnesses; as the body lies ill, it ages.

It is probable that a bigger pool are getting infected but only experiencing mild or no symptoms. Among those who have tested positive, <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf\">nearly 6% developed very serious illness</a>, according to an assessment of 2,000 patients aged under 18 in Wuhan, with under-fives and babies being most at risk.</p>\n    <p>A significant unknown is how infectious children are, assuming large numbers are getting infected. Early evidence suggests that around 50% of transmission in the pandemic at large has involved asymptomatic people and children could be among this group.</p>\n    <p>\u201cIt seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cWe know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren\u2019t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.</p>\n    <p>\u201cEvery mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they\u2019re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.</p>\n    <p>This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Last week the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-keeping-nation-informed-educated-entertained\">announced plans </a>to \u201cget older age group exercise routines and other fitness programming into people\u2019s homes on TV or radio\u201d as the outbreak meant many would be asked to self-isolate for weeks.</p> \n<p>Wicks\u2019s success, which was built on little more than a webcam and an established social media presence, shows the appetite that exists for online teaching, as parents struggle to keep children occupied at the start of what could be weeks indoors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/parents-heeding-calls-to-keep-children-home-from-school-say-heads\">Parents heeding calls to keep children home from school, say heads</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf this takes just a bit of pressure off parents, and makes kids a little fitter and happier, and gives them some structure to their day, then I\u2019ve achieved what I set out to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I think this might be one of the most meaningful things I\u2019ll ever do in my life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wicks said his free workouts would be very similar to the sessions that were planned as part of his school fitness tour, with a mix of HIIT (high-intensity interval training), involving exercises such as star jumps and squats.

The central bank announced a series of programs on Monday aimed at supporting large and small businesses already reeling from the economic blow of coronavirus. \u201cAggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,\u201d the central bank said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses\u201d. As part of the effort the central bank will relaunch a massive bond-buying program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or Talf, last used in response to the 2008 financial crisis, to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses. The Fed has previously announced it would purchase at least $500bn of Treasury securities and at least $200bn of mortgage-backed securities but will now buy bonds in \u201cthe amounts needed to support smooth market functioning\u201d. The bank also said it would soon roll out a \u201cMain Street business lending program\u201d to support lending to eligible small and midsize businesses. The move comes as plans for a government bailout have stalled in Washington. On Sunday Senate Democrats said the bailout of businesses, including airlines, did not adequately protect workers or include restrictions on bailed-out businesses. \u201cIn the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, Republicans can\u2019t seriously expect us to tell people in our communities who are suffering that we shortchanged hospitals, students, workers and small businesses, but gave big corporations hundreds of billions of dollars in a secretive slush fund,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington state. That news sent stock markets sharply lower on Monday morning and even news of the bailout failed to cheer investors. In London the FTSE 100 closed down 3.8% and all the US markets closed down with the Dow Jones losing 3%. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said Congress was \u201cvery close\u201d to approving a stimulus package and he hoped it could be passed on Monday. Mnuchin said he was also working to speed direct cash deposits to US taxpayers - estimated at $3,000 for a family of four - and to support payroll to small business for two months. \u201cThe president is fully determined we are using all our tools to pump massive amounts of liquidity, and working with the federal reserve, to support the US economy in an unprecedented situation when the government has shut down major parts of the economy,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC. The Fed\u2019s intervention came as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the economic hit from the Coronavius pandemic would be worse than during the global financial crisis of 2008. Speaking after a virtual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 group of major developed and developing nations, Georgieva said it was crucial to stop the virus spreading and to strengthen health systems everywhere. \u201cThe economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be\u201d, the IMF chief said. The Fed has moved quickly to address the escalating economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Interest rates have been cut twice in the last month and are now close to zero. But the moves have so far failed to dampen fears that the US is heading towards a deep recession. On Sunday the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president, James Bullard, predicted the US unemployment rate, now just 3.6% and close to record lows, may hit 30% in the second quarter because of shutdowns to combat the coronavirus. \u201cIt is a huge shock and we are trying to cope with it and keep it under control,\u201d Bullard told Bloomberg.

      "body": "<p>\u201cEvery time you get depressed, comedy will be there to drag your ass out of it,\u201d said Robin Williams in 1996. It is a gut-punch of a quote, considering that depression was one of the factors that led to his death 18 years later (although his wife has said the main reason for his suicide was probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/robin-williams-disintegrating-before-suicide-widow-says\">the debilitating brain disease diffuse Lewy body dementia</a>). It also speaks to a nagging sense that there is some truth to the \u201ctears of a clown\u201d cliche: that many of those who seek to make us laugh are masking private sadness.</p> <p>The list of comedy greats who have had some form of mental illness is long: Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Caroline Aherne, Stephen Fry, Joan Rivers and Kenneth Williams to name a few. The doubters say that it is no more common among comics than anyone else \u2013 they are just more cognisant of the bad stuff in the world and have the outlet to talk about it.</p> <p>So what of today\u2019s comedians? Is comedy dragging their ass out of anything? \u201cIt\u2019s where I found all my joy when I was having a tough year, with heartbreak and losing a close family member,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/09/suzi-ruffell-review-warwick-arts-centre\">Suzi Ruffell</a>, who has appeared on TV shows including Mock the Week and The Last Leg. \u201cPerforming was the one thing that was just mine. On stage, I was talking about how shit things were and people were laughing, and I often think that is them saying: \u2018Me too, I\u2019ve felt that.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for that, my healing process would have taken a lot longer.\u201d</p> <p>For John Robins, a BBC Radio 5 live DJ and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/26/edinburgh-fringe-comedy-award-shared-hannah-gadsby-john-robins\">Edinburgh Comedy award winner</a>, the stage is a safe place and \u201can island of control\u201d \u2013 but the process of writing comedy helps him more than the performance, he says: \u201cStandup is my way of making sense of my life and how I feel about myself. Often, I don\u2019t really get a handle on what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s found a life in a routine.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense written about \u2018comedy as therapy\u2019 \u2013 the therapy is the writing bit that happened eight months ago, the practice that happened six months ago, the honing that happened four months ago. There have been moments when I\u2019ve been writing difficult bits, I\u2019ve been sitting in my kitchen in floods of tears because I didn\u2019t realise the way I felt until I wrote it down. By the time most people see it, I\u2019m totally over that bit.\u201d</p> <p>It is a timely moment to revisit the subject of comedy and mental health, as some of its moving parts have shifted in the past decade. First, standups have been increasingly open about their mental health and traumatic episodes in their life. Some tackle this in an unobtrusive way, letting the stories of life\u2019s ups and downs speak for themselves, but many (notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/22/kim-noble-youre-not-alone-review-soho-theatre-london\">Kim Noble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">Hannah Gadsby</a>) have laid it bare in shocking detail. Last year, the documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBV-7_qGlr4\">Laughing Matters</a> got comics (such as Sarah Silverman and the US Office\u2019s Rainn Wilson) off the stage to tell their stories without the jokes in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d/0_0_2595_3896/667.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Gadsby with her Emmy for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the mainstream ... Hannah Gadsby won an Emmy in 2019 for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second big change has been the rise of social media, which has increased exposure for all, but especially those in the public eye. Third is the conversation around mental health, which has become far more sensitive, sophisticated and widespread. When a major broadcaster has a <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/pick-week-itvs-silent-ad-break-golden/1661868\">\u201csilent ad break\u201d</a> to encourage people to check in with each other \u2013 as ITV did last autumn \u2013 you know mental health has gone mainstream.</p> <p>Broadcasters are doing their bit again this week, with <a href=\"https://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/comedy-against-living-miserably/\">Comedy Against Living Miserably</a>, a three-part series on Dave in association with the mental health charity Calm. In each show, comics \u2013 including Ruffell, Robins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/02/nish-kumar-i-have-not-got-over-brexit\">Nish Kumar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/11/kiri-pritchard-mclean-review-pacey-lean-precision-tooled-set-from-increasingly-impressive-comic\">Kiri Pritchard-McLean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/darren-harriott-review-edinburgh-2019\">Darren Harriott</a> \u2013 will speak about everything from grief to anxiety to gaslighting and perform material on these subjects. As Robins says: \u201cMental health is life. As a standup, you\u2019re talking about your life, your experiences, good and bad. Everyone has mental health.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the introspection that comes with standup, this generation of comics are a responsible lot. Ruffell and Robins are aware of how much their comedy can benefit their audiences, too \u2013 especially at a time like this, which feels bleak and lonely for so many. Robins says people have told him (\u201cthe partners, usually\u201d) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\">his radio show with fellow comedian</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\"> Elis James</a> has got them through a tough time. Off the back of that, Robins and James started a podcast, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rq6vh/episodes/downloads\">How Do You Cope?</a>, that is aimed squarely at the subject of mental health.</p> <p>Ruffell\u2019s experience of how her comedy can help others will be an eye-opener to many: \u201cI\u2019ve had people travel 100 miles [to one of my shows] because they wanted to bring their gay teenage daughter to see me, because she doesn\u2019t have a gay network at all. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve had a teenager say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re on TV, it reminds my mum that I\u2019m normal.\u2019 So it\u2019s really important that they get to see someone like them under a spotlight talking about their experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Robins recognises, however, that comedy has limits in its influence. As a comic on stage, the best he can hope to achieve is \u201cthousands of tiny impacts\u201d. The same applies to many mental health campaigns, he says \u2013 the hashtag slogans #bekind and #reachout are \u201cabsolutely vital right now\u201d, but a drop in the ocean in the context of \u201cservices that are so stretched and so cut that they barely exist\u201d. He says: \u201cThe best way to actually improve the nation\u2019s mental health is to pay your taxes, encourage companies to pay their taxes and vote for a government that will spend that money in the most useful way, regardless of what political colour you are.\u201d</p> <p>The flip side of all this is that being a standup can also exacerbate mental health problems. It is a solitary job, with unpredictable results from one night to the next and little security in the long term, which is hardly a recipe for a settled existence. Robins says that writing a show requires \u201cholding yourself in places of anxiety, frustration or anger, and that isn\u2019t a healthy place to be\u201d. The Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles has gone as far as getting an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/28/21142319/comedy-therapist-laugh-factory\">in-house psychologist</a>, who was hired because \u201crecognised that comedians needed more support than he could provide\u201d.</p> <p>And then there is social media. Being active online is almost obligatory for comics today \u2013 and a necessity now that the possibility of performing live is gone for lord knows how long. The Faustian pact they make is that they give more of themselves away; they are \u201con\u201d when they are padding around at home, not only when they are on stage. \u201cPeople want a fuller idea of what a comic is these days,\u201d Ruffell says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing a bit more, but not everyone does, and if I see another comic sharing too much or tweeting certain things I\u2019ll send them a text just saying: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 We do have to look out for each other. For the sake of my mental health I have to tweet and not scroll.\u201d</p> <p>More alarmingly, she says: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s affected me the most [from social media] is the element of threat. I had this troll that just kept on saying: \u2018I\u2019m gonna rape you straight.\u2019 That\u2019s a really weird thing to read when you\u2019re at a train station, travelling home by yourself. Sometimes it happens on the way to a gig and you have to go on stage and be all: \u2018Hey! How\u2019s everyone doing?!\u2019 It\u2019s an extra thing people don\u2019t consider that wears away at you.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">murder of the Melbourne-based comedian Eurydice Dixon in 2018</a>, after a gig, shows that comics must tread the difficult line between taking such threats seriously and living their lives.</p> <p>But these are boom times for standup. There are more touring comics than ever before and more TV opportunities. The nature of the form means that, the second a comedian get on stage, with the spotlight and the mic, they have authority \u2013 and we in the audience or at home put them on a pedestal. The fact that many comics want to use this soft power for good is a start. As Ruffell says: \u201cI just hope there are people out there who watch the show and feel less alone.\u201d</p> <p><em>Comedy Against Living Miserably starts on Dave on </em><em>24 March</em><em> at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cEvery time you get depressed, comedy will be there to drag your ass out of it,\u201d said Robin Williams in 1996. It is a gut-punch of a quote, considering that depression was one of the factors that led to his death 18 years later (although his wife has said the main reason for his suicide was probably the debilitating brain disease diffuse Lewy body dementia). It also speaks to a nagging sense that there is some truth to the \u201ctears of a clown\u201d cliche: that many of those who seek to make us laugh are masking private sadness. The list of comedy greats who have had some form of mental illness is long: Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Caroline Aherne, Stephen Fry, Joan Rivers and Kenneth Williams to name a few. The doubters say that it is no more common among comics than anyone else \u2013 they are just more cognisant of the bad stuff in the world and have the outlet to talk about it. So what of today\u2019s comedians? Is comedy dragging their ass out of anything? \u201cIt\u2019s where I found all my joy when I was having a tough year, with heartbreak and losing a close family member,\u201d says Suzi Ruffell, who has appeared on TV shows including Mock the Week and The Last Leg. \u201cPerforming was the one thing that was just mine. On stage, I was talking about how shit things were and people were laughing, and I often think that is them saying: \u2018Me too, I\u2019ve felt that.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for that, my healing process would have taken a lot longer.\u201d For John Robins, a BBC Radio 5 live DJ and Edinburgh Comedy award winner, the stage is a safe place and \u201can island of control\u201d \u2013 but the process of writing comedy helps him more than the performance, he says: \u201cStandup is my way of making sense of my life and how I feel about myself. Often, I don\u2019t really get a handle on what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s found a life in a routine. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense written about \u2018comedy as therapy\u2019 \u2013 the therapy is the writing bit that happened eight months ago, the practice that happened six months ago, the honing that happened four months ago. There have been moments when I\u2019ve been writing difficult bits, I\u2019ve been sitting in my kitchen in floods of tears because I didn\u2019t realise the way I felt until I wrote it down. By the time most people see it, I\u2019m totally over that bit.\u201d It is a timely moment to revisit the subject of comedy and mental health, as some of its moving parts have shifted in the past decade. First, standups have been increasingly open about their mental health and traumatic episodes in their life. Some tackle this in an unobtrusive way, letting the stories of life\u2019s ups and downs speak for themselves, but many (notably Kim Noble and Hannah Gadsby) have laid it bare in shocking detail. Last year, the documentary Laughing Matters got comics (such as Sarah Silverman and the US Office\u2019s Rainn Wilson) off the stage to tell their stories without the jokes in between. The second big change has been the rise of social media, which has increased exposure for all, but especially those in the public eye. Third is the conversation around mental health, which has become far more sensitive, sophisticated and widespread. When a major broadcaster has a \u201csilent ad break\u201d to encourage people to check in with each other \u2013 as ITV did last autumn \u2013 you know mental health has gone mainstream. Broadcasters are doing their bit again this week, with Comedy Against Living Miserably, a three-part series on Dave in association with the mental health charity Calm. In each show, comics \u2013 including Ruffell, Robins, Nish Kumar, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Darren Harriott \u2013 will speak about everything from grief to anxiety to gaslighting and perform material on these subjects. As Robins says: \u201cMental health is life. As a standup, you\u2019re talking about your life, your experiences, good and bad. Everyone has mental health.\u201d But for all the introspection that comes with standup, this generation of comics are a responsible lot. Ruffell and Robins are aware of how much their comedy can benefit their audiences, too \u2013 especially at a time like this, which feels bleak and lonely for so many. Robins says people have told him (\u201cthe partners, usually\u201d) that his radio show with fellow comedian Elis James has got them through a tough time. Off the back of that, Robins and James started a podcast, How Do You Cope?, that is aimed squarely at the subject of mental health. Ruffell\u2019s experience of how her comedy can help others will be an eye-opener to many: \u201cI\u2019ve had people travel 100 miles [to one of my shows] because they wanted to bring their gay teenage daughter to see me, because she doesn\u2019t have a gay network at all. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve had a teenager say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re on TV, it reminds my mum that I\u2019m normal.\u2019 So it\u2019s really important that they get to see someone like them under a spotlight talking about their experiences.\u201d Robins recognises, however, that comedy has limits in its influence. As a comic on stage, the best he can hope to achieve is \u201cthousands of tiny impacts\u201d. The same applies to many mental health campaigns, he says \u2013 the hashtag slogans #bekind and #reachout are \u201cabsolutely vital right now\u201d, but a drop in the ocean in the context of \u201cservices that are so stretched and so cut that they barely exist\u201d. He says: \u201cThe best way to actually improve the nation\u2019s mental health is to pay your taxes, encourage companies to pay their taxes and vote for a government that will spend that money in the most useful way, regardless of what political colour you are.\u201d The flip side of all this is that being a standup can also exacerbate mental health problems. It is a solitary job, with unpredictable results from one night to the next and little security in the long term, which is hardly a recipe for a settled existence. Robins says that writing a show requires \u201cholding yourself in places of anxiety, frustration or anger, and that isn\u2019t a healthy place to be\u201d. The Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles has gone as far as getting an in-house psychologist, who was hired because \u201crecognised that comedians needed more support than he could provide\u201d. And then there is social media. Being active online is almost obligatory for comics today \u2013 and a necessity now that the possibility of performing live is gone for lord knows how long. The Faustian pact they make is that they give more of themselves away; they are \u201con\u201d when they are padding around at home, not only when they are on stage. \u201cPeople want a fuller idea of what a comic is these days,\u201d Ruffell says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing a bit more, but not everyone does, and if I see another comic sharing too much or tweeting certain things I\u2019ll send them a text just saying: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 We do have to look out for each other. For the sake of my mental health I have to tweet and not scroll.\u201d More alarmingly, she says: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s affected me the most [from social media] is the element of threat. I had this troll that just kept on saying: \u2018I\u2019m gonna rape you straight.\u2019 That\u2019s a really weird thing to read when you\u2019re at a train station, travelling home by yourself. Sometimes it happens on the way to a gig and you have to go on stage and be all: \u2018Hey! How\u2019s everyone doing?!\u2019 It\u2019s an extra thing people don\u2019t consider that wears away at you.\u201d The murder of the Melbourne-based comedian Eurydice Dixon in 2018, after a gig, shows that comics must tread the difficult line between taking such threats seriously and living their lives. But these are boom times for standup. There are more touring comics than ever before and more TV opportunities. The nature of the form means that, the second a comedian get on stage, with the spotlight and the mic, they have authority \u2013 and we in the audience or at home put them on a pedestal. The fact that many comics want to use this soft power for good is a start. As Ruffell says: \u201cI just hope there are people out there who watch the show and feel less alone.\u201d Comedy Against Living Miserably starts on Dave on 24 March at 9pm In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "Emergency measures to tackle the coronavirus will put disabled and older people at risk, charities and human rights experts are warning. Campaigners say measures being introduced in the government\u2019s coronavirus bill will temporarily remove the legal duty on councils to provide social care to all who are eligible. Clauses in the bill, which will be debated in parliament on Monday, suspend existing duties requiring councils to meet the eligible needs of vulnerable older people, disabled people, and care leavers moving into adult social care. The intention of the social care clauses is to allow councils to prioritise care for those they consider most at risk in the event that adult social care services become overwhelmed by surging demand or staff absences. A government impact assessment says that if triggered, \u201cthese clauses could result in individuals not receiving support for some needs where local authorities judge that resources need to be focused on meeting the most acute and pressing needs\u201d. The charity Disability Rights UK said: \u201cGiven the already broken social care system this bill will almost inevitably leave many thousands of disabled people without essential support or any rights to request this support. Rolling back our rights is not good for anyone and in the current circumstances will put many lives at risk. \u201cRather than removing disabled people\u2019s right to social care support the government must treat our essential social care service as key infrastructure, alongside the NHS, and as such it must immediately provide the necessary funding to keep this vital service running.\u201d The wide-ranging bill was expected to pass through the Commons without opposition parties forcing any votes, despite some disquiet among some MPs and civil liberties groups. One area of concern is that the powers detailed under the bill, as published, remain in force for two years. After pressure from Labour and others, the government agreed an amendment mandating a review of the measures every six months. A separate clause in the coronavirus bill temporarily amends the Mental Health Act to make it easier to section people into mental health facilities, and to keep them detained there for longer periods. Other elements of the bill give legal force to the closure of schools and nurseries, allow ministers to ban gatherings, and give extra powers to intervene if the government suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food. Another element would permit the closure of the UK\u2019s borders if too many border staff fell ill. Among the most draconian possible powers is for police, public health and immigration officers to detain people suspected of having Covid-19, force them to isolate and fine them if they refuse a test. Currently local authorities are required by the Care Act to assess the needs of all people who need care and support, consider whether they are eligible for state-funded support, and where necessary provide a plan of care. However, the government argues that at the peak of the crisis it may be impossible for councils to continue to maintain current service levels, or undertake the detailed assessments they would usually provide It argues that as the impact of coronavirus peaks \u201cit is crucial that local authorities should be able to prioritise care in order to protect life and reach rapid decisions over the provision of care without undertaking full Care Act compliant assessments\u201d. It adds: \u201cThese provisions, which would only be brought into operation for the shortest possible time at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, would allow local authorities to do this by temporarily releasing them from some of their duties under the Care Act 2014.\u201d It says that even during the operation of these changes, councils would still be expected to continue meeting all of their duties under the act if they are able to do so.

In the essay From Stones to Stars, which concludes her posthumously published and single poetry collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/25/bestbooksoftheyear.bestbooks\">A Responsibility to Awe</a>, Elson contrasted the discomforts of working in such a male-dominated environment with her pleasure in the openness and congeniality of Princeton\u2019s poetry community. But she went on to add a significant qualification, that \u201cthe discussions there were also a reminder that, although I loved the unlimited licence to invent, I also loved the sense of exploring not an inner, but an outer world, that was really there, in some objective sense\u201d. This week\u2019s poem seems to accommodate this dilemma, by working on a borderline between inventive \u201cpoetic\u201d figures and more objective description, while never fully letting go of the former.</p> <p>The opening lines are simple and striking. The speaker doesn\u2019t merely lie on her back to look up at the night sky, as any non-astronomer might do, but, childlike, she \u201ceats\u201d the stars.

      "bodyText": "Antidotes to Fear of Death Sometimes as an antidote To fear of death, I eat the stars. Those nights, lying on my back, I suck them from the quenching dark Til they are all, all inside me, Pepper hot and sharp. Sometimes, instead, I stir myself Into a universe still young, Still warm as blood: No outer space, just space, The light of all the not yet stars Drifting like a bright mist, And all of us, and everything Already there But unconstrained by form. And sometime it\u2019s enough To lie down here on earth Beside our long ancestral bones: To walk across the cobble fields Of our discarded skulls, Each like a treasure, like a chrysalis, Thinking: whatever left these husks Flew off on bright wings. In 1986, Rebecca Elson (1960-1999) was a young Canadian astronomer who had begun a post-doctoral research fellowship examining Hubble telescope data at Princeton. In the essay From Stones to Stars, which concludes her posthumously published and single poetry collection A Responsibility to Awe, Elson contrasted the discomforts of working in such a male-dominated environment with her pleasure in the openness and congeniality of Princeton\u2019s poetry community. But she went on to add a significant qualification, that \u201cthe discussions there were also a reminder that, although I loved the unlimited licence to invent, I also loved the sense of exploring not an inner, but an outer world, that was really there, in some objective sense\u201d. This week\u2019s poem seems to accommodate this dilemma, by working on a borderline between inventive \u201cpoetic\u201d figures and more objective description, while never fully letting go of the former. The opening lines are simple and striking. The speaker doesn\u2019t merely lie on her back to look up at the night sky, as any non-astronomer might do, but, childlike, she \u201ceats\u201d the stars. She goes on to tell us how she eats them: she sucks them, and finds the taste \u201cpepper hot and sharp\u201d. This is purposefully visceral and immediate, and a summons to the child star-lover in herself, a tuning-in to the old excitement before academia took over. She continues the \u201cnutrition\u201d metaphor with the word \u201cstir\u201d in the third stanza, but a change of approach is heralded as we\u2019re invited to follow her into the early universe: \u201cNo outer space, just space.\u201d And now poetic diction is reduced, the whole imaginative process more restrained. The biblical creation narrative is recalled, when the earth was \u201cwithout form, and void\u201d \u2013 yet the description, especially that of \u201cthe not yet stars\u201d, feels logical and objective. The alternative to stargazing and imagining, proposed in the fifth stanza, is \u201cTo lie down here on earth / Beside our long ancestral bones \u2026\u201d Because of the placing of the conjunction in the first line \u2013 \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s enough\u201d \u2013 the activity is subtly emphasised. It\u2019s at least as important as looking up at the stars to be aware of the horizontal neighbourhood, that of our \u201clong ancestral bones\u201d.

The pandemic has claimed nearly 15,000 lives across the globe and looks set to exact a deadly toll on Latin America in the coming weeks, with many regional governments closing borders and shutting down major cities in a desperate bid to limit the damage. But Bolsonaro has resisted such drastic measures, dismissing media \u201chysteria\u201d over coronavirus and calling the illness \u201ca little flu\u201d. In a tetchy television interview on Sunday night Bolsonaro again downplayed the pandemic and attacked the governors of key states including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo who have ordered residents to stay at home and are imposing quarantines. \u201cThe people will soon see that they were tricked by these governors and by the large part of the media when it comes to coronavirus,\u201d Bolsonaro said, as his own health officials announced 25 deaths and 1,546 cases of coronavirus in Brazil. Bolsonaro claimed a wave of pot-banging protests, which entered their sixth night on Sunday, were a part of a media-backed plot to topple him. \u201cIt is a shameless campaign, a colossal and absurd campaign against the head of state \u2026 They want to force me out however possible,\u201d he claimed. On Monday two opinion polls suggested widespread discontent with Bolsonaro\u2019s behaviour. One, by the Brazilian pollster Ibope, found 48% of people in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo now considered his administration bad or awful. Another, by the Datafolha group, said 51% of wealthy Brazilians and 46% of those with a university education were similarly unimpressed with his handling of the coronavirus crisis.

      "body": "<p>All over the world those who care about their health are hunkering down at home. In other circumstances, this might be a boon, an unexpected opportunity to chill-out rather than set off for yet another day in the frantically-paced 21st century. But when you are looking at weeks, maybe months of this, you do start to ask: how on earth am I going to fill my time? I have a few ideas \u2026</p> <h2>Set goals</h2> <p>Start by thinking of the range of things you would like to do: from tidying out the junk drawer in your kitchen to repainting your dining chairs to reading \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu or starting to write your own novel. Put each idea on a spreadsheet, scoring them one to five by such factors as practicality, seriousness of intent, length of time needed, possibility of completing the task alone and so on. You might have 30 possible projects but once you\u2019ve put them through your filter, about five would be a good total. Goals should be achievable, maybe not easily, but you don\u2019t want to set out for something so gargantuan that failure is inevitable.</p> <p>For while it\u2019s good to come up with self-improving ideas for your coronavirus sabbatical, you need to keep in mind self-compassion too. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over this. It\u2019s not a competition. This is a difficult time for everyone; don\u2019t make it any harder.</p> <h2>Use a schedule</h2> <p>If you are continuing to do your job from home, be up and showered at your usual time; don\u2019t stay in pyjamas or work from bed. You want to stay sharp and focused. If your time is your own, you have more flexibility, but most people find that they get much more done if they set themselves a timetable with breaks every 45 minutes or so. It\u2019s also a good idea to shuffle your tasks. After all, you have plenty of time, so you don\u2019t have to finish everything before starting something new.</p> <h2>Get social</h2> <p>Some projects could entail working with others remotely. Learning a language for example. A friend or tutor might agree to have language lessons with you by phone. You could move your book group online, or you could start a new, smaller one with the specific aim of reading positive, encouraging texts; no more Handmaid\u2019s Tale for you.</p> <p>You might even come up with a new business idea. One friend of mine Suzanne Noble has a hit with her Corona Concerts on Facebook, which she started when her London gigs as a blues singer were cancelled.</p> <p>Staying in contact with others is key. As therapist Mark Bailey wrote on <a href=\"http://welldoing.org\">welldoing.org</a>, \u201cWe are social beings and we need interaction to be psychologically healthy. Facetime and Skype are frankly godsends in these times so use them \u2013 not just for work but for friends, acquaintances and family. Focus conversation on other things in life, not just coronavirus!\u201d</p> <h2>Move our body</h2> <p>If you are able to get out of your home and safely go for a walk or run, do just that. But, increasingly, that\u2019s not encouraged. Use YouTube videos for exercise tips or yoga classes; haul out your skipping rope, run up your stairs. If you\u2019ve got a standing desk, use that for some of the time.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t move about much, don\u2019t spend too much time in your kitchen or you risk something less dangerous than coronavirus, but unpalatable all the same: packing on the pounds. Drinking lots of alcohol may also seem like a good idea at the outset, but it will soon have the same effect as the food.</p> <h2>Tidy up</h2> <p>All the irritating things in your life? Your messy desktop, unfiled documents, ancient bank statements, photos, schoolbooks: this is the time to deep clean your administrative life. Be brutal, go for the clean slate.</p> <p>Your wardrobe too would probably benefit from the sort of critical analysis that large tranches of free time will afford. Follow the time-honoured advice of separate piles: throw out, recycle or charity, mend or clean, keep and wear.</p> <h2>Use your imagination</h2> <p>Spend some of your time creatively. What better time to get Harriet Griffey\u2019s Write Every Day to kickstart creative writing? Or dare yourself to draw, even if you haven\u2019t since you were 12. Or sew, or knit? Or write poetry?</p> <p>Your might also imagine that this almost unbelievable health crisis is the beginning of something new. A kind of re-set, where we all give ourselves more time to reflect and ponder what life is all about, and how happy we are to actually be alive.</p> <ul> <li><p>Louise Chunn is the founder of UK-wide therapy platform <a href=\"http://welldoing.org\">welldoing.org</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "All over the world those who care about their health are hunkering down at home. In other circumstances, this might be a boon, an unexpected opportunity to chill-out rather than set off for yet another day in the frantically-paced 21st century. But when you are looking at weeks, maybe months of this, you do start to ask: how on earth am I going to fill my time? I have a few ideas \u2026 Set goals Start by thinking of the range of things you would like to do: from tidying out the junk drawer in your kitchen to repainting your dining chairs to reading \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu or starting to write your own novel. Put each idea on a spreadsheet, scoring them one to five by such factors as practicality, seriousness of intent, length of time needed, possibility of completing the task alone and so on. You might have 30 possible projects but once you\u2019ve put them through your filter, about five would be a good total. Goals should be achievable, maybe not easily, but you don\u2019t want to set out for something so gargantuan that failure is inevitable. For while it\u2019s good to come up with self-improving ideas for your coronavirus sabbatical, you need to keep in mind self-compassion too. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over this. It\u2019s not a competition. This is a difficult time for everyone; don\u2019t make it any harder. Use a schedule If you are continuing to do your job from home, be up and showered at your usual time; don\u2019t stay in pyjamas or work from bed. You want to stay sharp and focused. If your time is your own, you have more flexibility, but most people find that they get much more done if they set themselves a timetable with breaks every 45 minutes or so. It\u2019s also a good idea to shuffle your tasks. After all, you have plenty of time, so you don\u2019t have to finish everything before starting something new. Get social Some projects could entail working with others remotely. Learning a language for example. A friend or tutor might agree to have language lessons with you by phone. You could move your book group online, or you could start a new, smaller one with the specific aim of reading positive, encouraging texts; no more Handmaid\u2019s Tale for you. You might even come up with a new business idea. One friend of mine Suzanne Noble has a hit with her Corona Concerts on Facebook, which she started when her London gigs as a blues singer were cancelled. Staying in contact with others is key. As therapist Mark Bailey wrote on welldoing.org, \u201cWe are social beings and we need interaction to be psychologically healthy. Facetime and Skype are frankly godsends in these times so use them \u2013 not just for work but for friends, acquaintances and family. Focus conversation on other things in life, not just coronavirus!\u201d Move our body If you are able to get out of your home and safely go for a walk or run, do just that. But, increasingly, that\u2019s not encouraged. Use YouTube videos for exercise tips or yoga classes; haul out your skipping rope, run up your stairs. If you\u2019ve got a standing desk, use that for some of the time. If you can\u2019t move about much, don\u2019t spend too much time in your kitchen or you risk something less dangerous than coronavirus, but unpalatable all the same: packing on the pounds. Drinking lots of alcohol may also seem like a good idea at the outset, but it will soon have the same effect as the food. Tidy up All the irritating things in your life? Your messy desktop, unfiled documents, ancient bank statements, photos, schoolbooks: this is the time to deep clean your administrative life. Be brutal, go for the clean slate. Your wardrobe too would probably benefit from the sort of critical analysis that large tranches of free time will afford. Follow the time-honoured advice of separate piles: throw out, recycle or charity, mend or clean, keep and wear. Use your imagination Spend some of your time creatively. What better time to get Harriet Griffey\u2019s Write Every Day to kickstart creative writing? Or dare yourself to draw, even if you haven\u2019t since you were 12. Or sew, or knit? Or write poetry? Your might also imagine that this almost unbelievable health crisis is the beginning of something new. A kind of re-set, where we all give ourselves more time to reflect and ponder what life is all about, and how happy we are to actually be alive.

Let\u2019s try and get it corrected for the next time.\u201d</p> <p>That, Dr Fauci said, involved members of the White House coronavirus taskforce who, \u201cthe next time they sit down with him and talk about what he\u2019s going to say, they will say, \u2018By the way, Mr President, be careful about this and don\u2019t say that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In one notable recent example, Trump spoke from the podium on Friday about the idea that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, might treat the coronavirus. Dr Fauci then knocked the claim down, gently.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the things out there are what I have called \u2018anecdotal reports\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe information that you\u2019re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can\u2019t make any definitive statement about it.\u201d</p> <p>He subsequently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/sunday/fauci-coronavirus-trump.html\">told the New York Times</a> he did not want to \u201cembarrass\u201d Trump, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, \u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.\u201d</p> <p>Fauci told Science he was \u201csort of exhausted. But other than that, I\u2019m good. I mean, I\u2019m not, to my knowledge, coronavirus infected. To my knowledge, I haven\u2019t been fired.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how he hadn\u2019t been fired, having corrected the president so many times, he said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty interesting because to his [Trump\u2019s] credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens. He goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Fauci also described the process by which Trump prepares for briefings, which some say should not be carried live, given the president\u2019s use of the podium to attack reporters and his political enemies.</p> <p>\u201cWe sit down for an hour and a half,\u201d Dr Fauci said, \u201cgo over all the issues on the agenda. And then we proceed from there to an anteroom right in front of the Oval Office to talk about what are going to be the messages, what are the kind of things we\u2019re going to want to emphasize?</p> <p>\u201cThen we go in to see the president, we present to him and somebody writes a speech.

      "bodyText": "Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has not been fired. That might not seem much in the way of news but Dr Fauci is the public face of the US scientific community in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, and as such must regularly appear alongside Donald Trump at the White House podium. Across the US media, the doctor\u2019s reaction to every Trumpian claim, exaggeration or outright lie is frantically parsed for meaning, his occasional absence from the podium subject to national debate. In a brief interview with Science magazine published on Sunday, Dr Fauci, 79, was asked how it felt to \u201cstand there as the representative of truth and facts [when] things are being said that aren\u2019t true and aren\u2019t factual\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,\u201d he said. \u201cOK, he said it. Let\u2019s try and get it corrected for the next time.\u201d That, Dr Fauci said, involved members of the White House coronavirus taskforce who, \u201cthe next time they sit down with him and talk about what he\u2019s going to say, they will say, \u2018By the way, Mr President, be careful about this and don\u2019t say that.\u2019\u201d In one notable recent example, Trump spoke from the podium on Friday about the idea that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, might treat the coronavirus. Dr Fauci then knocked the claim down, gently. \u201cMany of the things out there are what I have called \u2018anecdotal reports\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe information that you\u2019re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can\u2019t make any definitive statement about it.\u201d He subsequently told the New York Times he did not want to \u201cembarrass\u201d Trump, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, \u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.\u201d Fauci told Science he was \u201csort of exhausted. But other than that, I\u2019m good. I mean, I\u2019m not, to my knowledge, coronavirus infected. To my knowledge, I haven\u2019t been fired.\u201d Asked how he hadn\u2019t been fired, having corrected the president so many times, he said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty interesting because to his [Trump\u2019s] credit, even though we disagree on some things, he listens. He goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.\u201d Dr Fauci also described the process by which Trump prepares for briefings, which some say should not be carried live, given the president\u2019s use of the podium to attack reporters and his political enemies. \u201cWe sit down for an hour and a half,\u201d Dr Fauci said, \u201cgo over all the issues on the agenda. And then we proceed from there to an anteroom right in front of the Oval Office to talk about what are going to be the messages, what are the kind of things we\u2019re going to want to emphasize? \u201cThen we go in to see the president, we present to him and somebody writes a speech. Then he gets up and ad libs on his speech. And then we\u2019re up there to try and answer questions.\u201d Asked how often he disagreed with the president, Dr Fauci said: \u201cI don\u2019t disagree in the substance. It is expressed in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject.\u201d He was also asked about a moment on Friday when Trump joked about the \u201cdeep state department\u201d and the doctor was seen to smile ruefully then rub his brow and jaw. It became an internet meme. Dr Fauci declined to comment. He was also asked about Trump\u2019s decision to refer to the coronavirus, the scientific name of which is Covid-19, as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. Would he ever do the same? \u201cNo.\u201d",

Lillis said: \u201cWe are calling on retailers to continue to improve their stores and procedures to help protect staff.\u201d The union welcomed the new measures being taken by supermarkets but said it wanted retailers to protect staff further with measures including: Limiting the number of customers in store at any one time. Increasing security. Telling customers to shop alone if possible and only buy what they need. Enforcing essential workers\u2019 and vulnerable people\u2019s shopping hours. Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, David Potts, said the company had employed 83 fitting teams to install protective screens at every checkout as soon as possible. \u201cThe wellbeing of colleagues is paramount,\u201d he said. It has also put hand sanitiser on all tills and marked out physical distancing points on store floors. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are understood to be reviewing measures to protect staff, such as potentially limiting the number of shoppers in stores at one time, but have not provided workers with masks. Tesco said it had introduced physical distancing measures, such as lines on the floor, around checkouts and queue barriers in large stores. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would now be asking customers to stand two metres away from each other and staff wherever possible and pay by card rather than cash at the tills. It will start installing acrylic screens at the end of this week. Sainsbury\u2019s is also handing hourly paid staff in its supermarkets, Argos chain, delivery network and customer contact centres a one-off 10% increase in hourly pay between 9 March and 5 April. Sainsbury\u2019s said the payment was in recognition of \u201cgoing above and beyond to serve customers during this challenging time\u201d. Asda has provided staff with gloves and hand sanitiser. It said it had also extended breaks so that employees could wash their hands more frequently and asked customers to pay by card whenever possible. One Tesco worker said: \u201cA lot of workers don\u2019t feel comfortable. They are trying to protect their workers, but there\u2019s not enough gloves and masks. Everyone\u2019s pretty responsible, a lot of people obviously concerned. Everyone has got a granny at home or young kids.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global coronavirus death toll passes 15,000 The number of people across the world who have died after contracting coronavirus now stands at over 15,300, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has been collating global data. The worldwide number of confirmed cases currently stands at 351,731. In Spain, one of Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries, the coronavirus death toll has reached 2,182, the total growing by 462 overnight. The death toll in Iran from the new coronavirus has increased to 1,812, with 127 new deaths in 24 hours. Upwards curve in infections \u2018may be flattening\u2019 in Germany There were signs that the exponential upwards curve in new coronavirus infections in Germany is levelling off for the first time because of the strict social distancing measures in force, the head of the country\u2019s public health institute has said. However, Lothar Wieler urged caution, saying many health authorities had not yet submitted their data from the weekend. \u201cI will only be able to confirm this trend definitively on Wednesday,\u201d he said. But he said he remained optimistic. Postponement of Tokyo Olympics under consideration The head of the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) said on Monday he would have to consider postponing the Games amid increasing calls from committees around the world to delay the event. \u201cFrom the athletes\u2019 point of view of safety and security, we have to come to a stage where we cannot help but consider things including postponement,\u201d the JOC president, Yasuhiro Yamashita, told reporters on Monday. However, he said too long a delay would be a burden to athletes given the possibility of having to qualify again, for example. Britain warns tougher measures on movement may be on way Britain\u2019s health secretary has accused those still socialising of \u201cvery selfish\u201d behaviour that risks the lives of NHS workers and others, as he signalled tougher restrictions on movement could be on the way. Matt Hancock said stricter rules such as curfews or further closures could come into place \u201cvery soon\u201d and urged people still socialising or going to holiday locations to \u201cstop it, and if you don\u2019t stop it then we\u2019re going to have to take more measures\u201d. French parliament votes for two-month \u2018health state of emergency\u2019 The move legalises the restrictive measures already taken \u2013 including the confinement introduced on 16 March \u2013 and gives the government power to legislate other emergency measures by decree. Indications are the French government will announce that the confinement-to-home regulations that were initially due to last two weeks will be extended on Monday following recommendations from the country\u2019s Covid-19 scientific committee. Markets slump as US Senate deadlocked over Covid-19 stimulus After stocks slumped in Asia overnight, European markets faced a rocky start. Among them was the UK-focused FTSE 250 share index, which was down 4.5% after nearly two hours of trading. This latest sell-off has been triggered by the news overnight that the US Senate failed to approve a massive funding package to combat the impact of coronavirus. Syria confirms first case of Covid-19 after weeks of denials. The patient is a 20-year-old woman who recently returned to Syria from an unspecified country and appropriate measures have been taken, the health minister, Nizar Yaziji, said. Fears are mounting of an outbreak that will have catastrophic consequences on the war-torn country. Philippines isolates hundreds of health workers More than 670 Filipino health workers have been quarantined over fears they were exposed to coronavirus, while others have resorted to using bin bags for protection as case numbers rise across much of south-east Asia. More than 50 million people in the Philippines remain under lockdown as the country\u2019s medical facilities struggle with a lack of testing kits and shortages of protective equipment. Wuhan\u2019s residents start to emerge from crisis Residents living in the city of 11 million people at the heart of the virus outbreak have been allowed to leave their residential compounds in small groups for the first time in weeks. Public transport is resuming and people are being allowed to return to work if the are certified healthy. Non-residents, stranded there since stringent travel restrictions went into effect on 23 January, can also begin applying to leave the city.

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.</p> <p>\u201cAn EV wouldn\u2019t work for me because \u2026\u201d<em> </em>is a familiar conversation starter. It\u2019s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter \u2013 but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a disconnect between the reality and the perception of electric vehicles (EV). Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers. \u201cAn EV wouldn\u2019t work for me because \u2026\u201d is a familiar conversation starter. It\u2019s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter \u2013 but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle. Emily Rice, Renault UK\u2019s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers\u2019 questions. I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I\u2019m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, Brighton Although it\u2019s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it\u2019s far from the only option.

For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking. Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to buy an EV, but don\u2019t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,\u201d says Rice. \u201cIt\u2019s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don\u2019t own an EV \u2013 but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.\u201d Based on data from the various infrastructure suppliers, it is estimated that 90% of charging is done at home or at work. Only 3% takes place en route to a destination, with the rest made up of people who \u201cgraze\u201d \u2013 charging in short bursts at the supermarket, the gym, or a municipal car park. Coffee shops are getting in on the act too, recognising that a half-hour charging cycle is even better than free wifi for creating a captive audience. It\u2019s worth noting that the notional \u201cfull charge\u201d is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank.

Both he and <strong>Dr Norman Swan</strong> said that once a lockdown ended there would be a resurgence, so any lockdown would effectively have to be sustained, or repeated, until a vaccine was available. </li> \n   <li>Kelly said that is why closing schools is such a big step \u2014 <strong>they would likely be closed all year. </strong></li> \n   <li>They said that all eyes were on China, which has not reported a resurgence of cases since lifting its lockdown provisions. </li> \n   <li>Professor <strong>Sharon Lewin, </strong>the director of the Doherty Institute, said that there were no specific treatment options available for Covid-19 at this point but they were being widely tested. <strong>She was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the development of some anti-viral treatments</strong> that might suppress both the symptoms and the spread of the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Paul Kelly</strong> agreed that health authorities in Australia <strong>needed to be clearer with their messaging.</strong></li> \n   <li>Kelly said that the situation in Australia was <strong>not comparable to the situation in Italy</strong> because Australia has tested and diagnosed a large number of very mild cases, while Italy\u2019s first 1,000 reported cases were \u201cvery serious\u201d. That meant Italy had missed many more cases than Australia, he said. </li> \n   <li><strong>Testing criteria in Australia will change in the next week</strong> as the number of overseas travellers drops dramatically, Kelly says. Testing has to date been focused on overseas travellers, but mandatory quarantine requirements and travel bans mean the number of travellers arriving had fallen significantly.</li> \n   <li><strong>Norman Swan </strong>suggested Australia was <strong>still missing asymptomatic cases of Covid-19</strong>, because it was not testing widely enough.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will leave our Australia-specific coverage of the coronavirus crisis there for tonight.

At all costs, we must prevent any Aboriginal deaths in custody from Covid-19. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Natsils also warned against blanket lockdowns or solitary confinement by prisons trying to manage a possible outbreak.

This will also allow more time to consolidate health system preparations and evaluate measures already implemented in Australia, and to learn from interventions in other countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It also explained the rationale for not recommending school closures, noting that \u201cone state [Victoria] has elected to bring forward Easter school holidays\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>AHPPC does not support the closure of schools given the lack of evidence of significant disease in children and the lack of reported major disease spreading in schools.</p> \n   <p>Furthermore, <strong>the closure of schools poses a major risk to children\u2019s education, mental health and wellbeing, particularly those from low socioeconomic regions</strong>, where schools provide an important environment for nurturing and learning. The impact on the critical workforce and potential <strong>exposure of elderly relatives caring for children is also of significance</strong>. School closure would achieve some degree of additional social distancing but the evidence of its benefit at this stage is minimal. </p> \n   <p>School closures are likely to be more effective when approaching the peak of the epidemic and enforced for a shorter period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T07:04:58.652Z\">at 7.04am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7855458f08e0999e6b8563\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T06:23:44.493Z\">6.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New South Wales senator <strong>Tony Sheldon</strong>, who was in a committee meeting with senators <strong>Rex Patrick</strong> and <strong>Andrew Bragg</strong>, both of whom have since tested positive to Covid-19, says that he is self-isolating but has no symptoms of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The statement from Sheldon\u2019s office reads:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Senator Sheldon has had no symptoms and has been self-isolating for 14 days, consistent with medical advice.

That means that if you contact Centrelink today about wanting to apply for unemployment benefits, but are unable to complete your application, <strong>you will be back paid from that first contact</strong>. (The government actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/13/coalition-warned-welfare-overhaul-could-worsen-poverty-and-unemployment\">abolished this in 2018 to save money</a>.)</p> \n  <p>Crucially, Robert said <strong>people starting a new Jobseeker Payment claim could verify their identity over the phone,</strong> rather than by submitting their documents at a Centrelink office. This change was slated for April and has apparently been brought forward.</p> \n  <p>That is, <strong>you do not need to go to a Centrelink office to complete your claim</strong>. In fact, Robert said there were fewer staff at the shopfronts due to social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>This does not get around the fact that getting through over the phone to Centrelink can take hours, let alone at a time like this.</p> \n  <p>Robert also said he was extending Centrelink call centre opening hours to 8am to 8pm (NSW time). The government is hiring up to 5,000 new staff at Services Australia to cater with demand, but it remains to be seen how quickly these employees can start.</p> \n  <p>Now, onto the <strong>MyGov website</strong>. Robert said the website suffered a DDoS attack (when a website is flooded with hits, essentially a cyber attack) but wouldn\u2019t give any more details.</p> \n  <p>He said the government had MyGov\u2019s upgraded capacity by 10 times.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s quickly recap the main points of that Q&amp;A special: Any mitigation measure Australia takes will need to remain in place until a vaccine is developed, which is about 18 months away, deputy chief health officer Professor Paul Kelly says. Kelly says the suggestion that a two or four-week lockdown would knock the spread of the virus on the head is incorrect. Both he and Dr Norman Swan said that once a lockdown ended there would be a resurgence, so any lockdown would effectively have to be sustained, or repeated, until a vaccine was available. Kelly said that is why closing schools is such a big step \u2014 they would likely be closed all year. They said that all eyes were on China, which has not reported a resurgence of cases since lifting its lockdown provisions. Professor Sharon Lewin, the director of the Doherty Institute, said that there were no specific treatment options available for Covid-19 at this point but they were being widely tested. She was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the development of some anti-viral treatments that might suppress both the symptoms and the spread of the virus. Paul Kelly agreed that health authorities in Australia needed to be clearer with their messaging. Kelly said that the situation in Australia was not comparable to the situation in Italy because Australia has tested and diagnosed a large number of very mild cases, while Italy\u2019s first 1,000 reported cases were \u201cvery serious\u201d. That meant Italy had missed many more cases than Australia, he said. Testing criteria in Australia will change in the next week as the number of overseas travellers drops dramatically, Kelly says. Testing has to date been focused on overseas travellers, but mandatory quarantine requirements and travel bans mean the number of travellers arriving had fallen significantly. Norman Swan suggested Australia was still missing asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, because it was not testing widely enough. We will leave our Australia-specific coverage of the coronavirus crisis there for tonight. You can follow our rolling global coverage here. Read a summary of the day\u2019s events in Australia here. Be well. We will see you in the morning. Paul Kelly agreed that authorities in. Australia did need to be clearer with their health messaging. Look,I think we need to be clearer with our messaging. I think that\u2019s come through from many sources. We\u2019re certainly listening to that. Kelly said he and chief health officer Professor Brendan Murphy had done 45 press conferences since 21 January and had a lot of information on the Australian health department website, as well as producing \u201cso many fact sheets.\u201d But he said that communication was \u201ca two way thing\u201d. \u201cPeople really are primed to listen\u201d. Paul Kelly said that controlling the epidemic was not a \u201ctwo or four week phenomenon, it\u2019s until we get the vaccine\u201d. Which, as he said earlier in the program, could take 18 months. We\u2019re all hoping for a vaccine in the future. If we get a vaccine that works and is effective, then we\u2019re protected and fantastic. We can really defeat this virus. If we go into lockdown as many people are suggesting we should do now, this is not a two or 4-week phenomenon, it\u2019s until we get the vaccine. If we do that, less people will be infected. Every time we take our foot off the brake... more people will get the infection. We can\u2019t completely eradicate this infection unless we get a vaccine. Hamish McDonald asked Paul Kelly if he the Australian modelling still showed that between 20% and 60% of the Australian population could get the virus. Kelly said the 60% figure would be an \u201cuncontrolled epidemic\u201d and the 20% prediction was \u201cwithout the major interventions that have gone into place this week and with potentially more to come\u201d. \u2018We are not two weeks behind Italy\u2019 One questioner asked if Australia was at risk of running out of ventilators, as has occurred in Italy. Paul Kelly said there was a \u201claser-like focus\u201d on Australia\u2019s current intensive care capacity. We\u2019ve been assured by our state and territory colleagues that a doubling of capacity is a relatively simple thing. A tripling of capacity is also possible. He said that the strongest mitigation measures in Australia were yet to have an impact on the number of cases detected, because they had only just been introduced. Kelly also warned against comparing Australia to Italy. Look, we are not Italy. I\u2019ve seen some people say when they look at the curves of what Norman is referring to, the epidemiological curve that we\u2019re two weeks behind Italy. We are not two weeks behind Italy. We\u2019ve been testing and finding many more mild cases. Italy mainly tested the top of the pyramid, the very serious cases that came into hospital. That\u2019s what their first 1,000 were. Our first 1,000 were mainly community cases. Mostly involved with travel from overseas. We\u2019ve only had 20 people through this whole period that have been in intensive care. We\u2019ve had seven deaths unfortunately. All in older people. The lower age is 77. The average age is 86. Some comments on vaccines and possible treatment. Sharon Lewin is the director of the Doherty Institute, one of the organisations in Australia working on vaccines and treatments. Lewin said that developing a vaccine was key but while that was being developed \u2014 which could take 12 to 18 months in the best case scenario \u2014 there were some treatment options being explored. We have no specific treatment for the virus.People get better on their own. Or they get better because they receive supportive care in hospital. But if we had a treatment at anti-viral drug, that blocked replication of the virus, it could potentially do two things. It could potentially improve outcome. People don\u2019t get so sick and don\u2019t die. Or also reduce transmission because most virus transmission is related to how much virus you have onboard. She said they were trialling an anti-arthritis drug which \u201creduced the amount of virus that we could measure in someone\u2019s swab\u201d. And we can actually measure the amount of it accurately and it definitely decreased with this particular arthritis drug. One thing we might see in the not so distant future is a lot of understanding about drugs that block replication and that could have implications for both clinical outcome as well as how infectious you are. I\u2019m a little optimistic about that. A few quick fire questions: Can grandparents look after young children while this crisis is underway? No, the experts say. It\u2019s too much of a risk and you can\u2019t rely on children to stay at least 1.5m away from vulnerable older people. Can you swim in the ocean, or a chlorinated pool if you\u2019re on quarantine? No, you are quarantined. The experts say that means you can\u2019t go out \u2014 not to swim in the ocean, not to bush walk. Will the change of seasons \u2014 heading into winter \u2014 make the coronavirus threat worse in Australia? Yes, winter does make things more difficult but not because coronavirus will be. worse. It will be more difficult because it will coincide with flu season, which already puts a pressure on the health system. Is it true that the virus can\u2019t survive hot temperatures? Can you kill it by drinking tea? No. There is no magic cure. Paul Kelly said school closures was one of the potential things Australia could do to flatten the curve and would be considered at some point. When pressed on why Australia does not do it straight away, he said: \u201cwhen you have a range of interventions, it\u2019s hard to know which one would work the best\u201d. Norman Swan said Australia had only a \u201cpartially targeted testing campaign. We\u2019re missing asymptomatics. So we don\u2019t have the best possible... we have an inadequate testing regime. We have an inadequate quarantine regime which relies on trust...And therefore we\u2019re not actually under control and the hockey stick illustrates that. It\u2019s doubling every two or three days. That means we need much stronger social distancing \u2014 including closing schools, Swan said. School closures \u2018not a two or four-week thing\u2019 Question four is from a senior high school student who says she is anxious about the impact of Covid-19 on her education. We\u2019re in one of the most stressful years of our lives and the additional stress from the way this pandemic is being treated can only be detrimental, affecting our mental, if not physical, health. Does the panel think that keeping schools open is the appropriate way to deal with this situation? What do you see as the long-term impact on the mental health of students? Sharon Lewin says there is \u201cgreat divisions in what experts are saying\u201d on school closures. Paul Kelly said that early data from Wuhan showed that children got sick in \u201cvery, very low numbers\u201d. Second of all, all of those cases and this is what has been found in other countries, tend to have come from the parents. Not amongst children. Very different to flu. Closing schools is a big thing. What we\u2019ve been trying to do right throughout this is to look at proportionate responses, what needs to be done now, thinking of that long-term game. What is sustainable over the long term? This is not a two or four-week thing. If schools close, they are closed for at least the next six months, probably for the whole school year....That\u2019s a life-changing event. We can\u2019t make these decisions lightly and they may have a place at some point. Paul Kelly says that the monitoring and testing of arrivals in Australia has been stronger than Norman Swan suggests. But he also says it\u2019s possible that the virus circulated in Australia before border checks were put in place. I believe there probably has been some circulation in the community. Perhaps as far back as January before we recognised the issue in Wuhan. Question three was from South Australian senator Rex Patrick, who tested positive to Covid-19 after being exposed to Senator Andrew Bragg, who caught Covid-19 at a wedding in rural NSW that has been linked to 35 confirmed cases. Patrick is asymptomatic, but was able to get a test because he was a known contact of Bragg, a confirmed case. But Bragg was not able to get tested immediately, because he did not meet the criteria. Said Patrick: Why is the test criteria so strict? Can you see how 10 minutes two weeks ago could have saved so much time and significantly reduced the risk of my infecting anyone? Paul Kelly said that 35 of the 140 guests at that wedding has been diagnosed with Covid-19, making it a \u201csuper spreading event\u201d. It demonstrates firstly how infectious this is. It\u2019s much more infectious than flu. Kelly said testing was focused on cases where it was \u201cmost likely to be positive\u201d. That\u2019s because of resourcing, he says. Up to this point it\u2019s most likely to be in people that have been returning from overseas. More than half still more than half of the cases of the 1,709 cases we have in Australia directly came from an overseas traveller. Hamish McDonald asks if that\u2019s a self-proving pattern \u2014 by mainly testing people who return from overseas, aren\u2019t we going to get more positives from people who have returned from overseas? Kelly says yes, it is, but he reiterates that we have a shortage of tests and need to remain targeted. He reiterates that the rate of testing in Australia has been higher than places like the US. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says the testing protocols in Australia will change \u201cthis week\u201d. Mostly the guidelines for testing are about a travel component and the travel is decreasing. Kelly said that Australia had looked \u201cvery carefully\u201d at the 30,000 people who have arrived in Australia on international flights in recent months. So that was one of the reasons why we\u2019ve gone to this new way of doing it, making sure anyone that comes in from any country must- and this is a must and a message to everyone out there that\u2019s comeback in this period - they must self-isolate. He said the procedures for enforcing that differ in each state. Some states require people to sign a statutory declaration upon arrival committing to self-isolate. Question two is about what is happening when people arrive at airports in Australia, from a man who flew in to Brisbane international on Friday. The question: Upon arrival there were no thermal cameras, no thermometers, no testing, nothing, just a few minor questions and a pamphlet.Customs officers, Border Force officials and duty free attendants were not wearing masks. Is this a strange and negligent as we think it was? Norman Swan is up first. One of the problems that\u2019s been throughout this whole episode so far has been contradictions. It\u2019s unsettled the public. And we talk about the borders, closing the borders, and people\u2019s experience of that has been different. And we\u2019ve seen cruise ships discharging and it\u2019s a common story that they\u2019ve got off at the airport and they walk straight through and they know there might be a problem. And they don\u2019t seem to be paying attention to it. Sharon Lewin says that public health relies on trust and education of the public. At the moment it has been an issue of trust. I still am a strong believer that\u2019s the best way to practice public health, educating and empowering the public but we may need to increase the levels of observation because of the significance of all the community when people don\u2019t stay in self-isolation. She suggested that increased observation could include tracking of mobile phones, or apps as used in Singapore. Paul Kelly said Australian officials had been in touch with the Singapore ministry of health, but that Australia was \u201ca different country to Singapore\u201d. Kelly said that in his 30 years working in public health, \u201cI have always been able to trust people once they\u2019ve got the message clearly about what\u2019s required, that they will do the right thing\u201d. Kelly said Australian officials were \u201ccertainly looking at the powers that are available under public health acts in all the state sand territories and indeed the biosecurity act...to do things if it is deemed necessary\u201d. But he conceded that Australia had to date not put those stronger tracking measures in place. Question one is from Chris McMeniman, who says his parents and younger brother, who has special needs, are stuck in a cruise ship off the coast of South America with 150 other Australians and cannot, at this stage, get home. They had been on a cruise to Antarctica. Paul Kelly says that DFAT is aware of the situation and trying to help bring Chris\u2019s family, and other Australians stuck overseas, back home. He said 3,000 Australians are currently stuck on 30 cruise ships around the world. Q&amp;A host Hamish McDonald, who is socially-distanced from two of his three guests, has invited deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly to make an opening statement. This is serious. No-one expected 2020 to start as it has. We\u2019ve had bushfires. We\u2019ve had floods. And now this virus. So whilst we\u2019ve been preparing for many years for a pandemic similar to this, this is unexpected at this time. The world has changed. Australia has changed. And we\u2019re all in this together \u2014 young and old \u2014 and we all need to play our part to get past this crisis that we\u2019re in. I want people tonight to really start listening to the messages. Listen to the experts. We\u2019ve got two others on the program tonight. Listen to them. Keep safe. Keep calm. And keep your distance. Meanwhile, if you are one of the thousands sadly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes has written a guide to help you learn if you are eligible for support. I will be blogging Q&amp;A\u2019s \u2018Ask the doctors\u2019 special, which will begin shortly. On the panel is deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly; the director of the Doherty Institute and a leading infectious diseases expert, Professor Sharon Lewin; and Dr Norman Swan, presenter of the health report on Radio National and the podcast Coronacast. Before Q&amp;A starts, let\u2019s take a look at where we stand. The federal government has extended the $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement to full-time students on Youth Allowance, Abstudy and Austudy, as tens of thousands of people face unemployment due to hospitality shutdowns. The coronavirus stimulus bill passed the lower house and is being debated in the Senate. Social distancing rules came into effect at 12pm today. Across Australia, cafes, casinos, pubs, clubs, places of worship, gyms and cinemas are closed, and weddings and funerals can only occur if people are provided with four square metres of space per person to a maximum of 100 guests or mourners. Takeaway and delivery for food and beverages is still permitted. South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will close their borders to domestic travellers tomorrow. All non-essential entrants will be required to undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation. Queensland\u2019s borders will close on Wednesday. Tasmanian borders are already closed. Schools in the ACT and Victoria have closed until at least 13 April, when the school closure will be reviewed. Elsewhere, schools are still open but parents have been told they won\u2019t be penalised for keeping their kids at home. In NSW, parents have been told that while schools will be open they should keep their kids at home, if possible. The NRL has suspended its 2020 season, following an earlier call by the AFL. A similar announcement is expected by the A-League tomorrow morning. The Australian Olympic Committee has told athletes that the 2020 Tokyo Games are unlikely to proceed. The Australian stock market fell 5.6% today. On the issue of school closures in New South Wales, Guardian Australia\u2019s Dave Earley received this email from a public school in Sydney. This morning, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said schools would remain open but encouraged parents to keep their children home if possible. According to one particular school, only parents with \u201cessential\u201d jobs should send their kids to school, where \u201csupervision will be provided for children who attend\u201d. No wonder parents are confused. The government\u2019s decision to expand the $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement to full-time students could be expected to impact about 250,000 people across the country. Government data shows there were about 200,000 students receiving Youth Allowance, as well as 36,000 who get Austudy and about 30,000 Abstudy recipients. These students will now get the coronavirus supplement, joining recipients of Jobseeker Payment, Youth Allowance (Jobseeker), Parenting Payment (Partnered and Single), Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit recipients. Student unions had said that full-time students were facing the prospect of quitting their studies to claim the unemployment benefit when their casual and part-time work dried up in the coming weeks and months. In response to questions from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, the government said it had no plans to expand the payment to disability support pensioners, or other payment recipients. However, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, will have the power to expand eligibility to the coronavirus supplement over the next six months under an amendment to the stimulus package legislation. Western Australia has recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of cases as of 5pm Perth time today to 140. Seven of the new cases relate to cruise ships: six passengers from the Ruby Princess and one from the Ovation of the Seas, all of whom returned to Perth from Sydney by plane. From 1.30pm tomorrow, anyone entering WA from interstate will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The premier, Mark McGowan, said health services in WA had conducted 450 tests in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of tests completed in WA to 10,000. More than 1,200 tests were in regional areas. Twelve Covid-19 patients in WA remain in hospital in Perth, while six of the 140 cases are confirmed to have fully recovered. In news that will delight hundreds of thousands of students across the country, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has told the Senate the government will extend the $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement to full-time students. Cormann said that the social services minister, Anne Ruston, will expand the supplement to people who receive Youth Allowance (Student), Austudy and Abstudy. Cormann: The minister intends to use this power to make student payments, Abstudy, Austudy and Youth Allowance (Student), and to make changes to the partner income test, and to essentially make sure they are captured by the coronavirus supplement arrangement. Austudy recipients currently receive about $460 a fortnight, less than jobseekers. They will now receive $550 a fortnight extra. Labor and the Greens, as well as welfare groups and student unions, had raised concerns that students who lost casual and part-time work would struggle to make ends meet during the looming economic downturn. The Western Australian government has provided an updated statement on the cruise ship MSC Magnifica, which is due to arrive in Fremantle at 5am tomorrow. It confirmed no passengers or crew would leave the ship and said communications with the ship had been \u201cinconsistent\u201d. Earlier, the premier, Mark McGowan, said that the ship had called the government requesting that its 1,700 passengers be allowed to disembark, and also that about 250 people on board had reported upper respiratory illness. But the operator MSC Cruises said that it did not intend for any crew or passengers to disembark in Perth, and denied that anyone on board was unwell with symptoms consistent with Covid-19. A few minutes ago, the WA government issued this statement: The cruise vessel Magnifica will make a refuelling stop at Fremantle tomorrow morning, but no passengers or crew will be disembarking. Over the past 24 hours the vessel had provided inconsistent advice to both the state and federal governments, about the health of its passengers and its intentions around disembarkation. The state government\u2019s position was clear this morning. That position was based on the latest information received from the cruise company. MSC Cruises now advises that all passengers and crew are \u2018well\u2019 or don\u2019t suffer from any \u2018respiratory diseases\u2019. WA Police and Border Force will be at the port tomorrow morning to monitor the refuel exercise. In this environment we cannot take risks and we will always put the Western Australian community first. It is a big night for television newsreaders, who are trying to sum up a truly dizzying amount of news in one succinct message. On the ABC\u2019s 7.30, the presenter Leigh Sales delivered a strong message on personal accountability, saying to her audience: \u201cYou are our best hope of stopping coronavirus.\u201d Your individual behaviour is the most important thing to prevent it spreading and everything else flows from that. So far, many Australians are behaving as if for some reason we\u2019re magically immune from going through the tragedy unfolding in Italy. We\u2019re not and unless people change their behaviour that\u2019s exactly what will happen. And on Nine News, veteran broadcaster Peter Overton went with a straight but powerful narration of all the unthinkable ways that Australia has changed in just one day. On Channel Nine, Peter Overton said: Eighty-eight thousand people have lost their jobs. The NRL is suspending the 2020 season. The Olympics won\u2019t go ahead this year. Queensland has closed its borders to us, 3,000 Australians are stranded on cruise ships around the world, and we can\u2019t go to the pub for a drink. If I told you six weeks ago this would happen, you would think I was making it up. Well, all of these things happened in one day. Today. Anglican schools in WA tell students to stay home Adding to the confusion about school closures, the Anglican Schools Commission in Western Australia is now telling parents that they should not send their kids to school tomorrow. A letter sent to the parents of students at John Septimus Roe school in Mirrabooka said that the Anglican Schools Commission of WA had agreed to a \u201cbroad directive\u201d that \u201cfrom Tuesday, 24 March 2020 (tomorrow), all parents are urged to keep their children home from all ASC schools\u201d. It said that teaching staff would take the next four days, from Tuesday to Friday, to finalise preparations to deliver remote online classes from next Monday, 30 March. School holidays in WA do not start until 10 April. \u201cWe urge all families to take this response seriously. Please ensure you keep your children AT HOME, in the interests of their health and the health of the wider community,\u201d the letter read. Schools in WA remain open, but the premier, Mark McGowan, said today that there would be no penalties for parents who chose to keep their kids at home. It\u2019s the same confused position as applies in every state other than Victoria and the ACT, which are closing schools from tomorrow. If you missed it earlier, the government services minister Stuart Robert in question time backtracked on an earlier claim that the MyGov website had come under a DDoS attack. In fact, it was overwhelmed by demand as thousands of people were made unemployed by shutdowns in response to the coronavirus. This is from Josh Taylor\u2019s report: MyGov had last week been able to cope with about 6,000 users logging on at once, but Robert said this was upgraded to 55,000 over the weekend in expectation that many more Australians would have been logging on after the increase in business shutdowns as a result of the coronavirus pandemic forcing more people into unemployment. Robert told the parliament that about 95,000 people were trying to access MyGov at once, causing the DDoS alarms to trigger. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it wasn\u2019t a cyber attack, \u201cit was an incompetence attack\u201d. The shadow minister for government services, Bill Shorten, went further and accused Robert on Twitter of lying about the attack, and suggested the minister should lose his job. Read the full piece here. And as Luke Henriques-Gomes said earlier, if you are unfortunately one of the many queuing for Centrelink this week, please be kind to the staff. This is awful and no one is immune. The Victorian Farmers Federation has clarified one point of confusion caused by the Victorian and New South Wales governments suggesting, on Sunday, that they would move to closing non-essential services. To be absolutely clear: at this stage, there are no further closures planned except those announced by the prime minister on Sunday night, and schools closing in Victoria and the ACT. It is likely that further shutdown measures will be announced over the coming weeks. But nothing has been announced at this stage. Importantly, the VFF has confirmed there will be no restrictions to agriculture. They tweeted this statement: It continues: We understand there are many questions. The simple answer is that we are working to ensure the whole agriculture/agribusiness supply chain remains open and viable. The important thing is that we are all working together to secure the future of our agricultural industry and continuing to produce to feed Victorians during these trying times. Parliament has been suspended until August. A sign, if you needed one, that this will not all be over in two to four weeks. Back to the Senate briefly, where the coronavirus economic response package is being debated. One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has told the Senate \u201cthe government must engage effectively to keep us all up to date with facts\u201d. If anyone wanted evidence that we are living in dark and unusual times, there it is. Roberts confirms One Nation will vote in favour of the package, although it has two reservations: It has previously opposed the business growth fund, suggesting it will \u201cwipe out opposition to the banks\u201d. It is concerned about $115bn of loans from the RBA and government \u2013 although it appears he incorrectly believes this will be spent on \u201csecuritised mortgages\u201d, not small business lending. The University of Western Australia has confirmed that one of its students has tested positive to Covid-19 but says they did not attend campus while unwell. The student flew in to Perth on an international flight on Wednesday, went to a testing centre before going home to self-isolate, and \u201chas not visited the UWA campus nor had contact with any member of the UWA community\u201d. Vice-Chancellor professor Jane den Hollander said there was \u201cno risk to our campus community from this case\u201d. Earlier, the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick recounted to Radio National his experience with Covid-19, contracting it from Liberal senator Andrew Bragg and then testing positive 8 days later. Patrick has done contact tracing with SA Health, suggesting they will now contact people who spent 20min within a metre or two hours in a room with him. Patrick said Bragg had symptoms but couldn\u2019t get tested for a few days because he hadn\u2019t been overseas or had confirmed contact with someone who had been infected: That\u2019s left a situation where until he found out he\u2019d been to the wedding in NSW where a number of people had been infected, he wasn\u2019t eligible for a test. Had the testing criteria been looser, he would\u2019ve found out much sooner, and I would\u2019ve found out much sooner, and I would\u2019ve self-isolated sooner. I think as we get more test kits available we should be testing perhaps more people. On social distancing, he said: I think it\u2019s really important that people take this seriously. Clearly it can be caught by anyone from a senator to a janitor. And people have to be careful, they have to listen to all the government messaging on this. The scenes we saw on Bondi Beach - [were] totally unacceptable. Take it seriously, people. Crown Burswood employees told to stay home Employees at Crown Resorts\u2019 Perth casino have been told they are not to come to work from 5pm today (Monday), unless told otherwise. \u201cThere will be some roles that continue as normal until further notice and relevant staff will be advised of this,\u201d staff were told in an internal bulletin, obtained by Guardian Australia. We will be in contact with all staff in coming days around what assistance and support is available. Staff numbers for the Perth casino were not immediately available but Crown employs 18,500 people in Australia, about 12,000 of whom work at the company\u2019s flagship Melbourne operation. Casinos across Australia were shut at midday on Monday as part of a broader clampdown on areas where people congregate, designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants and places of worship are also closed. \u201cWe will continue to speak to government regarding next steps for Crown and our people,\u201d the company said in the staff bulletin. Crown\u2019s casinos had been operating under controversial exemptions from earlier social distancing rules given by state health authorities. The company has been approached for comment. Earlier, in the lower house. Back to the Senate now. Greens senator, Nick McKim, has spoken on the coronavirus stimulus bills, calling for Australia to \u201cleave nobody behind\u201d and not to go back to business as usual afterwards. \u201cWe can\u2019t have rampant inequality in the good times and socialising the losses in the bad times,\u201d he said, calling for Australia to create \u201ca more caring economic and social framework\u201d. McKim is rattling off statistics to show times were tough for some \u2013 even \u201cbefore the crisis\u201d \u2013 citing rates of homelessness, rental stress, and insecure work. On the bills themselves, McKim says they are \u201cnot guided by the neoliberal ideology ... [because] the ideology of free markets is completely and provably unable to look after people, [it] destroys nature, and it does that in the good time and the bad\u201d. McKim calls on the government to adopt a similar whole-of-society approach to climate change, noting that global heating will cause an estimated $630tn of damage over a century, dwarfing Covid-19. The Greens have submitted many sheet of amendments to extend the corona supplement to students and close other gaps in eligibility. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally has commended the objective of these and said Labor also raised these with the government \u2013 but there is no point passing them in the Senate if they will be rejected by the government in the lower house. So they are doomed. The Star Entertainment Group, which operates casinos in Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, has released a fairly opaque statement in response to the social distancing rules that came into force at 12pm today. Under the national rules, restaurants, clubs, bars, and casinos are among the venues to close. Crown announced today that it had closed basically everything except its hotel and accomodation services, with some food and beverage outlets possibly remaining open for delivery or takeaway only. Here\u2019s the statement from Star: The Star respects the additional social distancing restrictions announced by the Federal and State governments to curb the spread of Covid-19. As one of the country\u2019s largest tourism and entertainment employers, we are working through the significant impacts on our business. The priority at present is to make sure we keep our valued team members informed about what this means for them and our properties in Sydney, Brisbane and Gold Coast. We will provide further updates at the appropriate time. Government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, has introduced the coronavirus safety net package to the Senate. Labor\u2019s deputy Senate leader, Kristina Keneally, is speaking about the opposition\u2019s support for the \u201cbasic support package ... designed to keep Australian families going\u201d. Keneally referred to queues forming outside Centrelink offices, with Australians waiting \u201canxiously and patiently\u201d, which she described as \u201chorrific scenes on a scale not seen before and I hope not to see again\u201d. She said: These are all people we know \u2013 our family members, friends, neighbours, and whether they are baristas, chefs, bartenders and flight attendants, they are all our fellow Australians. Keneally warns that 88,000 people are estimated to have lost jobs in hospitality alone and up to another 200,000 in the next 12 weeks \u2013 enough people \u201cwithout a pay packet\u201d to fill the MCG almost three times over. Keneally says the government has not addressed some gaps and concerns identified by Labor: There is no \u201csubstantial support to protect jobs or guarantees business receiving support will keep people on\u201d. Concerns the measures will \u201carrive too late\u201d. Renters have no direct support (yet - wait til national cabinet on Tuesday). Students are \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d but there is no coronavirus supplement for them, even if their hours are cut. No provisions for 1.6m temporary visa holders \u201csoon to be trapped here with no income and no access to income support\u201d. Provisions to access superannuation \u201cat the bottom of the market\u201d as a \u201clast resort\u201d suggest the government has not done enough to support people. Keneally flags that the government is considering a possible Labor amendment about the income test for safety measures. All flights out of Dubai cancelled for two weeks Just a quick update on that news on Emirates flights being cancelled \u2013 they are not the only airline that will be affected. The United Arab Emirates is suspending all inbound and outbound flights for two weeks, starting from Wednesday. So Emirates is not the only airline grounded. Etihad is the other major airline affected. This is from Associated Press: The United Arab Emirates, home to the world\u2019s busiest international airport, announced early on Monday that it was suspending all passenger and transit flights for two weeks to stymie the spread of the new coronavirus. The announcement came a day after the first cases were reported in the Gaza Strip and Syria, where years of conflict have severely degraded the local health care infrastructure. The new cases also raised fears about other vulnerable areas, like war-torn Libya and Yemen. Dubai\u2019s airport is a vital hub connecting Western nations with countries in Asia and Australia, and suspending transit flights there affects travellers around the world. It continues: The UAE\u2019s emergency and crisis management body and its Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that the decision to stop all commercial flights, including even transit flights, would take effect in 48 hours. The aviation authority said cargo and emergency evacuation flights would be exempt from the ban. On the heels of on that news, Mike Hytner says that the Football Federation Australia have called a press conference for 10am on Tuesday. It is expected the A-League will follow the NRL in suspending its season. NRL chair Peter V\u2019Landys said the decision to suspend the season was taken on Monday afternoon, in response to the evolving crisis and changing health advice. Due to the rapid rate of infection, we can no longer guarantee the safety of our players. Accordingly, we are suspending the 2020 NRL season. Earlier, the NRL announced it will close its offices from Tuesday until at least 1 May, forcing hundreds of staff across all departments to take annual leave. NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg said the shutdown was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the league and that \u201cthe game\u2019s cost base will need to be reset and that cost base is across the entire sport\u201d. That could include pay cuts to all players and himself, Greenberg said. Asked whether the season would be played at some stage this year, V\u2019Landys said the league had \u201cleft it open at the moment\u201d. All options are still on table. But what\u2019s paramount to our decision making is the health of our players. We\u2019ve never encountered a financial situation like this. This is a financial crisis. It\u2019s the biggest financial challenge the game has faced in its history. V\u2019Landys said rugby league will \u201calways be around\u201d but he could not guarantee it would return in the same form. He repeated earlier comments, for which he was criticised, that the NRL would be seeking some financial stimulus from the government. As a billion dollar business you want to stimulate the economy ... we are a major tax payer and if you want to make sure you get those taxes into the future you look after us right now. The NRL has suspended its 2020 season. Chairman Peter V\u2019landys, speaking at a press conference now, said they had \u201cno other option\u201d. The league had tried desperately to keep the competition going, hanging on longer than codes like the AFL. NRL offices have been closed until 1 May and all staff have been asked to take their annual leave immediately. Players have been told not to turn up to training tomorrow. The Australian War Memorial is closing indefinitely The Australian War Memorial is the latest public site in Canberra to close its doors to the public, in compliance with health advice on minimising the spread of the coronavirus. The National Gallery of Australia, National Library of Australia, and Old Parliament House have also closed. Here\u2019s the statement from the war memorial. The council and corporate management of the Australian War Memorial have decided to close the Memorial to the public from Tuesday 24 March 2020 until further notice. In line with the latest national health advice, the decision was made that all public spaces and programs within Memorial grounds, including galleries, the Reading Room, and the Last Post Ceremony, will be closed indefinitely. These measures will be effective from the conclusion of the Last Post Ceremony this evening. The health and safety of our visitors, veteran community, staff and volunteers remains the top priority for the Australian War Memorial. The decision to close the Memorial to the public has been made with the wider community in mind. Where we can transition some programs to an online and/or digital delivery only, we will look to do so. The Memorial will go ahead with a private, nationally televised Anzac Day commemorative service on 25 April 2020, to be broadcast live by the ABC and streamed online. Emirates has suspended all passenger flights for two weeks, starting on Wednesday 25 March. In a statement, the airline said they were acting in accordance with a directive from the UAE government. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused to our customers and travellers. These measures are in place to contain the spread of Covid-19, and we hope to resume services as soon as feasible. Customers have been told not to call to cancel affected flights but need to fill out a travel voucher request in order to be able to re-book. The decision has already affected flights out of Australia. Some people have reported that they were not told by Emirates that their flight had been cancelled. The moves makes it even more difficult for Australians desperately trying to get home in case border controls tighten further and for non-Australians trying to join family overseas. The national peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services (Natsils),has called on the prime minister and premiers to consider the early release of prisoners from prisons to protect them from a possible outbreak of Covid-19. In a statement, Natsils said it raised the issue in a meeting with the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, on Monday. The statement said: We, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS), are calling for national leadership from the prime minister, attorney general and all levels of state and territory government to take immediate action to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in prison, including early release. Most of our people in prison have chronic health issues and are living with disability; they are most at risk. With the over-representation of our people in prison, our lives are on the line. People in prison are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. This is why we are calling for immediate early release, particularly people who are on remand, women who are victims of family violence and sentenced for lesser offences like fines and public order offences, young people and those most at risk of transmitting Covid-19, like elderly and people with health conditions. At all costs, we must prevent any Aboriginal deaths in custody from Covid-19. Natsils also warned against blanket lockdowns or solitary confinement by prisons trying to manage a possible outbreak. It comes as prisons have suspended all visits for the time being. Courts suspended new jury trials last week, and some other court hearings have been delayed. We discussed with minister Wyatt the impact of Covid-19 in remote communities. Right now, our lives depend on having full access to social safety nets without any strings attached. Bush courts and circuit courts have now stopped, and ATSILS are working on ways to provide services without face to face contact to remote communities. When courts resume, this will place unprecedented need on our legal services. We require urgent additional resources to adequately respond to this pandemic. This pandemic will have a huge impact on our communities, our lives, and our services for many months to come. It is vital that the prime minister and all levels of government act now to show leadership for First Nations people. Western Australia has opened a new coronavirus testing clinic in the Perth suburb of Armadale. Another clinic will open in Rockingham tomorrow and two will open in Midland and Joondalup respectively on Wednesday. That brings the number of coronavirus fever clinics in WA to eight. For our Western Australian readers, fever clinics are already open from 8am to 8pm at Royal Perth Hospital, Fiona Stanley Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. A regional clinic at the Bunbury Health Campus is open from 10am to 4pm. The clinics were set up to take the pressure off the ordinary hospital system, but people who are not near a fever clinic can still go to their local hospital, although they are advised to call ahead if they believe they may have Covid-19. All states have now stood up similar clinics \u2013 lists can be found on state and territory health department websites. Some explanation from the AHPPC on shutdowns, school closures On Monday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 the experts who have been advising the government on its response to Covid-19 \u2013 published the rationale behind its most recent recommendations including that non-essential services close down. It said: The recent rapid influx in imported cases and associated chains of transmission, including cruise ships and super-spreader events, means we do need to do more now. It is too soon for the measures introduced only last week to have impacted on the epidemiology, but we are seeing evidence of non-compliance with these new measures, people not taking this seriously. We have also now had two \u2018super spreader\u2019 events in Sydney \u2013 one a wedding (35 infected) and one at a church service. There is a strong argument to do more, at least in the short term, to enforce the new way of life in social distancing that we will have to endure and to adapt the community mindset. This will also allow more time to consolidate health system preparations and evaluate measures already implemented in Australia, and to learn from interventions in other countries. It also explained the rationale for not recommending school closures, noting that \u201cone state [Victoria] has elected to bring forward Easter school holidays\u201d. AHPPC does not support the closure of schools given the lack of evidence of significant disease in children and the lack of reported major disease spreading in schools. Furthermore, the closure of schools poses a major risk to children\u2019s education, mental health and wellbeing, particularly those from low socioeconomic regions, where schools provide an important environment for nurturing and learning. The impact on the critical workforce and potential exposure of elderly relatives caring for children is also of significance. School closure would achieve some degree of additional social distancing but the evidence of its benefit at this stage is minimal. School closures are likely to be more effective when approaching the peak of the epidemic and enforced for a shorter period. New South Wales senator Tony Sheldon, who was in a committee meeting with senators Rex Patrick and Andrew Bragg, both of whom have since tested positive to Covid-19, says that he is self-isolating but has no symptoms of Covid-19. The statement from Sheldon\u2019s office reads: Senator Sheldon has had no symptoms and has been self-isolating for 14 days, consistent with medical advice. He did not meet the criteria for testing, but in light of this development will seek further medical advice. It\u2019s amazing what can happen when the parliament works together \u2013 the third reading for the coronavirus stimulus bill is now being read. And agreed on the voices. On that very depressing note (and I have the feeling there will be lot more of them coming), I will hand you over to the wonderful Calla Wahlquist. I\u2019ll be back with you tomorrow morning. Until then, please, take care of you. Again, this is what Australia is facing at this point. There are thousands of people in lines at Centrelink (now called Services Australia), desperate for help. Absolutely desperate. And again, this is the first day of this being available. Kristina Keneally appeared on Sky News a little earlier and brought up the issues over the Ruby Princess cruise ship and Scott Morrison blaming NSW authorities: You have to question the extent to which this national cabinet is working effectively. If you have in this circumstance, the commonwealth pointing fingers at the state of NSW for what is essentially a border responsibility. Now last time I checked under our laws, borders are the responsibility of the commonwealth government. And this government, backed into a corner by a mistake that has allowed some 50, nearly 50 and climbing I suspect, number of coronavirus cases to come off this Ruby Princess. ... This is a case where the commonwealth, the prime minister himself, stood up in front of the nation and said for the next 30 days there will be no cruise ships. Now somebody made an exemption for these four ships; it would have had to have been the commonwealth. They are now trying to duck and weave around that and shoot the blame home to Gladys Berejiklian \u2013 the premier of NSW \u2013 and her state government. It is their border responsibility and it\u2019s their responsibility to ensure that if people are coming off ships or aeroplanes, they should be temperature tested. The coronavirus stimulus bill is still being debated. It will reach the Senate tonight. The Senate is expected to pass it. If it doesn\u2019t manage that, parliament will sit for another day tomorrow, where it will remain the only thing on the agenda, other than question time. School has broken in Victoria for the last time this term, with school holidays brought forward. The ACT will be moving students to an online lesson plan from tomorrow. Schools in the rest of the country remain open, although parents may remove their children if they wish. The Australian stock exchange closed down 5.6% after government measures shuttered vast swathes of the economy, with the threat of more to come. Monday\u2019s losses come on top of a month of selling, punctuated by the occasional surge, that has driven the benchmark ASX200 index down from 7,162 at the close of trade on 20 February to 4,546 \u2013 a loss of more than 36%. The biggest loser among the top 200 listed companies was debt collector Credit Corp. Changes to the law announced as part of the Morrison government\u2019s stimulus package on Sunday night mean the threshold for bankrupting someone will increase from $4,000 to $20,000, depriving the company of one of its key debt collection weapons. Radio network operator Southern Cross Media also shed more than 30% of its value. After the market closed, casino operator Crown Resorts said it was closing everything at its Melbourne and Perth operations apart from accommodation, which will continue \u201cin a reduced capacity\u201d. It has also shut its London casino, Aspinalls. The company did not say what will happen to its 18,500 staff. With the NRL and FFA still awaiting advice from the government and health officials before following most other sports in shutting down their leagues, Super Netball has announced it will not start as planned at the beginning of May. Australia\u2019s premier netball competition will be deferred until at least 30 June. The league\u2019s commission will review the situation before the end of May and, based on the latest medical advice and government regulation, will determine whether the season start date should be extended out further. The competition\u2019s official pre-season tournament, the Team Girls Cup, had already been cancelled. The National Library of Australia has closed: Due to the need to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the National Library of Australia building has been closed to visitors until further notice \u2013 this includes the reading rooms, Exhibition Galleries, bookshop and cafes. \u201cWe have made the decision to temporarily close our doors as part of the nation\u2019s ongoing management of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d said Director-General of the National Library of Australia, Dr Marie-Louise Ayres. \u201cThis is following the updated advice and restrictions announced by the Australian and ACT Governments on public gatherings.\u201d Despite the public closure, Dr Ayres confirmed that staff will continue working behind the scenes to keep all the Library\u2019s popular digital services available. This is absolutely heartbreaking. It is day one. Queensland has a \u2018stay in your suburbs\u2019 advisory in place. It won\u2019t be long until it starts being spread across other states. Particularly if people continue to try to live their lives as usual. This is the latest from the Manly Beach\u2019s iconic Bold and Beautiful (B&amp;B) swim The House of Representatives is starting to move through amendments (or questions put on the amendments) of the coronavirus bill. Which means it is getting to the tail end(ish) of the proceedings in the House. Cruise ships continue to be a massive issue during this crisis: This is moving very fast: The NRL is starting to move. From AAP: The NRL has announced it will close its offices from Tuesday until at least 1 May, forcing hundreds of staff across all departments to take annual leave. In a town hall meeting on Monday, NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg told staff the game was determined to keep playing in the face of the growing coronavirus pandemic. Closing down the NRL offices and forcing employees to take annual leave are the latest cost-cutting manoeuvres from executives, who are desperately fighting to keep the game alive under \u201ccatastrophic\u201d financial pressure. More, when it comes, from here: This is the reason Stuart Robert\u2019s refusal to answer questions on how long people can expect to wait for help as well as his outright denial of how the government was not prepared, before being forced to admit the truth, matters. These are real people. That you and I know. And it is happening all over the country, and will for weeks. They need answers. Even if they are hard ones to give. Here is what we know so far today: The coronavirus stimulus package will pass the parliament. Up to a million additional people are expected to need the JobSeeker payment. Centrelink lines have been hundreds deep around the country. The MyGov website, which is needed to access government services, was down, after it was overwhelmed by people desperate for help. The minister responsible originally blamed the site\u2019s issues on a cyber attack, but was forced to admit it had been swamped by legitimate users. Schools are open, in all states but Victoria and the ACT (after tomorrow), however parents can choose to keep their children home in any state. In NSW, parents are encouraged to keep their children home from school. Borders will be shut in Queensland, the NT, South Australia, WA and Tasmania. Rex Patrick tested positive to coronavirus after sharing a Senate committee with another federal MP, Andrew Bragg, who was infected at a wedding. For those wondering how coronavirus will affect the ordinary work of parliament, one of the most pressing issues is what will happen to all those committees scrutinising legislation and other matters of government including the sports rorts inquiry? Today, the Senate agreed: That, if required, the time for the presentation of reports on matters referred by the Senate to standing committees, select committees and joint committees may be extended by agreement of the committee, duly notified to the president. Government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, also advised: I can provide reassurance to the chamber that the government will not seek to report early on committee referrals without the full consensus of the committee. So all committees can extend their own deadlines, which will also give latitude to postpone scheduled hearings. It was an extraordinary question time, in that it was just used for questions and answers. Even Stuart Robert had to admit he got something wrong, without bringing politics into it. Here is how Mike Bowers saw it, from the glassed-in section of the media (those allowed in under the numbers rules): Jenny McAllister, who also had to be tested after sitting on the same senate committee as Andrew Bragg (who contracted Covid-19 at a wedding), has tested negative. Rex Patrick, on the same committee, is not so lucky: Phil Coorey from the AFR reports the government has made plans to spend another $40bn as the Covid-19 crisis continues to roll on: Budget bills, which were set to pass both houses of parliament on Monday, were amended so that an annual discretionary fund of $1.2bn that is under the control of finance minister Mathias Cormann was expanded to $40bn. The government is anticipating having to pay top dollar for emergency supplies as global demand soars. It is official \u2013 Australia will not be sending a team to the Olympics if it is held this year. It is instead planning towards having the games hosted (in Japan) in 2021. Anthony Albanese says the stimulus bill will be with the Senate by 7.30pm. \u201cThe fact is, it wasn\u2019t a cyber attack, it was an incompetence attack,\u201d Anthony Albanese says of Stuart Robert\u2019s straight up BS about what caused the MyGov site to crash, as nearly 100,000 people tried to access it at once. Robert blamed it on a cyber attack. Turns out, it was just overwhelmed by people needing help. Because the government estimates at least an additional million people will be needing to access JobSeeker payments. And the site can only handle 55,000 people at a time. Here is what we know about the latest domestic border close: The state will be closed to \u201cnon-essential\u201d visitors. The boundaries will be closed from midnight on Wednesday. The Queensland disaster management committee will meet on Tuesday to finalise the details. As with Tasmania and WA, if you are a resident, you can still get in. You just have to quarantine (at home) for 14 days. Visitors will have to prove they can self-isolate for 14 days. Hospitality workers are queuing up at Centrelink and the MyGov website has crashed, but spare a thought for fans of bikini company Tigerlily, which is in financial distress because of the coronavirus (and the generally poor state of retail). The brand was founded by James Packer\u2019s ex-flame Jodhi Meares, a savvy business player who sold it on to Billabong in 2009. Two years ago Billabong sold it on to private equity group Crescent Capital Partners for a reported $60m. Meares, meanwhile, moved on to her current venture, sportswear label The Upside. Tigerlily appointed administrators Scott Langdon and Jenny Nettleton, of KordaMentha, on Sunday, a spokesperson for KordaMentha said. The decision to appoint administrators was made after considering the current state of the retail industry, and the Covid-19 pandemic significantly inhibiting the day-to-day operations of Tigerlily. Langdon said Tigerlily would trade on a \u201climited basis\u201d and was for sale: A sale of business process will commence immediately and we expect a high level of interest in the business given the strong brand and its reputation. Hand sanitiser will be back on the shelves \u201cvery soon\u201d says Karen Andrews after local companies began manufacturing it. Meanwhile: At least 95,000 people tried to access MyGov this morning, shortly after 9.30am. The site can take just 55,000 people at once. The demand triggered a denial of service alert. Stuart Robert made a big point in his press conference of saying the site was not overloaded, but it had been the victim of a cyber attack. In the parliament, where misleading the chamber can bring penalties, the minister admits there was no attack, just an alert, because the site was overwhelmed by the number of people trying to access it at once \u2013 almost double what it is set up to handle. Which was the most logical reason, given the number of people physically lining up outside of Centrelink offices this morning. But when asked about this in his earlier press conference (just a little under two hours ago) the minister deliberately dismissed questions, misled the public over what happened, and claimed there was a cyber attack when there wasn\u2019t. The NRL is under increasing pressure to follow suit in Australia after the AFL cut its season. The biggest difference in this question time? The lack of politics. There has not been a single \u201care you aware of other proposals/policy\u201d questions and the answers are just filled with information. The opposition\u2019s questions are just filling the gaps of the policies which have been put in place and probing some of the issues which need answering. In short, most of the people in the chamber are doing their best to do their jobs. It is a big change from what we usually see. That the lack of grandstanding is notable, tells you just how far the chamber has fallen in the past. In these ever shifting times, it is nice to be reminded that some things remain the same. One of those things is Michael McCormack can not stop yelling, or using homilies. Even as he attempts to explain supply chains will continue to hold up. As we all discover that meetings really could have been an email, we are also discovering which ministers should probably have stayed on the backbench. Josh Frydenberg says up to a million people could be accessing the coronavirus payment \u2013 on top of those who are already on the JobSeeker payment. Not all those new additions will necessarily be unemployed though. If you are a casual or sole trader and your income drops, you can still access it. The key points from the ACT update: There are 13 new cases in the ACT, all from people returning overseas or their close contacts, including five people on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. No evidence of community transmission (yet). ACT chief minister Andrew Barr warned the restrictions put in place by the national cabinet are likely to be in place at least until the end of the year. Barr said the national cabinet had agreed to meet more frequently, and the communications issues raised by Vic, NSW and ACT announcing changes before the meeting have been addressed by a new ability to immediately call meetings when the situation changes. Barr recognised that some jurisdictions are \u201cunder more pressure\u201d than others, due to higher rates of community transmission. \u201cNational cabinet must account for that ... We can and should do better, and we will,\u201d Barr said. Education minister Yvette Berry has conceded there was also \u201cunfortunate messaging\u201d with some schools telling students they will be closed from tomorrow. The actual position is that schools will use pupil free days to plan to shift to online learning, but schools will remain open with \u201cno child turned away\u201d so children of working parents can still attend. Government school attendance in the ACT is today at 60%. From 5pm new restrictions on aged care will apply, including social visits limited to one visit of up to two people for up to two hours per resident, except in end of life situations. The Australian defence force is being called in to help contact trace the passengers of the Ruby Princess. Who let the Ruby Princess passengers disembark? Scott Morrison says it was NSW Health. Supermarket giant Woolworths has begun installing plexiglass screens at its stores in a bid to protect its workers from exposure to the coronavirus. The company has already installed the screens at two of its Sydney stores at Town Hall and Kellyville North, and say they will begin rolling them out across the country in the coming weeks. They\u2019ll also begin asking shoppers to wash their hands before entering stores and introduce markers in shopping centre lines to avoid people standing too close to one another. The government has released 1.3m masks from the national medical stockpile for medical staff. Another 3m are on order. Greg Hunt says some of the countries where the masks have been ordered, have put a stop on the items leaving the country, which is a challenge. Karen Andrews says local manufacturers are also turning their attention to medical protective items. Australia has ordered an additional 1,000 ventilators. Four of the big electronic firms have turned their operations to their manufacture in Australia \u2013 ResMed, GE, Philips, Medtronic. Victoria has recorded 61 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Victoria to 355. Six of those cases are confirmed as being the result of community transmission \u2013 that\u2019s double the number of cases confirmed as from community transmission on Sunday. As of Monday, six of those diagnosed with Covid-19 are recovering in hospital and 97 (27%) are confirmed to have recovered. More than 23,700 people have been tested in Victoria to date. Thirty-five of the cases are in regional Victoria, 290 are in metropolitan Melbourne, and the remaining 30 are under investigation. The release from the Victorian department of health and human services reiterated that there are fines of up to $20,000 for people who do not comply with directions to self-isolate if they return to Victoria from overseas, or if they are a close contact of a confirmed case. Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton also had a message on social distancing: Everyone who\u2019s unwell must isolate themselves and everyone who\u2019s been told they\u2019re in quarantine either as a returned traveller or close contact must do so. Social distancing will save lives. Everyone needs to comply with restrictions in place to keep yourself, your loved ones and the whole community safe. We urge everyone to stay 1.5 metres away from everyone else, wash your hands often with soap and water and cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. On the question of opening telehealth services up to Medicare \u2013 meaning they would be bulk-billed, Greg Hunt says \u201cyes\u201d. That is after 17,000 doctors signed a joint letter calling for the telehealth consultations to be added to Medicare. The national cabinet has met four times in the past ten days, Scott Morrison says. Non-essential services have been defined (so far) as those businesses which have been closed, as well as the gatherings which have been shut down. More on that letter from the Northern Territory chief minister. On the economy he says: I talk to business owners every day and I know how much you\u2019re hurting. These new rules are going to hurt. They are going to hurt some people more. We\u2019ve released a tourism rescue package, we\u2019ve released the Jobs Rescue and Recovery package. And through the night we have been working on more support. \u201cThe $50m small business survival fund: the fund will deliver grants to help keep businesses alive, even when they have to shut. We will release more detail on the fund this afternoon and in coming days and I have directed it be open for applications from Friday. I know jobs will be lost. And I feel sick about that. I have agonised over these decisions. And I know a lot of people will be asking: why is all of this needed up here, when the problem isn\u2019t as bad up here? I think that is a fair question, and let me give you a thorough answer. My big fear \u2013 the thing that is keeping me up at night \u2013 is that the coronavirus wave is coming to the territory. I hoped that securing our borders would be enough to stop it. And it will help, but it won\u2019t be enough. It\u2019s clear extreme action is needed to keep us safe. Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner has issued an emotive statement talking about relief for businesses and closures consistent with other jurisdictions. He says while the advice from the nation\u2019s top health experts continues to be that it is safe for schools to stay open, from tomorrow and for the rest of the term, the decision to send kids to school will be a choice for parents. He says: Speaking directly to our teachers: thank you. You are on the front line. Your health is as important to me as our kids. I have asked that your welfare be paramount through all this. We need you, and we need you healthy and well. He also says the territory is not \u201cplaying catch-up\u201d like elsewhere and is ahead of the virus. His statement also speaks about the closure of non-essential services, and says remote communities will be exempt from these closures, given the protections already in place. Gunner says: When the coronavirus \u2013 this silent, invisible killer \u2013 first started to threaten our country and our community, I promised you I would do whatever it takes to protect you. It\u2019s a promise I intend to keep. The threat we are facing is deadly serious. The evidence presented to us at the national cabinet meeting last night was crystal clear. The spread of this highly contagious disease down south has made this an unprecedented health emergency for our entire country. While the territory remains the safest place in the country, things are getting worse, not better, down south. This is out of control down there. It is spreading and we must control it. Half-measures are not helping. The territory has been ahead of the game so far. And instead of playing catch-up like others, we can stay ahead of the game. New directions will be issued under the Public Environmental and Health Act to enact and enforce these new rules. These measures will be in place for one month, when they will be reviewed. There was a lot happening in that Stuart Robert press conference just now, so let\u2019s try to make sense of it. Amid all the noise, there were some announcements that will hopefully make a difference for people applying for the JobSeeker Payment and facing delays, either over the phone, online or in one of the long queues around the country. The government services minister said they would introduce Intent To Claim provisions. That means that if you contact Centrelink today about wanting to apply for unemployment benefits, but are unable to complete your application, you will be back paid from that first contact. (The government actually abolished this in 2018 to save money.) Crucially, Robert said people starting a new Jobseeker Payment claim could verify their identity over the phone, rather than by submitting their documents at a Centrelink office. This change was slated for April and has apparently been brought forward. That is, you do not need to go to a Centrelink office to complete your claim. In fact, Robert said there were fewer staff at the shopfronts due to social distancing rules. This does not get around the fact that getting through over the phone to Centrelink can take hours, let alone at a time like this. Robert also said he was extending Centrelink call centre opening hours to 8am to 8pm (NSW time). The government is hiring up to 5,000 new staff at Services Australia to cater with demand, but it remains to be seen how quickly these employees can start. Now, onto the MyGov website. Robert said the website suffered a DDoS attack (when a website is flooded with hits, essentially a cyber attack) but wouldn\u2019t give any more details. He said the government had MyGov\u2019s upgraded capacity by 10 times. It could now operate with 55,000 concurrent users and, he said, in fact the website never crashed. Australia has 1609 cases of Covid-19. The bells are ringing for question time. Given that this is not the politics live blog, I\u2019ll be doing it a little differently than usual (I mean, it is 2o20, and nothing is the same right now) and only bringing you the main points, as we continue to monitor all the Covid-19 changes. For anyone who needs some soothing, there are these photos (from before she was in isolation): The nation now has an agriculture industry engagement officer. Mark Tucker\u2019s job will be to act as a liaison between David Littleproud\u2019s department and the industry, as it navigates covid-19. Today Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud announced a new measure to maintain agricultural production and supply chains through the COVID-19 response. The reason why cruise ships are such a worry can be seen in the number of infections we are seeing coming out of the Ruby Princess. There are 48 identified cases from the Ruby Princess so far. Five from the Ovation of the Seas. Mark McGowan\u2019s strong stance on not letting the passengers of the Magnifica out, IF it is allowed to dock in Fremantle, is understandable. More than 17,000 doctors have signed a letter calling on the federal government to immediately allow Medicare to pay for all Australians to have access to telephone and video appointments in response to the coronavirus crisis. These kinds of appointments are known as \u2018telehealth\u2019, and while the use of technology for appointments has been a growing industry, especially for people living in remote and regional areas, the Covid-19 crisis has accelerated discussions around Telehealth and how to implement it. Many health groups and medical associations have been calling for increased support to roll out the technology more widely and rapidly. The federal government introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule and Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs items to allow doctors, nurses, midwives and mental health professionals to deliver services via telehealth, provided those services are bulk billed, so that people in self-isolation or quarantine can get health care. This is a temporary six-month measure. People who meet the testing guidelines for Covid-19, people aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, people with chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, and parents with new babies and people who are pregnant can access the bulk-billed Telehealth services. The thousands of doctors who have signed the letter say this is too restrictive. It comes \u201cwith special criteria that make it so ineffective it\u2019s practically useless,\u201d the letter says. \u201cDefining \u2018special groups\u2019 who are eligible for bulk-billed telehealth, leaving all others out in the cold - when normally all medical care attracts a rebate is simply un-Australian and tone deaf, especially when many of our community are losing their jobs and facing financial hardship. \u201cThe symptoms of coronavirus are identical to those of many other viruses. As the virus spreads in the community, it will be increasingly difficult to tell them all apart. By allowing telehealth access for all it will enable pre-emptive remote screening, without the risk of onward transmission. Telehealth access for all will also reduce the rush on the dedicated coronavirus screening clinics and lessen the impact on public hospitals \u2013 allowing them to focus on those who are acutely ill.\u201d The Consumers Health Forum agrees telehealth should be supported across as many accredited health services as possible to reduce the demand in clinics and hospitals. \u201cWe urge the Government to act on the advice of doctors, nurses and allied health practitioners and expand Medicare to cover telehealth services so clinicians can provide maximum help at minimal risk to many more patients and not just to known coronavirus risks,\u201d Consumer Health Forum CEO, Leanne Wells, said. \u201cThe current limited availability of Medicare-funded telehealth services to specified patient groups represents a lost opportunity to reduce the hazards for clinicians and patients of direct physical consultation and of unnecessary patient travel, while encouraging consumers to seek vital attention.\u201d In terms of views, this is where he sits on a lot of issues, despite the airtime he is given. On the Queensland border closure, I am being told that it will be similar to what we are seeing in WA and Tasmania, which means forced 14 day isolation, plus closures to non-essential visitors. Where this will get tricky is the border with NSW, which operates a lot like a grey zone, with people travelling to one state for work and another to live. The premier has just tweeted this That press conference was an absolute mess and I am sorry to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed by their job or financial situation and is desperately trying to get information. Our correspondent Luke Henriques-Gomes is working on the actual information you need. He has done a few posts below about some of the changes. The big take aways from what Stuart Robert was apparently trying to say. All claims will be backdated to today, no matter when you get your form in The intent to claim, which was scrapped, is back. You will not have to provide ID in Centrelink today, to be able to claim benefits. The government is claiming the site breakdown was because of a cyber attack (DoS - denial of service, which is where sites are flooded with requests, overloading them) but won\u2019t provide any further information on that. It is more likely that the site has been overwhelmed by people trying to get legitimate information, given the mass job losses we have already seen, on top of how low the JobSeeker payment has been for so long. It can only handle 55,000 people at once at this stage. When you are looking at the millions the government told us this would impact, that is just a drop in the ocean of people trying to access that system. What Stuart Robert is trying to say is that the government boosted the number of people who could use MyGov at once from 6000 to 55,000 people. He says that if you are one of the first 55,000 in line, you will get in. If you are 55,001 then you will get a no-service message. He claims it is not down. But he won\u2019t give a figure on how long the delays are. He also says the government is working on increasing the number of people who can access the site at once, again. The government also wants another 5000 people for Centrelink, so Robert says it is looking for people who may have lost their call-centre jobs to apply. The federal government has suspended work-for-the-dole from today. The community development program (CDP) in remote areas, and other activities delivered in group settings, \u201cwill be suspended to support social distancing measures\u201d, Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt said. I have also put in place arrangements to lift any existing suspensions and penalties for CDP job seekers. But he said jobseekers could still turn up for work on \u201ca voluntary basis\u201d where it was considered safe, because \u201cCDP providers play an important role in the day-to-day life of the communities where they operate.\u201d Until late last week Wyatt and his department, the National Indigenous Australians Agency, were advising Aboriginal people to turn up for group activities or risk losing their welfare payments, which alarmed national Aboriginal medical services, which said it was an \u201cunnecessary health risk\u201d. In a letter obtained by Guardian Australia, the agency had said any CDP participant who was unwell and may have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 should call Centrelink to discuss obtaining a \u201cmajor personal crisis exemption\u201d, valid for 14 days, to \u201cavoid any suspension of payment\u201d. Wyatt said he had instructed CDP providers not to penalise anyone while the biosecurity arrangements announced by Scott Morrison on 20 March were in place. All face to face visits to inmates in the nation\u2019s jails have been banned from today, in an effort to stop the virus spreading in enclosed populations. The decision was part of tougher distancing measures decided by the national cabinet on Friday night. Last week, more than 370 legal, academic and criminal justice professionals signed as letter calling on governments to address mounting concerns about the implications of COVID-19 on the criminal justice system. They\u2019re concerned it will spread widely and to devastating effect among those over-represented in prisons: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; people from low socio-economic backgrounds; people experiencing homelessness; and people with disabilities. The letter signed by criminologists, lawyers, barristers and former magistrates say prisons face \u201can uncontrollable outbreak.\u201d \u201cMany people who are incarcerated also have chronic conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma, which makes them vulnerable to more severe forms of COVID-19. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before COVID-19 breaks out in our prisons and youth detention centres. This will then have a substantial flow-on effect to the community. People are continually churning in and out of prisons and then being released to their communities. \u201cSignificantly, 77% of people entering and 33% of people in prison are unsentenced and 30% of sentenced prisoners are expected to serve less than 12 months. Failing to deal with COVID-19 in the criminal justice system will dramatically increase the epidemic curve. Stuart Robert is being very Stuart Robert about these issues. And by that I mean he is not explaining things in plain English, or acknowledging the emotional impact these delays are having. Q: How long does it take on average for people to get online on the phone or online? SR: We manage those things across multiple... Q: How long? You must have some idea? SR: At present there are delays. We don\u2019t give a running commentary on delays. Q: You must have some idea how long. These people have lost their jobs and are losing their minds trying to get onto your system. How long is it taking? SR: I don\u2019t accept your question but I understand the frustration people are experiencing. All Centrelink applicants will have their claims back dated to today, even if they are not approved today. Stuart Robert says MyGov has gone from an average of 6,000 concurrent users to 55,000 concurrent users. He then drops this little piece of news: Unfortunately, this morning we also suffered a distributed server attack on our main channels, which highlights other threats still are there.\u201d We are working on getting more information on this. AAP has reported on the Australian Olympic Committee plan: The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has told its athletes to prepare for a Tokyo Olympics in the northern summer of 2021. The AOC says an Australian team cannot be assembled for the Tokyo Games, which is scheduled to start on 24 July. \u201cWe have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programs. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,\u201d AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said in a statement on Monday. Western Australia has recorded another 20 cases of coronavirus overnight. Six of those are from the Ruby Princess, the cruise ship that was allowed to dock in Sydney, with passengers released. Another is from the Ovation of the Seas, which was also allowed to dock and disperse. That brings WA\u2019s cases to 140. Mark McGowan says he has been contacted by the cruise ship the Magnifica, which has about 1700 passengers on board \u2013 all overseas residents \u2013 who is asking for permission to dock in Fremantle. About 250 people have reported upper respiratory illnesses. McGowan says he will not allow the passengers out, and has spoken to Home Affairs and the government over what can be done. I will not allow what happened in Sydney to happen here. We will not allow passengers or crew to wander the streets. This is a non-negotiable position. Options are currently being developed the commonwealth, the defence forces and the state government. We are working cooperatively with the Commonwealth and in particular minister Dutton to resolve this matter and I\u2019d like to thank the commonwealth for their support ... We will provide assistance to those with urgent needs. My first priority has to be protecting West Australians. This is an emerging and an evolving issue. We will work with the Commonwealth throughout the day to come up with a plan that properly protects our state. WA premier Mark McGowan is also emotional as he talks about the business closures in his state, under the new restrictions. WA schools remain OPEN, but the law has been relaxed if you choose to keep your kids at home. So, basically, if you don\u2019t want to send your child to school, you don\u2019t have to, and the government won\u2019t come after you. The Australian market was down by about 6.8% at lunchtime today as the market struggled to digest the implications of sweeping new bans on hospitality and entertainment businesses. Trade in at least nine stocks was suspended or halted today, with five companies within the ASX200 halted. Buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay was the biggest loser in the top 200, crashing by a gargantuan 35%. The fintech is heavily dependent on retail sales, which are set to be crushed by the new rules, and has younger users who are more likely to be among workers joining the lengthy queues for unemployment benefits that have formed outside Centrelink offices this morning. Southern Cross Media, the operator of youth-orientated radio station network Triple M, was the second-biggest loser, shedding nearly a third of its value. Fourteen of the 200 stocks in the ASX200 have fallen more than 20% today - a number that woud probably be higher if companies at the centre of the economic firestorm including Crown Resorts, Flight Centre and Webjet weren\u2019t already suspended from trade. Outside the top 200, some stocks, mainly junior mining explorers, have lost more than half their value so far today. The chief medical officer Brendan Murphy will hold a press conference on the latest covid-19 figures in Australia at 1.40pm. AAP reports the Australian Olympic Committee has admitted the 2020 Tokyo Games will not be going ahead as planned this year, because of the coronavirus threat. On actual MyGov news: In amusing news, the minister in charge of government services has tagged the wrong MyGov in his tweet about MyGov Not sure how Daniel C. Schr\u00f6ter can help. If you need MyGov on twitter, it is @MyGovau Doctors are calling for all telehealth services to be bulk billed, to stop people coming into doctors\u2019 surgeries and clinics: \u2022 More than 17,000 doctors have signed a letter calling on the government to immediately allow Medicare to pay for ALL Australians to have access to telephone/video (telehealth) appointments in response to the coronavirus crisis. \u2022 The new telehealth restrictions must be removed immediately to stop the co-mingling of infected and non-infected patients in clinics to protect the health of the nation. \u2022 There is no extra cost to the government to do this. A telehealth appointment is rebated by Medicare exactly the same as a face-to-face appointment. Medical experts say coronavirus will spread significantly in Australia. This infection spreads easily and causes significant symptoms in many. Elderly and those with chronic disease appear most at risk but younger and fitter patients are also affected and will act as carriers. Almost all medical appointments currently only receive Medicare rebates if they are face-to-face. This means that patients have to physically see the doctor and sit in the waiting room among other patients. This increases the risk of contracting coronavirus. With new social distancing measures, medical clinics are exempt and people are still in very close contact with each other. Many of the things that Australians go to the doctor for can be managed without a face-to-face appointment. With a new and deadly infectious disease, anything that reduces contact with infected people will reduce onward transmission. As the virus spreads, most of those infected will seek advice from their local GP clinic and potentially expose other patients, their loved ones, doctors, nurses and medical administration staff, who then in turn go on and expose others. The federal government\u2019s current telehealth program is simply too restrictive, with special criteria that make it so ineffective it\u2019s practically useless. Defining \u201cspecial groups\u201d who are eligible for bulk-billed telehealth, leaving all others out in the cold \u2013 when normally all medical care attracts a rebate \u2013 is simply un-Australian and tone deaf, especially when many of our community are losing their jobs and facing financial hardship. Regional airline Rex, which has been screaming for the past week that it urgently needs a bailout, will shut all flights except in Queensland from 6 April \u201cunless the federal and state governments are willing to underwrite the losses\u201d. Passenger flights in Queensland are already backed by the state government. Rex deputy chairman John Sharp said the airline needed a bailout by the end of the week to be able to resume flying. He said passenger numbers had fallen by 60% and he expected them to tumble further, to 80% below normal levels. We believe that with only 20% of our passenger numbers left we have reached that point and the Rex Group has decided that the quasi suspension of all services at this stage presents the best option to preserve its cash. The federal government has acted swiftly by promising a rescue package to the airlines of $715m. However, the direct benefit to Rex from this package is only $1m a month, which is grossly insufficient to cover the $10m a month we expect to lose running the heavily reduced schedule we announced last week. Rex\u2019s Ambulance Victoria fixed-wing air ambulance services, charter contracts with mining companies, freight services and pilot training academies are not affected by the shutdown. The entire airline sector is under extreme financial pressure due to government decisions to ban or tightly restrict travel. This would be great, except MyGov is overwhelmed. Still, the advice is you don\u2019t need to physically go into a Centrelink office \u2013 and even if you do, you probably won\u2019t see anyone any quicker than waiting for MyGov to come back online. The regional airline Rex has announced it will be stopping all flights, except in Queensland. Ben Butler will have a bit more on that soon. Stuart Robert, who is in charge of government services (like how Centrelink works), has called a door stop for 1.15pm. That is because the MyGov website has crashed under the demand and people are lining up for hours to try to access help at Centrelink at a physical building. Western Australia is cancelling or rescheduling most non-urgent elective surgery from today, in an effort to preserve face masks and other personal protective equipment. After today, patients will no longer be able to book category 2 or 3 elective surgery, including dental procedures done at public hospitals. And from tomorrow, all booked category 3 patients will be cancelled, while category 2 patients will be reviewed and will only proceed if deemed urgent. Category 1 elective surgery \u2013 \u201cdefined as urgent with the potential to become an emergency\u201d \u2013 will continue. Health minister Roger Cook said cancelling non-urgent elective surgery was \u201cessential to ensure we have access to the right protective equipment to protect our staff who care for patients with Covid-19\u201d. He added: I understand reducing elective surgery will cause distress for some people, however the Covid-19 pandemic requires us to preserve our PPE and free up capacity in our hospitals. If anyone is still unclear on the numbers risk here, the UK\u2019s Channel 4 has spoken to Hugh Montgomery, who is the director of the UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance at the University College London (and also the guy who discovered an allele of the gene that influences physical fitness, if you need more of his bona fides) about just how contagious Covid-19 is. If you had the flu, you would give it to about 1.4 people. Then those people would pass it on and so on, so by the tenth time your flu has been passed around, you are responsible for 14 cases. With coronavirus, everyone infected with it can pass it on to three people (because of how infectious it is), so if those three people pass it on to another three people and so on, until your original infection has been passed on 10 times, you can infect 59,000 people. That is 59 thousand. That\u2019s why it is considered so dangerous and that is why the world is shutting down. The Australian Hotels Association has responded to the shutdown of its venues: This is a sad day for Australians with the shutdown of an Aussie institution \u2013 an unprecedented move in our peace-time history, AHA national CEO Stephen Ferguson said today. The health and wellbeing of our staff and patrons is paramount to all other considerations. In times like this, it is essential for us all to follow the instructions of our governments and medical officers. But there\u2019s no doubt this move is already having a devastating impact on our direct national workforce of 250,000 and our millions of patrons. We saw what an important role hotels play in their communities during the recent bushfires across large parts of the nation. Today\u2019s closure is an unprecedented move which will have a big social impact for months to come. It is looking increasingly likely that the Olympics will be postponed. It is almost inevitable at this point. The lines, and the potential for the virus to spread in them, has not gone unnoticed. Jacinda Ardern is ramping up the restrictions in New Zealand: all schools will be closed from tomorrow. New Zealand is at its level 3 alert. In the next 24 hours, it will move to level four. From the New Zealand Herald: Level 3 means limited travel in areas with clusters of Covid-19 cases, affected educational facilities closed, mass gatherings cancelled, public venues closed (such as libraries, museums, cinemas, food courts, gyms, pools, amusement parks), some non-essential businesses closed, and non face-to-face primary care consultations, with non elective services and procedures in hospitals, deferred. Level 4 means people instructed to stay at home, schools and universities closed, as well as non-essential businesses, major reprioritisation of health services and severely limited travel. All indoor and outdoor events cannot proceed. In short, we are all now preparing as a nation to go into self-isolation in the same way we have seen other countries do. Staying at home is essential. That would give the health system a chance to cope, she said. Given the website crashes, requests to streaming services to lower the data requirements and millions more suddenly trying to work from home and competing with their neighbours for speed, this media release from Paul Fletcher is incredibly, incredibly ill-timed and ridiculous. More than 11 million homes and businesses are now able to connect to fast and affordable broadband on Australia\u2019s National Broadband Network (NBN), which is closing in on its completion milestone this year. Minister for communications, cyber safety and the arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, said the Morrison government welcomes the significant progress. \u201cThe Coalition government\u2019s commitment to a fast, efficient delivery of the NBN means that today the rollout is more than 95% complete, with 30,000 to 40,000 additional connections made every week,\u201d minister Fletcher said. \u201cAround 6.8m homes and businesses across Australia now have an active NBN connection, with 67% of existing customers and 80% of new customers choosing retail plans with peak speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. \u201cNBN was a failing project when we came to government, with barely more than 50,000 premises connected to the fixed line network. Thanks to the turnaround which our Liberal National Government has driven, today the NBN is very widely available to Australians wanting to use fast, affordable broadband for a productivity and connectivity boost. Here is more information on the new entry requirements for WA: It is coming up to midday in daylight-saving states, which means the forced closures are about to take place. As a rule of thumb, if you can drink there, sweat there or gather there, it will be closed. Restaurants and cafes will only be able to do takeaway food. Everything else, at this point, remains open. If you are worried, then don\u2019t go out. NSW health authorities have diagnosed 48 people who were on the cruise ship Ruby Princess, which was allowed to dock in Sydney last week and have passengers disperse, with Covid-19. Twenty-seven of those passengers are in NSW; 21 of those passengers have left the state and gone to their home states Five people on the Ovation of the Seas have also tested positive. Things are escalating in Queensland over the schools issue. A reminder that there will be border closures in more Australian states. WA will close its borders to all but essential services and workers from 1.30pm (WA time) on Tuesday. All interstate arrivals will be made to self-isolate for two weeks. South Australia will monitor its borders from 4pm (SA time) on Tuesday, with all entrants made to sign a declaration on their health and enter mandatory isolation for two weeks. The Northern Territory will introduce its own border controls from 4pm (local time) tomorrow. All people must self-isolate for 14 days. It\u2019s all about the coronavirus stimulus today More from Mike Bowers: With the MyGov website still down, Bill Shorten and Linda Burney are demanding minister Stuart Robert sort out something for people trying to access the coronavirus payments: Around the nation there are queues around the block at Centrelink offices as first-time social security recipients are told they can only get a customer reference number by going into shopfronts in person. And online myGov has once again crashed despite demand being entirely foreseeable. Government services minister Stuart Robert must do better. He must ensure Centrelink services \u2013 online and in person \u2013 are working now when Australians need them most. Virgin Australia has announced new measures for domestic flights (international flights are being grounded), with people due to fly this week able to be moved onto flights TOMORROW, as the majority of Australian states\u2019 and territories\u2019 travel restrictions come into effect. For guests departing on or before this Friday: Guests who are booked on a Virgin Australia or Tigerair flight scheduled to depart on or before this Friday 27 March inclusive are able present at the airline\u2019s check-in counters at any time from now to be moved onto a flight departing on or before tomorrow (Tuesday 24 March) without paying any change fee or fare difference. Guests can also rebook their flight via the airline\u2019s guest contact centre: Virgin Australia 13 67 89 Tigerair 1300 174 266 Should a seat not be available on an earlier Tigerair service, those guests will be able to fly on Virgin Australia without additional costs. Guests departing before 30 June (inclusive): The new measures to help guests return home are in addition to Virgin Australia Group\u2019s recent announcement giving guests full flexibility for existing and new bookings scheduled to depart up until and including 30 June 2020 as detailed below: Virgin Australia and Tigerair guests can change their flight to a later date and/or to a different destination, without incurring a change fee. Guests will just need to cover the fare difference if the value of their new fare is greater than the original. If travel is within four weeks, Virgin Australia and Tigerair guests can also cancel their domestic or international travel without incurring a fee and receive the full value of the booking as a flight voucher in their Travel Bank, valid for 12 months. Michael Gunner also warns of stricter measures coming: I know this is a lot to take in. I know this decision will cause pain for people. I expect there will be territorians who do not support this and who will never forgive me for it, but I didn\u2019t make these hard choices ... If I didn\u2019t make these hard choices to save lives, I could never forgive myself. People\u2019s lives are on the line. That\u2019s what has to come first. This is not the end. In coming days, I\u2019ll have to ask even more of you. Things will get harder before they get easier. Eventually they will get easier. This crisis will not break us. We will not let it break us. We are all in this together. We are all on Team Territory. And then he speaks of the recent heart attack he suffered and has to pause, as he is overwhelmed: A few months ago, I was the one lying in the hospital bed in the ED. Extraordinary doctors and nurses saved my life. I thank God for them. I thank God for the Royal Darwin Hospital and I thank God for everyone that works there. I was lucky. Great Territory health care workers were there for me, to care for me and to save me. If I had presented in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak, it might are been a different story. So everything we are doing, every one of these hard decisions, is to prevent that outbreak, that nightmare, from happening here. We do not know everything about this virus, but we know this - the only thing that\u2019s been properly effective anywhere in the world is partly shutting down sections of society where the risk is greatest. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s really saved lives. No Government has regretted going full bore to stop this virus. Almost every government has regretted doing too little and waiting too long. I don\u2019t want us to have the same regrets. Michael Gunner becomes choked with emotion when he begins to talk about what is coming: My big fear, the thing that is keeping me up at night, is that the coronavirus wave is coming to the territory. I hope that securing our borders will be enough to stop it. It will help, but it won\u2019t be enough. It\u2019s clear extreme action is needed to keep us safe. We know the coronavirus is already here. We don\u2019t have community spread, neither did anywhere else in Australia until they suddenly did. In every part of the world, it all started with one case. Please do not think the territory is immunity from the worst effects of the coronavirus. We are not. If this hits us hard, it will be devastating. If you think these measures go too far, Google coronavirus and Italy and spend five minutes looking through the pictures and the videos, see the sick and dying lined up in hospital hallways and then think, \u201cThat could be mum. It could be dad. It could be my brother, my sister, my colleague, my mate.\u201d It could be your son or your daughter. It could be you. It could be me. Till now, he with are... We have been in the safest place inAustralia and I am going to keep it that way. The states down south might be able to let the virus get out of control before acting but up here we do not have the luxury of waiting for it to get worse. Our size is too small, our population too vulnerable, the risk too great, the cost too high. Maybe this hits home for me more than most. The NT government has set up a $50m business fund: The $50 million business, small business survival fund. The fund will deliver grants to help keep businesses alive, even when they have to shut. An advisory board of business-leaders will oversee the fund. We will release more detail on the fund this afternoon and in coming days and I\u2019ve directed it be open for application from Friday. It has three clear goals: First, and most importantly, keeping businesses alive, helping you survive this period, so you\u2019re still here when things go back to normal. Second - helping businesses adjust and adapt to this new environment, like setting you up online or helping you expand takeaway and delivery services. Just on that - if Territorians want to help and are not sure how, order some takeaway. I am serious. At least a meal a day from a local joint. If you\u2019ve got the dough for it, being the best Territorian you can be right now does mean eating takeaway. Michele O\u2019Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has warned that the measures announced by the federal government \u201cdo not go far enough ... in terms of how quickly they\u2019re going to be available but also they don\u2019t provide enough assistance to keep people in jobs and incomes flowing\u201d. O\u2019Neil said: It was \u201cwrong\u201d the Coalition had decided against direct subsidies to keep workers in jobs, favouring waiving withholding of tax instead The doubling of jobseeker payments (formerly Newstart), doesn\u2019t kick in until 27 April, meaning workers will go on the \u201cold, very inadequate\u201d rate of Newstart (about $40 a day) before then The one-off payment of $750 doesn\u2019t happen til mid April The ACTU wants the government to follow the lead of other countries with \u201cmuch faster, much more direct and more comprehensive support for workers, jobs and employment\u201d - particularly the UK model of an 80% subsidy of wages to keep workers in jobs. \u201cIf taxpayer money is to assist business - and we think it should - then that should be on conditions \u2013 to keep people in jobs, and income coming weekly,\u201d she said Michael Gunner on what is OPEN: Bottle-os are still open. You can still get a beer - God knows we all might need one - but everything else, there are no changes right now. Retail stores are still open, but with the existing restrictions that already apply to indoor venues. Shopping centres are open, but do not sit at food courts and, of course, supermarkets will always stay open, always. New directions will be issued under the Public Environmental Health Act and enforce these new rules. As a starting point, these measures will be in place for one month, when they will be reviewed and only relaxed if the threat has subsided. Remote communities are not included in these, given the strong protections we are already implementing for them. Michael Gunner, the Northern Territory leader, says schools will remain OPEN in the territory. Parents can choose whether or not they want to send their children to school. Kristina Keneally is standing in for Penny Wong as Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate (Wong is self-isolating). Keneally echoed Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech in the House: Labor will raise our concerns about this stimulus package, this economic support package. It isn\u2019t perfect, and we acknowledge it may not ever be. It may not be as Labor would have implemented it, had we been in government. We will look at additional methods of accountability and scrutiny to ensure this stimulus is getting into people\u2019s pockets as quickly as possible. When it comes to both our health response and our economic response, we need to be asking ourselves as a parliament: if we know we are going to need to do something in a week or two weeks\u2019 time, wouldn\u2019t it be better to do it as soon as possible? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to take action as soon as possible to save lives and livelihoods? We will do what all of us have been elected to do to protect Australians and our Australian way of life. We will be constructive as we work through this evolving and complex crisis. Australia now, more than ever, needs leadership and clear messaging. We need to support Australian families and we need to support one another, because we\u2019re only going to get through this health and economic crisis together. What Mike Bowers saw this morning: You will be seeing these scenes for weeks. Possibly months. Expect more information on indoor gatherings at private homes following the next national cabinet meeting on Tuesday night. In the meantime, it is one person per 4 sq metres. Don\u2019t switch up your weekly pub drinks by meeting at a mate\u2019s house. Here was Dan Andrews on that this morning: The manufacturing of hand sanitiser in Australia is being ramped up. From Karen Andrews\u2019s release: Ego Pharmaceuticals makes Aqium sanitiser at its factory in Melbourne. Managing Director Alan Oppenheim said it had drastically increased how much it made. In February we made five times what we forecast and our factory is now running 24 hours a day, five days a week. We\u2019re currently hiring to increase that to six days a week and we\u2019ve stopped our little bit of exporting to prioritise Australian needs. The government is also working to ensure ethanol supply for that hand sanitiser. AAP on the MyGov crash: The website giving Australians access to government services has crashed as people deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere is unprecedented demand for the service right now, but Australians need to be patient,\u201d the government services minister, Stuart Robert, said on Monday. \u201cTry logging on later today or even tomorrow. \u201cMyGov is working, but the best option right now is for people to be patient.\u201d The government business line will be opened seven days a week to answer questions about the new payments and tax changes: Operations at the business.gov.au 13 28 46 Contact Centre will increase from five days per week to seven days per week, and provide additional hours of support outside standard operating hours for the first month, answering calls from 7am to 11pm AEST. The Senate will sit until 10.30pm if needed to pass the coronavirus stimulus bill. If it doesn\u2019t pass tonight for whatever reason, the parliament will sit tomorrow. In just over an hour, these businesses will all be forcibly closed: Pubs, registered and licensed clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues) and hotels (excluding accommodation). Gyms and indoor sporting venues. Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will only be able to serve takeaway. Religious gatherings, places of worship or funerals (in enclosed spaces and other than very small groups and where the rule of one person per 4 sq metres applies). For those who want to see what exactly is in the bill, you can find more information here. This is a very, very sombre parliament you have right now Australia. Anthony Albanese: Today we feel the weight of our nation\u2019s need. Never has our duty been so urgent. I lead a Labor team determined to be constructive and Labor stands ready to play our role. We want to help the government to get it right and this parliament to get it right. All of us. We find ourselves in a time like no other. We, the Australian people, must, in our self-isolation, come together, remember who we are. We are the people who came together selflessly in the recent bushfire crisis. Now is not a time for \u2018me\u2019, it is a time for \u2018us\u2019. Let\u2019s spread kindness and humanity, not coronavirus. The months ahead will be difficult. There will be pain and suffering. Our country, our world has changed but this will not last forever. Things will be different after this. I am an optimist. I have faith in the people of Australia; faith in our people\u2019s courage, faith in our people\u2019s sense of community, faith in our people\u2019s compassion for one another. And that gives me the faith that we will get through this together. What is Labor worried about in the bill? This is about people\u2019s lives, and then of course consequentially their livelihoods. Particularly the lives of many of our vulnerable people \u2013 our parents and grandparents, the disadvantaged and the First Australians. We owe them our best. It is pretty hard to self-isolate if you are homeless. Also, the economy: We will support both stimulus packages, not because they are perfect but because they are urgent. We want this package to work and to work quickly. People\u2019s lives are at stake. We are concerned about the lack of direct support that would keep people in their jobs. The business measures do not guarantee support for workers because it is calculated on people being in work in February, not now or in the future. Those who don\u2019t receive the coronavirus subsidy: Youth Allowance, Abstudy and Austudy recipients do not receive the coronavirus supplement. Various visa holders also aren\u2019t getting the support that we believe they need. Other sectors: There are sectors that I think could be given more support. Today, of all days, we think of our teachers ... they are certainly not child minders, they are people who each and every day \u2013 whether they work in the public system, the Catholic system or the independent system \u2013 create future Australians with their knowledge and commitment and we respect those for the work that they are doing. We also think of other sectors that haven\u2019t got specific support at this point. The arts and entertainment industry, so important for the quality of our lives, needs, in my view, direct support in order to be sustained into the future so that as we come out of this diabolical circumstance. We recognise that the quality of our lives isn\u2019t just about money. And the super changes \u2013 what happens to those funds which are losing millions of dollars in investments if people start pulling their contributions to access the $10,000? This is still an issue: Anthony Albanese again says Labor will pass the bill: We have provided the government with that absolute certainty that at the end of the process we would put forward our suggestions and our views to try and improve the legislation, but we would not stand in the way of economic stimulus or any bring-forward of any health measures that were proposed. That is the responsible thing to do. That is consistent with the view that I put when my caucus colleagues and party members gave me the great honour of leading this party that is 130 years old next year. It is the responsible thing to do. We will continue to be responsible and we will act today in a responsible and constructive manner because I want to be known as the Labor leader, not the opposition leader. The legislation today is not perfect. We would do more and do it sooner but we will advance our arguments. This is not a time to prevent measures that, however imperfect, are necessary to be implemented. We do need unity and above all we need resolute action. Anthony Albanese is now speaking: Most of our lives have not been directly affected by war, hunger or financial strife. They were stories our parents and grandparents told us. We listened to those stories and we pictured them in black and white. We thought we were the lucky generations. We now face an enormous threat and it\u2019s in colour. It is happening right now. It is global. Fear and panic, of course, feed on uncertainty and inconsistency and at the moment those ingredients abound. This is a time for national leadership, consistent messages, clear directions. Today parents are concerned about whether to send their kids to school or not. People are anxious and that is understandable. They know this is a big deal, and when people feel that they can\u2019t control events they seek comfort in what they can control. We\u2019ve seen that exhibited around the country. That they have enough essentials such as toilet paper or pasta \u2013 that\u2019s seeking control over something in the face of the threat for which it is difficult for people to understand. They want to go to the footy or go to the beach one last time because they mightn\u2019t be able to go next week. These actions might be regrettable, but hectoring will not help. Clear explanation and clarity will. Those Centrelink queues are forming everywhere: Scott Morrison finishes his opening speech with a promise that more help is coming, as Australians line up around Centrelink\u2019s around the country and businesses close: We will be doing everything we can to protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of this crisis and to preserve the businesses that employ them. There will be more support to come and it will keep coming for as long as this challenge is before this nation. And even more importantly, we will be there to ensure that Australians get back on their feet, that the businesses rebuild, that our economy resurges and that we go on in the great national story of this amazing nation, Australia. He finishes: In conclusion, the more Australians work together, the more we share the sacrifice and the burden. The more we do the right thing, the more lives and the more livelihoods we will save. And when the virus passes - and it will - we will be stronger on the other side. This will be a test of all Australians. It is a test of our nation, of our spirit. There are some who believe Liberal democracies and free societies cannot cope with these sorts of challenges. We will prove them wrong here in Australia. Gerry Harvey, of Harvey Norman department stores, is understandably getting a lot of pushback this morning, for ridiculous comments he made on the Nine Network\u2019s 60 Minutes show, bragging about the \u201croaring trade\u201d his business is doing as Australians come to grips with a new normal. He said: Why are we so scared about getting this virus? There\u2019s pretty much nothing to get scared of. It\u2019s not the Spanish Flu that killed 15 million people just after the first world war \u2026 I\u2019m 80, I should be really scared. Guess what? I\u2019m not really scared. ... You know, this is an opportunity. Our sales are up in Harvey Norman in Australia by 9% on last year. Our sales in freezers are up 300%. And what about air purifiers? Up 100%. In case it needs to be said: there is a lot to be worried about. A lot. Scott Morrison: I will say this: while you may not be able to go to church, the synagogue, the temple or the mosque, I most certainly call on all people of faith in our nation to pray. I can assure you, my prayer knees are getting a good work out. Mr Speaker, as Australia works to flatten the curve and slow this virus, we also face an immense economic challenge. Across Australia today many thousands of Australians will lose their jobs. They are lining up at Centrelink offices as we speak \u2013 something unimaginable at this scale only weeks ago. They have lost their jobs, many, and we know, many more will. This is the biggest economic shock our nation has faced in generations. Australia, long an open, trading nation, is now closed off largely from the world. Internal border restrictions not seen since before federation are now in place. Scott Morrison: Australians will be living with this virus, is our advice, for at least the next six months. It could be longer. There is no three- or four-week shutdown that makes it all go away. There is no short-term solution to this. We have to steel ourselves for the next six months and work together to slow the spread in order to save lives, to protect the elderly and vulnerable Australians. They are counting on us. Every extra bit of time we save allows us to better prepare for the challenges that are ahead. Last night all the states and territories, through the national cabinet, agreed to an even more stringent set of social distancing rules that will change further how we all live our lives. No more going to the pub after work. No more gym in the morning. No more sitting down at a cafe for lunch. These chains are vital to slow the spread of this virus. As the virus spreads \u2013 and it will \u2013 governments around Australia will not be complacent and may need, and are likely to need, to impose further restrictions on our daily lives. Wherever possible we will seek to do that to ensure a consistency of approach between all states and territories. Scott Morrison: Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change. For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives. Meeting this challenge is bigger than any Australian. It\u2019s obviously bigger than politics, it is bigger than any of us who are in this chamber \u2013 prime ministers, leader of the oppositions, minister, shadow minister, members of parliament; bigger than all of us. It is bigger than premiers, chief ministers, captains of industry, leaders of union movements; it is bigger than all of us. I want to thank all of those who have come to this great challenge with such a unity of spirit. It requires every single Australian to do their duty as public citizens. So again in that spirit I want to thank in particular the nation\u2019s premiers and chief ministers for coming together to form Australia\u2019s first ever national cabinet, a cabinet of all Australian governments. Five Labor leaders, four Coalition leaders. I want to thank the leader of the opposition for the cooperation he and his colleagues have afforded us here in this parliament as we battle this dual health and economic crisis. Today we have some very important work to do. The doors remaining open is not the only change \u2013 there will also be no adjournment debate. When the speaker declares the parliament adjourned, that\u2019s it. Parliament has begun. Scott Morrison has the first speech: We gather today at a time of great challenge for our nation and indeed the world. We are a strong nation and a strong people but in the months ahead this will put us all to the test. At no time like this, since World War II. But together, Australia, we are up to this challenge. He invokes the \u201cspirit of Australia\u201d: So we summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy, of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia. That is our legacy that we draw on at this time. The Australian market plunged more than 8% on Monday morning amid uncertainty over the effects of a shutdown of hospitality and entertainment operators announced by prime minister Scott Morrison on Sunday night. Monday\u2019s losses are on top of more than a month of coronavirus-inspired selling that has already cut the value of Australian shares by a third. Before the market opened, gambling company Tabcorp said its totalisator outlets and on-course betting, both of which are to be shut, accounted for about 28% of its revenue. With this money now set to be ripped away, the company said it withdrew its previous profit guidance. A raft of companies temporarily halted trade in their shares to give them time to respond to the new restrictions, including Star Entertainment, which operates Sydney\u2019s casino, and Retail Food Group, which is the franchisor of fast food outlets including Gloria Jean\u2019s coffee shops and pizza joints Pizza Capers and Crust. Village Roadshow said it was closing Gold Coast theme parks Warner Bros Movie World, Sea World, Wet\u2019n\u2019Wild and Paradise Country, but Sea World would remain open because it has a hotel. Airline Virgin Australia, which along with rival Qantas has already slashed flights as travel restrictions bite, said it \u201cexpects a material reduction in its domestic capacity as a result\u201d of new travel bans announced by state and federal authorities over the weekend. The doors in the parliamentary chambers are remaining open, so people don\u2019t have to touch the door handles. Teachers who fall into the at-risk categories in Queensland, like everyone in the public service, can arrange to work from home. It is advised that all other workplaces follow suit. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Jeanette Young, on why the advice is to keep schools open: There are all sorts of reasons why the private school system might be making different decisions to the public. For the public school system, it is extremely important it remain open. Our children need their education. We all know that education is the most important department of health and department of people\u2019s situation, so it needs to continue. But just putting that to one side, it is of course true, looking at the evidence, we have not seen outbreaks in schools, we haven\u2019t seen them in Australia, we haven\u2019t seen them overseas. Where children have got it, when we\u2019ve worked back through how they got it, they got it from their parents. Children are not giving this disease to their parents, the parents are giving to it the children. This is not flu. ... This is not a flu, it is a coronavirus. Totally different. Queensland is also looking at closing its borders. Annastacia Palaszczuk: Yes, we are. Cabinet will be considering that today. I think that is a really important issue. Other states have done it. We have already looked at closing our western border and I think there is a greater sense that we should be looking at taking stricter measures, especially with aircraft coming in. We would possibly make people quarantined for 14 days but let me say very clearly that people should be staying in their state, staying in their suburb, and as much as possible staying at home. Queensland\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, says the state has tested 32,000 people for coronavirus so far. It has 319 positives. Most people picked up the virus oveseas, but there are signs of community transmission. Queensland is particularly worried about the cruise ships which have docked in Sydney, where passengers have dispersed into the community. (Queenslanders love to cruise.) But the council elections and byelections are still going ahead. The Queensland chief medical officer Jeanette Young says \u201cnormal\u201d work is continuing in hospitals, but there is a decrease in \u201csome of the very elective work\u201d. You might see changes to your arrangements or for some of the surgery that was scheduled, for some of the selective outpatients, but the important work that we need to do to save lives in Queensland is continuing and to enable that to continue, please, those of you who are regular blood-donors, could you please go and donate blood? The Red Cross has contacted me that they\u2019ve seen a decrease in the numbers of people coming forward. And I understand that, because people are hearing the social distancing message, but Red Cross has that all in hand. They have social distancing in place. The bells are ringing in parliament. The coronavirus stimulus debate will begin. In Queensland, another 60 people have been diagnosed overnight. That brings Queensland\u2019s cases to 319. Victoria: closed from tomorrow NSW: open, but parents are encouraged to keep students home, if they can. Queensland: open, but parents can choose to keep their children at home. Tasmania: open, but parents can choose to keep their children at home. ACT: closed from tomorrow. In the House of Representatives chamber, parliament is about to start. There are bottles of water (usually glasses, with water served by the attendants) and name tags telling MPs where to sit, under the physical distance changes. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the same closures the prime minister announced last night will be applied in Queensland. Queensland schools will remain OPEN. Parents can choose to keep their children at home, if they wish. Palaszczuk says Queensland has been testing since the end of January and is watching \u201cthis every single day\u201d and if the \u201cexpert health advice changes, then we will change, I want to make sure everyone knows that\u201d. Palaszczuk says when the school holidays happen everyone must \u201cstay in your state and stay in your suburb\u201d. It is not about packing up the car and going to the beach for a picnic or going for a swim on the beach. It\u2019s not about going camping, packing the family up and going camping. This is about staying in your suburb I need everyone to listen to advice and stay in your suburb. Queensland has the best weather and it will be hard for people because we have to do it because we are trying to lessen the curve. Following the government\u2019s announcement that any non-essential domestic travel should be reassessed, along with the border closures we are seeing within Australia, Virgin Australia had told the ASX it expects to cut its domestic services even further. The NSW government website has come back online. It\u2019s list of CLOSED businesses is exactly as the prime minister outlined last night: Restrictions on facilities The Australian government has announced the following facilities will be restricted from opening from midday local time 23 March 2020: Pubs, registered and licensed clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues), hotels (excluding accommodation). Gyms and indoor sporting venues. Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery. Religious gatherings, places of worship or funerals (in enclosed spaces and other than very small groups and where the 1 person per 4 square metre rule applies). Here is the Victorian government release on its new police taskforce. Queensland police have also been authorised to enforce the physical distance rules. They have been doorknocking people in self isolation, to ensure they are staying in. Tasmania recorded five more positive Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the state\u2019s total to 22. So far all infections can be traced back to an overseas visit (so no community transmissions there, as yet). The national cabinet (the teleconference of premiers, health officers and federal government leaders) will discuss if there are any stage-two restrictions needed, when it comes to closures. Included in that, will be what to do about childcare centres and private gatherings. That meeting will be held tomorrow night. Tasmanian schools will remain OPEN, but premier Peter Gutwein says parents can keep their children home if they wish (which is what Scott Morrison said last night). Online learning will be made available. If they\u2019re at home they must be at home. This does not mean take your children out of school and let them go on holiday. The government\u2019s view, based on the AHPPC advice, is that the best and safest place for your children is at school. If you decide to take them out of school, look after them, be responsible for them. If they are at school, then we will be responsible for them. But if you take them out, then it is incumbent upon you to ensure that you know where your children are, what they are doing, that they are not mixing with groups, that they are not putting themselves at risk or others at and I can\u2019t be clearer than that. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein echoes other state leaders in telling citizens they can\u2019t migrate their social life to their mate\u2019s or family\u2019s homes. I also want to say that \u2013 and a number of people this morning have said, you know, \u201cWhy bring this in so quickly?\u201d Well, this disease is amongst us. There is no community transmission [in Tasmania] and we are not going to go through the farcical situation that we saw in Britain, where last drinks brought hundreds of people together for one last night, which must have \u2013 there is no doubt in my mind \u2013 further spread the virus in that country. We need to act now. I\u2019m sorry for that, but we need to take these steps. I also want to make the point that, with pubs and clubs, entertainment venues, casinos, hotels closing, do not gravitate to holding parties in backyards or in other facilities. The rules of social distancing apply. If you\u2019re having a 21st or a 40th or a 50th, abide by the rules of social distancing. Tomorrow night, the national cabinet will be looking again at the issue of private gatherings. This cannot be a migration from the pub to the backyard. This is important. It will save lives. NSW teachers who are in the high-risk category for Covid-19 will be able to arrange to work from home, the departmental secretary, Mark Scott says. There is one agenda item for the parliament today \u2013 the coronavirus stimulus package. Question time will be the only thing that interrupts it. That will be at 2pm. Then it is back to the debate. As soon as it is passed, the parliament will adjourn. It is now in \u201cemergency mode\u201d which means for the foreseeable future, it will only sit when there is an urgent bill to pass. The next scheduled sitting was the first week in May, which is almost certainly going to be postponed, at this stage. There are additional Centrelink staff (Services Australia) staff being put on, but obviously not fast enough. Good morning all. With parliament about to resume for the brief session to legislate the stimulus, all MPs, I suspect, will be exercising an abundance of caution. Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong is one of those MPs. She\u2019s given me a short statement. This morning I woke feeling unwell. Consistent with advice to all Australians, and recognising that my parliamentary colleagues will return to their home states and communities, as a responsible precaution I will self-isolate, pending medical advice. As a result I will not be attending the Senate today.\u201d Wong is in Canberra and attended meetings with colleagues yesterday about the arrangements for this sitting, including the Labor leader Anthony Albanese and the prime minister Scott Morrison. She is not aware of having come into close contact with anyone who has coronavirus. It is very unusual to see politicians walking alone in these halls. There are still Australians stranded overseas. Ben Doherty has the latest on Australians trapped in Peru: Australians scrambling to find a way home from locked-down Peru say they still don\u2019t know if they will be able to get out of the country and fear the window for leaving \u201cmay slam shut\u201d. Britons and Canadians have been promised government flights to take them home from Peru, while Israelis and Mexicans have already been evacuated by their governments, but Australians say they are unsure commercial charter flights they have been encouraged by Canberra to book will be allowed to fly. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said late on Sunday she had spoken to Peru\u2019s foreign minister, N\u00e9stor Popolizio Bardales, \u201cas we try to facilitate departures for our nationals\u201d. Australia\u2019s ambassador said citizens trapped in the country were her \u201ctop priority\u201d. Peru is continuing to tighten its travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the government closing all airports and insisting only government-organised flights, flying out of military airbases, will be permitted to leave the country. Unfortunately, the NSW government website is still down. That website crashed after the NSW premier said it would include a list of businesses which would have to close. There are now 330,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world. \u201cField\u201d hospitals in New York, Washington state and California \u2013 they will be established in hotels and federal buildings. The National Guard (the US army reserve) will be called in. The International Olympic Committee, has for the first time, conceded the Tokyo olympics may be delayed That decision will be made in the next month. A little earlier, the Victorian premier Dan Andrews made it clear that shut bars did not mean people could have house parties. You won\u2019t be able to go to the pub because the pub is shut. That doesn\u2019t mean you can have all your mates round to home and get on the beers, that\u2019s not appropriate. It\u2019s not essential. It\u2019s not needed. All it will do is spread the virus. If you want another example we had a case last week where a group of people, a dozen or so, went to a dinner party. As best we can tell the dinner party started with one person who had the coronavirus. By the end of the dinner party almost everybody at the dinner party had the coronavirus. This spreads rapidly. If people simply behave as normal, if they don\u2019t take this seriously, if they act selfishly, then people will die. I can\u2019t be any clearer than that. I also say many are doing the right thing, and I\u2019m very grateful to them for having the welfare of others, the welfare of all of us front of mind. That\u2019s your civic duty. That\u2019s what\u2019s most important and that\u2019s what must be done.\u201d Victoria has set up a special police unit, with 500 officers, to ensure the physical distance rules are being adhered to. Anthony Albanese on Labor passing the stimulus bill, speaking to the ABC this morning: The package is likely to have a procedural motion this morning that will ensure that it will pass by 5pm this afternoon. We met with the prime minister and Josh Frydenberg and other leaders of the government yesterday. It was a constructive meeting. We have been determined to be constructive. We have a range of concerns, Fran. Including on superannuation. We will be pursuing those. But if they are not successful, that will not mean that we stand in the way of this stimulus package. Because quite clearly, our economy needs it and it needs it right now. Those issues: On superannuation, for example, it clearly isn\u2019t in the interest of individual superannuants to essentially sell out at the bottom of the market. That would have a negative impact on their retirement incomes. ... We think the government should be stepping in and providing more support for low-income workers. We think there should be a greater act of urgency. We\u2019re concerned that a range of the measures that have been introduced have been introduced with an eye on politics. So, for example, even the first stimulus payments of $750 doesn\u2019t flow until the second quarter, until the June quarter. The next payment flows in the quarter that begins the first quarter of the next financial year beginning in July. That clearly is aimed at trying to avoid recession. What we actually need to do is to get money into the economy sooner rather than later. Schools: Victorian schools will be closed from tomorrow. The school holidays are being brought forward. The next term will begin on 14 April, unless health advice says otherwise. NSW schools will remain open BUT parents are advised to keep their kids at home if they can. ACT schools will be closed from tomorrow. The school holidays are being brought forward. Online learning will be made available. All other states are continuing the school term as scheduled. OK. There is a lot of confusion it seems over what is open and what is closed under the new rules: Here is what is closed from noon: Pubs, registered and licenced clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues), hotels (excluding accommodation). Gyms and indoor sporting venues. Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery. Religious gatherings, places of worship or funerals (in enclosed spaces and other than very small groups and where the 1 person per 4 square metre rule applies). Retail stores remain open. Shopping centres remain open. As do hairdressers, dentists, doctor surgeries, post offices \u2013 those sorts of things. The indoor gathering rules apply to those services and stores still open. No more than one person per 4 sqm and a maximum of 100 people. Keep your distance \u2013 at least 1.5m away from people. DO NOT stop taking your prescribed medication for high blood pressure. The Heart Foundation chief medical adviser professor Garry Jennings is very, very worried that people prescribed medications to lower their blood pressure may have heard an unproven theory about some of the medication and coronavirus and decided to stop. DO NOT DO THIS is the message from Jennings. Continue to take all your medicines, including ARBs or ACE inhibitors, as prescribed by your doctor,\u201d Jennings said. The medications, ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) and ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure, as well as in cases of heart failure and in treatment following a heart attack. \u201cThese medications are widely used and considered safe. They have important benefits in treating high blood pressure and in reducing the risk of illness and death in many chronic health conditions, including heart failure.\u201d From the Heart Foundation: More than three million Australians take anti-hypertensive medications, the equivalent to three in 10 Australian adults (hypertension is the medical name for high blood pressure). It\u2019s estimated that more than six million Australians have high blood pressure (34% or 1 in 3) \u2013 a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is Australia\u2019s single biggest killer. Jennings said stopping prescribed medicine could do more harm than good: \u201cThe dangers of suddenly stopping your blood pressure medications are clear and well known whereas the interaction of these types of medicines with Covid-19 is hypothetical and unproven,\u201d he said. A passenger who was on the Ruby Princess cruise ship said he believes he shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to disembark, and organisers knew that coronavirus was spreading on the boat. Bill Beerens, who contracted Covid-19 on the ship, told the ABC this morning that organisers \u201cknew what was going on, and they just wanted us off the boat\u201d. \u201cWe got off the boat on Thursday,\u201d Beerens said. \u201cWe got off at 9am. I was feeling alright. We hopped on to the shuttle bus and I was starting to get coughing there, but I held it back because of the other passengers on the bus there ... By 10pm that night, I was up at Nepean hospital getting tested and two days later, I\u2019m positive. \u201cI think that they let us down. I do honestly believe that they knew what was going on and they just wanted us off the boat. They pushed us so quickly. As I said, I do believe that they knew what was going on. \u201cOur cabin boy, the person who looks after the cabin, he was off for two days and they said \u2013 he\u2019s alright and he just has a sore throat.\u201d The 2,700 passengers on the Ruby Princess had been allowed to disembark at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay last week and were deemed to be \u201cvery low risk\u201d, despite more than 150 recorded cases of illness on board. Yesterday, NSW Health yesterday confirmed that 26 people from the cruise ship had tested positive for Covid-19 \u2013 including eight people who had been allowed to fly interstate. Earlier, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard admitted that allowing the passengers to disembark was \u201ca mistake\u201d. It seems like there was a lot of interest in Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s schools announcement \u2013 the NSW government website has crashed. To be clear: schools are open in NSW, but parents are encouraged to keep their children home, if they can. That is because 30% of parents had already made that decision, and education was already disrupted. However, there are parents who have no other choice, and for them, the schools will remain open. There will be no special lessons. A single lesson plan for each grade will be taught. Online learning will be made available for those at home. In the last hour we have learned: \u2022 NSW schools remain open, but for \u201cpractical reasons\u201d parents are encouraged to keep their children home. If you have no other choice, there will be a single lesson plan for all kids at school. \u2022 Victoria will bring forward the school holidays as planned. School will resume as planned on April 14, unless health advice recommends otherwise. \u2022 Victoria has established a 500-strong police taskforce to enforce the physical distance rules. \u2022 Labor will support the fast passage of the coronavirus stimulus bill and hopes to have it passed by 5pm today. Dan Andrews has announced a special police group has been established to ensure the physical distance rules are enforced: Now, many Victorians are doing the right thing, they are keeping their distance, they are observing the rules that have been written but there are many Victorians who are acting selfishly. They are not taking this seriously. They are doing the wrong thing and if that continues, then people will die. It is easy to do the right thing for your family and for people that you have never met. I just want to make this point, whether you call it mateship, whether you call it being Australian, being Victorian, whether you call it decent behaviour, civic duty, I don\u2019t care what you call it, just do it. You need to keep your distance. You need to observe the rules, and that is not an option. That is why today I\u2019m joined by the chief commissioner and I can also announce that Victoria police have allocated 500 police members to a special taskforce that is all about enforcing the coronavirus rules that have been put in place. In some respects it is disappointing that it has come to this but we have seen people on beaches in Sydney, we could just as easily have seen people in bars and cafes and restaurants and nightclubs here in Melbourne and right across Victoria. It is unacceptable. It will cost lives. It will cost lives. So no matter what you call it, no matter what motivates you, do the right thing for everybody. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. NSW has had 136 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. 10 people remain in intensive care. The state\u2019s total is now at 669. In Victoria, Dan Andrews is also having a press conference. Schools, as you know, were due to break up, holidays will begin, were scheduled to begin on Friday. There was at least one pupil-free day in the week also. We have taken the decision, and the chief health officer of Victoria is completely comfortable and supportive of this, to bring forward the school holidays and to spend these precious days without kids at school to plan for remote, flexible, distance learning in the event that we need to move to that way of teaching and learning. The schools will remain open in NSW, but if you can keep your children at home, you should \u201cfor practical reasons\u201d. There will be a single unit of teaching for all teachers, and online teaching will be supported. Gladys Berejiklian says it is safe to send your kids to school, but 30% of parents have already made the decision to keep their children at home. But for parents who have no choice, the schools will remain open. There will be no special lessons though. The NSW premier is holding a press conference and says she endorses the message from the prime minister last night, to close all \u201cnon-essential\u201d services. The AFL has also shut down the season, but the NRL says it will keep playing until it is told it can not. A decision from the A-League is expected later today. Under the new rules put in place last night, this is what will be forcibly shut down at midday today The following facilities will be restricted from opening from midday local time 23 March 2020: Pubs, registered and licensed clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues), hotels (excluding accommodation) Gyms and indoor sporting venues Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and nightclubs Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery Religious gatherings, places of worship or funerals (in enclosed spaces and other than very small groups and where the one person per four square metre rule applies). Isolated remote community hubs are not included in these restrictions. These measures also apply to outdoor spaces associated with the above venues. Gladys Berejiklian will hold a press conference at 8am. The NSW leader is expected to announce what that state will be doing over school closures. On the coming forced closures, Anthony Albanese says the \u201cearlier we act on the health issues, the better it will be\u201d, and says he supports the crackdown to ensure physical distance. But he says he understands why parents are confused over schools. \u201cIt was clear as mud,\u201d he said of last night\u2019s press conference. Albanese says he also believes federal Labor should have a seat at the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d but he won\u2019t go to Scott Morrison \u201cwith a begging bowl\u201d. The Labor leader says if Labor\u2019s suggestions are not picked up, the opposition will still not stand in the way of passing the legislation. Anthony Albanese says the payments should be brought forward, and there should be more money available to low-income workers. He also wants some safeguards put in around superannuation. He had a private meeting with Scott Morrison last night and \u201cunlike what the opposition did when we saved the nation from the global financial crisis\u201d, Labor will be \u201cconstructive\u201d during the legislation process. Anthony Albanese is now talking to Fran Kelly on ABC radio and says he believes the coronavirus stimulus bills will be passed by 5pm today. For anyone who needs information on the coronavirus payments, you can find more here. I\u2019ve had a few messages from readers \u2013 to make it clear, as a parent, you can decide to remove your children from school, if that is what you wish, no matter where you live. Scott Morrison (from last night): Parents who make the decision for their children to remain at home must take responsibility for those children. Those children are staying at home. It\u2019s not an excuse for them to go down the shopping centre or to go and congregate somewhere else or potentially put themselves in contact with the vulnerable and elderly population. If you choose to keep your child at home, you are responsible for the conduct and behaviour of your children. That is always the case for any parent. But particularly in this case, it is important that they observe the strict social distancing arrangements that have been advised to the public. The Labor shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says Labor won\u2019t stand in the way of the government\u2019s stimulus package, and will do what it can to support the fast passage of the bill. But Chalmers says the government hasn\u2019t moved as quickly as it might have, and the July payments need to be brought forward. It isn\u2019t clear how Labor plans on trying to make that happen as yet \u2013 at the moment, everyone is trying to get this bill cleared as soon as possible. The first payment is due to be released at the end of this month. Dan Tehan, the education minister, is resolute that schools will remain open, as far as the federal government is concerned: What we have to do is take the medical expert advice. If we don\u2019t do that, what do we do? Do we take the medical expert advice on Twitter, on Facebook? This opinion or that opinion? We can\u2019t be doing that. We\u2019ve got to listen to the panel which has been brought together which is taking in the best advice that we can get around the country from our scientists, from our universities, from our best medical professionals. That\u2019s what is informing government decision-making and that\u2019s what will continue to inform government decision-making. That very best medical advice. If it changes, the government\u2019s made very clear that we will change the position when it comes to schools. But at the moment, it hasn\u2019t changed. The education minister Dan Tehan is on ABC Breakfast, attempting to clear up the confusion around schools being open or closed. \u201cSchools remain open, and if parents want to send their kids to school, they should do so,\u201d he says. Tehan says he doesn\u2019t want students to lose a year\u2019s education, if it can be avoided, and the medical panel is agreement that schools can safely remain open. The education minister is trying to spin Victoria\u2019s decision to close schools this week, as not a rebellion \u2013 he says Dan Andrews has just moved school holidays earlier. It\u2019s a mess. The parliament will sit today, but with reduced numbers. Only 90 MPs will be allowed into the House of Representatives at a time. There are 30 pairs. The parliament will sit for as long as it takes to pass the coronavirus stimulus package and that\u2019s it. It is scheduled for today, but will spill into tomorrow, if necessary. Scott Morrison said the parliament was now in \u201cemergency mode\u201d, which means it will sit when there is an urgent need \u2013 which basically means when it needs to pass more legislation related to Covid-19. There is still some confusion over schools closures. Here is what we know. Queensland: schools open as usual. NSW: an announcement is expected today. Victoria: easter holidays brought forward, with schools to close from Tuesday. ACT: easter holidays brought forward, with schools to close from Tuesday. Scott Morrison said last night that parents could decide to pull their children from school, regardless of where they lived, but were responsible for keeping them at home. Good morning, everyone. Australia will introduce another round of measures to encourage social distancing today with all clubs, pubs, nightclubs, places of worship, cinemas, indoor sporting and other entertainment venues closing from midday. Cafes and restaurants will be able to do takeaway only. These restrictions could be in place for up to six months, according to the prime minister. But schools will remain open in all states and territories except Victoria and the ACT, who have announced they will be bringing Easter holidays forward to start tomorrow. There\u2019s been a lot of confusion on the issue of schools. NSW and Victoria both signalled yesterday that they were going to go it alone and shut down schools and introduce more draconian lockdown measures without national consensus. But when the prime minister emerged from the national cabinet meeting at 9pm last night he insisted that schools would remain open, and that those that were closing early for the school holidays would open again in term two, subject to medical advice. Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin have more on this obvious fracture between the PM and the premiers of the two most populous states. You have the whole Guardian team working to bring you the issues as they happen. We have never seen these sorts of restrictions in Australia before \u2013 and we know there are more to come.",

The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases. The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe\u2019s pollution hotspots. Since the country went into lockdown on 9 March, NO2 levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40%. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unprecedented,\u201d said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. \u201cIn the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather.

That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel.

Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus\u2019s foothills.

Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final.

      "bodyText": "No one was ever going to beat Michael Johnson\u2019s record. Not in my young lifetime anyway, maybe some distant day when I was old and grey, and athletics had changed out of all recognition. Remember watching him set it at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had and he finished five metres back. Over the next decade, no one got near. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62, Xavier Carter in 19.63, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65. They were the second, third, and fourth quickest 200m sprints in history, and Johnson\u2019s time was so far beyond them it was in another realm altogether. Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus\u2019s foothills. There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt \u2013 a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors. Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finish line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so. He was one. What is less well remembered now is just how upset some people got about it all, how the president of the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, called him out for \u201cdisrespecting his competitors\u201d and said it wasn\u2019t \u201cthe way we perceive being a champion\u201d. Watching in the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, it wasn\u2019t the swagger that bothered me but the split seconds it had cost him. We didn\u2019t know, then, whether Bolt would run that fast again \u2013 Johnson never did \u2013 which meant he, and we, might never find out what he was capable of, where his limits, our human limits, really lay. Until four days later, when we found out. Bolt explained he had not been bothered about breaking the 100m world record, since it was already his. The 200m mark, Johnson\u2019s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet.

Yourcenar\u2019s perfect steady and calm voice, in which you can almost hear the breathing; Breece \u2013 and this may just be my bad memory \u2013 for his gnarled, condensed, gritty sentences that hide a shadow meaning; or Fermor for his \u2026 what? \u2026 flow, exuberance?; or Paley\u2019s wise and humane manner of speaking, so to speak\u2026</p> <p>The book is \u2018about\u2019 \u2013 that horrible word \u2013 what is lost, washed away to see but also, perhaps, the idea that <em>you cannot destroy a ruin</em> and that sometimes, when the light is right, something of the old structure of our lives returns.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nickel and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17381240\">greenmill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An American writer leaves her middle-class life to attempt to survive in the minimum wage world of house cleaners, waiters in cheap diners and Walmart sales assistants.

Turns out the morning cook had forgotten to take said steaks out of the freezer before he clocked off. It goes steadily down hill after that.</p> <p>Desperate stuff. Important subject.</p> </blockquote> <p>Joseph Conrad\u2019s The Secret Sharer has worked its magic on <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17857286\">LeatherCol</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is probably one of the most exciting and moving stories about gay desire and dynamics that I\u2019ve read. Profound and passionately erotic and goes without saying, beautifully written.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kazimierz<em><strong> </strong></em>Brandys\u2019 Warsaw Diary 1978-81 is \u201cessential cold war reading\u201d, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100520245\">AbsoluteBeginner76</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brandys writes in a concise, intelligent and insightful way about Poland and his memories of Poland before 1939. The section I just read concerns the visit to Warsaw of the Pope in Summer 1979. Brandys is not Catholic or a believer but observes the nation coming together around one of their own and their Catholic heritage. Young people walk under his window at night in earnest chatter, a large cross stands on Victory Square and he notices the regime are suddenly invisible, uneasy, watching from the shadows. He observes the features of the Pontiff from afar on the giant screen. He muses on the act of describing something, not showing or naming and then spends a paragraph describing the facial features of Jean Paul in beautiful simple language ....</p> </blockquote> <p>Many of you have also been sharing tips that fall outside our usual literary remit, but feel important and reassuring right now. There have been ideas for staving off boredom, for ensuring sanity, for survival and for spreading kindness. You\u2019ve also been checking in on each other. All this is welcome. It makes me feel better and I hope it does the same for you. While the Botheration remains ongoing, I\u2019ll occasionally highlight a few of these posts up here. Like the following splendid idea from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12168095\">PatLux</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I love visiting art galleries and over the years I have accumulated loads of beautiful art books that I bought in gallery shops. I tend to look at them on the journey home and then they sit on my shelves for years. I have decided that each day I will remove one book from my shelves and leaf through it. This will doubtless bring to mind memories of not only the paintings but also the trip to the city where the art gallery is. Before I do that I am going to lift my spirits with a scoot through my book of Janet Fish\u2019s beautiful paintings. I love how she paints glassware.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, some excellent advice on reading Charles Dickens from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I long ago came to the conclusion that one must<em> never </em>analyse Dickens: just sit back and let those sentences, that energy, those images, roll through your brain. Even better than caffeine.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those sentences are among the things that will help us get through this \u2013 and make doing so feel worthwhile. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all together here, tending the flame.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>\u201cEverything was different in 1920,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/reading-1920s-essay-nicholson-baker/\">Nicholson Baker on 100-year-old literary sensations</a>, \u201cand yet nothing really has changed.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>The US book industry is bracing for a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/books/coronavirus-impact-publishing-industry-booksellers-authors.html?te=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=edit_bk_20200317&amp;campaign_id=69&amp;instance_id=16851&amp;segment_id=22321&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a&amp;regi_id=4174067420200317\">\u201cnewly ominous future\u201d</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Charles Nicholl <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n05/charles-nicholl/the-wind-comes-up-out-of-nowhere\">on the disappearance of Arthur Cravan</a>.</p></li> <li><p>\u201cEveryone in the industry is in the same mess.

Joseph Conrad\u2019s The Secret Sharer has worked its magic on LeatherCol: I think it is probably one of the most exciting and moving stories about gay desire and dynamics that I\u2019ve read. Profound and passionately erotic and goes without saying, beautifully written. Kazimierz Brandys\u2019 Warsaw Diary 1978-81 is \u201cessential cold war reading\u201d, says AbsoluteBeginner76: Brandys writes in a concise, intelligent and insightful way about Poland and his memories of Poland before 1939. The section I just read concerns the visit to Warsaw of the Pope in Summer 1979. Brandys is not Catholic or a believer but observes the nation coming together around one of their own and their Catholic heritage. Young people walk under his window at night in earnest chatter, a large cross stands on Victory Square and he notices the regime are suddenly invisible, uneasy, watching from the shadows. He observes the features of the Pontiff from afar on the giant screen. He muses on the act of describing something, not showing or naming and then spends a paragraph describing the facial features of Jean Paul in beautiful simple language .... Many of you have also been sharing tips that fall outside our usual literary remit, but feel important and reassuring right now. There have been ideas for staving off boredom, for ensuring sanity, for survival and for spreading kindness. You\u2019ve also been checking in on each other. All this is welcome. It makes me feel better and I hope it does the same for you. While the Botheration remains ongoing, I\u2019ll occasionally highlight a few of these posts up here. Like the following splendid idea from PatLux: I love visiting art galleries and over the years I have accumulated loads of beautiful art books that I bought in gallery shops. I tend to look at them on the journey home and then they sit on my shelves for years. I have decided that each day I will remove one book from my shelves and leaf through it. This will doubtless bring to mind memories of not only the paintings but also the trip to the city where the art gallery is. Before I do that I am going to lift my spirits with a scoot through my book of Janet Fish\u2019s beautiful paintings. I love how she paints glassware. Finally, some excellent advice on reading Charles Dickens from interwar: I long ago came to the conclusion that one must never analyse Dickens: just sit back and let those sentences, that energy, those images, roll through your brain. Even better than caffeine. Those sentences are among the things that will help us get through this \u2013 and make doing so feel worthwhile. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re all together here, tending the flame. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cEverything was different in 1920,\u201d says Nicholson Baker on 100-year-old literary sensations, \u201cand yet nothing really has changed.\u201d The US book industry is bracing for a \u201cnewly ominous future\u201d. Charles Nicholl on the disappearance of Arthur Cravan. \u201cEveryone in the industry is in the same mess. Well, good company, if you ask us.\u201d Melville House\u2019s message to readers will possibly make you cry, but will certainly give you hope. If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog. Happy reading!",

Olympics in doubt as Canada pulls out The Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been cast into doubt after Canada became the first team to announce it would not send athletes unless the Games were postponed until next year. The Canadian Olympic Committee said holding the event as planned \u201cruns counter to the public health advice\u201d. Australia and New Zealand have expressed similar concerns. Panic buying threatens US food supply Panic buying is more damaging to the US food supply chain than the pandemic, experts interviewed by the Guardian have said. The practice is causing a shift in buying practices that the grocery supply has not yet adapted to, with working from home and social distancing perhaps to blame for the stockpiling trend. Germany. Experts have speculated as to why the country has a relatively low coronavirus mortality rate. The rate in Germany is just 0.3%, compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK, with 84 deaths out of 22,364 cases as of Sunday. And in other news\u2026 An earthquake has caused widespread damage to Croatia\u2019s capital, Zagreb, hitting the city shortly after 6am local time on Sunday. The 5.3-magnitude quake, which was followed by a series of tremors, was the biggest in Zagreb in 140 years, according to the prime minister, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, and brought many residents on to the streetsdespite social distancing measures. The Hungarian parliament will consider a bill to give prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n emergency powers to rule by decree during the coronavirus outbreak this week. Critics warn the measures could easily be abused, and the bill\u2019s proposal to jail those considered to be sharing fake news has caused alarm among independent journalists who have often been accused by the government of spreading misinformation. European clean energy initiatives experienced a significant slowdown last year due to lack of state support, a report suggests. The findings follow warnings that the coronavirus outbreak could stall the development of clean energy initiatives. In other energy news, RuPaul caused a social media uproar after appearing to announce that he conducts fracking on his land. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross, the RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race host revealed that he leases the mineral and water rights of 60 acres of land he owns in Wyoming to oil companies. Must-reads Wild animals reclaim locked-down cities With cities around the world in quarantine, wild animals including deers and turkeys have been spotted wandering in empty streets and subway stations from Nara in Japan to California. As people stay indoors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the animals appear to be emboldened to search further for food. How to manage Covid-19 anxiety The brain finds uncertainty notoriously difficult to handle, so experiencing high levels of anxiety during the enormous social upheaval caused by coronavirus is perfectly normal. Emine Saner gets tips on managing it from leading psychologists. Isolated tribes at risk of virus from missionaries As coronavirus spreads to more than 340,000 people around the world, officials and doctors have warned of the risks posed to isolated tribes. It came after an evangelical Christian missionary group landed its helicopter outside a Brazilian reserve, which is home to the world\u2019s highest concentration of isolated indigenous groups. The mission to save rare African wildlife With just 10,000 left, African manatees have been classified as a vulnerable species and placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List. Annika Hammerschlag joins researchers fighting to save the manatees in Senegal. Opinion Homeless people have been forgotten in coronavirus measures, argues Mustafa Santiago Ali. Homeless children in the US reportedly suffer from asthma at six times the national average, making them more at risk from the virus, while handwashing is inaccessible for those without access to water and soap. If we want to mitigate the impacts of this highly contagious and deadly virus, it is imperative that we ensure that vulnerable communities have access to clean water and address this long-standing environmental injustice.\u201d Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

After 50 minutes of simmering, you have a pale yellow, gently flavoured stock to be strained and salted. You also have a little poached meat that has given up some but not all of its flavour.

      "body": "<p>The old adage about writing what you know has fallen out of fashion as advice for new writers, but it\u2019s served Jessica Moor well in her first novel, <em>Keeper</em>, the story of a murder investigation that centres on a women\u2019s refuge. Moor was inspired to write about her experiences of working with victims of domestic violence, and <em>Keeper</em> explores how abuse can rob women of their lives in more ways than one.</p> <p>Katie Straw, a young worker at a refuge in the north-western town of Widringham, is found dead in the river after apparently jumping from the bridge. DS Daniel Whitworth had hoped to reach his imminent retirement \u201cwithout having to deal with another corpse\u201d, though at least this one looks like an open-and-shut suicide, since Katie\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 the obvious suspect \u2013 has an alibi. It\u2019s only when Whitworth discovers that Katie was living under a false identity that he realises he might have to start paying attention to the women at the refuge, none of whom \u2013 with good reason \u2013 has much faith in the law\u2019s ability to listen.</p> <p>The novel unfolds using several voices, and across two time frames, which is occasionally confusing. Moor follows the individual stories of the women in the refuge, so different from one another in age and background, but thrown together in uneasy solidarity by the experience that binds them \u2013 the violence of a man close to them. There are also flashbacks to Katie\u2019s earlier life and her previous relationship with a seemingly perfect man called Jamie.</p> <p>These strands are intercut with chapters following Whitworth\u2019s investigation, which are the weakest elements of the novel; the author is less certain of her material here, and Whitworth never quite achieves more than two dimensions as a character.</p> <p>But the novel really comes to life when she tells the women\u2019s stories. Katie\u2019s relationship with Jamie is chilling in its creep towards coercive control, a form of abuse only recently recognised in law but familiar in fiction and drama, from the 1938 play <em>Gas Light</em> to Louise Doughty\u2019s recent novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/22/platform-seven-by-louise-doughty-review\" title=\"\"><em>Platform Seven</em></a>.</p> <p>Moor skilfully avoids the danger of making the novel too didactic and allows her female characters to speak for themselves. She presents a spectrum of male violence, from a Twitter trolling campaign of violent rape threats against the refuge, to the male detectives\u2019 dismissive response, through the various instances of physical and emotional control and ultimately murder.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day a hundred and fifty women in this country are turned away from refuges. Two hundred children too.\u201d It\u2019s an almost off-hand comment made by Val, the director of the women\u2019s shelter, but it stayed with me as one of the most frightening moments in this atmospheric, timely debut.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Keeper</em> by Jessica Moor<em> </em>is published by Penguin (\u00a314.99).

DS Daniel Whitworth had hoped to reach his imminent retirement \u201cwithout having to deal with another corpse\u201d, though at least this one looks like an open-and-shut suicide, since Katie\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 the obvious suspect \u2013 has an alibi. It\u2019s only when Whitworth discovers that Katie was living under a false identity that he realises he might have to start paying attention to the women at the refuge, none of whom \u2013 with good reason \u2013 has much faith in the law\u2019s ability to listen. The novel unfolds using several voices, and across two time frames, which is occasionally confusing. Moor follows the individual stories of the women in the refuge, so different from one another in age and background, but thrown together in uneasy solidarity by the experience that binds them \u2013 the violence of a man close to them. There are also flashbacks to Katie\u2019s earlier life and her previous relationship with a seemingly perfect man called Jamie. These strands are intercut with chapters following Whitworth\u2019s investigation, which are the weakest elements of the novel; the author is less certain of her material here, and Whitworth never quite achieves more than two dimensions as a character. But the novel really comes to life when she tells the women\u2019s stories. Katie\u2019s relationship with Jamie is chilling in its creep towards coercive control, a form of abuse only recently recognised in law but familiar in fiction and drama, from the 1938 play Gas Light to Louise Doughty\u2019s recent novel Platform Seven. Moor skilfully avoids the danger of making the novel too didactic and allows her female characters to speak for themselves. She presents a spectrum of male violence, from a Twitter trolling campaign of violent rape threats against the refuge, to the male detectives\u2019 dismissive response, through the various instances of physical and emotional control and ultimately murder. \u201cEvery day a hundred and fifty women in this country are turned away from refuges. Two hundred children too.\u201d It\u2019s an almost off-hand comment made by Val, the director of the women\u2019s shelter, but it stayed with me as one of the most frightening moments in this atmospheric, timely debut. \u2022 Keeper by Jessica Moor is published by Penguin (\u00a314.99).

Although the majority of Italy\u2019s population of 62 million are complying with the regulations, the interior ministry said on Monday that 92,367 citizens had been charged for breaking them since the lockdown was enforced. Police now have permission to use drones as controls are upped across the country, and the army is patrolling the streets in some places. People have been jogging, playing ping-pong on the beach and walking their dogs more often than usual as an excuse to venture out.

Italians are banned from moving across municipalities other than for \u201cnon-deferrable and proven business or health reasons or other urgent matters\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Retirees David and Denise Morse were celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary with a 15-day trip aboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess cruise liner</a> when 19 crew members and two passengers aboard the ship were diagnosed with the coronavirus.</p> <p>The original itinerary had the Morses arriving in Ensenada, Mexico, from Hawaii on 5 March, and returning home to San Francisco two days later. Instead, the cruise liner was held off the San Francisco coast for several days, until it docked in the Port of Oakland on 9 March.</p> <p>The 2,000 passengers on board disembarked over the course of three days. More than 800 California residents were sent to Travis air force base in Fairfield, about 47 miles north-east of San Francisco , to serve out a 14-day quarantine.</p> <p>David and Denise are keeping a diary documenting their stay there.</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 10.</strong><strong>35</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I don\u2019t know what this is going to be \u2013 a journal, story or what. I just wanted to write down some of the many thoughts I have had as we go through this surreal ordeal.<strong> </strong>We are on the fourth floor of the Westwind Inn hotel, on the property of Travis air force base. Got in our room at 9.30pm last night, after a long day that started at 6am on the ship.</p> <p>We had been dressed and ready to depart our stateroom C314 on the 10th floor, at 7am. The ship had arrived in Oakland the previous day, and passengers had begun disembarking \u2013 the sick and elderly first. We couldn\u2019t see much from what was going on. All the action was on the starboard side, and we were on port.</p> <p>We waited more than six hours for our turn today. My impression is that Princess Cruises is very experienced in handling large groups, feeding, giving instructions and disembarking procedures. They have it together. On the land, it\u2019s more politically and medically challenging, as officials have to coordinate between cities, states and the federal government.</p> <p>This morning, we thought we had to get up for our coronavirus test at 7.15am. On 6 March, Vice-President Pence had announced that everyone disembarking from the boat would be tested for coronavirus.</p> <p>We scrambled to the elevator area, only to find that the staff were handing out breakfast boxes. So, no testing. At 9.30am, they gave us a temperature check and symptom questions. We were told we would be tested only if we show symptoms. Is that because there is a shortage of testing supplies?</p> <p>We went downstairs and found a large group of masked passengers in line for coffee and using their bare hands to get juice cartons and breakfast boxes.</p> <h2><strong>12 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>55am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>There are 846 Californians in our four-story hotel at Travis air force base. The majority are elderly folks, many using canes, walkers, wheelchairs and scooters. Medical staff takes our temperatures twice a day. We asked again to be tested for Covid-19 and learned this morning from a medical staff person that they do not have test kits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is likely that there are folks among us with the virus. We are advised to wash hands, wear our masks, stay six feet from others, and not gather in large groups. However, we have large groups standing close to each other in line to pick up their food boxes. We\u2019ve seen people pick up a box, look at it, then choose another box.</p> <p>We skipped coffee this morning because to get coffee you have to stand in a line, then use your bare hands to separate a cup from a stack of cups and dispense coffee from a community container. I asked a medical staff person why not have staff dispense the coffee, noting they all have gloves. She said there is not enough staff.</p> <p>I feel that each day we stay here we increase our chances of contracting the virus. Denise and I are doing our best to protect ourselves and stay positive. We are healthy and know that we will do well if we get the virus. We don\u2019t take the elevators; we try to stay away from groups of people. We exercise. I do tai chi every day and Denise meditates every day.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 2pm \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I spent much of yesterday and today talking to political folks about the conditions here, calling the offices of California senators Diane Feinstein and Kamala Harris and congressman John Garamendi.</p> <p>We were feeling rather discouraged about the health and safety situation. But things are improving. At noon they started delivering our meals to our rooms.</p> <p><strong>David, 3</strong><strong>.40</strong><strong>pm \u2013</strong> What a day. Another passenger and I were outside playing Five Foot Two on the ukuleles we got on the cruise ship. A military guy politely approached us and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I have orders to ask you to return to your room.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. Off to our room.</p> <p>There is no alcohol allowed here. But we have a few small bottles from the ship. Just had Jack and coke, made Denise a gin and tonic without ice or limes.</p> <h2><strong>13 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 9</strong><strong>.02</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><em> </em>We are getting acquainted with how things work here. Yesterday at the reception area in the lobby I asked a friendly service woman if we could have some shampoo. She said, \u201cYou know, soap is fine.\u201d I said \u201cOK, could we have some soap?\u201d She said, \u201cSorry, we are out of soap.\u201d Later I asked another staff member for some soap. She gave me a small bottle of shampoo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view from the Morse\u2019s fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view from the Morses\u2019 fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This morning, after complimenting the staff on how they are now dispensing the box meals to our rooms, I complained that coffee is still grab and go, as are juice, water, cream and sugar.</p> <p>A few minutes later a staff member knocked at our door and said the commander of the quarantine operation would like to talk to me. Denise and I thought, \u201cOh no, now we are in trouble.\u201d We met Nate Contreras, who informed us that he is in charge of 60 staff, who serve food, deliver medications, take our temperatures and respond to any passenger\u2019s medical issue. He was friendly and wanted to hear our concerns. He explained that he didn\u2019t have enough staff to dispense coffee, but he has asked for more.</p> <p>We asked for more hand-washing stations, signs and hand sanitizer. The only place we can wash our hands is in our rooms. We suggested they give us packets for the coffee makers we have in our rooms, he said he would look into it. Surprise: we were not in trouble.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>We got our first official Travis air force base newsletter today. Here\u2019s what they said about testing: <em>Everyone here will have the opportunity to be tested for Covid-19. You are not required to be tested. It will be your choice. If you choose to be tested, it is important that you understand that if the results of your test are pending, then it is possible it may delay your departure.</em></p> <p><strong>David, 10</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am</strong> \u2013 23 March is the first day of spring and supposedly the end of our 14-day quarantine. We have nine days to go; this testing statement sounds like it is a feeble attempt to be able to claim that passengers were offered the opportunity to be tested. What would you do?</p> <p>Here is our list of needs: a blanket (we have a one-sheet cover on our bed and it\u2019s cold in here), coffee, replacement light bulb for the light on our bed stand, hand soap and laundry detergent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68/0_44_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>03</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong> Denise and I are healthy and in good spirits. We got another newsletter today. It repeats the same testing instructions we saw yesterday, which seem like a threat rather than an option to be tested.</p> <p>We walked in the rain this morning. We have to walk on the lawn, as most of the sidewalks are outside the perimeter fence that surrounds the complex \u2013 with security guards in SUVs watching 24/7.</p> <h2><strong>16 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>Woke up at 6am. While David was doing the laundry down the hall, I made the bed and cleaned the bathroom with the hand sanitizer cloths that we had brought with us on the cruise ship. They are gold, and we only use them to clean surfaces in our room and bathroom. There are no cleaning supplies. We were told we could have a room cleaning, but we prefer to not have anyone in our room.</p> <p>We have decided not to be tested. Our rationale is we are in good health and show no symptoms. As required, we wear our masks when out of our room, stay six feet from individuals, don\u2019t touch handles.

      "bodyText": "Retirees David and Denise Morse were celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary with a 15-day trip aboard the Grand Princess cruise liner when 19 crew members and two passengers aboard the ship were diagnosed with the coronavirus. The original itinerary had the Morses arriving in Ensenada, Mexico, from Hawaii on 5 March, and returning home to San Francisco two days later. Instead, the cruise liner was held off the San Francisco coast for several days, until it docked in the Port of Oakland on 9 March. The 2,000 passengers on board disembarked over the course of three days. More than 800 California residents were sent to Travis air force base in Fairfield, about 47 miles north-east of San Francisco , to serve out a 14-day quarantine. David and Denise are keeping a diary documenting their stay there. 11 March David, 10.35am \u2013 I don\u2019t know what this is going to be \u2013 a journal, story or what. I just wanted to write down some of the many thoughts I have had as we go through this surreal ordeal. We are on the fourth floor of the Westwind Inn hotel, on the property of Travis air force base. Got in our room at 9.30pm last night, after a long day that started at 6am on the ship. We had been dressed and ready to depart our stateroom C314 on the 10th floor, at 7am. The ship had arrived in Oakland the previous day, and passengers had begun disembarking \u2013 the sick and elderly first. We couldn\u2019t see much from what was going on. All the action was on the starboard side, and we were on port. We waited more than six hours for our turn today. My impression is that Princess Cruises is very experienced in handling large groups, feeding, giving instructions and disembarking procedures. They have it together. On the land, it\u2019s more politically and medically challenging, as officials have to coordinate between cities, states and the federal government. This morning, we thought we had to get up for our coronavirus test at 7.15am. On 6 March, Vice-President Pence had announced that everyone disembarking from the boat would be tested for coronavirus. We scrambled to the elevator area, only to find that the staff were handing out breakfast boxes. So, no testing. At 9.30am, they gave us a temperature check and symptom questions. We were told we would be tested only if we show symptoms. Is that because there is a shortage of testing supplies? We went downstairs and found a large group of masked passengers in line for coffee and using their bare hands to get juice cartons and breakfast boxes. 12 March David, 8.55am \u2013 There are 846 Californians in our four-story hotel at Travis air force base. The majority are elderly folks, many using canes, walkers, wheelchairs and scooters. Medical staff takes our temperatures twice a day. We asked again to be tested for Covid-19 and learned this morning from a medical staff person that they do not have test kits. It is likely that there are folks among us with the virus. We are advised to wash hands, wear our masks, stay six feet from others, and not gather in large groups. However, we have large groups standing close to each other in line to pick up their food boxes. We\u2019ve seen people pick up a box, look at it, then choose another box. We skipped coffee this morning because to get coffee you have to stand in a line, then use your bare hands to separate a cup from a stack of cups and dispense coffee from a community container. I asked a medical staff person why not have staff dispense the coffee, noting they all have gloves. She said there is not enough staff. I feel that each day we stay here we increase our chances of contracting the virus. Denise and I are doing our best to protect ourselves and stay positive. We are healthy and know that we will do well if we get the virus. We don\u2019t take the elevators; we try to stay away from groups of people. We exercise. I do tai chi every day and Denise meditates every day. Denise, 2pm \u2013 I spent much of yesterday and today talking to political folks about the conditions here, calling the offices of California senators Diane Feinstein and Kamala Harris and congressman John Garamendi. We were feeling rather discouraged about the health and safety situation. But things are improving. At noon they started delivering our meals to our rooms. David, 3.40pm \u2013 What a day. Another passenger and I were outside playing Five Foot Two on the ukuleles we got on the cruise ship. A military guy politely approached us and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I have orders to ask you to return to your room.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. Off to our room. There is no alcohol allowed here. But we have a few small bottles from the ship. Just had Jack and coke, made Denise a gin and tonic without ice or limes. 13 March David, 9.02am \u2013 We are getting acquainted with how things work here. Yesterday at the reception area in the lobby I asked a friendly service woman if we could have some shampoo. She said, \u201cYou know, soap is fine.\u201d I said \u201cOK, could we have some soap?\u201d She said, \u201cSorry, we are out of soap.\u201d Later I asked another staff member for some soap. She gave me a small bottle of shampoo. This morning, after complimenting the staff on how they are now dispensing the box meals to our rooms, I complained that coffee is still grab and go, as are juice, water, cream and sugar. A few minutes later a staff member knocked at our door and said the commander of the quarantine operation would like to talk to me. Denise and I thought, \u201cOh no, now we are in trouble.\u201d We met Nate Contreras, who informed us that he is in charge of 60 staff, who serve food, deliver medications, take our temperatures and respond to any passenger\u2019s medical issue. He was friendly and wanted to hear our concerns. He explained that he didn\u2019t have enough staff to dispense coffee, but he has asked for more. We asked for more hand-washing stations, signs and hand sanitizer. The only place we can wash our hands is in our rooms. We suggested they give us packets for the coffee makers we have in our rooms, he said he would look into it. Surprise: we were not in trouble. Denise, 9am \u2013 We got our first official Travis air force base newsletter today. Here\u2019s what they said about testing: Everyone here will have the opportunity to be tested for Covid-19. You are not required to be tested. It will be your choice. If you choose to be tested, it is important that you understand that if the results of your test are pending, then it is possible it may delay your departure. David, 10.30am \u2013 23 March is the first day of spring and supposedly the end of our 14-day quarantine. We have nine days to go; this testing statement sounds like it is a feeble attempt to be able to claim that passengers were offered the opportunity to be tested. What would you do? Here is our list of needs: a blanket (we have a one-sheet cover on our bed and it\u2019s cold in here), coffee, replacement light bulb for the light on our bed stand, hand soap and laundry detergent. 14 March David, 8.03am \u2013 Denise and I are healthy and in good spirits. We got another newsletter today. It repeats the same testing instructions we saw yesterday, which seem like a threat rather than an option to be tested. We walked in the rain this morning. We have to walk on the lawn, as most of the sidewalks are outside the perimeter fence that surrounds the complex \u2013 with security guards in SUVs watching 24/7. 16 March Denise, 9.30am \u2013 Woke up at 6am. While David was doing the laundry down the hall, I made the bed and cleaned the bathroom with the hand sanitizer cloths that we had brought with us on the cruise ship. They are gold, and we only use them to clean surfaces in our room and bathroom. There are no cleaning supplies. We were told we could have a room cleaning, but we prefer to not have anyone in our room. We have decided not to be tested. Our rationale is we are in good health and show no symptoms. As required, we wear our masks when out of our room, stay six feet from individuals, don\u2019t touch handles. We take stairs and wash our hands for 20 seconds when we return to our room. 15 March Denise, 9.31am \u2013 Up at 7am. Our floor medical person took our temp at 8.30 \u2013 normal. We have acquired some coffee, so David made coffee in our room. Breakfast was lighter this morning: bagel, cream cheese, banana, option for yogurt and a ketchup pack (what for?). The daily 2pm conference call with federal officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) left us confused and worried. They announced there have been two confirmed cases among passengers assigned to this facility. They said those with close contact with those individuals have been informed; no need to be concerned. They have begun testing those who asked to be tested \u2013 only 30% of those at Travis ended up wanting a test. Those who got tested are still waiting for results. Dinner served at 6.40pm included a hamburger bun with a piece of yellow cheese, sliced tomato and a piece of lettuce. I asked if there was anything else and the man who delivered it said no. So we used the microwave in our room to heat up the bun and cheese. Wasn\u2019t that bad, but it was not many calories.

The NHS will be put under enormous strain. And even after the peak \u2013 whenever that is \u2013 it will take time for social distancing measures to be relaxed and for the coronavirus to be behind us.</p> <p>The scientific expert I spoke to, on condition of anonymity, suggested that a best-case scenario was that an antibody test will be soon developed that will let us know if substantial numbers of the population have been infected and recovered. But, he stressed, it would probably still take six months for it to be developed, ramped up, and tested on the population.</p> <p>Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it may be that when we do have those tests, we\u2019ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just don\u2019t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.\u201d</p> <p>Even if football returns behind closed doors \u2013 the best\u2011case scenario \u2013 there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: \u201cWe are in a very bad place. And we haven\u2019t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially you\u2019ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out \u00a3250,000 each for Richard Scudamore\u2019s \u00a35m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs.</p> <p>More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club; and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets players\u2019 salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical.</p> <p>Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? It\u2019s not as if they can\u2019t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is \u00a361,024 a week \u2013 and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. That\u2019s a cumulative \u00a330m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teams\u2019 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one week\u2019s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined \u00a3100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/usa-track-and-field-tokyo-olympics-postponed\">USA Track and Field joins swimming in calling for Olympics postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe?</p> <p>The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this season\u2019s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. \u201cI think it\u2019s delusional to think it\u2019s going to happen. If people are saying that they\u2019ve got absolutely no idea about what\u2019s about to hit them.\u201d</p>",

Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials. \u201cWe still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it may be that when we do have those tests, we\u2019ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just don\u2019t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.\u201d Even if football returns behind closed doors \u2013 the best\u2011case scenario \u2013 there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: \u201cWe are in a very bad place. And we haven\u2019t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially you\u2019ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.\u201d Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out \u00a3250,000 each for Richard Scudamore\u2019s \u00a35m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs. More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club; and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets players\u2019 salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical. Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? It\u2019s not as if they can\u2019t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is \u00a361,024 a week \u2013 and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. That\u2019s a cumulative \u00a330m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teams\u2019 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one week\u2019s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined \u00a3100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean. At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe? The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this season\u2019s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. \u201cI think it\u2019s delusional to think it\u2019s going to happen. If people are saying that they\u2019ve got absolutely no idea about what\u2019s about to hit them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At a time when questions of identity are fraught and thorny, there\u2019s something daring in the set-up of Sebastian Barry\u2019s <em>A Thousand Moons</em>. Continuing the sweepingly ambitious cycle of stories that draw on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\" title=\"\">a fictionalised version of his own family history</a>, Barry now turns to a minor figure from his previous novel, the Costa prize-winning <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/days-without-end-by-sebastian-barry-review\" title=\"\">Days Without End</a></em>. Winona is a member of the Lakota tribe \u2013 \u201cthe saddest people that ever were on the earth\u201d \u2013 rescued by Thomas McNulty (who narrated the last book) and his partner John Cole. That Barry knows he has strayed into tricksy territory is clear from the off. \u201cI am Winona,\u201d the novel begins, before immediately qualifying this seemingly simple statement of identity. It is Winona\u2019s fate to be adopted and re-presented by men, appropriation that points to the author\u2019s conflicted stance speaking with Winona\u2019s voice. \u201cIn early times I was Ojinjintka, which means rose. Thomas McNulty tried very hard to say this name, but he failed, and so he gave me my dead cousin\u2019s name because it was easier in his mouth. Winona means first-born. I was not first-born.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Thousand Moons </em>skips forward a few years from <em>Days Without End </em>and although it\u2019s in effect a sequel, the novel stands alone, wasting no time with backstory as it launches into its typically rollicking tale. It\u2019s now 1870 and McNulty and John Cole live together on a starvecrow farm outside of Paris, Tennessee. It\u2019s a kind of utopian oasis in the fractious post-civil war days. The farm is run by the decent, tight-lipped Lige Mason. Alongside McNulty, Cole and Winona \u2013 an orphan who is just \u201cthe cinders of an Indian fire\u201d \u2013 there are two former slaves, Rosalee and Tennyson Bouguereau. Danger is everywhere \u2013 from the \u201cnightriders\u201d led by the malevolent Zach Petrie to the dregs of the civil war that still haunt Paris: \u201cThe town was still full of rough Union soldiers kicking their heels, and the defeated butternut boys were a sort of secret presence, though they were not in their uniforms. Vagabonds on every little byway. And state militia watchful for those vagabonds.\u201d</p> <p>The greatest threat to the life of the farm, though, is the racism that means that Winona, Cole (whose \u201cgrandmother or the woman before his grandmother was an Indian person\u201d) and the Bouguereaus are never truly safe: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a crime to kill an Indian because an Indian wasn\u2019t anything in particular.\u201d Early on, Winona is raped in an attack of terrible brutality; she\u2019s plied with \u201cdistillery whiskey\u201d and is unable to remember who carried out the assault \u2013 although all signs point to a local man, Jas Joski, who refers to Winona as his fiancee. Then Tennyson Bouguereau is also attacked, and the fragile peace of the farm is shattered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\">Sebastian Barry: \u2018Family stories mean a whole different thing in your 60s\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winona sets out on a quest for revenge, dressed \u201cin boy\u2019s britches\u201d with a gun and a knife in her belt. Soon she\u2019s joined by a fiery Chippewa orphan girl, Peg, who becomes her lover. Barry handled scenes of McNulty and Cole cross-dressing in <em>Days Without End</em> immaculately; here, again, we understand the power conferred on Winona by her change in identity, the way she is suddenly able to move freely where she had previously been constrained. Her adventures take her on a journey that is horrifying, thrilling and enchanting in equal measure, all of it rendered in Barry\u2019s uniquely lyrical prose, which seems at once effortless and dense with meaning.</p> <p>This novel, like its predecessor, provides a compelling answer to those who claim that authors should stick to their own when it comes to telling stories. The idea of a middle-class white male writing in the voice of a cross-dressing teenage lesbian Native American might feel out of step with its times, but prose this good is a kind of enchantment, transcending the constructs that are supposed to define us to speak in a voice that is truly universal.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Thousand Moons </em>by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "At a time when questions of identity are fraught and thorny, there\u2019s something daring in the set-up of Sebastian Barry\u2019s A Thousand Moons. Continuing the sweepingly ambitious cycle of stories that draw on a fictionalised version of his own family history, Barry now turns to a minor figure from his previous novel, the Costa prize-winning Days Without End. Winona is a member of the Lakota tribe \u2013 \u201cthe saddest people that ever were on the earth\u201d \u2013 rescued by Thomas McNulty (who narrated the last book) and his partner John Cole. That Barry knows he has strayed into tricksy territory is clear from the off. \u201cI am Winona,\u201d the novel begins, before immediately qualifying this seemingly simple statement of identity. It is Winona\u2019s fate to be adopted and re-presented by men, appropriation that points to the author\u2019s conflicted stance speaking with Winona\u2019s voice. \u201cIn early times I was Ojinjintka, which means rose. Thomas McNulty tried very hard to say this name, but he failed, and so he gave me my dead cousin\u2019s name because it was easier in his mouth. Winona means first-born. I was not first-born.\u201d A Thousand Moons skips forward a few years from Days Without End and although it\u2019s in effect a sequel, the novel stands alone, wasting no time with backstory as it launches into its typically rollicking tale. It\u2019s now 1870 and McNulty and John Cole live together on a starvecrow farm outside of Paris, Tennessee. It\u2019s a kind of utopian oasis in the fractious post-civil war days. The farm is run by the decent, tight-lipped Lige Mason. Alongside McNulty, Cole and Winona \u2013 an orphan who is just \u201cthe cinders of an Indian fire\u201d \u2013 there are two former slaves, Rosalee and Tennyson Bouguereau. Danger is everywhere \u2013 from the \u201cnightriders\u201d led by the malevolent Zach Petrie to the dregs of the civil war that still haunt Paris: \u201cThe town was still full of rough Union soldiers kicking their heels, and the defeated butternut boys were a sort of secret presence, though they were not in their uniforms. Vagabonds on every little byway. And state militia watchful for those vagabonds.\u201d The greatest threat to the life of the farm, though, is the racism that means that Winona, Cole (whose \u201cgrandmother or the woman before his grandmother was an Indian person\u201d) and the Bouguereaus are never truly safe: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a crime to kill an Indian because an Indian wasn\u2019t anything in particular.\u201d Early on, Winona is raped in an attack of terrible brutality; she\u2019s plied with \u201cdistillery whiskey\u201d and is unable to remember who carried out the assault \u2013 although all signs point to a local man, Jas Joski, who refers to Winona as his fiancee. Then Tennyson Bouguereau is also attacked, and the fragile peace of the farm is shattered. Winona sets out on a quest for revenge, dressed \u201cin boy\u2019s britches\u201d with a gun and a knife in her belt. Soon she\u2019s joined by a fiery Chippewa orphan girl, Peg, who becomes her lover. Barry handled scenes of McNulty and Cole cross-dressing in Days Without End immaculately; here, again, we understand the power conferred on Winona by her change in identity, the way she is suddenly able to move freely where she had previously been constrained. Her adventures take her on a journey that is horrifying, thrilling and enchanting in equal measure, all of it rendered in Barry\u2019s uniquely lyrical prose, which seems at once effortless and dense with meaning. This novel, like its predecessor, provides a compelling answer to those who claim that authors should stick to their own when it comes to telling stories. The idea of a middle-class white male writing in the voice of a cross-dressing teenage lesbian Native American might feel out of step with its times, but prose this good is a kind of enchantment, transcending the constructs that are supposed to define us to speak in a voice that is truly universal. \u2022 A Thousand Moons by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (\u00a318.99).

And you would never distinguish between the two in terms of generosity or creativity: there are mental health nurses offering Skype calls, people offering parking spaces and dog walking. And above all, and always, support for self-isolation: any shopping, any errands, anything at all, to maintain this state of confinement that only a fortnight ago would have felt impossible, and still feels so unnatural.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/facebook-powerful-crisis-coronavirus-communities-online\">Facebook is still far too powerful. It's also how millions are coping with this crisis | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-whatsapp\">WhatsApp group</a>, though, was organised by the local Labour party, and this is how it shows: it was organised by wards, which are much smaller than the entire borough \u2013 10,000 people rather than 300,000. The ward immediately split into subgroups of two or three streets, and the leafleting began.</p> <p>This is what you always remember from a Labour childhood, the endless leafleting, the crushing sense of futility at popping another 300 flyers telling people how seriously your candidate takes buses. In a time of crisis, it is transformed: you don\u2019t want to create an online community of people who all use the same social networks. You want to tell everybody. There is a huge amount of embedded knowledge about the process of activism, how to get round an estate where there\u2019s an entry code, what phrases to use in the leaflet, how big the font should be. All guardedness is jettisoned, with people freely giving out their numbers and addresses to strangers.</p> <p>There is a lot of regular, worldly expertise \u2013 a nurse, a shrink and a vet on one scabby road \u2013 who can scotch operational rumours that circulate quite freely on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/facebook-mask-ad-ban-coronavirus\">Facebook</a> (\u201cwear gloves\u201d, the round robins say; but gloves are the same as hands, in hygiene terms. And at least hands, you can wash). You could predict from miles away that there would be a lot of local knowledge, but it is still so surprising in its particulars \u2013 there\u2019s a nunnery in the road perpendicular to mine, which everyone has always known, because of the nuns. But it was the activists who knew that it was also a hospice, housing 176 terminally ill people, and it was that tiny local support group that started putting together a rota for checking what they need. Not every member knows every other in a Labour ward, but there\u2019s one person who everybody knows, and she (it\u2019s always a she) carries a lot of weight, maybe because she doesn\u2019t swing it. She can shoot down a misjudged idea with an emoji. In this group of very mild, sometimes online-only acquaintanceship, there is a huge amount of love.</p> <p>Hoaxes and hysteria are the condiments of any emergency: presumably there\u2019s malice in their creation, which is depressing, but I understand why people believe and spread them. We are in this insistently eerie state of constantly checking the news, only to find it hasn\u2019t changed, except to worsen. This puts us all in a passive, suspended state.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m in two groups that have sprung up spontaneously online, for neighbours to help each other out: one on Facebook, the other on WhatsApp. Neither is remotely political, in the sense that nobody is discussing the government or its deficiencies. And you would never distinguish between the two in terms of generosity or creativity: there are mental health nurses offering Skype calls, people offering parking spaces and dog walking. And above all, and always, support for self-isolation: any shopping, any errands, anything at all, to maintain this state of confinement that only a fortnight ago would have felt impossible, and still feels so unnatural. The WhatsApp group, though, was organised by the local Labour party, and this is how it shows: it was organised by wards, which are much smaller than the entire borough \u2013 10,000 people rather than 300,000. The ward immediately split into subgroups of two or three streets, and the leafleting began. This is what you always remember from a Labour childhood, the endless leafleting, the crushing sense of futility at popping another 300 flyers telling people how seriously your candidate takes buses. In a time of crisis, it is transformed: you don\u2019t want to create an online community of people who all use the same social networks. You want to tell everybody. There is a huge amount of embedded knowledge about the process of activism, how to get round an estate where there\u2019s an entry code, what phrases to use in the leaflet, how big the font should be. All guardedness is jettisoned, with people freely giving out their numbers and addresses to strangers. There is a lot of regular, worldly expertise \u2013 a nurse, a shrink and a vet on one scabby road \u2013 who can scotch operational rumours that circulate quite freely on Facebook (\u201cwear gloves\u201d, the round robins say; but gloves are the same as hands, in hygiene terms. And at least hands, you can wash). You could predict from miles away that there would be a lot of local knowledge, but it is still so surprising in its particulars \u2013 there\u2019s a nunnery in the road perpendicular to mine, which everyone has always known, because of the nuns. But it was the activists who knew that it was also a hospice, housing 176 terminally ill people, and it was that tiny local support group that started putting together a rota for checking what they need. Not every member knows every other in a Labour ward, but there\u2019s one person who everybody knows, and she (it\u2019s always a she) carries a lot of weight, maybe because she doesn\u2019t swing it. She can shoot down a misjudged idea with an emoji. In this group of very mild, sometimes online-only acquaintanceship, there is a huge amount of love. Hoaxes and hysteria are the condiments of any emergency: presumably there\u2019s malice in their creation, which is depressing, but I understand why people believe and spread them. We are in this insistently eerie state of constantly checking the news, only to find it hasn\u2019t changed, except to worsen. This puts us all in a passive, suspended state. If you can find movement in events, you can think yourself ahead of them. Hence this slew of rumours: the army\u2019s on the streets, the shops are running out of food, this guy knows a guy who works in RBS, and he says national quarantine by 5pm, my friend who\u2019s a nurse says don\u2019t drink anything with ice in it, and hold your breath while counting to 10.

But now, more than ever, is the time to establish a healthy social \u2013 and emotional \u2013 distance from your 401(k) retirement savings plans.</p> <p>Unless you have been hiding under a rock (not a bad plan) you will have seen that the Covid-19 pandemic has torn through the stock markets.</p> <p>In the last month, the S&amp;P 500 index has plunged more than 27% and triggered the biggest sell-off for US equities since the 1987 stock market crash, an event that many of today\u2019s younger investors weren\u2019t even alive to witness.</p> <p>Studying your shrinking 401(k) balance and panicking won\u2019t help. Instead, take a step back and distance your emotions from the market\u2019s gyrations with this generational guide to getting through this frightening period.</p> <h2><strong>Millennials: e</strong><strong>mbrace the c</strong><strong>haos!</strong></h2> <p>Welcome to the sale of the decade.</p> <p>You may never get the lowest prices, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a sale\u201d, says Leon LaBreque, chief growth manager at Sequoia Financial in Troy, Michigan. \u201cBy the time you retire, you will have seen 20% or greater declines several times, and several recessions and economic cycles. You\u2019ll remember all of them as ugly while you were in them and as buying opportunities in retrospect.\u201d</p> <p>Younger investors who were too early in their careers to begin investing at the lowest levels of the recently deceased bull market have an opportunity to pick up some bargains.</p> <p>The longer your time horizon and the sooner you start investing, the better you\u2019ll fare, even if all you can afford when you start off is a small amount. That\u2019s because in 401(k) plans, your profits are rolled over and reinvested, meaning that you begin earning <a href=\"https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/99698/how-does-compound-interest-work-with-stocks\">compounded gains</a>.</p> <p>For those with stable jobs who haven\u2019t yet opened a 401(k) account, this is a great year to do that. Odds are that you\u2019ll be buying many stocks near their lows.</p> <h2><strong>Gen X: j</strong><strong>ust hang in there \u2026</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s painful to watch your carefully accumulated savings decline. But remember, you won\u2019t realize any of those losses until you actually sell. And you don\u2019t want to sell, anyway. You still have another few decades to go until you\u2019re going to draw on this money to finance your retirement.</p> <p>\u201cFor those folks who have 30 to 40 years ahead of them, they just should not be worried about the market touching the bottom,\u201d says Jennifer Ellison, principal at Bingham, Osborn &amp; Scarborough, in Burlingame, California. \u201cIt\u2019s all about dollar cost averaging and rebalancing.\u201d</p> <p>Emphasize those strategies now. Dollar-cost averaging simply means that even if the market goes down, so will your average cost. And when it reverses course \u2013 three months, six months, a year or more from now \u2013 your gains will be all the greater. Rebalancing means making sure you\u2019re sticking to your plan, based on your long-term goals.</p> <p>A big reason to avoid selling is that you\u2019ll need to reinvest at some point. Stuffing your money into the bank won\u2019t earn you anything at all as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.</p> <p>History shows that, as a group, investors tend to be a really bad judge of when to reinvest after a market crash. And if you happen to be out of the market on its 10 best days between 1980 and 2019, according to a study by Fidelity Investments, you would have ended up with <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/six-tips\">about half the money</a> at the end of the period than you would have possessed by riding out the storms.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in your 40s, you already know what it\u2019s like to feel financially stretched. You still may be paying off your own student loans, as you try to save enough to cover your children\u2019s education.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean you should tap into your 401(k) to fill in any gaps, or shortchange yourself by not investing enough to earn that \u201cfree money\u201d from your employer kicks into the pot in the shape of a matching contribution. And yes, you\u2019ll probably need it.</p> <h2><strong>Baby b</strong><strong>oomers: k</strong><strong>eep i</strong><strong>t w</strong><strong>orking for y</strong><strong>ou</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019ve got fewer years to recover your losses.

      "bodyText": "I know it feels like time to PANIC! But now, more than ever, is the time to establish a healthy social \u2013 and emotional \u2013 distance from your 401(k) retirement savings plans. Unless you have been hiding under a rock (not a bad plan) you will have seen that the Covid-19 pandemic has torn through the stock markets. In the last month, the S&amp;P 500 index has plunged more than 27% and triggered the biggest sell-off for US equities since the 1987 stock market crash, an event that many of today\u2019s younger investors weren\u2019t even alive to witness. Studying your shrinking 401(k) balance and panicking won\u2019t help. Instead, take a step back and distance your emotions from the market\u2019s gyrations with this generational guide to getting through this frightening period. Millennials: embrace the chaos! Welcome to the sale of the decade. You may never get the lowest prices, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a sale\u201d, says Leon LaBreque, chief growth manager at Sequoia Financial in Troy, Michigan. \u201cBy the time you retire, you will have seen 20% or greater declines several times, and several recessions and economic cycles. You\u2019ll remember all of them as ugly while you were in them and as buying opportunities in retrospect.\u201d Younger investors who were too early in their careers to begin investing at the lowest levels of the recently deceased bull market have an opportunity to pick up some bargains. The longer your time horizon and the sooner you start investing, the better you\u2019ll fare, even if all you can afford when you start off is a small amount. That\u2019s because in 401(k) plans, your profits are rolled over and reinvested, meaning that you begin earning compounded gains. For those with stable jobs who haven\u2019t yet opened a 401(k) account, this is a great year to do that. Odds are that you\u2019ll be buying many stocks near their lows. Gen X: just hang in there \u2026 It\u2019s painful to watch your carefully accumulated savings decline. But remember, you won\u2019t realize any of those losses until you actually sell. And you don\u2019t want to sell, anyway. You still have another few decades to go until you\u2019re going to draw on this money to finance your retirement. \u201cFor those folks who have 30 to 40 years ahead of them, they just should not be worried about the market touching the bottom,\u201d says Jennifer Ellison, principal at Bingham, Osborn &amp; Scarborough, in Burlingame, California. \u201cIt\u2019s all about dollar cost averaging and rebalancing.\u201d Emphasize those strategies now. Dollar-cost averaging simply means that even if the market goes down, so will your average cost. And when it reverses course \u2013 three months, six months, a year or more from now \u2013 your gains will be all the greater. Rebalancing means making sure you\u2019re sticking to your plan, based on your long-term goals. A big reason to avoid selling is that you\u2019ll need to reinvest at some point. Stuffing your money into the bank won\u2019t earn you anything at all as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. History shows that, as a group, investors tend to be a really bad judge of when to reinvest after a market crash. And if you happen to be out of the market on its 10 best days between 1980 and 2019, according to a study by Fidelity Investments, you would have ended up with about half the money at the end of the period than you would have possessed by riding out the storms. If you\u2019re in your 40s, you already know what it\u2019s like to feel financially stretched. You still may be paying off your own student loans, as you try to save enough to cover your children\u2019s education. That doesn\u2019t mean you should tap into your 401(k) to fill in any gaps, or shortchange yourself by not investing enough to earn that \u201cfree money\u201d from your employer kicks into the pot in the shape of a matching contribution. And yes, you\u2019ll probably need it. Baby boomers: keep it working for you You\u2019ve got fewer years to recover your losses. That said, \u201cremember that your retirement date isn\u2019t your end date,\u201d says Ellison. \u201cYou can expect you\u2019ll still be drawing on those savings 20 years later.\u201d Translation? You still need to own stocks, since their long-term growth outpaces that of bonds or cash. The longer you can postpone dipping into your retirement savings, the greater the time they will have to recover from this sell-off, so you might consider living off your cash savings or even deferring retirement for a year or so, if you can. Retired: still, don\u2019t sell! Actuarial data suggest that if you\u2019re over 65, there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll live to see your 90th birthday. Which means you still need those stocks. Evaluate how you\u2019re doing against your objectives, and if you\u2019re well ahead of the game, think about putting some money into stocks or funds that might do best in the recovery. Still, once you reach your 70s, the rules say that you\u2019re required to take a minimal annual distribution (a required minimum distributions \u2013 RMD) calculated as a percentage of your account balance) over the course of the coming year.

When the noodles are cooked, drain well and immediately add to the egg mixture, mixing really well so they are coated in the sauce. Divide the noodles between two bowls, and sprinkle with shredded nori if you like. Serve immediately. From East by Meera Sodha (Penguin, \u00a320)",

Meanwhile, they\u2019re stuck in cities where they can\u2019t trust the authorities, and where their attorneys say they have, at best, limited access to healthcare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-us-immigration-detention-center\">First US immigration agency employees test positive for coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stuart is among the migrants who have been forced to wait in Mexico for months or even a year because of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown at the border. One policy, called \u201cmetering\u201d, makes migrants join a line in Mexico for their chance to <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/policies-affecting-asylum-seekers-border\">access the asylum process</a> in the United States.</p> <p>Another, the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/01/24/migrant-protection-protocols\">Migrant Protection Protocols</a> (MPP), strands people at the southern border before and between their US immigration court hearings.</p> <p>Through these changes to immigration norms, the Trump administration is sending migrants to a place that ranks first on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/news/2019/07/24/most-dangerous-cities-world-tijuana-caracas-cape-town/1813211001/\">most dangerous cities in the world</a>\u201d lists, or a state under a \u201c<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mexico-travel-advisory.html\">do not travel</a>\u201d advisory, instead of allowing them to at least temporarily come into the US.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/campaign/remain-mexico\">In late-February</a>, Human Rights First compiled more than a thousand publicly reported rapes, murders, kidnappings and other violent crimes against migrants returned to Mexico to await their court dates. Like in Stuart\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Publicly%20Reported%20MPP%20Attacks%20-%2028%20Feb%202020.pdf\">police were often the perpetrators</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who are sick in MPP, a lot of people who have kids or parents that have medical vulnerabilities already because they\u2019ve been in Mexico, and homeless, and living in tent camps or crowded shelters for a really long time,\u201d said Christina Brown, a Denver-based immigration attorney.</p> <p>Yet even as the coronavirus spread across the US, migrants still amassed in large groups, were transported next to one another in vans and filed into US immigration courts, their attorneys said.</p> <p>When Brown started experiencing the virus\u2019s symptoms last week and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6808342-Motion-to-Continue.html\">tried to postpone</a> her client\u2019s court date so she wouldn\u2019t potentially infect government workers and vulnerable migrants, it took multiple calls and an email from her or her paralegal just to get permission to file an emergency continuance over the web, instead of in-person.</p> <p>A judge eventually granted her motion, but Brown balked at the fact that it was a matter of discretion.</p> <p>In California, Robyn Barnard, a staff attorney with Human Rights First, asked her clients who came through the San Ysidro port of entry for their asylum hearing whether they were given additional screenings for health conditions or coronavirus symptoms. They told her they were asked by US officials for their names and if the women were pregnant or on their periods, but nothing more. The family packed into a court waiting room, where there weren\u2019t even enough chairs for everyone to sit.</p> <p>As immigration judges, government attorneys and immigration attorneys collectively sounded the alarm that continued operations at immigration courts could threaten public health, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which adjudicates immigration cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/us-immigration-courts-open-coronavirus-risks\">slowly reacted</a>.</p> <p>But even after EOIR closed some courts and postponed hearings for immigrants not in government custody, the MPP hearings continued.

      "bodyText": "Stuart isn\u2019t leaving his house in Tijuana right now unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Like countless others across the world, the Guatemalan asylum seeker is wary of contracting the coronavirus. But he\u2019s also worried about going outside after Mexican municipal police detained him illegally, then tortured and robbed him earlier this month, according to him and his attorney. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here, and I\u2019m afraid to be here,\u201d said Stuart, who asked to protect his identity by using a nickname. Migrants in Mexico are staring down yet another existential threat to their health and safety in the shape of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, they\u2019re stuck in cities where they can\u2019t trust the authorities, and where their attorneys say they have, at best, limited access to healthcare. Stuart is among the migrants who have been forced to wait in Mexico for months or even a year because of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown at the border. One policy, called \u201cmetering\u201d, makes migrants join a line in Mexico for their chance to access the asylum process in the United States. Another, the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), strands people at the southern border before and between their US immigration court hearings. Through these changes to immigration norms, the Trump administration is sending migrants to a place that ranks first on \u201cmost dangerous cities in the world\u201d lists, or a state under a \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory, instead of allowing them to at least temporarily come into the US. In late-February, Human Rights First compiled more than a thousand publicly reported rapes, murders, kidnappings and other violent crimes against migrants returned to Mexico to await their court dates. Like in Stuart\u2019s case, police were often the perpetrators. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are sick in MPP, a lot of people who have kids or parents that have medical vulnerabilities already because they\u2019ve been in Mexico, and homeless, and living in tent camps or crowded shelters for a really long time,\u201d said Christina Brown, a Denver-based immigration attorney. Yet even as the coronavirus spread across the US, migrants still amassed in large groups, were transported next to one another in vans and filed into US immigration courts, their attorneys said. When Brown started experiencing the virus\u2019s symptoms last week and tried to postpone her client\u2019s court date so she wouldn\u2019t potentially infect government workers and vulnerable migrants, it took multiple calls and an email from her or her paralegal just to get permission to file an emergency continuance over the web, instead of in-person. A judge eventually granted her motion, but Brown balked at the fact that it was a matter of discretion. In California, Robyn Barnard, a staff attorney with Human Rights First, asked her clients who came through the San Ysidro port of entry for their asylum hearing whether they were given additional screenings for health conditions or coronavirus symptoms. They told her they were asked by US officials for their names and if the women were pregnant or on their periods, but nothing more. The family packed into a court waiting room, where there weren\u2019t even enough chairs for everyone to sit. As immigration judges, government attorneys and immigration attorneys collectively sounded the alarm that continued operations at immigration courts could threaten public health, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which adjudicates immigration cases, slowly reacted. But even after EOIR closed some courts and postponed hearings for immigrants not in government custody, the MPP hearings continued. Meanwhile, Kim Hunter, a border rights fellow for Project Corazon who until recently worked in Matamoros, saw only a handful of people wearing masks. Not until Friday did MPP hearings cancel for the day, and confusion abounded as to when and how they would be rescheduled. Migrants who showed up at ports of entry were turned away, attorneys said; some were told to return the following day so they could be assigned a court date. The change in policy coincided with the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that it was closing the US-Mexico border to all non-essential travel. Hunter listed off clients who are currently in Mexico and fit the profiles of coronavirus\u2019s most at-risk victims \u2013 a girl with a life expectancy of 10, whose particular syndrome kills those affected when they breathe; a client with cardiomyopathy; a nearly 70-year-old living in a tent in one of the camps. But it\u2019s going to be difficult to get any of them into the US now, said Charlene D\u2019Cruz, one of Hunter\u2019s colleagues at Project Corazon. To even try, she thought she would have to somehow go to Mexico and risk the spread of disease. Even then, the likelihood her clients would actually be removed from MPP and allowed into the US was still low, in her view. Erika Pinheiro, litigation director at Al Otro Lado, warned she fears that mass deaths will follow once the virus reaches the crowded spaces where migrants in Mexico find refuge. Already, attorneys said they constantly hear everyone staying in shelters and camps walking around with a cough, a testament to how quickly respiratory issues spread in such close quarters. \u201cOnce it hits the camp, it will spread like wildfire,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>NHS hospitals are in urgent need of ventilators and are approaching full capacity because of the Covid-19 outbreak, which will increasingly force doctors to make tough decisions about which patients to treat, the British Medical Association has warned.</p> <p>The comments by the BMA spokesman Tom Dolphin come as senior staff at a London hospital told the Guardian they expect beds in its intensive care unit to be full by 30 March, with one source describing its A&amp;E unit as \u201clike a war zone\u201d.</p> <p>Dolphin, a consultant anaesthetist at a central London teaching hospital, said some hospitals in the capital, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">Northwick Park, which was forced to declare a \u201ccritical incident\u201d last week after running out of critical care beds</a>, are already struggling with the number of patients.</p> <p>\u201cLike any epidemic, there are hotspots. Some hospitals have had to transfer patients out to other intensive care units,\u201d he told PA Media, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the point where we are really running out of capacity and that transfer ability is going to be difficult to do anyway because nowhere else will have anywhere either.\u201d</p> <p>Dolphin said that as the number of Covid-19 patients escalated, doctors would be forced to make decisions over who would benefit the most from ventilation and intensive care.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find ourselves at the point where decisions are going to get harder and harder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have limited resource, and rather than being able to offer it to everybody who needs it, we are probably going to have to prioritise between the people who are going to benefit from it as well.\u201d</p> <p>NHS staff have expressed concern about a shortfall of ventilators and correct protective personal equipment (PPE), with photographs circulating of staff creating their own makeshift items, including with clinical waste bags. Dolphin said their concerns were real.</p> <p>He said his own hospital was \u201cstruggling\u201d with supplies of PPE. \u201cIt\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government says it\u2019s coming but it\u2019s not all out there. It\u2019s in very short supply.\u201d</p> <p>Dolphin said the government promise of more ventilators needed to happen immediately. \u201cThe surge is beginning, we are pretty much out of time for that capacity to come online,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Staff at the Royal London hospital in east London told the Guardian that the number of patients there is doubling every five days and will exhaust the current capacity in nine days\u2019 time.</p> <p>Managers at the hospital\u2019s trust are considering developing the hospital\u2019s 14th and 15th floors into intensive care wards, a spokesperson confirmed, and are being pushed by staff to hold talks with private developers.</p> <p>A source at the Royal London said: \u201cIt already feels like a war zone. You cannot go into A&amp;E because it is full of suspected Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>\u201cDoctors are having to take decisions about who to treat and who to abandon already. Operations are being cancelled, and we are nowhere near the height of the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The 14th and 15th floors, which look like \u201ca neat building site\u201d according to one source, were never completed because the trust wanted to save cash payments on the hospital\u2019s PFI (private finance initiative) deal.</p> <p>Barts health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, is training more staff to help use equipment in the intensive care unit and redeploying staff into critical care from other areas.</p> <p>Managers are looking at options to expand intensive care into theatres, recovery anaesthetic rooms and specialist wards.</p> <p>Dr Ian Renfrew, the hospital\u2019s lead interventional radiologist, has set up a WhatsApp group so that the London and Regional Properties billionaire Ian Livingstone and other developers can discuss possible sites to rapidly establish new units with the trust\u2019s chief executive, Alwen Williams. </p> <p>In a sign that the offer is being taken seriously, Williams has invited members of the group to meet the hospital\u2019s estates director to discuss space and specification.</p> <p>The Whittington hospital in north London has had to expand its 15-bed intensive treatment unit because of the leap in Covid-19 cases and now has space for 35 people.</p> <p>However, there are fears about how staff will cope with the extra patients. A nurse at the hospital, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cThe problem as well is nursing staff levels. We are expanding to 35 beds but then we will be short of staff.

      "bodyText": "NHS hospitals are in urgent need of ventilators and are approaching full capacity because of the Covid-19 outbreak, which will increasingly force doctors to make tough decisions about which patients to treat, the British Medical Association has warned. The comments by the BMA spokesman Tom Dolphin come as senior staff at a London hospital told the Guardian they expect beds in its intensive care unit to be full by 30 March, with one source describing its A&amp;E unit as \u201clike a war zone\u201d. Dolphin, a consultant anaesthetist at a central London teaching hospital, said some hospitals in the capital, such as Northwick Park, which was forced to declare a \u201ccritical incident\u201d last week after running out of critical care beds, are already struggling with the number of patients. \u201cLike any epidemic, there are hotspots. Some hospitals have had to transfer patients out to other intensive care units,\u201d he told PA Media, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the point where we are really running out of capacity and that transfer ability is going to be difficult to do anyway because nowhere else will have anywhere either.\u201d Dolphin said that as the number of Covid-19 patients escalated, doctors would be forced to make decisions over who would benefit the most from ventilation and intensive care. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find ourselves at the point where decisions are going to get harder and harder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have limited resource, and rather than being able to offer it to everybody who needs it, we are probably going to have to prioritise between the people who are going to benefit from it as well.\u201d NHS staff have expressed concern about a shortfall of ventilators and correct protective personal equipment (PPE), with photographs circulating of staff creating their own makeshift items, including with clinical waste bags. Dolphin said their concerns were real. He said his own hospital was \u201cstruggling\u201d with supplies of PPE. \u201cIt\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government says it\u2019s coming but it\u2019s not all out there. It\u2019s in very short supply.\u201d Dolphin said the government promise of more ventilators needed to happen immediately. \u201cThe surge is beginning, we are pretty much out of time for that capacity to come online,\u201d he said. Staff at the Royal London hospital in east London told the Guardian that the number of patients there is doubling every five days and will exhaust the current capacity in nine days\u2019 time. Managers at the hospital\u2019s trust are considering developing the hospital\u2019s 14th and 15th floors into intensive care wards, a spokesperson confirmed, and are being pushed by staff to hold talks with private developers. A source at the Royal London said: \u201cIt already feels like a war zone. You cannot go into A&amp;E because it is full of suspected Covid-19 patients. \u201cDoctors are having to take decisions about who to treat and who to abandon already. Operations are being cancelled, and we are nowhere near the height of the crisis.\u201d The 14th and 15th floors, which look like \u201ca neat building site\u201d according to one source, were never completed because the trust wanted to save cash payments on the hospital\u2019s PFI (private finance initiative) deal. Barts health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, is training more staff to help use equipment in the intensive care unit and redeploying staff into critical care from other areas. Managers are looking at options to expand intensive care into theatres, recovery anaesthetic rooms and specialist wards. Dr Ian Renfrew, the hospital\u2019s lead interventional radiologist, has set up a WhatsApp group so that the London and Regional Properties billionaire Ian Livingstone and other developers can discuss possible sites to rapidly establish new units with the trust\u2019s chief executive, Alwen Williams. In a sign that the offer is being taken seriously, Williams has invited members of the group to meet the hospital\u2019s estates director to discuss space and specification. The Whittington hospital in north London has had to expand its 15-bed intensive treatment unit because of the leap in Covid-19 cases and now has space for 35 people. However, there are fears about how staff will cope with the extra patients. A nurse at the hospital, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cThe problem as well is nursing staff levels. We are expanding to 35 beds but then we will be short of staff. Capacity being full means one nurse looks after three or four intubated patients in that scenario. At the moment the hospital is coping but I am not sure it will in the future when capacity grows.\u201d The housing minister, Robert Jenrick, told Sky News on Sunday that the government had received prototypes of new ventilators and should begin production soon. However, NHS staff have said there must be sufficient people trained to operate them too. Jason Leitch, NHS national clinical director of healthcare quality and strategy, insisted there was sufficient supply of PPE but admitted distribution had been an issue. He said staff had to be trained in how to fit the high-end masks, adding: \u201cI am confident that the beginning of that supply chain is robust and now the distribution will get better over the next few days.\u201d On Saturday it was announced that more beds, ventilators and 20,000 qualified extra staff would be made available from next week, thanks to a deal between NHS England and private hospitals. A spokesman for Barts health NHS trust said: \u201cWe are considering how best we can work in partnership to help our hospitals manage the continuing increase in Covid-19 cases.\u201d",

When it comes to maths puzzles, Winkler is the connoisseur\u2019s connoisseur. Team A and Team B are perennial football rivals. Every year they meet for a series of games. The first team to win four games gets to take home the Golden Teapot and keep it for a year. The teams are evenly matched except for a small home advantage. When playing at home, each team has a 51 per cent chance of winning. (And a 49 per cent chance of losing. No ties are allowed.) Every year, the first three games are played at the home of Team A, and the rest at the home of Team B. Which team is more likely to win the Golden Teapot? A math(s) professor at Dartmouth College in the US, Winkler currently occupies the chair for the public dissemination of mathematics at New York\u2019s Museum of Math. He\u2019s one of my all time puzzle heroes.

      "bodyText": "Q In September 2017 my wife and I bought a flat in joint names as our permanent home and paid stamp duty. We have now separated and as part of our separation agreement, I paid her a sum of \u00a3250,000 for her half share of the flat in order to get full title of the property. I paid \u00a32,500 in stamp duty so that means that stamp duty has been paid twice on this property. Is it possible to get this sum refunded? MH A It should be possible to get a refund of the second lot stamp duty land tax (SDLT) you have paid because you shouldn\u2019t have been charged it in the first place. In the words of HM Revenue &amp; Customs: \u201cIf you\u201d \u2013 or in your case, your ex-wife \u2013 \u201ctransfer an interest in land or property to your partner as part of an agreement or court order because you are either divorcing or dissolving a civil partnership, you don\u2019t pay SDLT.\u201d And \u201cin these cases there\u2019s no need to tell HMRC about the transfer even if the value is more than the SDLT threshold\u201d of \u00a3125,000. The same in not true for unmarried couples who split up with one buying the other out of his or her share of joint property. In this case if the cost of the bought-out share exceeds \u00a3125,000, SDLT is due on the amount over \u00a3125,000. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

So keep to a routine. It makes home schooling easier and helps children to realise this is not a holiday, and that teachers are expecting learning to take place to some degree.\u201d <em>Lillie Rosenblatt</em><em>, teacher at Brookfield primary school in Camden, London</em></p> <h2>Give your child some autonomy</h2> <p>\u201cLet your child create their own structure or timetable for the day, combining their ideas and home learning. If they try and schedule double PlayStation every morning, then it\u2019s probably time for parents to step in, but give them the option first. I think a lot of parents will be impressed with the outcome.\u201d <em>Joanna Conway</em><em>, headteacher, Whitegate End primary school and nursery, Oldham</em></p> <h2>Let your child get bored</h2> <p>\u201cIn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/17/children-dont-get-presents-schools-open-over-christmas\">communities like mine</a>, there are not a lot of PCs, laptops and other tech in the home that allow pupils to access learning platforms. My advice is let your kids have a holiday and enjoy themselves until they get bored. Then they will want to get on to learning they have been set.

Too much screen time has very negative effects on physical and mental health and it disrupts sleep patterns as well. Variety is key: exercise, reading a great book and learning a new skill are all suitable ways of avoiding the sheer monotony of a TV and computer screen.\u201d <em>Jules White</em></p> <h2>Emphasise literacy and numeracy...</h2> <p>\u201cContinue to practise essential English and maths. Review fundamental maths skills such as number bonds, times tables, division facts and addition/subtraction strategies.

But activities should not just be solely English and maths-based. Making learning fun is vital \u2013 so baking, painting and getting out and about in the garden are essential to reduce boredom.\u201d <em>Emily Proffitt</em><em>, headteacher, Tittensor first school, Stoke-on-Trent</em></p> <h2>Be attentive</h2> <p>\u201cListen to your child. Enjoy hearing your child explain what they are being asked to do, and the challenges they face.\u201d <em>Jules White</em></p> <h2>Consider the impact of social isolation and constant supervision</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s vital that children get downtime to be independent and relax. We are encouraging our pupils to write to each other, giving them a purpose but also helping them feel less isolated.\u201d <em>Emily Proffitt</em></p> <h2>Encourage reading every day</h2> <p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s reading to themselves, a parent, a sibling or even a special animal friend, it\u2019s essential children continue to read. Reading anything counts.\u201d <em>Jordan Bickel </em></p> <h2>Don\u2019t expect children to work non-stop</h2> <p>\u201cThe younger the child, the less time they can sit and learn for, so frequent breaks are important for productivity.\u201d <em>Lillie Rosenblatt</em></p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t overdo it</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d recommend around two hours\u2019 learning in total a day for children in key stage 1, which covers reception to year 2. That should include arts and crafts, and hands-on activities. Children in key stage 2, which covers year 3 through to year 6, would be able to do more: about three to four hours. But again, that should include PE activities and more creative tasks as well.\u201d <em>Jordan Bickel</em></p> <h2>Support child-led learning</h2> <p>\u201cEncourage your child to research something that is of interest to them and show their learning with a creative project. This could be making something with play-dough, junk modelling, papier-mache or a presentation. Let your children experiment.\u201d <em>Jordan Bickel</em></p> <h2>Endorse regular movement breaks</h2> <p>Movement breaks \u2013 such as dancing to music, performing animal walks or playing Simon Says \u2013 provide children with sensory feedback and offer them a chance to \u201creset\u201d. \u201cIf fast movement breaks aren\u2019t working, slow it down by doing wall or chair push-ups or squeezing hands, shoulders or legs. Find what works for your child. It will really help with learning and focus.\u201d <em>Lillie Rosenblatt</em></p> <h2>Make the most of any outdoor space</h2> <p>\u201cThere are so many benefits to outdoor learning: children develop an appreciation of the world around them, enhance their solving skills and increase their sensory skills, not forgetting the benefits for physical and mental health. Maybe you could learn about all the plants and trees near your house, or create your own outdoor circuit and do a daily workout together.

      "bodyText": "School may have closed for the foreseeable future, and all exams cancelled, but children still need to be educated and entertained \u2013 as well as reassured. Many schools plan to send work home and there are lots of free resources available via online platforms such as BBC Teach. But meanwhile, how do you even start home learning when this is all so new? We asked teachers for their emergency advice. Prioritise your child\u2019s wellbeing \u201cGreat learning only happens when children feel happy, safe and secure. Provide your children with reassurance and love.\u201d Jules White, headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham Keep to a routine \u201cChildren need normality, familiarity and structure. So keep to a routine. It makes home schooling easier and helps children to realise this is not a holiday, and that teachers are expecting learning to take place to some degree.\u201d Lillie Rosenblatt, teacher at Brookfield primary school in Camden, London Give your child some autonomy \u201cLet your child create their own structure or timetable for the day, combining their ideas and home learning. If they try and schedule double PlayStation every morning, then it\u2019s probably time for parents to step in, but give them the option first. I think a lot of parents will be impressed with the outcome.\u201d Joanna Conway, headteacher, Whitegate End primary school and nursery, Oldham Let your child get bored \u201cIn communities like mine, there are not a lot of PCs, laptops and other tech in the home that allow pupils to access learning platforms. My advice is let your kids have a holiday and enjoy themselves until they get bored. Then they will want to get on to learning they have been set. The homework is there not to improve standards but to ease boredom.\u201d Chris Dyson, headteacher, Parklands primary school, Leeds Limit tablets, phones and TV \u201cIt will be important for friends to stay in virtual contact with each other as long as interactions are friendly and supportive \u2013 but avoid an unhealthy overreliance on screen time in all of its guises. Too much screen time has very negative effects on physical and mental health and it disrupts sleep patterns as well. Variety is key: exercise, reading a great book and learning a new skill are all suitable ways of avoiding the sheer monotony of a TV and computer screen.\u201d Jules White Emphasise literacy and numeracy... \u201cContinue to practise essential English and maths. Review fundamental maths skills such as number bonds, times tables, division facts and addition/subtraction strategies. Encourage your child to write for pleasure about what they\u2019ve done that day, or make a comic.\u201d Jordan Bickel, Grand Avenue primary and nursery school, Surbiton ...but remember that learning should be fun \u201cChildren need to have a plan or timetable right from the start, and to stick to it using a timer. But activities should not just be solely English and maths-based. Making learning fun is vital \u2013 so baking, painting and getting out and about in the garden are essential to reduce boredom.\u201d Emily Proffitt, headteacher, Tittensor first school, Stoke-on-Trent Be attentive \u201cListen to your child. Enjoy hearing your child explain what they are being asked to do, and the challenges they face.\u201d Jules White Consider the impact of social isolation and constant supervision \u201cIt\u2019s vital that children get downtime to be independent and relax. We are encouraging our pupils to write to each other, giving them a purpose but also helping them feel less isolated.\u201d Emily Proffitt Encourage reading every day \u201cWhether it\u2019s reading to themselves, a parent, a sibling or even a special animal friend, it\u2019s essential children continue to read. Reading anything counts.\u201d Jordan Bickel Don\u2019t expect children to work non-stop \u201cThe younger the child, the less time they can sit and learn for, so frequent breaks are important for productivity.\u201d Lillie Rosenblatt Don\u2019t overdo it \u201cI\u2019d recommend around two hours\u2019 learning in total a day for children in key stage 1, which covers reception to year 2. That should include arts and crafts, and hands-on activities. Children in key stage 2, which covers year 3 through to year 6, would be able to do more: about three to four hours. But again, that should include PE activities and more creative tasks as well.\u201d Jordan Bickel Support child-led learning \u201cEncourage your child to research something that is of interest to them and show their learning with a creative project. This could be making something with play-dough, junk modelling, papier-mache or a presentation. Let your children experiment.\u201d Jordan Bickel Endorse regular movement breaks Movement breaks \u2013 such as dancing to music, performing animal walks or playing Simon Says \u2013 provide children with sensory feedback and offer them a chance to \u201creset\u201d. \u201cIf fast movement breaks aren\u2019t working, slow it down by doing wall or chair push-ups or squeezing hands, shoulders or legs. Find what works for your child. It will really help with learning and focus.\u201d Lillie Rosenblatt Make the most of any outdoor space \u201cThere are so many benefits to outdoor learning: children develop an appreciation of the world around them, enhance their solving skills and increase their sensory skills, not forgetting the benefits for physical and mental health. Maybe you could learn about all the plants and trees near your house, or create your own outdoor circuit and do a daily workout together. Doing something physical keeps our mind healthy too.\u201d Joanna Conway Praise children\u2019s efforts and behaviour, not their achievements \u201cPositive constructive praise that targets effort, behaviour and specific aspects of a child\u2019s work is much more powerful than just saying \u2018well done for completing your English\u2019. Lillie Rosenblatt Bond with your child \u201cEnjoy the extra time together. Create some artwork, a board game, make a meal together, do a jigsaw, write a song or put on a production, a dance or make a video. Maybe you could send it to relatives to cheer them up. I would also recommend sharing a \u2018family gratitude\u2019 each day.\u201d Joanna Conway Stick to your existing schedule \u201cTry to keep to your timetable as much as you can.

      "bodyText": "A zoo in Wales that made headlines in 2017 after a lynx escaped suffered the deaths of one in five of its animals in 2018, it has emerged. Borth Wild Animal Kingdom near Aberystwyth reopened last month in defiance of the council after closing temporarily in January following a \u201cdirective\u201d to shut its most dangerous animal enclosures since it does not have enough firearms-qualified staff in the event of an animal escaping. The zoo, which reopened all areas apart from the lion enclosure, is to appeal against the decision in court. Reports of animals dying in mysterious circumstances began to surface after an escaped lynx was shot dead by a marksman in late 2017 and another was killed accidentally by strangulation while being moved shortly after. A number of other deaths followed. Some of the reports originated when a volunteer animal handler, Mark Anthony, accused the zoo, which had recently been taken under new ownership by Tracy and Dean Tweedy, of neglect and keeping the animals in inadequate conditions.

Anthony is also accused by the Tweedys of selling a number of primates and a crocodile, which reportedly ended up in the pet trade.

That means the design of the new Surface Pro 7 hasn\u2019t changed since the 2017 Surface Pro 5, with Microsoft taking an \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke\u201d approach.

Microsoft\u2019s unique design language continues to stand out. Well-made computers with sharp-looking lines, lightly textured magnesium bodies with rounded corners and the company\u2019s unrivalled kickstand on the back. The 12.3in screen is still crisp and beautiful, but the large bezels around the sides now look a little dated compared to the Surface Pro X, traditional laptops and mobile tablets. All versions are available in Microsoft\u2019s platinum grey colour, while some are also available in black, which is definitely nicer.

The \u00a399 Surface Pen is the same, again making it one of the best styluses available \u2013 precise, with low-latency, tilt and plenty of pressure levels. It magnetically attaches to the left side of the Surface Pro 7, which is good, but not on the same level as clever the new Slim Pen tray in the keyboard for the Surface Pro X. Specifications Screen: 12.3in LCD 2736 x 1824 (267 PPI) Processor: Intel Core i3, i5 or i7 (10th generation) RAM: 4, 8 or 16GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Graphics: Intel UHD (i3) or Intel Iris Plus (i5/i7) Operating system: Windows 10 Home Camera: 8MP rear, 5MP front-facing, Windows Hello Connectivity: Wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, USB 3.0, USB-C, headphones, TPM, microSD Dimensions: 292 x 201 x 8.5 mm Weight: 775 or 790g (i7 version) Processing and battery life The Surface Pro 7 comes with either Intel\u2019s 10th-generation i3, i5 or i7 processors. While the i3 will be fine for light usage, most will want the Core i5 or i7 versions, which are considerably more capable. The version tested had a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and performed as you would expect from a high-end tablet PC or laptop. It handled general computing with no slowdown at all, even with 10 applications open with lots of tabs in Chrome and several large images open and being worked on in Affinity Photo, comparing favourably to Apple\u2019s 13in MacBook Pro and Dell\u2019s XPS 13.

With light computing they were not audible, but when connected to a 4K monitor or when running slightly more intensive applications they were noticeable in quiet rooms.

Battery life was slightly disappointing, with the Core i7 version lasting around seven hours between charges, which wasn\u2019t quite long enough to complete some work days without reaching for the charger. The Core i5 version should have longer battery life. Charging the Surface Pro 7 wasn\u2019t quite as quick as the Surface Pro X, but it will reach 80% from dead in about 60 minutes and fully charge in just under two hours using the included Surface Connect power adapter. Charging via a 45W USB-C charger happened at a similar rate, so you have two good options for charging the tablet. Unlike the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Pro 7 is difficult to fix and was only awarded a score of one out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit. None of the components, including the battery are user replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers. The company operates both trade-in and recycling schemes for old machines, however. Ports The big new change for the Surface Pro 7 is the introduction of USB-C, finally. The modern, industry-standard port is a jack of all trades and replaces the miniDisplay Port of older Surfaces devices. USB-C allows you to charge the Surface, connect any number of accessories including displays, drives, ethernet adapters and so on. You can also connect it to a USB-C dock for power, displays and accessories all from one cable. It is not Thunderbolt 3-compatible, but most will be fine with the standard bandwidth and functions of USB-C, it\u2019s just a shame there\u2019s only one of them. A standard USB-A port takes care of older accessories, while the Surface Connect takes the included power adapter but can also be used to connect to a Surface Dock and other Microsoft accessories. A microSD card slot is also very welcome, particularly for photographers. Observations The Surface Pro 7 ships with a standard version of Windows 10 Home with device encryption The tablet no longer supports on-screen interaction with Microsoft\u2019s Surface Dial accessory Price The Surface Pro 7 comes with various different specifications starting at \u00a3669 for a Core i3 with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Core i5 with 8GB of RAM costs \u00a3789 with 128GB of storage or \u00a31,035 with 256GB of storage, the Core i5 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs \u00a31,259. The Core i7 versions all have 16GB of RAM and cost \u00a31,299 with 256GB (as tested), \u00a31,649 with 512GB and \u00a32,024 with 1TB of storage. All versions are available in platinum with some available in black. Verdict The Surface Pro 7 is arguably the best windows tablet money can buy, it\u2019s just not that big a leap over the Surface Pro 6. The form, design, microSD card slot, kickstand, Windows Hello and simply the way it works are still winners in 2020. The screen is still great, however the bezels around it are functional but look a little dated compared to the Surface Pro X. The big new thing is the addition of a USB-C port, which is well overdue. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s not a full Thunderbolt 3 port, but I suspect most won\u2019t care. The battery life on the Core i7 version is not class-leading, so buy the Core i5 version if you want more like a day\u2019s work without the charger. The biggest downside is that the essential keyboard is not included with the tablet, which pushes the price up by at least \u00a3125.

This would contravene the policy Funai has had since 1987 of no contact with isolated groups, introduced after tribes were decimated by disease when contact was forced on them.</p> <p>New Tribes pilot Jeremiah Diedrich <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjRjSkY13To&amp;feature=emb_logo\">said in a video</a> that the region where the Javari Valley is located had the highest concentration of uncontacted people groups anywhere in the world. \u201cIt is the darkest, densest, hardest to reach place in all South America,\u201d Diedrich said. \u201cThis is why we need a helicopter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe mission leadership is going to be able to assign new teams to reach new people groups in this area,\u201d fellow missionary Julie Diedrich said in the film.

In court <a href=\"http://www.mpf.mp.br/df/sala-de-imprensa/docs/acp-coordenador-funai-1\">documents</a>, they quoted a recording of Edward Mantoanelli Luz \u2013 a conservative anthropologist, Bolsonaro supporter and son of the New Tribes director, who is not part of the group. In it, he claimed some of the credit for the Dias appointment and vowed the \u201cno contact\u201d policy would end.

We need to renew and update this policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Funai and health professionals could initiate the process of contacting isolated groups, he said. \u201cThe evangelical message can come at another moment,\u201d he added, voicing support for Bolsonaro\u2019s policy to allow commercial farming and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/like-a-bomb-going-off-why-brazils-largest-reserve-is-facing-destruction-aoe\">mining</a> on indigenous reserves, activities currently prohibited.</p> <p>Last week, Funai <a href=\"https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,funai-atropela-regimento-e-libera-acesso-a-indios-isolados-por-causa-de-coronavirus,70003238006\">changed</a> its rules to allow contact with isolated groups if Covid-19 made it essential to their survival, and suspended entry to indigenous reserves. Mantoanelli Luz welcomed the move. On Monday, following an outcry, the government effectively changed the rules back again.</p> <p>Funai said it has no requests from New Tribes to enter the Javari Valley. Dias declined an interview and did not answer a question on whether the \u201cno contact\u201d policy would be changed.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the current indigenous policy, the self-determination of isolated peoples is a guaranteed and respected right,\u201d he said in an email.</p> <p>The prosecutors challenging his appointment described an international movement of missionary groups to convert indigenous tribes, including a coalition called <a href=\"https://www.finishingthetask.com/\">Finishing the Task</a>. In a video on the Ethnos360 site called A Vision for Finishing, its CEO in the US, Larry Brown, <a href=\"https://ethnos360.org/about\">said</a>: \u201cWe can see every tribe reached.

      "bodyText": "A radical group of evangelical Christian missionaries set on converting every last tribe on Earth has raised fears that deadly diseases \u2013 and even the coronavirus \u2013 will spread in the Brazilian Amazon. The group has based its newly bought helicopter right beside a reserve with the world\u2019s highest concentration of isolated indigenous groups, who have little resistance to common illnesses. There are more than 100 isolated indigenous groups in Brazil, all highly vulnerable to common diseases such as measles and flu, and 16 of them live in the same reserve in the Javari Valley, a vast, remote area the size of Austria. Covid-19 could wipe out any of them. Videos posted in 2018 by the US-based missionary organisation Ethnos360 \u2013 formerly called New Tribes Mission \u2013 aimed to raise money to buy the helicopter, saying it would be used to reach \u201cnew people groups\u201d. The Brazilian government official now in charge of isolated and recently contacted tribes at the government\u2019s indigenous agency, Funai, is a former New Tribes missionary. The official, anthropologist Ricardo Lopes Dias, worked for 10 years for New Tribes beside the Javari Valley. New Tribes said its helicopter was now based in Cruzeiro do Sul, 55km south of the reserve. \u201cHistory shows us that any contagious disease can be catastrophic for these people,\u201d said Douglas Rodrigues, a professor of medicine at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo with extensive experience of isolated indigenous groups. Doctors also highlighted the danger of Covid-19 for isolated tribes. According to the site Amaz\u00f4nia Real, one adult Marubo indigenous man and his two daughters are suspected of having the virus. All three are reported to be in isolation in Atalaia do Norte, a town on the Amazon\u2019s northern edge. Samples for testing need to be sent to Manaus, over 1,000km away. \u201cThis virus is a potential killer that could easily wipe out the whole community,\u201d said Adam Mol, a Polish doctor who worked with remote tribes in the Javari Valley. Mol cited the case of American missionary John Chau, killed by a tribe of hunter-gatherers last year after he landed on North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean to illustrate the risks New Tribes present to the region. \u201cHe literally accepted killing some of them with the excuse of bringing them God\u2019s word. That\u2019s literally how these people think,\u201d Mol said. Evangelical Christians have extended their influence in Brazil under the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who increasingly relies on their support and has a history of racist remarks about indigenous people, calling those living on protected reserves \u201cprehistoric\u201d. \u201cThe route is being prepared,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cThey are ready to invade these territories and do these contacts. New Tribes\u2019 mission is clear.\u201d The indigenous association of the Javari Valley, Univaja, demanded the authorities take action to \u201cavoid the worst\u201d. New Tribes has had a controversial history for decades in Brazil. \u201cThey are fundamentalist believers,\u201d said Daniel Everett, an American linguist and former missionary in the Brazilian Amazon who knows the group well. \u201cTheir views are extremely 19th century.\u201d In 1991, New Tribes missionaries were expelled by Funai from a remote region where they had contacted an isolated indigenous group of Zo\u2019\u00e9 indigenous people. In 2014, Warren Scott Kennell was given a 58-year sentence for producing child pornography while working as a missionary for New Tribes in Brazil and admitted sexually abusing children. In 2018, Manoel de Oliveira was handed a three-year prison sentence and fined for keeping Zo\u2019\u00e9 indigenous people in slave-like conditions on his cashew nut plantation. Prosecutors said he had worked with New Tribes in the region. He is currently appealing. Brazil\u2019s \u00c9poca magazine reported that Ethnos360 had appealed for donations to buy a helicopter to evangelise isolated indigenous groups in western Brazil, near the Peruvian border. This would contravene the policy Funai has had since 1987 of no contact with isolated groups, introduced after tribes were decimated by disease when contact was forced on them. New Tribes pilot Jeremiah Diedrich said in a video that the region where the Javari Valley is located had the highest concentration of uncontacted people groups anywhere in the world. \u201cIt is the darkest, densest, hardest to reach place in all South America,\u201d Diedrich said. \u201cThis is why we need a helicopter.\u201d \u201cThe mission leadership is going to be able to assign new teams to reach new people groups in this area,\u201d fellow missionary Julie Diedrich said in the film. In a video shot in front of the Robinson R66 helicopter that was shared on Facebook, New Tribes\u2019 Brasil director, pastor Edward Gomes da Luz, thanked God for its arrival. In February, federal prosecutors sought to suspend Dias\u2019s Funai appointment. In court documents, they quoted a recording of Edward Mantoanelli Luz \u2013 a conservative anthropologist, Bolsonaro supporter and son of the New Tribes director, who is not part of the group. In it, he claimed some of the credit for the Dias appointment and vowed the \u201cno contact\u201d policy would end. A judge rejected the prosecutors\u2019 move. Edward Mantoanelli Luz told the Guardian that his father was a \u201cgreat professional\u201d and that Brazil\u2019s policy of no contact had been \u201cmanipulated\u201d by other countries. \u201cWe have now a new president, a president who looks at Brazil before looking abroad. We need to renew and update this policy,\u201d he said. Funai and health professionals could initiate the process of contacting isolated groups, he said. \u201cThe evangelical message can come at another moment,\u201d he added, voicing support for Bolsonaro\u2019s policy to allow commercial farming and mining on indigenous reserves, activities currently prohibited. Last week, Funai changed its rules to allow contact with isolated groups if Covid-19 made it essential to their survival, and suspended entry to indigenous reserves. Mantoanelli Luz welcomed the move. On Monday, following an outcry, the government effectively changed the rules back again. Funai said it has no requests from New Tribes to enter the Javari Valley. Dias declined an interview and did not answer a question on whether the \u201cno contact\u201d policy would be changed. \u201cAccording to the current indigenous policy, the self-determination of isolated peoples is a guaranteed and respected right,\u201d he said in an email. The prosecutors challenging his appointment described an international movement of missionary groups to convert indigenous tribes, including a coalition called Finishing the Task. In a video on the Ethnos360 site called A Vision for Finishing, its CEO in the US, Larry Brown, said: \u201cWe can see every tribe reached. It is doable.\u201d The Finishing the Task website lists the Korubo tribe in the Javari Valley as one of its \u201cprioritised unengaged unreached people groups\u201d. Guardian reporters visited their villages in 2018. Three small groups of Korubo were contacted by Funai in recent years in exceptional circumstances, following health and security scares. One remains in isolation. Doctor Lucas Albertoni worked on all three contacts. \u201cA common cold could evolve into pneumonia and sepsis in a matter of days without medical assistance,\u201d he said, noting that even contacted Korubo remain vulnerable because immunity takes time to build up. \u201cThey are a high-risk group for coronavirus,\u201d he said. New Tribes Mission already has one church in the Javari Valley. Its helicopter will \u201csupport mission work in the region\u201d, the group said in a statement. \u201cNew Tribes Mission Brazil does not work with isolated people, without contact,\u201d it said. But in 1991, New Tribes missionaries led by Edward Gomes da Luz were expelled by Funai from the eastern Amazon region inhabited by the Zo\u2019\u00e9 tribe. Funai blamed them for dozens of deaths by disease. Douglas Rodrigues arrived in the region with a Funai team six months after the missionaries had set up their base. The Zo\u2019\u00e9 tribe were suffering from malaria, which they said they had never seen before the missionaries arrived, and flu. Tests showed none had been vaccinated against anything, Rodrigues said. \u201cIt is inadmissible that you enter into contact with a group like this \u2026 and don\u2019t vaccinate them,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout experience in doing contact, the missionaries caused great mortality in these people,\u201d Funai employee Fiorello Parise \u2013 who also went there \u2013 told anthropologist Felipe Milanez, in his book Memories of Indigenous Specialists (Mem\u00f3rias Sertanistas). Luz told BBC Brasil he was the first non-indigenous person to contact the tribe, in 1982. He declined the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview and his group said investigations had proved \u201cthe absence of illicit acts\u201d and called the accusations \u201cunfounded and untrue\u201d. Rodrigues said Covid-19 is a reminder of how dangerous a new virus can be to anyone lacking immunity. In this sense, he said: \u201cWe are all wild indigenous people now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The record temperatures of summer 2019 helped make it the best season for butterflies in 22 years, with more than half of Britain\u2019s species increasing in number. Last summer delivered a winning combination of warmth, sunshine and rain which ensured that caterpillars fed up on lush plants before emerging as adult butterflies. The marbled white enjoyed its best year since scientific monitoring began in 1976, continuing its climate-assisted march northwards, and the dark green fritillary enjoyed its third best year on record, its numbers up 51% on the previous year. The drought of 2018 led to fears of a crash in butterfly populations, particularly among species whose caterpillars feed on grasses that shrivelled up that summer. Unexpectedly, however, the annual UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme revealed that plenty of grass-feeding species thrived in 2019 including the ringlet, enjoying its second-best year on record, the meadow brown, which had its fifth-best year, and the rare Lulworth skipper, numbers of which increased by 138% on the previous year. The monitoring of 3,014 sites by volunteers supported by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, showed that summer 2019 was also a notable year for the painted lady. The migratory butterfly flew in from Africa via continental Europe in greater numbers than in any summer apart from 2009 and 1996. Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation said the encouraging results \u201cprovide evidence that the overall rate of decline of butterflies is slowing and for some species being reversed\u201d. He said conservation through agri-environment schemes, increased woodland cover, climate warming and \u201cincreases in grazing levels by wild animals and a slowing in the rate of agricultural intensification\u201d had all played their part. Dr Marc Botham of the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology said two warm summers in succession, which allowed population numbers to build up over a longer period, had also contributed to the boom year. \u201cIn addition to record numbers of spring species such as orange-tip and brimstone, it was also encouraging to see annual increases in garden favourites such as peacock and small tortoiseshell, both of which have had some poor years recently,\u201d he said. Some species, however, are struggling to adapt to rapid climatic changes. The rare heath fritillary saw its annual abundance drop by 34%. Its numbers have fallen by 91% over the long term as a result of climate change and a loss of traditional coppicing in woodlands and grazing on moorland. The figures show that targeted conservation work is helping many rarer species, including the chequered skipper, up by 175% on 2018, and the Duke of Burgundy, which a decade ago was threatened with extinction but recorded its eighth best year since 1976. Other species benefiting from habitat management include the marsh fritillary, silver-studded blue and silver-spotted skipper, none of which are now in long-term population decline. \u201cWe\u2019re really heartened to see a shift in the fortunes of many of our most loved species,\u201d Brereton said. \u201cThe long-term situation for butterflies in general does remain a cause of concern though, with more species declining than increasing since the 1970s.\u201d",

They have done it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\">Iran</a>, so why not here?</p> <p>The UK government has already announced that it intends to ease pressure on prisons by increasing the number of prisoners released on home detention curfew with a tag.</p> <p>But the PAS is calling for those inmates who are old or infirm; or have long passed their tariffs \u2013 if they are serving a wretched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/10/ipp-sentencing-regime-in-england-and-wales-branded-deeply-harmful\">imprisonment for public protection</a> (IPP) sentence; or simply do not pose a threat, to be released immediately.

We have already had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">the first case of Covid-19 in a prisoner at Strangeways in Manchester</a>. Make no mistake, this virus will take hold. Nowhere more so than in our antiquated local jails, such as Strangeways, where two or more prisoners are crammed into cells Victorian prison planners designed for one. Please tell us, justice minister, how such inmates can self-isolate?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Local jails may become charnel houses if nothing is done to release those who represent at worst a nuisance to society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only last month a <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/improving-the-prison-estate/\">report from the National Audit Office </a>on the physical state of prisons revealed a shocking state of disrepair, from leaking roofs and failing heating systems to broken cell windows and rat infestations. So, how can they possibly provide the hygienic conditions needed \u2013 particularly for frail, elderly prisoners \u2013 to fight this virus. Last year inspectors found that 10 out of 35 men\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">prisons weren\u2019t meeting minimum standards</a> of cleanliness and infection control compliance.</p> <p>When serving time, I experienced a few hairy moments, occasions when I felt my actions would lead to my physical harm. But my biggest fear, always, was suffering a serious illness. Of all the myths peddled by the MoJ, the line that prisoners receive healthcare comparable with that they would receive in the community is the hardest one to swallow.</p> <p>Writing about the state of the prison system in England and Wales, my inbox is full of horror stories of medical neglect in the penal estate. They include prisoners who have died in hospital, more often than not in chains, after prison medical staff had ignored signs of serious illness until it was too late. The one I recount here did not end in death, but the scale of the neglect still shocks me.</p> <p>A prisoner in a Midlands jail complained of severe pains in his leg. He was given paracetamol. Then his leg began to turn black and started to smell. The man did not have great mental capacity and simply accepted his pain. He was discharged from a relatively small sentence and his son immediately took him to their GP, who referred him immediately to a specialist. It was, of course, gangrene and there was nothing to be done but amputate. I put them in touch with a lawyer and the man eventually received compensation. But no treatment, on a leg that had turned black and smelly?</p> <p>Ironically for the hang \u2019em and flog \u2019em brigade, the least dangerous prisons in terms of coronavirus will be the high security ones, which house those who have committed the most serious crimes. They are not overcrowded and all inmates have single cells. The local jails may well transform into charnel houses if nothing is done to release those who represent at worst a nuisance, rather than a danger to society.</p> <p>On Saturday night I spoke to a pal from the old days, who is now retired from the game but keeps abreast of prison matters.

      "bodyText": "The Prisoners\u2019 Advice Service (PAS), a charity of which I am a trustee, asked the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) last week to release groups of prisoners in order to lessen the impact of coronavirus in the penal estate. They have done it in Iran, so why not here? The UK government has already announced that it intends to ease pressure on prisons by increasing the number of prisoners released on home detention curfew with a tag. But the PAS is calling for those inmates who are old or infirm; or have long passed their tariffs \u2013 if they are serving a wretched imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence; or simply do not pose a threat, to be released immediately. These include the more than 1,700 prisoners, mostly men, aged 70 and over \u2013 some of whom are 80 or older, with a growing number in their 90s. Releasing these prisoners, who are now completely harmless, will undoubtedly save lives, not just of prisoners but also of prison officers and other staff, especially in jails where there are wings full of elderly inmates. We have already had the first case of Covid-19 in a prisoner at Strangeways in Manchester. Make no mistake, this virus will take hold. Nowhere more so than in our antiquated local jails, such as Strangeways, where two or more prisoners are crammed into cells Victorian prison planners designed for one. Please tell us, justice minister, how such inmates can self-isolate? Only last month a report from the National Audit Office on the physical state of prisons revealed a shocking state of disrepair, from leaking roofs and failing heating systems to broken cell windows and rat infestations. So, how can they possibly provide the hygienic conditions needed \u2013 particularly for frail, elderly prisoners \u2013 to fight this virus. Last year inspectors found that 10 out of 35 men\u2019s prisons weren\u2019t meeting minimum standards of cleanliness and infection control compliance. When serving time, I experienced a few hairy moments, occasions when I felt my actions would lead to my physical harm. But my biggest fear, always, was suffering a serious illness. Of all the myths peddled by the MoJ, the line that prisoners receive healthcare comparable with that they would receive in the community is the hardest one to swallow. Writing about the state of the prison system in England and Wales, my inbox is full of horror stories of medical neglect in the penal estate. They include prisoners who have died in hospital, more often than not in chains, after prison medical staff had ignored signs of serious illness until it was too late. The one I recount here did not end in death, but the scale of the neglect still shocks me. A prisoner in a Midlands jail complained of severe pains in his leg. He was given paracetamol. Then his leg began to turn black and started to smell. The man did not have great mental capacity and simply accepted his pain. He was discharged from a relatively small sentence and his son immediately took him to their GP, who referred him immediately to a specialist. It was, of course, gangrene and there was nothing to be done but amputate. I put them in touch with a lawyer and the man eventually received compensation. But no treatment, on a leg that had turned black and smelly? Ironically for the hang \u2019em and flog \u2019em brigade, the least dangerous prisons in terms of coronavirus will be the high security ones, which house those who have committed the most serious crimes. They are not overcrowded and all inmates have single cells. The local jails may well transform into charnel houses if nothing is done to release those who represent at worst a nuisance, rather than a danger to society. On Saturday night I spoke to a pal from the old days, who is now retired from the game but keeps abreast of prison matters. He\u2019s a Londoner and we discussed the impact this virus may have on the local jails he and I know well: Pentonville, Wandsworth and Wormwood Scrubs. We discussed our chances of survival if we were back inside any of them. Would we get the medical care our ages (we are now in our 70s) and our underlying medical conditions (I was a heavy smoker) required? \u201cMore likely to be struck by lightning,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Pentonville, we\u2019d be lucky to get a mattress to sleep on.\u201d As many as 60% of prisoners could become infected with coronavirus, according to Prof Richard Coker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has looked at the potential spread of the virus in locked establishments. Those who say criminals deserve what they get should bear in mind that, in life, as in prisons, there is a pecking order. The poor and disadvantaged, who have committed no crimes, will be the next in the line of fire of this disease. \u2022 Eric Allison is the Guardian\u2019s prisons correspondent.

One of the largest employers, Crown Resorts, which employs an estimated 18,500 workers and contractors, made a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon. The hotels attached to Crown\u2019s casinos in Melbourne and Perth will remain open, but all gaming and restaurants will shut under the government\u2019s orders to limit the spread of Covid-19. The company and thousands of others were investigating whether to stand people down \u2013 allowing them to use their holiday and long service leave but remain employed \u2013 or lay them off, which could trigger Centrelink payments. But the impacts will reverberate well beyond Crown employees. Crown estimates it has 4,000 small businesses that depend on it, either as suppliers of products and food for the casino or those who provide food outlets in its food courts. The Star, the other major casino operator, was yet to comment. The Australian Hotels\u2019 Association issued a statement saying the shutdown was \u201cunprecedented in our peacetime history\u201d and warning it would have \u201ca devastating effect\u201d on the 250,000 people it directly employs. \u201cWe saw what an important role hotels play in their communities during the recent bushfires across large parts of the nation \u2013 today\u2019s closure is an unprecedented move which will have a big social impact for months to come,\u201d the AHA national CEO, Stephen Ferguson, said.

      "bodyText": "Top story: UK hospitals braced for surge of Covid-19 patients Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer with the latest news on the coronavirus and all the other stories you need to know about. This year\u2019s Olympic Games in Tokyo have been thrown into serious doubt after Canada became the first country to say that it would not be sending a team because of concerns about the coronavirus. Australia\u2019s Olympic organisers added to the questions about sport\u2019s biggest event when they told their athletes to prepare for a delayed Games, while New Zealand said it would consider a boycott. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe acknowledged that a postponement of the Games could be \u201cunavoidable\u201d. The International Olympic Committee has given itself a four-week deadline to consider its options. Britain\u2019s hospitals are reaching crisis point as they struggle to cope with the Covid-19 outbreak and are in urgent need of more ventilators as the long-predicted \u201csurge\u201d in patients begins, the British Medical Association has warned. Some hospitals were running out of capacity, a BMA spokesman said, while staff at one London hospital said the number of patients was doubling every five days and would exhaust capacity by 30 March. One source described its A&amp;E unit as \u201clike a war zone\u201d. The government had to deliver on its promise of more ventilators, the BMA said, while there was also a shortage of protective personal equipment for staff. Boris Johnson says the government might have to consider an Italy-style lockdown if people do not start obeying social distancing guidelines in the next 24 hours. Some councils have already closed parks after anger at large gatherings over the weekend. McDonald\u2019s is closing its restaurants, as is Nando\u2019s. In a warning to the UK and other countries, our Rome correspondent writes that Italy\u2019s failure to convince its population to take the threat seriously has taken a terrible human toll. Follow all the latest updates here. * * * Migrants at risk \u2013 A million undocumented migrants living in the UK could fall victim to the coronavirus and also risk starvation as pressure grows on food supplies, charities have warned. The migrants are not entitled to welfare payments and often rely on food banks and charitable handouts to feed themselves. But many soup kitchen-style operations have closed because of the pandemic and charities and NGOs are calling on the government to provide food for homeless and destitute migrants. * * * Girl, 7, stabbed \u2013 A woman has been arrested after a \u201ctotally unprovoked and random\u201d stabbing left a seven-year-old girl dead in a park in Bolton. Police said the girl was stabbed in Queen\u2019s Park on Sunday afternoon and died despite the effort of her family and first responders. A member of the public detained the suspect, who did not know the child, and she was arrested later. Russ Jackson, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \u201cWords cannot describe how awful this attack is. The family were out in the park, enjoying the spring sun when \u2026 this little girl sustained horrendous injuries and sadly died.\u201d * * * Cleaned out \u2013 Europe\u2019s clean energy storage boom stalled last year, according to a study showing that the market grew by 1 gigawatts per hour compared with growth of 1.47GWh in 2018. The slowdown was most marked in large-scale battery projects connected to grids but household battery installation continued to show strong expansion. Coronavirus extra New York is the frontline in the battle against the virus in the United States. It has 15,000 cases \u2013 5% of the global total \u2013 and 117 deaths. More states, including Ohio, have locked down citizens, which means a third of the US population have been told to stay at home. Donald Trump says states are getting the help they need but New York governor Andrew Cuomo has been praised for his \u201cwisdom\u201d as the president blusters. Also in New York state, Harvey Weinstein has reportedly tested positive for the virus, according to prison officials. Although some residents in Wuhan have been allowed to leave their homes, lockdowns continued to intensify around the world. New Zealand is going into a four-week isolation, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced, as she sought to avoid the \u201cgreatest loss of life\u201d in the country\u2019s history. More schools closed in Australia after Victoria\u2019s premier brought forward the Easter holidays by a week. Pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas are now closed nationwide. Papua New Guinea has declared a state of emergency and Indonesia is battling to contain a fast-spreading outbreak.

Despite loyally serving in Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet and playing a leading role in drawing up the party\u2019s recent manifesto, she tells Anushka Asthana she is determined not to be portrayed as the continuity Corbyn candidate. Lunchtime read: Dionne Warwick on the hell of segregation The ageless soul singer Dionne Warwick, who at 79 is planning another UK tour later this year, talks about her gospel-filled upbringing in New Jersey, working with Burt Bacharach and Hal David, living in Brazil, and why she thinks racial segregation still blights the US and UK. Sport Formula One has successfully run its first virtual GP with the Bahrain Grand Prix won by Renault\u2019s Chinese test driver Guanyu Zhou.

Super Consumers Australia, a division of consumer advocacy group Choice, says drawing down the maximum $20,000 over two years, allowed under new rules introduced by the Morrison government on Sunday, will cost about $50,000 in retirement income, or about a year\u2019s worth. The super fund that covers the virus-battered hospitality and entertainment sectors, where workers are being laid off in droves due to the crisis, estimates losses could be even higher. Industry fund Hostplus says that $20,000 withdrawn by a 25-year-old would have swelled to $132,000 by age 67. Under the new rules, workers whose income is reduced by at least 20% due to the Covid-19 outbreak are allowed to take $10,000 out of their super between mid-April and June 30 and another $10,000 in the three months after that date. In addition to raising concerns that hard-up members will drain their super at the expense of their retirement income, the proposal has also sparked worries that super funds will be forced to sell assets to fund the drawdowns. Labor opposed the proposal, but has committed to support the survival package of which it is a part. \u201cSelling your super at the bottom of the market will risk squandering people\u2019s hard-earned retirement savings,\u201d the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, told parliament on Monday. \u201cIt is also the case if the superannuation industry is forced to sell assets at the bottom of the market. That also is not sensible economics.\u201d Industry Super Australia, which represents the union-and-employer-controlled industry super sector, said it was not consulted on the move. \u201cThis is an issue that must be handled very carefully in order to prevent the compounding of liquidity pressures that may be faced by superannuation funds in the current market conditions, and as they support anxious members,\u201d the chief executive, Bernie Dean, said. Super Consumer Australia director Xavier O\u2019Halloran said $30,000 was \u201cabout what the average couple would live on in retirement\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d really weigh the options and look at it as a last resort,\u201d he said. He said some people might need to take the money in order to avoid becoming homeless or to feed their families, and could still rely on the pension when retired. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be kicked out of the house because you can\u2019t pay rent or you can\u2019t buy food for your family, these things can lead to things that are far worse than losing a few years of income in retirement,\u201d he said. The Hostplus CEO, David Elia, said the drawdowns would not cause his $45bn fund to freeze. \u201cWe are sitting on billions of dollars in cash and billions of dollars in listed equities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should also be recognised that whilst global equity markets have declined in recent months, the falling Australian dollar has also lifted the value of those international holdings.\u201d Both ISA and Hostplus said the super drawdowns would put pressure on fund systems because they had to be manually processed. \u201cThere are also other broader considerations for the entire superannuation industry that we have to consider, including the impact on an already stressed system dealing with current member queries relating to the recent investment market volatility and the consequential reduction in member account balances,\u201d Elia said. \u201cMany funds are already at full capacity dealing with member inquires.\u201d",

A new study by consultants Delta-EE for Ease found that the European market grew by a total of 1 gigawatt-hours in 2019, a significant slowdown compared with 2018, when the energy storage market exceeded expectations to grow by 1.47GWh. The slowdown in 2019 has emerged amid rising concern that the outbreak of the coronavirus may stall the rollout of clean energy technologies in 2020, dealing a double blow to the clean energy industry. The 2019 downturn was particularly marked for large-scale energy storage projects which connect directly to energy grids, and can help make better use of renewable energy by storing the clean electricity to use when wind and solar power is not available.

In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-exposes-society-fragility-find-solutions-that-will-endure\">Coronavirus exposes society\u2019s fragility.

They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it. The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources. But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment. Yes, to some extent this is a utopian aspiration. But it is also essentially pragmatic. We cannot extol the virtues of small government and global societies without grasping that the risk to the majority cannot be halted from spreading: viruses do not distinguish between classes and nationalities. Just as work and public life cannot be shuttered for ever, borders cannot be closed indefinitely. African countries are moving fast against coronavirus, well aware that they are on their own. But barring a miracle, or a pandemic Marshall plan by wealthier countries, if the virus explodes in poorer countries, the cataclysm will engulf everyone. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Dionne Warwick is 79 and on fire. In 2019 she released two albums, kicked off a Vegas residency and won a lifetime achievement Grammy award. This year she has already done a turn on the US version of The Masked Singer \u2013 the reality TV show where artists perform songs incognito \u2013 and a UK tour is planned for autumn.</p> <p>As the sweet, mellow voice behind the hits Walk on By and Do You Know the Way to San Jose, she was one of the first artists in the series to be correctly identified by the show\u2019s judging panel. \u201cThe fortunate, or unfortunate thing about my voice is it\u2019s so distinctive,\u201d she says. Obscuring it would have been impossible, she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s 11am in Las Vegas when Warwick calls me in the UK. At the time she was several months into a run performing four intimate shows a week on Cleopatra\u2019s Barge at Caesars Palace. The shows are currently suspended. After more than five decades of touring, performing like this must feel like a doddle? \u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she giggles. \u201cIt\u2019s taken the running-through-airports out my life for a minute, but aside from that, it is basically the same.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick has dazzled audiences since the 60s, when she was the bright young thing introduced to the Paris Olympia as \u201cthe black pearl\u201d by Marlene Dietrich. But she had been singing for her supper long before that. Born in 1940 in East Orange, New Jersey, she had a \u201cwonderful\u201d upbringing. \u201cEvery family knew every family, of course,\u201d she says. \u201cMy aunt lived about a block and a half away from us.\u201d Her aunt is Cissy Houston, one of the many singers in the family, and mother of Warwick\u2019s late cousin Whitney Houston.</p> <p>Warwick was singing in the New Hope Baptist Choir in Newark by the age of six. \u201cI come from a gospel-singing family,\u201d she says. Her mother and maternal aunts and uncles toured the country as the Drinkard Singers; she and her sister Dee Dee formed the group the Gospelaires in their teens. Despite this, she insists she didn\u2019t have a showbusiness upbringing. \u201cWe grew up like normal people grow up. Went to school like everybody else did. Did my homework, and did the dishes as I had to. I had a normal life.\u201d</p> <p>She went to college, studying music at Hartt College of Music in Connecticut and was planning to go into teaching. But her music career with the Gospelaires was beginning to take off. \u201cI was doing demonstration records, and backing singing in studios in New York while I was in college,\u201d she says. \u201cFor Dinah Washington, the entire Scepter roster, Chuck Jackson, Maxine Brown, the Shirelles ... we did some things with Ben E King.\u201d</p> <p>Which ones stand out in her memory? \u201cThey all did. Are you kidding me? They were stars. It was really wonderful to be, first of all, in demand, and that\u2019s what our group was. And subsequently, over the years, I made friends with all these people.\u201d She didn\u2019t get to work with Elvis, although, she says: \u201cI had sweet aspirations to. But I had the pleasure of meeting him and getting to know him. That\u2019s as far as that went.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick isn\u2019t inclined to regale me with anecdotes about working in this golden era, preferring to be matter-of-fact about her job. \u201cWe did what we knew how to do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a very lucrative situation that helped keep me in college with my tuition and books and things of that nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a20d19cba672e6f3200b277ccb0f17d6424ceac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a20d19cba672e6f3200b277ccb0f17d6424ceac/0_0_2283_3000/761.jpg\" alt=\"Warwick with Burt Bacharach in 1968.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warwick with Burt Bacharach in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The music industry had other plans for her. The songwriting duo and kings of easy listening Hal David and Burt Bacharach had heard her work as a session musician and asked her to record a demo of a song that they had written for the Shirelles. They sent it over to Scepter records \u2013 the independent label that launched the careers of the Kingsmen, the Isley Brothers and Tammi Terrell \u2013 and when its president, Florence Greenberg, heard it, says Warwick, paraphrasing Greenberg\u2019s famous response: \u201cShe did not want the song. She wanted the voice, and that was me.\u201d</p> <p>In 1962, she released the Bacharach-David song Don\u2019t Make Me Over, which reached No 21 on the Billboard charts and established her around the world as one of pop music\u2019s great voices. Her biggest hit came in 1967, with I Say A Little Prayer, followed by Do You Know The Way to San Jose in 1968. Despite starting so young, she never had Motown-style deportment coaching for public life, or a chaperone, nor did she need one. \u201cFrom what I was taught at home, I already knew what I was doing and how to act and how to dress and how to speak. I came from a safe, solid home.\u201d</p> <p>Her 60s heyday was relatively short-lived. By 1972, she had split with her prolific writing and producing team; Bacharach and David had decided, mid-recording contract, not to work together any more. \u201cI had no choice but to sue both Bacharach and David,\u201d she says, but their friendship survived. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t cut off and disappear.\u201d This was the start of a patchy decade on the charts, but the 80s brought her another golden era.

That happens to be high on my priorities, and it seems it is everywhere else except the United States.\u201d Now, she says: \u201cI don\u2019t just feel that way about the US, but I feel that way about the entire world. It\u2019s in the most chaotic state ever. It\u2019s just a period of time in which everything\u2019s changing.</p> <p>\u201cWars, segregation, everything that the entire world is going through, emotionally, mentally and physically, it\u2019s in a sad state right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s segregation going on in the States, and segregation going on in the UK. There\u2019s segregation going on everywhere, it\u2019s still the same.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick experienced formal segregation first-hand while touring the southern US, where audiences were split according to race. \u201cIt was in the 60s and it was horrible, something I\u2019d never experienced. It was like a bad movie,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the modus operandi for that part of our country, unfortunately.\u201d And more than 50 years later, she believes there has been little progress. \u201cNothing\u2019s really changed yet,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope eventually we\u2019ll get to the point where we all understand that we all bleed red blood, end of.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick didn\u2019t get directly involved in the civil rights movement. \u201cI\u2019m not a marcher, I\u2019m a doer,\u201d she says. In 1969, the year after Martin Luther King was assassinated, Warwick won her first Grammy \u2013 best female pop vocal performance for Do You Know the Way to San Jose. \u201cI believe I was the first [African American woman] to win a Grammy in the pop arena, which was basically almost designated for white people,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was kind of unheard of. I was probably the first person in a lot of areas.\u201d</p> <p>She was also the main breadwinner for her husband, William David Elliott, an actor and drummer, and two sons, David and Damon, who both now work in music (Damon produced one of his mother\u2019s latest albums, She\u2019s Back, and has worked with Beyonc\u00e9, Macy Gray, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani). That put a strain on the marriage. \u201cI was the major earning power in the family and that is very difficult for the male ego,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just got too much to bear for my husband, and we decided that it would be best for us to part ways.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7b7439d147549e607be305dedf77976ff4ae62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7b7439d147549e607be305dedf77976ff4ae62f/0_0_3780_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warwick performing at the Paris Olympia in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warwick performing at the Paris Olympia in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo 12/Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breadwinning became harder in the 90s. This was when Warwick started presenting infomercials sponsored by the Psychic Friends Network. These took the form of a pastel-hued daytime talkshow, complete with studio audience and a lot of pot plants. Fronted by the psychic Linda Georgian, the network offered a telephone psychic reading service and the infomercials proved a roaring success, raking in $125m a year at its peak.</p> <p>I politely inquire whether this sojourn was a passion or just a job. Warwick is clearly wearied by the fact that she\u2019s never going to live this down, nor the story about her temporarily adding an \u201ce\u201d on the end of her surname in the early 1970s after her astrologer told her it would boost her success, so she plumps for the latter \u2013 just a job \u2013 in a flash. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it was. It was during a period of time when I was not recording. You know, it kept the lights on in my house and food on my table. It was an earning power. I earned money that I normally would have earned if I was on the road. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d</p> <p>But was she a believer? \u201cNo more than anybody else is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou ask anybody in the world: \u2018What\u2019s your sign?\u2019 and they\u2019ll say it.\u201d I feel bad for having brought it up, so I comment on how successful the show was. \u201cIt sure was,\u201d she says. \u201cThen everybody put a boo-boo on that. They said: \u2018What are you doing, ratting on about that?\u2019 But now that\u2019s all you see on TV or hear people talk about. I\u2019m known to be the first to do things.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, Warwick appeared on Celebrity Apprentice in the US with Donald Trump. She describes the experience as \u201cvery interesting\u201d. It didn\u2019t go well for her and when her co-contestants turned nasty, she fired herself. \u201cIt got to the point where I felt this was not what I was supposed to be doing with my 50-year career.\u201d However, she says, \u201cthe Donald Trump that I knew was very nice. He really was. He was a gentleman. He never was out of the way with me. I didn\u2019t know what he did with anybody else but I know how he treated me. I did concerts in his hotel, and he was always very nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>She has fewer words to describe how she feels about him now. \u201cI don\u2019t know that man. That\u2019s not the man that I knew. Period.\u201d This is as political as she\u2019s prepared to get. \u201cPolitics, religion and sex are three things that should totally be avoided in conversation,\u201d she says firmly.</p> <p>She\u2019s also, understandably, loth to talk about her cousin Whitney, who died in 2012 after years of substance abuse. As we speak, the bizarre hologram show An Evening With Whitney Houston has opened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/28/an-evening-with-whitney-houston-hologram-review-liverpool\">in the UK to bewildered reviews</a>. \u201cFirst I even heard about it, so, you know, I have no opinion of it,\u201d she says, but she does. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of time. And Whitney\u2019s legacy, her music, speaks for itself.\u201d Some fans have commented that they feel Houston is being exploited beyond the grave. Houston\u2019s former manager and sister-in-law Pat Houston, <a href=\"https://time.com/5790210/\">meanwhile, has reportedly said</a>: \u201cThis is something that she wanted to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know,\u201d says Warwick, I think referring to the real motives behind the show, \u201cit\u2019s what makes the world go round.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick says she will carry on performing, \u201cas long as I\u2019m giving people the pleasure that they seem to have when they come to my concerts, and I\u2019m doing it to the best of my ability. But when I feel that I have altered in any way, vocally, appearance wise, or any of the other things that go along with it, that\u2019s when I should gracefully bow out.\u201d That\u2019s when she will return to Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s my paradise,\u201d she says. \u201cI say when I\u2019m through with showbusiness, that\u2019s where I want to live.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound in the least sad about the prospect. \u201cWell, you know,\u201d she laughs, \u201cnothing lasts for ever.\u201d</p>",

I was probably the first person in a lot of areas.\u201d She was also the main breadwinner for her husband, William David Elliott, an actor and drummer, and two sons, David and Damon, who both now work in music (Damon produced one of his mother\u2019s latest albums, She\u2019s Back, and has worked with Beyonc\u00e9, Macy Gray, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani). That put a strain on the marriage. \u201cI was the major earning power in the family and that is very difficult for the male ego,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just got too much to bear for my husband, and we decided that it would be best for us to part ways.\u201d Breadwinning became harder in the 90s. This was when Warwick started presenting infomercials sponsored by the Psychic Friends Network. These took the form of a pastel-hued daytime talkshow, complete with studio audience and a lot of pot plants. Fronted by the psychic Linda Georgian, the network offered a telephone psychic reading service and the infomercials proved a roaring success, raking in $125m a year at its peak. I politely inquire whether this sojourn was a passion or just a job. Warwick is clearly wearied by the fact that she\u2019s never going to live this down, nor the story about her temporarily adding an \u201ce\u201d on the end of her surname in the early 1970s after her astrologer told her it would boost her success, so she plumps for the latter \u2013 just a job \u2013 in a flash. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it was. It was during a period of time when I was not recording. You know, it kept the lights on in my house and food on my table. It was an earning power. I earned money that I normally would have earned if I was on the road. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d But was she a believer? \u201cNo more than anybody else is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou ask anybody in the world: \u2018What\u2019s your sign?\u2019 and they\u2019ll say it.\u201d I feel bad for having brought it up, so I comment on how successful the show was. \u201cIt sure was,\u201d she says. \u201cThen everybody put a boo-boo on that. They said: \u2018What are you doing, ratting on about that?\u2019 But now that\u2019s all you see on TV or hear people talk about. I\u2019m known to be the first to do things.\u201d In 2011, Warwick appeared on Celebrity Apprentice in the US with Donald Trump. She describes the experience as \u201cvery interesting\u201d. It didn\u2019t go well for her and when her co-contestants turned nasty, she fired herself. \u201cIt got to the point where I felt this was not what I was supposed to be doing with my 50-year career.\u201d However, she says, \u201cthe Donald Trump that I knew was very nice. He really was. He was a gentleman. He never was out of the way with me. I didn\u2019t know what he did with anybody else but I know how he treated me. I did concerts in his hotel, and he was always very nice to me.\u201d She has fewer words to describe how she feels about him now. \u201cI don\u2019t know that man. That\u2019s not the man that I knew. Period.\u201d This is as political as she\u2019s prepared to get. \u201cPolitics, religion and sex are three things that should totally be avoided in conversation,\u201d she says firmly. She\u2019s also, understandably, loth to talk about her cousin Whitney, who died in 2012 after years of substance abuse. As we speak, the bizarre hologram show An Evening With Whitney Houston has opened in the UK to bewildered reviews. \u201cFirst I even heard about it, so, you know, I have no opinion of it,\u201d she says, but she does. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of time. And Whitney\u2019s legacy, her music, speaks for itself.\u201d Some fans have commented that they feel Houston is being exploited beyond the grave. Houston\u2019s former manager and sister-in-law Pat Houston, meanwhile, has reportedly said: \u201cThis is something that she wanted to do.\u201d \u201cWell, you know,\u201d says Warwick, I think referring to the real motives behind the show, \u201cit\u2019s what makes the world go round.\u201d Warwick says she will carry on performing, \u201cas long as I\u2019m giving people the pleasure that they seem to have when they come to my concerts, and I\u2019m doing it to the best of my ability. But when I feel that I have altered in any way, vocally, appearance wise, or any of the other things that go along with it, that\u2019s when I should gracefully bow out.\u201d That\u2019s when she will return to Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s my paradise,\u201d she says. \u201cI say when I\u2019m through with showbusiness, that\u2019s where I want to live.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound in the least sad about the prospect. \u201cWell, you know,\u201d she laughs, \u201cnothing lasts for ever.\u201d",

The stonechats that often sing here were absent, perhaps deterred by the strong wind, but on the hilltop pastures lambs raced in groups around the stolid ewes. They were clearly enjoying the warmth of the sunshine, for what was probably the first time.</p> <p>At the crest of the path, the view to the north opened up dramatically. A broad line of surf picked out the sweep of the beach towards Ynyslas, while the hills of Gwynedd beyond lay half hidden in cloud and murk. Between the two, the sand-banked and marsh-fringed estuary of the Afon Dyfi reached inland towards Machynlleth.</p> <p>This spot, Craig yr Wylfa, is well named \u2013 translating roughly as the lookout rock. On a good day, you can see the whole breadth of Cardigan Bay from here \u2013 a horizon 50 miles across. This was not one of those days, but the strategic advantage gained by anyone who held the cliff in historic times was still evident.</p> <p>Dropping out of the wind, the grassy slope towards Borth gave me time to look across the expanse of Cors Fochno, the great peat wetland beyond the Afon Leri. Beneath towering clouds, the patches of open water within the mosaic of mottled vegetation looked almost black in the afternoon sun, but the light suddenly softened. Glancing westward, I could see the next bank of high cloud begin to obscure the sun. More rain was on the way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The narrow lane down to the beach was edged with the yellow flowers of celandines, huddled at the base of the hedge. After days of rain, the field drains jetted water from the steep, saturated fields above, giving the overgrown brook an unusual urgency as it tumbled towards the water-rounded cobbles of the shoreline. Storm surf driven by recent gale-force winds had stirred up sediment and detritus from the floor of the shallow bay, leaving the seawater discoloured and turbid. Breaking waves still pitched and roared over the dark, outlying skerry rocks and hissed across the wave-cut shallows, while oystercatchers wheeled uncertainly above their usual perches. The coast path towards Borth, steep and unforgiving as it loops around the scalloped cliffs, climbed muddily between shoulder-high banks of gorse. The stonechats that often sing here were absent, perhaps deterred by the strong wind, but on the hilltop pastures lambs raced in groups around the stolid ewes. They were clearly enjoying the warmth of the sunshine, for what was probably the first time. At the crest of the path, the view to the north opened up dramatically. A broad line of surf picked out the sweep of the beach towards Ynyslas, while the hills of Gwynedd beyond lay half hidden in cloud and murk. Between the two, the sand-banked and marsh-fringed estuary of the Afon Dyfi reached inland towards Machynlleth. This spot, Craig yr Wylfa, is well named \u2013 translating roughly as the lookout rock. On a good day, you can see the whole breadth of Cardigan Bay from here \u2013 a horizon 50 miles across. This was not one of those days, but the strategic advantage gained by anyone who held the cliff in historic times was still evident. Dropping out of the wind, the grassy slope towards Borth gave me time to look across the expanse of Cors Fochno, the great peat wetland beyond the Afon Leri. Beneath towering clouds, the patches of open water within the mosaic of mottled vegetation looked almost black in the afternoon sun, but the light suddenly softened. Glancing westward, I could see the next bank of high cloud begin to obscure the sun. More rain was on the way.",

But by question time, at 2.55pm, Robert was forced to take back his statement, telling parliament that it wasn\u2019t an attack but just the alarms that are designed to detect and stop DDoS attacks triggering due to the large volume of people trying to log in. \u201cThe DDoS alarms showed no evidence of a specific attack today,\u201d he said. MyGov had last week been able to cope with about 6,000 users logging on at once, but Robert said this was upgraded to 55,000 over the weekend in expectation that many more Australians would have been logging on after the increase in business shutdowns as a result of the coronavirus pandemic forcing more people into unemployment. Robert told the parliament that about 95,000 people were trying to access MyGov at once, causing the DDoS alarms to trigger. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said it wasn\u2019t a cyber attack, \u201cit was an incompetence attack\u201d. The shadow minister for government services, Bill Shorten, went further and accused Robert on Twitter of lying about the attack, and suggested the minister should lose his job. Before Robert\u2019s reversal, Labor was already showing skepticism over his claim of a DDoS attack. \u201cThis is the most pathetic excuse imaginable for the failure of the Morrison government to plan for an entirely foreseeable surge in user demand,\u201d Labor MP Tim Watts tweeted. \u201cCrying DDoS in this situation will rightly be laughed at by everyone with the most basic technical competence.\u201d Guardian Australia has sought comment from Services Australia and the Australian Cyber Security Centre.",

The IOC said on Sunday that it was drawing up alternative scenarios for the Games, but was not considering calling them off. It said it would take up to a month to reach a decision, although that timeline will soon begin to look unrealistic if more national Olympic committees threaten boycotts. \u201cThese scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cThe IOC will ... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement. The IOC is confident that it will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks.\u201d Abe, who until recently insisted the Olympics\u2019 timing would not change, hinted that postponement could be an option if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to hold them in July with the full quota of athletes and spectators. If holding the Olympics in its complete form \u201cbecomes impossible, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games, given the Olympics\u2019 principle of putting the health of athletes first\u201d, Abe told parliament on Monday. Despite the uncertainty, Japan\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said on Monday that the torch relay would start on Thursday as planned. Organisers have asked people not to line the route when the flame begins its journey through Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures in Fukushima.",

      "bodyText": "We know how this story ends. The story ends with Labor passing the Morrison government\u2019s multibillion-dollar stimulus measures sometime on Monday, 23 March 2020. But the journey to that end is worth recording. The Australian parliament, the people\u2019s house, is so sparse today it echoes. The wide corridors, normally teeming with life during a sitting fortnight, are empty, save the odd solo journey to another office, or the chambers, or the press gallery. The clocks tick, and there are few human voices in competition with that relentless meter. The MPs representing us in the scaled-back session are splayed across the benches, like hyper-extended chain links. Reporters are confined behind glass. There is hand sanitiser on the tables, near the hansard volumes, and at the entrances to the chambers, the cafeteria, the cabinet suite. Politicians are, by disposition, creatures of certainty. They are destiny people. This pandemic has stolen their certainty, and yet they must lead. They are called to make decisions, weighing life and death, guided by expertise that is contested minute by minute in the roiling court of public opinion. Politicians are anxious, like the rest of us. They are deeply flawed, like the rest of us. They are tired. The times feel desperate, and the most honest and self-reflective among our elected representatives must wonder right now whether we have the capacity, either institutionally, and societally, to rise to the demands of this moment. This nagging doubt hangs over this strange parliamentary sitting, but it is cloaked, masked, by cliches. The Anzac spirit. Team Australia. There is almost constant motion in Canberra, as a crisis demands, but in the fleeting moments of stillness, emotions brim, and are checked. Scott Morrison asked the nation to pray on Monday. Partisans will mock him for it, but prayer is a deeply ingrained reflex for the prime minister. It is a golden thread through his life. Morrison, the political product, is oversized, and ubiquitous, but he holds his private self close. When he invokes prayer, he is inviting a glimpse into his private self. For non-believers, this spiritualism is symptomatic of the prime minister\u2019s fundamental failure of reason. But for Morrison, invoking prayer is an intimate act rather than a crude political calculation \u2013 although the signal, the pulse of devotional affirmation, binds him of course to fellow believers, and those believers vote, and he holds those voters close. On Monday, Morrison looked like a man who wanted to summon the power of prayer to steel his personal resolve, and the national resolve, to buttress himself and the country, because our open, trading nation, has now closed the door to the world. Parts of the federation are also closing their doors to visitors \u2013 restrictions on freedom of movement not seen in this nation for more than a century. Locking down neighbourhoods will be the next logical step. To protect ourselves, we are shrinking. Australia, one of the most gregarious nations on earth, is folding in on itself. Australia has looked to the world throughout recent history as the bedrock of our prosperity. The vast majority of us are not afraid of each other, or the world beyond our continent. We are endlessly curious. We look out. But now we must look to each other, to the ingenuity and humanity of our fellow countrymen and women; looking but not touching. If we are so inclined, we can also look to a higher power. Morrison, the miracle prime minister, the believer, has shut the churches. But he urged fellow believers to maintain their rituals. \u201cWhile you may not be able to go to church, the synagogue, the temple or the mosque, I most certainly call on all people of faith for you to pray. I can assure you, my prayer knees are getting a good workout.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, understands the decisions he is making now, in this 24 hours, are definitional ones for his still new Labor leadership, even if they don\u2019t net a single vote. In the chamber on Monday, the Labor leader felt the \u201csilence\u201d of job losses, cascading outside, as the social distancing measures gradually lock down the country. Those queues outside Centrelink on Monday morning, stretching down city blocks. The gig economy, an amoral byproduct of our current cultural obsession with cut-price convenience, lies in ruins. Big companies quiver on the brink. Thousands of small businesses stand silent as of midday Monday, and some will never reopen their doors. Anchored in that materialism, Albanese said his overwhelming duty was to be a Labor leader, not an opposition leader. Politicians often create distinctions without a difference for sport, for superficial combat. But Albanese\u2019s separation of his roles was meaningful. It defined the contours of a response. Labor will try to amend the stimulus package on Monday, but it will not insist on the various suggestions. Albanese is strongly of the view that Morrison has, throughout this coronavirus crisis, been a day late and a dollar short. But those arguments, or at least the full-throated version of them, can wait for a safer place in the future. Question time on Monday was emblematic of that conversation, that interrogation, that rebuttal, both present and deferred. \u201cToday we feel the weight of our nation\u2019s need,\u201d Albanese told the chamber on Monday. \u201cNever has our duty been so urgent. \u201cI lead a Labor team determined to be constructive and Labor stands ready to play our role. We want to help the government to get it right and this parliament to get it right.\u201d",

They explore a city, try the local food, hit the tourist spots and very begrudgingly have a good time.</p> <p>In anyone else\u2019s hands that would get tedious (see: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1702042/\">An Idiot Abroad</a>), but Ayoade is so infectiously kind that even his outright cynicism comes across as fun. He\u2019s loquacious, neurotic and witty about the silly joys and annoyances of travel.</p> <p>The show\u2019s at its best when he\u2019s paired with someone who knows how to bounce off that extremely British tendency to complain. Not surprisingly, some of the best episodes are the ones with his mates.</p> <p>In Copenhagen, Ayoade and<em> </em>Mighty Boosh co-star Noel Fielding drink schnapps and have cute antics at Tivoli amusement park. When Ayoade complains, Fielding smiles and says, \u201cI thought this was going to be a holiday \u2013 not one of your weird, anally retentive fright-fests\u201d.</p> <p>The episode in Vienna with The IT Crowd\u2019s Chris O\u2019Dowd is also worth a watch \u2013 if only for this scene in a snowglobe store.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GosoiF5NMk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GosoiF5NMk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Other celebrities featured on the show include Dawn French, Stephen Merchant, Rob Delaney and Australia\u2019s Adam Hills \u2013 all big names in UK comedy. But another, somewhat more unlikely, match is US actor Jon Hamm.</p> <p>In a longer Christmas episode, Hamm and Ayoade travel to Hong Kong and get foot massages, buy tailored pink and red velvet suits, and practice tai chi. Other Americans (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyJh68lrMv8\">Lena Dunham</a>) are a bit too flat and earnest, but Hamm (and Paul Rudd, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylbZT6RNLLw\">who also appears on the show</a>) has a big goofy energy that offsets Ayoade\u2019s deadpan charm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/21/australian-music-for-isolated-times-a-new-weekly-playlist\">Australian music for isolated times \u2013\u00a0a new weekly playlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A travel show might sound like a frustrating watch right now.

At the start of each show he stands, stiff and sceptical, in the middle of a dazzling European city and says: \u201cWe\u2019re here \u2013 but should we have come?\u201d Travel Man has been a hit in the UK since 2015, but I only discovered it in the past year or so while shuffling through On Demand. In each 30-minute episode, Ayoade (comedian, writer, director, and most famously Moss from The IT Crowd) pairs up with a different celebrity for a 48-hour mini-break. They explore a city, try the local food, hit the tourist spots and very begrudgingly have a good time. In anyone else\u2019s hands that would get tedious (see: An Idiot Abroad), but Ayoade is so infectiously kind that even his outright cynicism comes across as fun. He\u2019s loquacious, neurotic and witty about the silly joys and annoyances of travel. The show\u2019s at its best when he\u2019s paired with someone who knows how to bounce off that extremely British tendency to complain. Not surprisingly, some of the best episodes are the ones with his mates. In Copenhagen, Ayoade and Mighty Boosh co-star Noel Fielding drink schnapps and have cute antics at Tivoli amusement park. When Ayoade complains, Fielding smiles and says, \u201cI thought this was going to be a holiday \u2013 not one of your weird, anally retentive fright-fests\u201d. The episode in Vienna with The IT Crowd\u2019s Chris O\u2019Dowd is also worth a watch \u2013 if only for this scene in a snowglobe store. Other celebrities featured on the show include Dawn French, Stephen Merchant, Rob Delaney and Australia\u2019s Adam Hills \u2013 all big names in UK comedy. But another, somewhat more unlikely, match is US actor Jon Hamm. In a longer Christmas episode, Hamm and Ayoade travel to Hong Kong and get foot massages, buy tailored pink and red velvet suits, and practice tai chi. Other Americans (see: Lena Dunham) are a bit too flat and earnest, but Hamm (and Paul Rudd, who also appears on the show) has a big goofy energy that offsets Ayoade\u2019s deadpan charm. A travel show might sound like a frustrating watch right now. I get that. Some of the most renowned tourist sites in the world are ghost towns, and you\u2019re more likely to be grieving a cancelled trip right now than planning a new one. But as your whole world shrinks to the size of your lounge room, it\u2019s important to remember that this isn\u2019t permanent. This will pass. There will be more trips to plan. For now, all we can do is look out to the other side: to a time when you can jet off to explore the world with your closest friends, and inevitably complain about motion sickness and lines and prices and sore feet the whole time. \u2022 Seasons one, two, eight and nine of Travel Man are streaming on SBS On Demand now.",

Confined to our homes with all plans cancelled, borders closed and services stalled, there was little else to distract us from an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/22/the-coronavirus-story-is-unfathomably-large-we-must-get-the-reporting-right\">unfathomable crisis</a> that was getting more dystopic by the day.</p> <p>But for those who tuned in to Isolaid this weekend \u2013 a two day Australian music festival which ran via Instagram\u2019s live story feature \u2013 there was solace to be found. We were all there in the same place, going through the same thing, despite being alone. I didn\u2019t expect to be so caught up in it. I didn\u2019t expect to feel such relief.</p> <p>Organised by Emily Ulman, Rhiannon Atkinson-Howatt (Merpire) and Shannen Egan to raise funds and awareness for industry non-profit Support Act, Isolaid featured 74 acts playing 20-minute sets, livestreaming from their bedrooms, their home farms, the bedraggled living rooms of their inner-city share houses. After each set, the performer would throw to the next \u2013 and we would scrabble for the right account to tune into.</p> <p>Most artists pulled a crowd of around 4-600, including a bunch of other musicians, managers, label folk and promoters who were lighting up the comments with love hearts and applause emojis. The live performance industry was one of the first to be decimated by coronavirus: according to the user-generated data compiled by <a href=\"https://ilostmygig.net.au/\">I Lost My Gig</a>, cancelled gigs have cost them more than $280m already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-leaves-roadies-and-events-crew-devastated-its-the-first-industry-to-stop-dead\">Coronavirus leaves roadies and events crew devastated: 'It's the first industry to stop dead'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why Isolaid felt like the first laugh after a big cry. The energy was fun, hilarious and occasionally chaotic. Musicians stopped songs to read the comments, and brought dogs in to distract us while they tuned. Denise Le Menice gave a brilliant set from WA, filling in for Moaning Lisa who had to cancel last-minute. \u201cThanks for clapping \u2013 not that I can hear!\u201d she laughed manically, before trying to auction off a signed roll of toilet paper for $20, drink in hand. \u201cCheers to the coronavirus, you little fucking dickhead!\u201d</p> <p>Just like at every other music festival, I ran into friends, discovered a bunch of new bands, saved the schedule as my screen lock and got FOMO each time I had to miss a set. Unlike every other music festival, I was wearing pyjamas and eating from crockery. I propped my screen up on the kitchen counter to watch a few sets as I cooked a salmon steak. Each performance was ephemeral, one-time-only; Instagram stories delete themselves after 24 hours. \u201cTake care of each other,\u201d musicians told us, over and over again. \u201cStay home. Stay away from people. Stay sane.\u201d</p> <p>And they were there for each other too. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d said Eilish Gilligan, before premiering a yet-to-be-recorded song written with Japanese Wallpaper and Alex Lahey.</p> <p>\u201cOMG YES EILISH,\u201d wrote Lahey in the comments. \u201c10/10,\u201d commented Ball Park Music. \u201cWe stan Eilish more than anything else in this whole world,\u201d said Cry Club.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most connected I have felt in many, many days,\u201d McMahon told us from her living room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f/0_561_828_630/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.\" width=\"500\" height=\"380\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each \u201cstage\u201d was set differently. Hannah Blackburn played alone in her bedroom before inviting her band in: David Western came in via a ladder through the window, carrying three beers and a banjo and followed by drummer Jess Ellwood, who was handed a jar full of cash to use as percussion.</p> <p>Grace Turner\u2019s floor was strewn with roses and moodily dappled with vintage lamps; Alice Skye moved her camera from a Casio in the grass on her family farm to the upright in her living room. Zoe Fox\u2019s hysterical set, filmed by Melbourne artist Didirri, featured costumed extras and Instagram filters that turned her into a surprise pickle. It ended with a cross to the next artist, Ro, who performed from the next room \u2013 before another cross to Didirri\u2019s set. His cover of Times They Are a Changin\u2019 was both impossibly hokey and weirdly perfect.

      "bodyText": "When Melbourne musician Angie McMahon launched into her live cover of Lana Del Rey\u2019s Born To Die \u2013 filming herself on her home piano on Saturday night \u2013 the comments underneath lit up with that brand of fandom hyperbole that expresses joy as a death wish. \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d said one. \u201cWe are all dead,\u201d said another. \u201cCall an ambulance,\u201d said a third, before Sydney artist Alex the Astronaut chimed in: \u201cEveryone stop it plz stay alive.\u201d At a live gig, McMahon\u2019s voice can electrify a room. But on Instagram this weekend \u2013 her hair a messy plait down one side of a crinkled T-shirt, phone camera propped on top of her upright, her face cropped so closely it felt like Facetiming a friend \u2013 the performance felt personal, and even more intense. More than 2,000 people had tuned in to watch her set; 2,000 people who had mostly been inside for at least a week now, following a global catastrophe as it unfolded in a scroll of increasingly frightening headlines on our phones. These last few days had been particularly bad. Confined to our homes with all plans cancelled, borders closed and services stalled, there was little else to distract us from an unfathomable crisis that was getting more dystopic by the day. But for those who tuned in to Isolaid this weekend \u2013 a two day Australian music festival which ran via Instagram\u2019s live story feature \u2013 there was solace to be found. We were all there in the same place, going through the same thing, despite being alone. I didn\u2019t expect to be so caught up in it. I didn\u2019t expect to feel such relief. Organised by Emily Ulman, Rhiannon Atkinson-Howatt (Merpire) and Shannen Egan to raise funds and awareness for industry non-profit Support Act, Isolaid featured 74 acts playing 20-minute sets, livestreaming from their bedrooms, their home farms, the bedraggled living rooms of their inner-city share houses. After each set, the performer would throw to the next \u2013 and we would scrabble for the right account to tune into. Most artists pulled a crowd of around 4-600, including a bunch of other musicians, managers, label folk and promoters who were lighting up the comments with love hearts and applause emojis. The live performance industry was one of the first to be decimated by coronavirus: according to the user-generated data compiled by I Lost My Gig, cancelled gigs have cost them more than $280m already. Perhaps that\u2019s why Isolaid felt like the first laugh after a big cry. The energy was fun, hilarious and occasionally chaotic. Musicians stopped songs to read the comments, and brought dogs in to distract us while they tuned. Denise Le Menice gave a brilliant set from WA, filling in for Moaning Lisa who had to cancel last-minute. \u201cThanks for clapping \u2013 not that I can hear!\u201d she laughed manically, before trying to auction off a signed roll of toilet paper for $20, drink in hand. \u201cCheers to the coronavirus, you little fucking dickhead!\u201d Just like at every other music festival, I ran into friends, discovered a bunch of new bands, saved the schedule as my screen lock and got FOMO each time I had to miss a set. Unlike every other music festival, I was wearing pyjamas and eating from crockery. I propped my screen up on the kitchen counter to watch a few sets as I cooked a salmon steak. Each performance was ephemeral, one-time-only; Instagram stories delete themselves after 24 hours. \u201cTake care of each other,\u201d musicians told us, over and over again. \u201cStay home. Stay away from people. Stay sane.\u201d And they were there for each other too. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d said Eilish Gilligan, before premiering a yet-to-be-recorded song written with Japanese Wallpaper and Alex Lahey. \u201cOMG YES EILISH,\u201d wrote Lahey in the comments. \u201c10/10,\u201d commented Ball Park Music. \u201cWe stan Eilish more than anything else in this whole world,\u201d said Cry Club. \u201cThis is the most connected I have felt in many, many days,\u201d McMahon told us from her living room. Each \u201cstage\u201d was set differently. Hannah Blackburn played alone in her bedroom before inviting her band in: David Western came in via a ladder through the window, carrying three beers and a banjo and followed by drummer Jess Ellwood, who was handed a jar full of cash to use as percussion. Grace Turner\u2019s floor was strewn with roses and moodily dappled with vintage lamps; Alice Skye moved her camera from a Casio in the grass on her family farm to the upright in her living room. Zoe Fox\u2019s hysterical set, filmed by Melbourne artist Didirri, featured costumed extras and Instagram filters that turned her into a surprise pickle. It ended with a cross to the next artist, Ro, who performed from the next room \u2013 before another cross to Didirri\u2019s set. His cover of Times They Are a Changin\u2019 was both impossibly hokey and weirdly perfect. This share house was having the best time. Liv Cartledge, Clews and June Jones gave us lo-fi sets with stunning vocals; Lupa J and Harvey Sutherland made big parties in home studios; Rat Hammock and Good Morning had full bands, sensibly spaced out. Housemates applauded in the background. There were a great many dogs. Emma Russack\u2019s mum played piano behind her, and Cry Club offered a stripped back version of their social distance anthem: Don\u2019t Fucking Touch Me. On Sunday night Julia Jacklin sang the most prescient lines of the weekend: \u201cYou\u2019ll go outside, enjoy the sun / soon you\u2019ll feel fine to see everyone\u201d (Comfort); \u201cYou can love somebody without using your hands\u201d (Head Alone); and, \u201cI know I\u2019ve locked myself in my room / I\u2019ll open up the door and try to love again soon\u201d (Pressure to Party). Her set was watched by more than 2,700. Around the same number had tuned into Stella Donnelly the night before. Donnelly is staying with her partner and his dad and dog, away from her own family in Western Australia, whose borders have just closed. \u201cMy mum\u2019s still a punk, and you\u2019re still shit,\u201d she drawled in a verse from Seasons Greeting \u2013 before breaking from the song to speak directly to the camera: \u201cMiss you, Mum.\u201d According to the organisers, the festival raised $12,000 for Support Act \u2013 and they\u2019re booking a follow-up for next weekend already.

      "bodyText": "On a Sunday afternoon in November last year, children clambered over an adventure playground as their parents watched from under shady trees in a park in an affluent suburb of Napier, on New Zealand\u2019s North Island. The suburban scene was interrupted as two bikie gangs carrying baseball bats and sharpened metal weapons appeared and set upon each other nearby, leaving one man unconscious and onlookers terrified. Two months later, fears among the residents in the predominantly middle-upper class suburb of Taradale escalated further when members of the region\u2019s rival gangs \u2013 the Mongrel Mob and Black Power \u2013 were involved in a shootout. The brawl between up to 40 gang members led to a Black Power member losing his eye. A shotgun pellet lodged into a car seat in the man\u2019s vehicle, narrowly missing his infant daughter. In the weeks since then many locals have been left wondering how such extreme violence entered their lives. When the Guardian visits, many are too frightened of the gangs\u2019 growing power to give their names. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re attacking us, but you could get caught in the middle of something,\u201d said one. Another says: \u201cI\u2019m definitely more hyper-aware that it\u2019s happening more often. If I see a gang member now I worry about my kids\u2019 safety.\u201d Gangs have existed for decades in New Zealand; their members are a common sight on the country\u2019s roads and truck stops, immediately identifiable in patched vests and riding oversized motorcycles. But years of low-key activity has been shattered by recent wars between rival gangs, and police in the worst-affected parts of the country \u2013 on the east coast of the North Island \u2013 are wondering just how, and if, they can ever be brought under control again. Turf wars and recruitment drives Taradale is Black Power\u2019s small but tightly held island in a sea of Mongrel Mob territory. But outsiders would be hard pressed to know it. Gang patches are banned in the suburb\u2019s public spaces and locals say members usually keep to themselves. The recent conflict has come as a shock after years of the gangs operating discreetly. A 10-minute drive east is the Mongrel Mob headquarters, dwarfing a sparse playground nearby. A huge red billboard depicting the gang\u2019s logo \u2013 a bulldog wearing a German \u201cStahlhelm\u201d helmet \u2013 covers the side of the two-storey house. This is Maraenui, Napier\u2019s poorest suburb. More than two-thirds of residents are M\u0101ori or Pacific islander and unemployment, poverty and gang affiliation are high. Locals say they\u2019re used to gang warfare \u2013 but in recent months it has escalated to an alarming degree. In the weeks following the Taradale shooting police, who are normally not armed in New Zealand, carried firearms on their daily duties, increased patrols and vowed to crack down on gang activities.. While their presence has provided some reassurance, residents also worry that not enough is being done to address the root causes of poverty and crime that have led to an explosion in the local gang population. And they have reason to be worried. Gangs are recruiting more than two members a day, according to police figures. There are now 1,128 patched gang members in Hawke\u2019s Bay and Gisborne \u2013 up 40% from two years ago. Dr Jarrod Gilbert, a gang expert from the University of Canterbury, says the groups have thrived on the east coast following the mass migration of M\u0101ori from rural to urban centres. Ancestral roots, already damaged by colonisation, were severed for many as they came to work the region\u2019s abundant fields, orchards, farms and factories in the 1950s and 60s. When recessions hit in the 70s and 80s, the jobs went and, with no family to fall back on, the gangs grew, says Gilbert. But after a violent period in in the 1980s, members grew older and had families, and a period of relative calm ensued. That all changed with the arrival of Australia\u2019s largest motorcycle gang in 2008. The Rebels\u2019 flashy bikes, gold jewellery and sophisticated operation attracted new members in droves. The gangs in Hawke\u2019s Bay envied the Rebels and started their own recruitment drives, while at the same time the methamphetamine trade blossomed, fuelled by the arrival of more gang members deported from Australia under that country\u2019s controversial deportation law. \u201cSo we have a small area with lots of new gang members. When it\u2019s crowded someone is going to get elbowed out,\u201d says Gilbert. This turf war is partly to blame for the current problems. The Taradale shooting was a retaliatory act after Mob members, visiting a relative\u2019s grave in January, failed to give warning to Black Power that they would be entering their territory to do so. The convention of phoning ahead before entering another\u2019s patch has ensured peace between the two gangs since 2011. But these conventions appear to be fraying in the fight for territory and dominance. Detective Inspector Mike Foster, who heads the eastern district gang unit, told the Guardian: \u201cThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re full of meth. They\u2019re out there looking for trouble. You\u2019ll have one gang go into another gang\u2019s territory on purpose just to provoke them.\u201d Police have tried to ensure gang leaders \u201ckeep a lid on things\u201d but the younger ones are not listening, he says. It\u2019s something veteran Mob leaders are \u201cpissed off\u201d about, admits senior Mongrel Mob member Rex Timu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want guns going off in the middle of the street or kids getting hurt,\u201d he says. Black Power also struggle to control their younger members at times, says life member and spokesperson Denis O\u2019Reilly.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump attempted to blunt growing criticism of the stalled federal response to the coronavirus crisis on Sunday night, promising that more help was on the way for states suffering a critical shortage of medical equipment, hospital beds and testing facilities.</p> <p>As the death toll from Covid-19 in the US<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> rose to 417</a>, with more than 33,000 cases reported nationwide, increasing numbers of state and city leaders fired off warnings to the White House that a tipping point was near.</p> <p>Warnings were particularly strong from New York, where cases have risen sharply past 15,000 and now account for around half of those in the US.</p> <p>Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, said earlier in the day hospital supplies including ventilators, masks and surgical gloves would be exhausted within 10 days, while Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned that up to 80% of his state\u2019s population of almost 20 million was at risk of contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on our own,\u201d De Blasio said on CNN. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response came at an evening press conference at the White House, during which he acknowledged \u201ca back-up\u201d in some states and reeled off numbers and lists of equipment he said had been ordered for the three worst-hit states, New York, Washington and California, and others.</p> <p>He also said the US government would be funding \u201c100%\u201d of the costs of national guard deployment to assist in the supply chain, said he had approved major disaster declarations for New York and Washington states and that the army corps of engineers would be available for the construction of field hospitals providing thousands of new beds.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the states can get, they should be getting,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a back-up for the states, and some of the states are doing really well and some don\u2019t do as well. The ones that don\u2019t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit really hard.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo had urged the president to invoke the powers of the Defense Production Act for the<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/politics/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-federal-government/index.html\"> government to assume the acquisition and distribution of medical supplies</a> and prevent states having to compete with each other for essential equipment. He said masks that would usually cost 85 cents were costing his state, where more than 15,000 have the virus and 117 have died, about $7 apiece.</p> <p>But Trump insisted that private companies stepping up to manufacture much-needed equipment was the way to go. \u201cDoing it the way we\u2019re doing it is much better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the threat of doing it if we need it but we have millions of masks being done, ventilators, respirators, we have a lot of good things happening right now.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies are calling us, General Motors spoke to us about doing ventilators. If I call companies and say, \u2018you build us ventilators,\u2019 they don\u2019t even know what a ventilator is.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also suggested that hospitals could sterilize face masks so they could be reused.</p> <h2>Dems block rescue bill over lack of worker aid</h2> <p>Meanwhile, in the US Senate, Democrats blocked legislation that would have pumped $1tn into the US economy, claiming the Republican-crafted bill favored corporate interests over hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states. Earlier, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was touting the stimulus that would have put $3,000 into the hands of most American families.</p> <p>The failure forces the two parties back to the negotiating table on Monday.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump attempted to blunt growing criticism of the stalled federal response to the coronavirus crisis on Sunday night, promising that more help was on the way for states suffering a critical shortage of medical equipment, hospital beds and testing facilities. As the death toll from Covid-19 in the US rose to 417, with more than 33,000 cases reported nationwide, increasing numbers of state and city leaders fired off warnings to the White House that a tipping point was near. Warnings were particularly strong from New York, where cases have risen sharply past 15,000 and now account for around half of those in the US. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, said earlier in the day hospital supplies including ventilators, masks and surgical gloves would be exhausted within 10 days, while Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned that up to 80% of his state\u2019s population of almost 20 million was at risk of contracting the virus. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on our own,\u201d De Blasio said on CNN. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point.\u201d Trump\u2019s response came at an evening press conference at the White House, during which he acknowledged \u201ca back-up\u201d in some states and reeled off numbers and lists of equipment he said had been ordered for the three worst-hit states, New York, Washington and California, and others. He also said the US government would be funding \u201c100%\u201d of the costs of national guard deployment to assist in the supply chain, said he had approved major disaster declarations for New York and Washington states and that the army corps of engineers would be available for the construction of field hospitals providing thousands of new beds. \u201cWhatever the states can get, they should be getting,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a back-up for the states, and some of the states are doing really well and some don\u2019t do as well. The ones that don\u2019t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit really hard.\u201d Cuomo had urged the president to invoke the powers of the Defense Production Act for the government to assume the acquisition and distribution of medical supplies and prevent states having to compete with each other for essential equipment. He said masks that would usually cost 85 cents were costing his state, where more than 15,000 have the virus and 117 have died, about $7 apiece. But Trump insisted that private companies stepping up to manufacture much-needed equipment was the way to go. \u201cDoing it the way we\u2019re doing it is much better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the threat of doing it if we need it but we have millions of masks being done, ventilators, respirators, we have a lot of good things happening right now. \u201cCompanies are calling us, General Motors spoke to us about doing ventilators. If I call companies and say, \u2018you build us ventilators,\u2019 they don\u2019t even know what a ventilator is.\u201d Trump also suggested that hospitals could sterilize face masks so they could be reused. Dems block rescue bill over lack of worker aid Meanwhile, in the US Senate, Democrats blocked legislation that would have pumped $1tn into the US economy, claiming the Republican-crafted bill favored corporate interests over hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states. Earlier, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was touting the stimulus that would have put $3,000 into the hands of most American families. The failure forces the two parties back to the negotiating table on Monday. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said Democrats might craft their own legislation proposals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everybody to see if we can get something done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to help the American worker.\u201d A number of US senators were weighing up a decision to self-quarantine after news emerged that the Kentucky Republican Rand Paul had tested positive for Covid-19. Paul, 57, was swimming at the Senate gym on Sunday morning, according to CNN, and had taken lunch with several colleagues in recent days, although his office insisted he was asymptomatic. \u201cAll the senators are going to seek medical advice as to what action we should take to make sure that we don\u2019t in any way spread the virus ourselves,\u201d the Utah senator Mitt Romney told reporters. \u201cWe have to determine whether any of us should self-quarantine as a result of being in the same room.\u201d Soon after Romney spoke, he and the Utah senator Mike Lee entered voluntary quarantine. Trump, a fierce critic of Romney since the former presidential candidate was the only Republican to vote for impeachment in his recent Senate trial, expressed sarcastic sympathy. \u201cGee, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said. Earlier in the press conference, Trump had attempted to strike a reassuring tone that critics have pointed out was absent from prior press conferences. \u201cFor those worried and afraid, please know that as long as I am your president you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win,\u201d he said. Trump also praised Cuomo, and said that four new field hospitals providing 1,000 beds, a hospital ship soon to arrive in New York and increasing urgency on sending medical supplies were in response to the governor\u2019s call for help. \u201cTime matters, minutes count and this is literally a matter of life and death,\u201d Cuomo said at his own Sunday press conference.

In a televised address - his third in less than a week - Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the measure will prohibit \u201cthe circulation and movement of citizens\u201d deemed to be \u201cpurposeless\u201d - the strictest restriction, yet, in the fight to contain the novel coronavirus spreading further. </p> <p>\u201cIt is perhaps the last step that an organised democratic state [can take],\u201d he said. \u201c A step which must be taken in time, so that it is not taken in vain, because time isn\u2019t counted, any more, in days but in hours,\u201d he told the nation adding that in Italy, every two minutes, a life was now being lost to Covid-19. </p> <p>Exceptions to the rule would be made for citizens going to and from work; for the provision of food and medicine; for visits to a doctor and for those who needed care; for those exercising individually, or with one other person, and for people walking dogs. Those travelling to their permanent place of residence would also be exempt from the measure. </p> <p>But once enforced anyone out on the streets would have to have their passports or identity cards with them at all times, the centre right leader said insisting that the full force of the law would be imposed on those who violated the restriction. Fines of 150 euro will be given in the case of infractions. </p> <p>Although Greece has managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections, numbers are going up and privately officials say they expect a big leap in the coming days. On Sunday, health authorities announced that in the past 24 hours there had been 94 new cases of people testing positive for the virus with a total of 624 confirmed coronavirus cases countrywide. To date, 15 people have died from the disease (with the exception of three, all men). Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. <br><br>Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d </p> <p>Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather. A mass exodus of residents from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside has also alarmed authorities who fear transmission rates spreading to remote areas nationwide. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:58:13.354Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e779cd58f08a08573fbf623\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:15:03.890Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our UK focussed coronavirus blog is reporting on Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference which is currently happening.

Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d</p> <p>His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising.</p> <p>The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered.</p> <p>The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising.</p> <p>Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently.</p> <p>The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus.</p> <p>Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds.

The International Olympic Committee is considering postponing Tokyo 2020, saying cancellation is \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d. About 1.5 million UK residents who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus will be contacted by the NHS and advised to stay at home for 12 weeks. There have been 48 new deaths in the UK and 112 in France. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tests positive for coronavirus. Germany has banned meetings of over two people. 23 people have died and 83 have been left injured in overnight prison riots in Bogota as inmates demanded better protection against the virus. A European clinical trial involving some 3,200 people has been launched to test four possible experimental coronavirus treatments, French public health research body Inserm has said. Participants will have been hospitalised with coronavirus and are expected to be drawn from Belgium, the UK, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands. UK residents have been told that \u201cessential travel\u201d does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks, whether for isolation purposes or holidays and that they should remain in their primary residence. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport updated its guidance to avoid non-essential travel in the UK, saying: \u201cThis guidance is for people planning to visit second homes or holiday premises during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cEssential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.\u201d The update follows a wave of people travelling to rural and remote areas to self-isolate. The trend has been condemned by Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who underlined that it meant \u201cextra pressure on essential services and on health services that are already more distant from people\u201d. Similarly, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said self-isolaters should be prohibited from travelling to rural parts of Wales during the crisis. The Welsh government has warned that people will face a tough crackdown if they refuse to self-isolate and continue with non-essential travel during the outbreak. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it is important members of the public follow the official advice to prevent further deaths. \u201cSelf-isolation for those who have symptoms and social distancing by everyone is absolutely essential at this stage if we are to delay the spread of this virus and save lives,\u201d the First Minister said. \u201cWe all need to follow this advice now to protect each other and our families and to help ensure our NHS is not overwhelmed. Social distancing includes avoiding all but essential travel and if people don\u2019t follow this advice we will have no choice but to use powers to enforce it.\u201d The First Minister\u2019s warning follows a similar message from Boris Johnson, where he outlined that stricter measures would be enforced if social distancing was not observed. Across Wales, 12 people with Covid-19 have died and a further 347 have tested positive for the virus. Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia has announced that the government is shutting down the municipalities of Marneuli and Bolnisi, south to capital city of Tbilisi. The move comes as reportedly the Georgian healthcare authorities could not identify the source for the latest case confirmed in Marneuli, and follows the country\u2019s declaration of a state of emergency yesterday. Brazil has just announced its latest coronavirus statistics. Twenty five dead and 1,546 confirmed cases as of today. That is up from 18 and 1,128 yesterday. South-east Brazil has so far borne the brunt of the crisis and of the fatalities 22 were in Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo and three in the neighbouring state of Rio de Janeiro. Both states are now in a state of partial shutdown with S\u00e3o Paulo set to enter a two-week period of quarantine on Tuesday. Streets were eerily empty on Sunday in parts of Rio although supermarkets and some shops remain open. Brazil\u2019s far-right president - whose response to the crisis has been widely criticised - has attacked the governors of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo - who he sees as potential presidential rivals in the 2022 election - for the drastic steps they are taking. \u201cThey are creating a climate of terror,\u201d by trying to shut airports and keep people at home, Bolsonaro said on Saturday. But there have now been five nights of protests against Bolsonaro\u2019s administration and his handling of coronavirus here and many observers believe his reaction has already wrecked any hope of re-election. McDonald\u2019s has said it is closing all its UK and Ireland restaurants from Monday night. In a statement, its UK CEO, Paul Pomroy, said: \u201cI am incredibly grateful to our brilliant employees who have been working hard to continue to serve you safely in difficult circumstances. \u201cOver the last 24 hours, it has become clear that maintaining safe social distancing whilst operating busy takeaway and Drive Thru restaurants is increasingly difficult and therefore we have taken the decision to close every restaurant in the UK and Ireland by 7pm on Monday 23 March. \u201cWe will be working closely with community groups across the UK and Ireland to distribute food from our restaurants to those most in need, and ahead of closing tomorrow evening, will ensure frontline health workers and emergency services personnel do not have to pay for any food or drink in our restaurants on sight of their work pass. \u201cTake care of one another in these unprecedented times, we look forward to seeing you again as soon as it is safe for us to reopen.\u201d Paul Pomroy Our Australian team have launched their blog today to follow all the developments there. NHS healthcare workers received a round of applause and flowers from Tesco staff in a show of support for their work against the pandemic. Tesco told the PA news agency that staff at stores across the country independently decided to make the gesture as part of the \u2018NHS hour\u2019 it has introduced. This will allow healthcare workers to arrive an hour earlier every Sunday to buy supplies. Grenada has reported its first case of coronavirus, local sources report. The patient is said to have recently travelled from the UK.

The Costa Rican government has announced 17 more Covid-19 cases, bringing the total to 134. President Carlos Alvarado said the virus how now spread to all parts of the country and urged Costa Ricans not to drop their guard against the virus. There is still hope coronavirus can be contained in the Central American country amid a nationwide lockdown. Costa Rica has the second largest outbreak in the region behind Panama, where cases have surged over the weekend to 245 and three deaths. Further north, Guatemala has started an eight day curfew to prevent the spread of the virus after the country recorded 17 cases on Saturday. From PA Media: A fourth patient diagnosed with Covid-19 in Ireland has died. The patient is reported to have had an underlying condition. Syria\u2019s health minister Nizar Yazigi has announced the country\u2019s first confirmed coronavirus case, AP reports. The Archbishop of Canterbury has started a call to prayer on Twitter amidst the pandemic. The International Olympic Committee is considering a postponement of Tokyo 2020, with four weeks until it has to make a decision. The BBC reports the IOC saying that cancellation is \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d, but a \u2018scaled-down\u2019 Games will be considered. France\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 112 on Sunday to 674, senior health official Jerome Salomon said. The number of confirmed infections increased by 1,559 to 16,018, according to Reuters. The UK\u2019s education secretary Gavin Williamson has reiterated guidance on school attendance for children of key workers. In a statement, he said: \u201cTomorrow, all schools will be closed except for vulnerable children and those of critical workers. If your work is not critical in the response to Coronavirus then please keep your child at home. This will help to halt the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives. \u201cWe will be closely monitoring what is happening in schools and will ensure they get the support they need in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d An 18-year-old with underlying conditions has died in England, the NHS has said. They are thought to be the youngest person in the UK to die of the virus so far. The global fashion retailer H&amp;M has announced tonight that it is using its global supply chain to produce \u201cpersonal protective equipment\u201d such as masks, gloves and aprons for use in hospitals and by health care workers to help tackle the widespread effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, The H&amp;M Group said its supply chain teams around the world were collectively supporting initial efforts to support as many countries and communities as possible worldwide. Anna Gedda, head of sustainability at the H&amp;M Group, said:\u201cThe Coronavirus is dramatically affecting each and every one of us, and H&amp;M Group is, like many other organisations, trying our best to help in this extraordinary situation. We see this is as a first step in our efforts to support in any way we can. We are all in this together, and have to approach this as collectively as possible.\u201d The High Street coffee chain Pret Manger has this evening reversed a previous decision to cut the working hours of its employees by 25%, agreeing to continue to continue to award them full pay and following the decision to close all 400 UK stores. The company\u2019s staff were told on Thursday it was triggering contractual clauses relating to \u201cunforeseen, exceptional circumstances\u201d caused by the coronavirus outbreak and that the measures would remain in place for at least three months. On Saturday evening it announced the closure of all its UK stores, after closing seating areas and switching to a \u2018takeaway model\u2019 from Wednesday. A Pret spokesperson said: \u201cWe have decided to continue to pay all our UK employees 100% of their normal hours and pay, reversing our previously proposed reduction in hours. This decision follows the Government\u2019s announcement on Friday that it will pay a percentage of wages due to the coronavirus impact. \u201cThis allows us to keep our teams safe at home and ensure they are paid 100% of their normal hours throughout March and April, despite the fact that our UK shops are not currently open. \u201cWe have made a commitment to protect jobs across Pret and our number one priority is to look after our teams throughout this pandemic. We will keep reviewing the situation as it develops and in light of the continuing cost pressures on the business.\u201d Opera star Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has tested positive for coronavirus. In a Facebook post, the 79-year-old Spanish tenor wrote: \u201cI feel it is my moral duty to announce to you that I have tested positive for COVID19, the Corona virus. My Family and I are all in self isolation for as long as it is deemed medically necessary. Currently we are all in good health but I experienced fever and cough symptoms therefore deciding to get tested and the result came back positive. \u201cI beg everyone to be extremely careful, follow the basic guidelines by washing your hands frequently, keeping at least a 6 feet distance from others, doing everything you can to stop the virus from spreading and please above all stay home if you can ! Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis, so we can hopefully return to our normal daily lives very soon. Please follow your local government\u2019s guidelines and regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves but our entire community.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, Hannah Mays. Handing over now to my colleague Clea Skopeliti Spain\u2019s prime minister has called for the European Union to roll out its own \u201cMarshall Plan,\u201d describing a program of public investment capable of countering the deep economic blow of the crisis. The country has emerged as one of the hardest hit in Europe, with the death toll soaring to 1,720. The country has 28,572 confirmed cases \u2013 a number that is expected to rise in the coming days as expanded testing is rolled out. Officials have warned that the worst is yet to come. \u201cWe\u2019re in a critical moment, the days ahead will be hard,\u201d the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said in a televised address on Saturday. \u201cWe have to ready ourselves psychologically and emotionally.\u201d Around 12% \u2013 or 3,475 of the confirmed cases \u2013 are doctors, nurses and others on the frontlines of the coronavirus battle, the head of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said Sunday. Earlier this week, Spain lost its first healthcare worker to the virus: A 52-year-old nurse from the Basque Country. As the government scrambles to contain the virus, a near-total lockdown has been imposed with residents ordered to stay in their homes save for essential trips. S\u00e1nchez said on Sunday that he would seek to extend the emergency measures until 11 April. He also announced additional measures, including a 30-day restriction on travellers arriving from non-EU countries, save for those on essential travel. As well, regional governments will be given the power to take control of private care homes amid concerns that the unchecked spread of the virus in care facilities could be linked to the deaths of at least 100 people. While the country struggles to contain the virus, many worry about the economic impact it will have on a country where the unemployment rate already ranks among the highest in the industrialised world. Praising the EU\u2019s response to the crisis so far, S\u00e1nchez called for an EU-wide plan aimed at reinvigorating the economies of member states. \u201cWe need to articulate a grand Marshall Plan of reconstruction,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is at war against the coronavirus. And we have to respond with all of our weapons, with all our tools.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tests positive for coronavirus. Merkel\u2019s spokesman said the German chancellor, who is 65, was informed about the doctor\u2019s test shortly after holding a news conference Sunday announcing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Merkel had received a precautionary vaccine Friday against pneumococcal infection. Seibert said in a statement that Merkel would undergo \u201cregular tests\u201d in the coming days and continue with her work from home for the time being. Merkel had earlier expressed her gratitude to Germans who were following the rules on social distancing, saying it was important to remain at least 1.5 meters (about five feet) apart to reduce the likelihood of infection. Greece\u2019s prime minister has announced that as of 6 AM tomorrow a curfew will come into effect nationwide. In a televised address - his third in less than a week - Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the measure will prohibit \u201cthe circulation and movement of citizens\u201d deemed to be \u201cpurposeless\u201d - the strictest restriction, yet, in the fight to contain the novel coronavirus spreading further. \u201cIt is perhaps the last step that an organised democratic state [can take],\u201d he said. \u201c A step which must be taken in time, so that it is not taken in vain, because time isn\u2019t counted, any more, in days but in hours,\u201d he told the nation adding that in Italy, every two minutes, a life was now being lost to Covid-19. Exceptions to the rule would be made for citizens going to and from work; for the provision of food and medicine; for visits to a doctor and for those who needed care; for those exercising individually, or with one other person, and for people walking dogs. Those travelling to their permanent place of residence would also be exempt from the measure. But once enforced anyone out on the streets would have to have their passports or identity cards with them at all times, the centre right leader said insisting that the full force of the law would be imposed on those who violated the restriction. Fines of 150 euro will be given in the case of infractions. Although Greece has managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections, numbers are going up and privately officials say they expect a big leap in the coming days. On Sunday, health authorities announced that in the past 24 hours there had been 94 new cases of people testing positive for the virus with a total of 624 confirmed coronavirus cases countrywide. To date, 15 people have died from the disease (with the exception of three, all men). Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather. A mass exodus of residents from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside has also alarmed authorities who fear transmission rates spreading to remote areas nationwide. Our UK focussed coronavirus blog is reporting on Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference which is currently happening. You can follow here. Poland went ahead with six by-elections on Sunday and reaffirmed plans to hold presidential elections on May 10 as pressure rises to call off the poll amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe have to prepare this. That is the law in our country - nothing has changed,\u201d Tomasz Grzelewski, spokesman for the National Electoral Commission, said. \u201cIf there was a decision by the President about introducing a state of emergency, then we would behave differently.\u201d Poland has shuttered schools, cinemas and theatres, while limiting public gatherings to no more than 50 people. It has also closed its borders to foreigners and introduced a \u201cstate of epidemic\u201d. The country has 627 confirmed cases of coronavirus and seven deaths as of Sunday. But despite calls from opposition critics and candidates to call off the presidential elections, the government says it will not postpone them as it could only do so if it introduces a state of emergency. Earlier this month, voters turned out in low numbers in France\u2019s mayoral elections after the government imposed stringent restrictions on public life. The second round of the election was then called off. Grzelewski said protective measures had been taken to ensure the by-election went ahead smoothly. Staff at voting booths had masks, disinfectant gel and gloves for voters to use. Voters were also to be given single-use pens to mark their ballots. Germany will ban public meetings of more than two people unless they are about work on slowing the spread of the coronavirus, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state said on Sunday. \u201cThe danger lies in the direct social interaction,\u201d state premier Armin Laschet said, adding that the federal government and regional states had agreed on the stricter rules. Spain\u2019s Interior Ministry has said that Spain will impose 30 day entry restrictions on most foreigners from midnight at ports and airports. Spanish nationals, foreign residents, air crew, cargo workers, health workers and diplomats will be exempted from restrictions. Colombia\u2019s prisons were rocked by riots and protests overnight, with inmates demanding better protection against the spread of Covid-19 in the South American country\u2019s jails. Shootouts were heard outside some prisons as videos circulated on social media showing fires and unrest. One video appears to show armed riot police outside La Modelo prison in Bogot\u00e1, the capital, as shots and explosions can be heard inside. Another video appeared to show a fire raging inside the same prison. Colombia\u2019s overcrowded prisons have long been hotbeds for organised crime, with violent power struggles between inmates and guards flaring up on occasion. Earlier this month, the government banned visitors to prisons in a bid to isolate inmates from the coronavirus. \u201cThe authorities must urgently hand over an official report on the protests and riots that occurred last night in the country\u2019s jails,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, tweeted on Sunday morning. \u201cMany of the detainees demanded conditions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They denounce several dead and wounded.\u201d The Justice Ministry said Sunday that the rioting left 23 dead and 83 injured in Bogota. Prison authorities have not yet reported how many casualties resulted from the disturbances. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, joined the chorus calling for a report on Sunday morning, tweeting that if authorities don\u2019t \u201cface up and explain [what happened] to families of prisoners, there will be another right, but of distressed families.\u201d The riots broke out on the same night that Colombia confirmed its first death as a result of Covid-19. On Sunday morning, confirmed cases stood at 231, with two people dying from the disease. A nationwide quarantine - expanding on those currently in place in cities across the country, including Bogot\u00e1 - will come into effect at midnight on Tuesday. Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said at a press conference that \u201cLife shouldn\u2019t feel normal right now, so if your life still feels entirely normal, ask yourself if you are doing the right things\u201d She also said that people shouldn\u2019t go shopping except for essentials or gather at parties, celebrations or weddings. She said that gathering together in the park or at the beach should be avoided, because this is almost as dangerous as going to the pub. Mozambique has confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus - a 75-year-old man who had recently returned from Britain, health minister Armindo Tiago said on Sunday. The man returned to the country mid-March, Tiago told journalists. The death toll in the northern region of Lombardy, which has borne the brunt of Italy\u2019s virus outbreak, has risen by around 360 in a day to more than 3,450, a source has told Reuters. The number of cases in the region, which includes Italy\u2019s financial capital Milan, has increased by around 2,590 to more than 28,370. However, a number of results were still awaiting confirmation and it was not clear if they would be added later. Sunday\u2019s figures represented an improvement on Saturday, when the death toll in the region rose by 546 and new cases increased by 3,251. The national death toll is due to be released later on Sunday. The tally stood at 4,825 on Saturday - the highest in the world. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said his government would ask parliament to extend for another 15 days until April 11 a state of emergency it imposed this month to try to curb the spread of the virus. The nationwide state of emergency was first announced on March 14 and it bars people in the nation of around 46 million people from leaving home except for essential outings like buying food or seeking medical care. Sanchez said the request to extend the state of emergency would be approved by his cabinet on Tuesday and he was confident the assembly would approve it. \u201cI know that is a drastic measure... but experts agree that it is an effective measure in the fight against coronavirus,\u201d he told a news conference after holding talks via video conference with the heads of Spain\u2019s regional governments. The announcement comes after Spain announced 394 new deaths caused by the pandemic, raising to 1,720 the official death toll in Europe\u2019s worst-hit country after Italy, a 30 percent increase over the previous day. The number of confirmed cases of the disease rose by 3,646, or 14.6 percent, to 28,572, according to health ministry figures, straining Spain\u2019s health care system. Sanchez has said his country\u2019s situation was now the most difficult since the 1936-39 civil war, and he warned that the outbreak would worsen. \u201cWe must prepare ourselves emotionally and psychologically for very hard days ahead,\u201d he told the nation in a televised address late on Saturday. A French doctor has died from coronavirus, the first medic to succumb in the country, health minister Olivier Veran has said. The minister paid tribute to all front-line medical staff and urged other workers to keep essential services running despite the nationwide lockdown. \u201cThe medical profession is making a heavy sacrifice in our country today,\u201d Veran told LCI television. The doctor who died was an emergency specialist working at a hospital in Compiegne, north of Paris, public television reported, citing a Facebook post by one of his children. \u201cWe\u2019re asking citizens to continue mobilising to keep our economy working,\u201d Veran said. \u201cNot for the sake of economic objectives or budgets, but because a single missing link can bring down the entire production system.\u201d France\u2019s death toll rose by 112 to 562 on Saturday, according to health ministry numbers, while the number of confirmed cases increased 15% to 14,459 in 24 hours. The government may also roll out a tax-free coronavirus \u201cattendance bonus\u201d for people who need to be at their workplace to carry out their jobs, officials have said. Dubai carrier Emirates has reversed a previous announcement suspending all passenger flights, saying it is going to continue flying to 13 destinations, including the the U.S., the UK, Japan, Australia and Canada. The company said Sunday that the decision comes after receiving requests from governments and customers to support the repatriation of travellers. Hours earlier, Emirates said it was suspending all passenger flights starting Wednesday. Cambodia has reported 31 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, 29 of them among French tourists, bringing the total number of infections recorded in the Southeast Asian country to 84, the health ministry said in a statement. The statement said the two Cambodians who were infected had been tour guides accompanying the tourists. All were now being kept in isolation in a hotel in the beach city of Sihanoukville, the statement said. The Canadian death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped almost 50% percent to 19 in less than a day, according to official figures released by the federal government on Sunday. Ottawa said late on Saturday that 13 people had died from the respiratory illness caused by the virus, but by 9 a.m. ET (1300 GMT) on Sunday that number had grown to 19. The number of confirmed cases rose to 1,302 from 1,099, with a further 69 people listed as probably suffering from the highly contagious virus. Canada has already closed its borders to all but essential travel, announced a C$27 billion aid package for the most affected by the health crisis and is urging people to practice self-isolation. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said on Saturday that \u201cCanadians need to understand this isn\u2019t about two weeks of social distancing. This is about months of social distancing.\u201d Nova Scotia on Sunday became the latest of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces to declare a state of emergency, closing its borders to non-residents and threatening to arrest those who did not practice self-distancing. Premier Stephen McNeil told a news conference that despite warnings to avoid meeting in large groups, people were flocking to provincial parks and other common areas. \u201cWe are dealing with a deadly virus and this behavior is unacceptable,\u201d he said. Saudi Arabia has reported a jump in coronavirus cases. Saudi Health Ministry spokesman Mohammed Abdelali said the kingdom recorded 119 new cases, raising the total number to 511, the highest to date in the Gulf Arab region. The tally of cases in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council now stands at more than 1,700. Jos\u00e9 Ameal Pe\u00f1a was just four years old when the 1918 flu tore through his small fishing town in northern Spain, its deadly path narrated by the daily ringing of church bells. More than a century later, Ameal Pe\u00f1a \u2013 believed to be Spain\u2019s only living survivor of a pandemic described to be the deadliest in human history \u2013 has a warning as the world faces off against Covid-19: \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the same thing repeated, it claimed so many lives.\u201d The 1918 flu, known as the Spanish flu after the country\u2019s press were among the first to report on it, killed between 50 and 100 million people around the world. In Ameal Pe\u00f1a\u2019s town of Luarca, it claimed some 500 lives, or a quarter of the town\u2019s 2,000 residents. He watched from his window as a steady stream of funeral processions made their way to the local cemetery. In autumn 1918, he became the only one out of his seven siblings to catch the flu. \u201cI still can\u2019t figure out how I\u2019m here,\u201d he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo. \u201cWhen I woke up, I could barely walk. I had to crawl on my hands and knees.\u201d As he wrestled with a relentless fever, a local doctor prescribed vapours of boiled eucalyptus and seaweed. In recent weeks, he\u2019s watched anxiously as another pandemic tightens its grip on the world. Spain has emerged as one of Europe\u2019s hardest-hit by the coronavirus, with 1,720 people killed. \u201cHe knows exactly what is happening with the coronavirus,\u201d his daughter Anunciata told El Mundo. \u201cSince he lived through all that, he\u2019s having a hard time now. He\u2019s afraid that something similar will happen again, even though we\u2019re living in very different times.\u201d While the fear unleashed by both pandemics is similar, this time the battle is unfolding against a backdrop of scientific advances, allowing the virus to be isolated, antiviral drugs to be tested and complex medical treatments to be carried out. Across the Atlantic, another survivor of the 1918 flu, 107-year-old Joe Newman, offered his perspective. \u201cThere are those of us who say, well, this too shall go away. And it will,\u201d the resident of Sarasota, Florida told NBC news. \u201cBut at what cost, at what expense?\u201d Newman urged people to lean on each other for support. \u201cYou have to be my crutch. I have to be yours. It\u2019s been that way through every crisis we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we find \u2013 when we do look back \u2013 that is what got us through it.\u201d One of the world\u2019s biggest airlines, Emirates, said it was suspending all passenger flights starting Wednesday. It\u2019s a pivotal move that reflects the dramatic slowdown in traffic through the airline\u2019s hub in Dubai, the world\u2019s busiest international airport, due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus. The state-owned carrier stressed in a statement on Sunday it will continue to operate cargo flights through its fleet of Boeing 777 freighters for the transport of essential goods, including medical supplies across the world. It also said the company would reduce salaries for the majority of its employees for three months, but will not cut jobs. 23 new cases of the virus have been confirmed in Singapore. 18 of the cases had recently travelled to Europe, North America, South America and ASEAN countries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update. Nine of the cases had travelled to the UK and three to the US. Singapore confirmed its first deaths yesterday. A 75-year-old Singaporean woman and 64-year-old Indonesian man. During his weekly Sunday blessing, Pope Francis urged all Christians to join in reciting the Our Father prayer on Wednesday at noon. \u201cTo the virus pandemic, we want to respond with the universality of prayer, of compassion, of tenderness\u201d, the pope said. Francis, who began streaming his audiences online earlier this month due to virus concerns, said he would also lead a global blessing to an empty St. Peters Square on Friday. The Urbi et Orbi, blessing is normally reserved for Christmas Day and Easter. Waitrose and John Lewis have outlined measures that will be in place from tomorrow to support NHS workers: All Waitrose shops will protect a proportion of deliveries of \u2018hard to find\u2019 and essential stock exclusively for NHS workers to ensure they have better opportunity to access basic shopping items at all times of the day.A proportion of deliveries NHS staff will receive priority checkout treatment in all Waitrose supermarkets either through a dedicated till or moved to the front of the queue John Lewis is donating comfort items and Easter gift food to local hospitals, to support workers Berangere Michel, Executive Director for Customer Service at the John Lewis Partnership, said: \u201cThrough these steps we want to recognise the tireless work of NHS staff, supporting us all through these unprecedented circumstances. We hope these measures make their life a little easier; our Partners are keen to do something to help, and we are offering this with sincere thanks from us all.\u201d These new measures follow steps outlined by the John Lewis Partnership earlier this week to support customers, including the launch of a \u00a31million Community Support Fund to help local communities along with a protected shopping hour for the elderly and vulnerable. Many Waitrose shops have already been using their community funds to assemble care packages of essential items for vulnerable or elderly people in the local community. Greece\u2019s centre right government is hours away from announcing further restrictive measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus with media reports saying the latest clampdown on movement will likely take the form of a curfew. starting either tonight or tomorrow morning. News sites reported that prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to announce the emergency measure in a TV address at 6pm local time. The step follows alarm at the number of citizens still flouting regulations enforced as part of gradual lockdown to halt transmissions of the virus. On Saturday Greeks could be seen flocking to beaches along the Athenian riviera despite repeated government entreaties for people to remain at home. A mass exodus of Greeks from Athens, and other urban areas, to villages in the countryside has also caused consternation. As of Saturday afternoon, when the latest health ministry figures were announced, authorities had confirmed 530 cases of coronavirus and 13 fatalities - with the exception of one, all men. Mitsotakis and other officials have repeatedly warned that the coming weeks are critical in containing the disease. Addressing reporters last night, the deputy civil protection minister Nikos Hardalias felt fit to remind Greeks that Italy, the country worst hit in Europe by Covid-19, had recorded the same number of coronavirus cases and deaths 24 days ago. Officials fear that Greece\u2019s health system - savaged by years of budget cuts during the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis - is far from ready to deal with a sudden surge in numbers requiring immediate hospitalisation. That, and the country\u2019s proximity to Italy, played a central role in the government taking a tough stance from the outset announcing measures that included the closure of schools early on. Afghanistan has announced its first Coronavirus death. The Health Ministry confirmed that the patient, who was 40 years old, died three days ago in northern Balkh province and the result of his coronavirus test arrived today. Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the Health Ministry said the body was transferred to a Taliban controlled area [by his relatives] and buried there. Another suspected patient died today in western Herat province. The coronavirus test result will arrive tomorrow. Herat neighbours Iran and is the most affected city with 18 positive cases so far. Afghanistan has reported 34 coronavirus cases so far, 10 in last 24 hours. Testing remains low and experts fear the full extent of the spread is not known. With as many as 15,000 people arriving daily from Iran, one of the worst-hit countries, Afghanistan remains vulnerable to the spread. Fox News reports that the New York City Police Department is dealing with a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. According to NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, over 50 police officers have tested positive for the virus, but only one has been hospitalised. The 1st Precinct in Manhattan is the hardest hit, with 31 officers (17 percent of the workforce) calling in sick, forcing the NYPD to call the Movie and Television Unit to fill in. The police union says that the NYPD has failed to provide adequate protective equipment for officers or cleaning supplies. In the space of less than 24 hours on Sunday, India amped up its drastic measures to try and stop the spread of coronavirus, as the number of cases rose to 341 and the death toll reached seven. From 7am to 9pm, a nationwide \u201cpeople\u2019s curfew\u201d was imposed to clear the streets. It was then announced that all train operations in India would be suspended until at least 31 March, a move which will impact the 23 million passengers who rely on India\u2019s railways every day. The capital city of Delhi, which has now reported six cases of coronavirus which were locally transmitted, will also be locked down from 6am on Monday until at least 31 March, with the state borders sealed, all public transport and non-essential businesses closed and taxis and rickshaws ordered off the roads. Lockdowns were imposed in 75 districts across the country and in Goa the curfew was extended until Wednesday. The first two cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the Gaza Strip last night in individuals who had come from Pakistan. An outbreak could wreak havoc on the Palestinian territory, which is home to over 2 million people, many living in cramped cities and refugee camps. There are similar concerns about a catastrophe if the virus turns up in war-torn Syria, Libya or Yemen. Abdelnasser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization\u2019s Gaza office, said the territory only has 62 ventilators, with all but 15 already in use. He estimates the territory needs 50 to 100 more to address an outbreak. With its current capacity, he estimated Gaza\u2019s hospitals can handle the first 100 cases if they come in gradually. If there is a spread to hundreds, this will cause a challenge to the health care system,\u201d he said. Hundreds of Gazans have returned home in the past two weeks, but only 92 people have been examined, highlighting the territory\u2019s limited testing capacity. More than 1,270 people have been quarantined at hospitals, hotels and schools after crossing into Gaza from Israel and Egypt, according to the Health Ministry. The coronavirus economic relief bill being finalised in the US Congress will include a one-time $3,000 payment for families and allow the Federal Reserve to leverage up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the nation\u2019s economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said today. Mnuchin, speaking in an interview on the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d television program, said the additional liquidity measures for the U.S. central bank aims to help a broad base of U.S. businesses to get through next 90 to 120 days. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Netherlands rose by 573, or nearly 16%, to 4,204, Dutch health authorities said in a daily update on Sunday. The death toll in the Netherlands rose by 43 to 179, with victims aged between 57 and 97. The Chinese billionaire founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba has sent coronavirus supplies to Africa. Jack Ma sent a cargo flight from Guangzhou in China containing more than 6m medical items, which arrived today in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa. The supplies will be distributed to African countries in need of resources to battle the virus. According to Ethiopian officials and the Jack Ma Foundation, the plane carried 5.4m face masks, 1.08m testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields. Ma has sent similar shipments of medical supplies to countries in Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America. The virus has been slow to reach Africa but has now spread to at least 42 of the continent\u2019s 54 countries. Independent.ie has reported that hospitals in Ireland are braced for a new wave of cases after at least 14 patients in an Irish care home in Leinster tested positive for the virus. Covid-19 is believed to have been transmitted to residents via a health worker. The Welsh government has just tweeted reminding everyone to avoid all but essential travel and suggesting stronger measures will be brought in if people ignore the advice. We\u2019ve now got a live blog up and running focusing on UK coronavirus developments. Head over here to check it out. Meanwhile I\u2019ll be continuing to bring you the major headlines and updates from around the world. Boris Johnson has tweeted asking everyone to stay at home and not visit vulnerable mums in person this Mother\u2019s Day. Paul Reid, Ireland\u2019s top health service official, has said huge orders have been placed for coronavirus testing equipment and protective gear for staff. A total of 11m masks, 1m face shields and 1m goggles for workers are on order. Another 400,000 gowns and suits are also being purchased. Almost 40,000 sample test kits are being distributed. Another 20,000 will be in Ireland by Wednesday, the health service said. The Irish Republic is at an advanced stage of negotiations with China to secure a further 100,000 and good progress is being made, it said. The worldwide nature of the coronavirus pandemic means there is a lot of competition to secure supplies. On Saturday night, 177 people were in Irish hospitals with coronavirus, up from 151 on Saturday morning. Ireland usually spends \u20ac15m a year on personal protective equipment, the health service said. Its bill since January has already hit \u20ac60m. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the US was responsible for sending coronavirus to Iran, therefore making it impossible to accept any American help to fight the virus there. Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help. \u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran. The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim. Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising. The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered. The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising. Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently. The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished. The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus. Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds. Stay at home or else you\u2019re the next person.\u201d The death toll in Spain has climbed to 1,720 \u2013 with 394 lives claimed in the past day \u2013 as the country\u2019s prime minister warned that the \u201cworst is yet to come\u201d and announced plans to extend the country\u2019s near-total lockdown until the 12 of April. Across Spain, the number of confirmed cases sits at 28,572, according to the latest data from the health ministry. In the span of a few weeks, Spain has emerged as one of the hardest-hit countries in the global pandemic. After the first full week of near-total lockdown, the country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, reportedly told regional leaders he would aim to get parliamentary approval to extend the emergency measures for another 15 days. The extension comes after S\u00e1nchez warned that the toughest days of the crisis still lie ahead. \u201cUnfortunately, the worst is to come,\u201d Pedro S\u00e1nchez said on Saturday. \u201cWe have yet to feel the impact of the hardest, most damaging wave, one that will test the limits of our moral and material capacity, as well as our spirit as a society.\u201d A cacophony of sound preceded his address to the nation, as some banged pots and pans to show their dissatisfaction with how his government has managed the crisis. Healthcare workers on the frontlines have described a healthcare system pushed to the brink, with intensive care patients outstripping capacity in some hospitals and workers forced to use garbage bags as hospital gowns amid a shortage of protective gear. \u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d one doctor at Madrid\u2019s La Paz Hospital told the Guardian. The government said it had distributed more than million masks and was working on a plan to domestically produce protective gear. As the call for expanded testing grows, S\u00e1nchez said the government had acquired more than 640,000 tests and had already begun handing them out. On Sunday, paramedics in Madrid began transferring patients to a field hospital set up in Madrid\u2019s main exhibition hall, in a bid to relieve pressure on the city\u2019s most overwhelmed hospitals. The makeshift hospital, mounted in the past days by the military, can be expanded to hold as many as 5,500 patients. Croatia\u2019s capital Zagreb was shaken by a series of earthquakes this morning that brought most of the population out onto the streets, just as social distancing regulations to prevent the spread of coronavirus had gone into place. The ill-timed quakes, the largest of which measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, have left one child in critical condition and damaged buildings across Zagreb, including the spire of the city\u2019s main cathedral. The epicentre was about four miles north of Zagreb. Photographs showed damage to a hospital in the capital, just as the country\u2019s health system was gearing up for a potential surge in coronavirus cases. Mothers cradled their newborns on the street as a maternity ward was evacuated. Croatian authorities on Saturday advised residents to stay off the streets, cut most public transport and demanded people pay heed to social distancing recommendations. The country has recorded 206 cases of coronavirus so far and one death. Croatia\u2019s interior minister Davor Bo\u017einovi\u0107 said on Sunday that the army was helping to clear up the rubble in Zagreb. He said authorities were working to manage both crises, but said the coronavirus was a more serious threat to the country than the earthquake. He urged those on the streets due to the earthquake to maintain social distancing norms. A Tesco in Lewes that opened one hour early for NHS workers at 9am this morning reportedly let others in because of long queues outside and did not open the tills until 10am, meaning that shoppers were packed together in close quarters. The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths in Spain has risen by almost 400, or 30%, in 24 hours, as the government is reported to be extending its state of emergency by another 15 days. As well as 394 new deaths, the country reported the number of confirmed cases has risen by 3,646 (15%) from 24,926 to 28,572. In Iran, the death toll rose has risen by 129 (8%) to 1,685 over the past day, and the number of cases has risen by 1,028 (5%) to 21,638. In Germany, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen by 1,948 (12%) to 18,610, and the number of deaths has increased by nine (20%) to 55, the country\u2019s public health institute said. Indonesia has confirmed 10 new deaths from Covid-19 and 64 new cases, taking the respective totals to 48 and 514. On Saturday, Indonesia reported six deaths and 81 new cases.The south-east Asian country has turned its athletes village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital. The number of deaths in Wales of patients who tested positive for coronavirus has more than doubled, from five to 12, the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said. Colombia, Guam Kosovo and Romania each reported their first death, with the fatality in Guam, the first in the Pacific region. Palestinian officials reported the first two cases in the Gaza strip. The UK government has refused to dismiss the idea of an Italian-style lockdown if needed to curb the further spread of the virus, amid reports that many people were out enjoying the weather on Saturday and not practising social distancing. The government is to write to 1.5m people perceived as vulnerable due to underlying health conditions, urging them to stay indoors for 12 weeks. A group of almost 4,000 NHS workers in the UK have pleaded with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to ensure they have adequate protective equipment to deal with the coronavirus crisis.In an open letter to The Sunday Times, the medics have called on Johnson to \u201cprotect the lives of the life-savers\u201d and resolve the \u201cunacceptable\u201d shortage of protective equipment. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced wide ranging restrictions on businesses but has said schools will remain open. Among those affected will be clubs, hotels, pubs, entertainment venues, indoor supporting venues and places of worship. Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway only. The Russian military is sending medical help to Italy from today, including mobile disinfection vehicles and medical specialists. Malaysia has sent the army to the streets to enforce restrictions which people appear to be defying. The country has one of the highest rates of infection in Southeast Asia. China is diverting all Beijing-bound international flights to other airports for checks before allowing them to continue. Singapore has banned the entry and transit of all foreigners, except those with work permits in essential services. Hawaii has become the first US state to require 14 days quarantine for all arrivals. India has imposed a curfew from 7am to 9pm Delhi time. The Italian PM ordered businesses to close all operations. More than 50,000 people queued to see the Olympic flame in northeast Japan. Meanwhile Olympic officials are reportedly workshopping delaying the games despite the Japanese government\u2019s insistence it go ahead. Employers in Scotland have been urged to give paid leave to all members of staff who volunteer as special constables to help Police Scotland cope with the coronavirus pandemic. The force said it faced \u201cunprecedented challenges to maintain policing while managing rising levels of sickness and self-isolation among officers and staff.\u201d It has asked special constables, who have the same powers as regular police officers, to increase their hours volunteering over the next three months and written to their employers asking them to support them. Police Scotland launched a new recruitment campaign on 3 February this year after a sharp decline in special constable numbers, partly because 500 specials became full time officers. Figures given to BBC Scotland after a freedom of information request showed a 62% fall since the unitary force was formed in 2013, down from 1,391 that year to 517 in 2019. Malcolm Graham, a Police Scotland deputy chief constable, said in a statement: \u201cThis is an extraordinary moment and one that requires a collective response. It is a moment when the ethos of the Special Constabulary \u2013 supporting Scottish communities and local policing - has never been more relevant. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is presenting an unprecedented and dynamic set of challenges and, to support health professionals and maximise public safety, the policing response is crucial. \u201cThe coming weeks and months will be demanding and there will be significant additional duties that we are required to discharge during this critical period. To support our overall response, we would like to include our valued special constables in our resourcing plans.\u201d Tourists are being urged to stay at home and not visit some of the remote communities in the Scottish Highlands in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. Scotland\u2019s Tourism Secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said: \u201cMy advice to everybody is stay where you are. Do not travel to the Highlands and Islands.\u201d The pleas came as the organisation that represents tourism businesses along the A830 road, which connects Fort William with Mallaig, also urged visitors to stay away. The Road To The Isles group includes 100 accommodation and visitor-based businesses on the scenic route, which takes in Glenfinnan, Lochailort, Roshven, Arisaig, Morar, Mallaig and the Small Isles of Eigg, Muck, Rum, Canna and the Knoydart peninsula. The area already has an ageing population, with just one doctor and ambulance to cover it, and the nearest hospital is 100 miles away. Thanks to Haroon for covering the blog this morning. This is Hannah Mays signing on. An 82-year old man who died in hospital in Kosovo on Sunday is the country\u2019s first victim of the coronavirus, the Kosovo Public Health Institute said in a statement. \u201cPatient already had chronic illness, cardio and pulmonary,\u201d the institute said, according to Reuters. Kosovo, a country of 2 million people, has registered 31 cases of people infected with coronavirus. This is my last post, I am now handing over to my colleague Hannah Mays. The number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Spain has risen by almost 400 - 30% - to 1,720 in the last day, Spanish media are reporting. As well as the 394 deaths, the number of confirmed cases has reportedly risen by 3,646 (15%) from 24,926 to 28,572. The government is reportedly extending the 15-day state of emergency imposed on 14 March by another 15 days. Croatia\u2019s capital Zagreb was shaken by a series of earthquakes this morning that brought most of the population out onto the streets, just as social distancing regulations to prevent the spread of coronavirus had gone into place.

He urged those on the streets due to the earthquake to maintain social distancing norms. Albania has said it will suspend all commercial flights to and from the country from midnight, allowing only flag carrier Air Albania to fly to Turkey and operate humanitarian flights, the government and airport operator said. The government had already cut all air and sea links with Italy, now the worst-hit country and home to 400,000 Albanians, after its first coronavirus case arrived from Italy a fortnight ago along with 120,000 returning Albanians. There have been 76 coronavirus cases in Albania and two deaths. We have had lots of people get in touch about lack of social distancing in the UK, with people going out in the sunny weather. A reader from the Lake District - a popular holiday destination in north-west England - did not want to be named but said: People are escaping to the countryside for days out as normal. The National Trust shut all its properties, but kept the outdoor places open for people to exercise. They had to reverse this decision overnight as thousands of tourists saw the sunny weather as an opportunity to have a day out. Many of the properties where busier that a normal bank holiday weekend. This is just not acceptable. The rural areas just can\u2019t cope with this kinds of influx of visitors at this time. Our healthcare system in the Lakes is only meant for the 500,000 permanent residents. It\u2019s already being overwhelmed. The local community is trying its best to get the message across that we aren\u2019t welcoming visitors at the moment, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to be working. We are overrun. Car parks have turned into campsites, and our small local co-ops are now empty as they can\u2019t keep up with demand from tourists. All the holiday cottages and second homes are full. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced restrictions on businesses but has said schools will remain open. In a press conference, which is ongoing - you can follow it on our dedicated Australia live blog - he said that Australians had been disregarding advice on social distancing. In response, he announced that from tomorrow at midday, the following businesses will be closed or restricted in their trade: Registered and licensed clubs Licensed premises in hotels and pubs. Entertainment venues and cinemas, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will be restrict to takeaway only. Indoor sporting venues. Places of worship. Enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four square metre rule which will be enforced. Hong Kong has reported 44 more cases confirmed over the past 24 hours, the city\u2019s second highest daily increase to date, RTHK reports. The highest daily toll to date was the 48 confirmed on Friday. The total number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong now stands at 317. Out of the 44 new cases, 29 had recently come back to Hong Kong from abroad, including nine students who had just returned to Hong Kong, RTHK says. NHS nurses are being made to use various items they can find \u2013 including bin bags \u2013 in the hospital to help protect themselves, with many using plastic aprons over their head, buying wellies or wrapping clinical waste bags around their feet. One nurse, who did not wish to be named, said: Widespread nurses are making their own PPE [personal protective equipment]. I know friends I trained with doing the same. We have to protect ourselves, some of us have children and babies. We are trying to help people but have to protect families. I don\u2019t know why we are not getting PPE. She added: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about money but management. Some third world countries are dealing properly with this pandemic but we are not. We are doing our best - really doing our best but in terms of the equipment needed to help patients they are failing. Ventilators, for example. If we have unwell patients but no ITU [intensive treatment unit] capacity we can\u2019t do much. Nurses in the Royal Free hospital in north London have been tying clinical waste bags around their legs, the Guardian has been told. In North Middlesex hospital they have been tying plastic aprons around their heads. A further seven patients in Wales who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total to 12, the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, has said. Iran has also issued its latest figures, which show the death toll has risen to 1,685, an increase of 129 in 24 hours, and the number of cases has risen by 1,028 to 21,638. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen by 1,948 to 18,610, and the number of deaths has increased by nine to 55, the country\u2019s public health institute has said. Covid-19 could pose a threat to Africa\u2019s endangered mountain gorilla, conservationists have warned. From AP: Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park, home to about a third of the world\u2019s mountain gorillas, is barring visitors until 1 June, citing advice from scientific experts indicating that primates, including mountain gorillas, are likely susceptible to complications arising from the Covid-19 virus. Neighboring Rwanda also is temporarily shutting down tourism and research activities in three national parks that are home to primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees. Mountain gorillas are prone to some respiratory illnesses that afflict humans. A common cold can kill a gorilla, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, one reason why tourists tracking gorillas are not normally permitted to get too close. Paula Kahumbu, chief executive of the Kenya-based conservation group WildlifeDirect, told The Associated Press that every possible effort must be made to protect mountain gorillas because so few are left in the wild. She said: We know that gorillas are very sensitive to human diseases. If anyone has a cold or a flu they are not allowed to go and see the gorillas. With coronavirus having such a long time of no symptoms in some cases, it means that we could actually put those gorillas at risk. Even existing measures may not be enough to protect them. A UK pet shop chain, Pets At Home, has been criticised for claiming key worker status for its staff. Schools in the UK have closed but children of those classified as key workers are still allowed to attend. A letter from Pets At Home tells schools to contact their legal department in case of questions. The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers has responded: The UK communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has reiterated government warnings for people to maintain social distancing, refusing to dismiss the idea of an Italian-style lockdown if needed to curb the further spread of the virus. He told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We want to continue in a free society. But this isn\u2019t a game, people need to follow the advice. Discussing a plan announced overnight to write to 1.5m people perceived as vulnerable due to underlying health conditions, urging them to stay indoors for 12 weeks, with provision for care packages to be sent to them, Jenrick said these people could remain with other household members, saying he is \u201cnot expecting families to be broken up\u201d. Jenrick said that while people should stay healthy and go out for exercise, he said they should not pack together in parks, and stay physically apart from people Failure to follow the advice could see the NHS overwhelmed, he warned, even with measures to increase critical care capacity: We\u2019re doing all the things we can, but let\u2019s be clear, the numbers are rising, we need to follow the advice of healthcare professions. Indonesia has confirmed 10 new deaths from Covid-19 and 64 new cases, taking the respective totals to 48 and 514. On Saturday, Indonesia reported six deaths and 81 new cases. The south-east Asian country has turned its athletes village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital with a capacity to hold more than 4,000 patients, it announced earlier today. A group of almost 4,000 NHS workers in the UK have pleaded with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to ensure they have adequate protective equipment to deal with the coronavirus crisis. In an open letter to The Sunday Times, the medics have called on Johnson to \u201cprotect the lives of the life-savers\u201d and resolve the \u201cunacceptable\u201d shortage of protective equipment. The group said many medical workers are \u201cputting their lives on the line every day\u201d by treating coronavirus patients without appropriate protection, and they called on the prime minister to ensure an adequate supply of masks, safety glasses, gloves, aprons and protective suits. The letter, signed by 3,963 front-line NHS staff, reads: Front-line doctors have been telling us for weeks that they do not feel safe at work. Intensive care doctors and anaesthetists have told us they have been carrying out the highest-risk procedure, putting a patient on a ventilator, with masks that expired in 2015. The letter adds that paediatricians have warned their stocks of protective glasses would run out in 48 hours, including in special-care baby units. One acute care worker reported one NHS trust had run out of its stock of masks last weekend, the letter said. It continued: GPs have told us they feel abandoned; many have been left without any protection for weeks and do not even have simple masks to protect them if a patient comes in with symptoms of Covid-19. The group also said ambulance workers had been arriving for shifts to find no hand sanitiser, masks or wipes were available. Iran\u2019s supreme leader has today refused US humanitarian assistance to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Washington has offered to help Iran while refusing to lift crushing sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: Possibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more, Khamenei said. Or if you send therapists and doctors, maybe he wants to see the effect of the poison, since it is said that part of the virus is built for Iran. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei\u2019s comments. Earlier this month, Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted that it might be US army who brought the epidemic - described by Donald Trump as the Chinese virus - to Wuhan. Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Iran has over 20,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,556 reported deaths. Romania has today confirmed its first death in the due to coronavirus, Reuters reports. The deceased was a 67-year-old man who had been suffering from terminal cancer, the government said. He was confirmed to be infected with coronavirus on 18 March and was being treated in a hospital in the southern Romanian city of Craiova. Romania, which has recorded 367 cases of coronavirus to date, declared a state of emergency on 16 March.

Four out of 10 towers in the Athlete\u2019s Village, located in the country\u2019s capital city, have been converted into a medical facility that would house more than 7,000 people, including a coronavirus task force, medical staff and up to 4,208 patients. \u201cThe ministry of state-owned enterprises will provide supplies for the emergency hospital to handle COVID-19, be it healthcare equipment, medicine, personal protection gear and masks,\u201d the minister of state-owned enterprises, Erick Thohir, said in a statement. On Saturday, Indonesia confirmed 81 new cases and 6 more deaths due to the virus, bringing the total number of cases to 450 and deaths to 38. Indonesia has the highest coronavirus death toll in Southeast Asia. From Reuters: Malaysia has deployed the army to enforce a two-week curb on travel in a country that has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia, most of them linked to a mass religious gathering. The country has so far reported nine deaths and 1,183 infections. Southeast Asia has recorded a total of more than 3,200 positive cases, with the other big centres being Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines. Malaysia called in the army after some people continued to defy the restrictions that came into force on Wednesday, the defence minister said in a briefing after the deployment started at noon. \u201cEven though police have said 90% compliance now, 10% is not a small number,\u201d Ismail Sabri Yaakob said. \u201cAmong the things that will be done jointly by the police and army include road blocks. Likewise for patrols in urban and rural areas, maintaining security at hospitals, managing areas that are congested and may not abide by the order such as markets.\u201d A four-day Islamic gathering held at a mosque near the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is connected to 60% of all the cases in the country, whose tally is only behind those of China and South Korea in Asia. Worshippers who attended the event are cooperating with authorities, an organiser said in a statement, after the government said on Thursday that it had yet to trace 4,000 of the 14,500 Malaysian residents who attended. The health ministry said on Saturday it expected the number of cases to spike next week as it tried to track down unscreened participants of the Feb. 27-March 1 congregation. \u201cAfter hearing reports of thousands or participants yet to be screened, many had returned to their district health departments or hospitals repeatedly until their names and details were recorded,\u201d Abdullah Cheong, a leader of the event\u2019s organising team, said on Saturday. \u201cWe are prepared and have given our full commitment to help the authorities deal with the pandemic.\u201d He also said 12,500 people attended the gathering, including foreigners and 200 Rohingya refugees. The government has put the number at 16,000. From my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Afghanistan. Afghanistan has reported 10 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours raising the total cases to 34. Two foreign diplomats are included. The health ministry said in a press conference in Kabul that the diplomats were infected by the coronavirus while abroad. They were not identified publicly. He also asked authorities to quarantine the western city of Herat, which neighbours Iran and is the most affected city in the country. 18 of the 34 cases were found in Herat, and concerns are high, with thousands of Afghans crossing the border each day from Iran. The Russian military will start sending medical help to Italy from Sunday in order to help it battle the new coronavirus after receiving an order from President Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry said in a statement. Putin spoke to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday, the Kremlin said, saying the Russian leader had offered his support and help in the form of mobile disinfection vehicles and specialists to help the worst hit Italian regions. Italy recorded a jump in deaths from coronavirus of almost 800 on Saturday, taking the toll in the world\u2019s hardest-hit country to almost 5,000. The Russian Defence Ministry said military transport planes would deliver eight mobile brigades of military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy starting from Sunday. Russia itself has reported 306 cases of the virus, most of them in Moscow, and one coronavirus-related death. China\u2019s aviation regulator said on Sunday that all international flights due to arrive in Beijing would be diverted to other airports as their first port of entry beginning on Monday, as the country steps up measures to battle the coronavirus. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said incoming international flights to Beijing would land at one of 12 other designated airports, where passengers would be screened. Passengers who were cleared would then be permitted to reboard the plane, which would take them on to Beijing, it said. More than 50,000 people queued to see the Olympic flame in northeastern Japan on Saturday. Honestly. Some people stood in the 500m queue for hours, according to local media. The flame arrived in Japan to a scaled-down welcoming ceremony on Friday as doubts grew over whether the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will go ahead on schedule as the deadly virus causes chaos around the world. It was displayed at Sendai station in Miyagi, chosen as part of the \u201cRecovery Olympics\u201d to showcase the region\u2019s revival after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. The pandemic has already shredded the global sports calendar, with top sports leagues suspended and major tournaments postponed. A brilliant visualisation of how and why isolation and distancing is so important to stop people dying. Another Australian state is effectively closing its borders by requiring all entrants to undergo 14 days quarantine. The Western Australian border will close at 1.30pm Tuesday, at the same time as South Australia and the Northern Territory. The WA police commissioner Chis Dawson indicated that self-isolation would occur at the point of arrival. Exemptions will be made for freight, essential services, and 2,500 \u201ccritical\u201d staff in the mining and oil and gas industries, who are based interstate but will be allowed to fly in. The WA government is looking to acquire hotels in order to house people who have nowhere appropriate to undergo self-isolation, or who don\u2019t want to self-isolate. Rottnest Island, a former prison turned into a tourist destination, could be appropriated for this purpose. More details on our Australia-focused live blog here. Two people are dead and six wounded in a protest at a Sri Lankan prison where guards fired on inmates to prevent them from fleeing. Prisoners at the Anuradhapura prison, about 200km from Colombo, were complaining about the decision by the authorities not to allow visitors as a move to contain the virus. Senaka Perera, president of the Committee for Protecting Rights of Prisoners, said the inmates were protesting congested conditions and the poor quality of meals after the government banned visitors for two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus. Visitors often bring home-cooked food. Sri Lanka\u2019s prisons are overcrowded, sometimes housing 5,000 inmates in a facility capable of holding 800, according to the pressure group. Tensions erupted Saturday at the prison when guards tried to control the riot, police said. In the commotion, guards opened fire to prevent inmates from fleeing, police said. Sri Lanka has imposed a three-day countrywide curfew since Friday as the number of cases has risen to 77. Netflix Inc said it will cut traffic by 25% on networks across Europe in a relief measure for internet service providers (ISPs) experiencing a surge in usage due to government \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders aimed at slowing the coronavirus outbreak. The streaming giant, which has already deployed a way to reduce its traffic on networks in Italy and Spain by a quarter, on Saturday said it would do the same for the rest of Europe in the next two days. Netflix said it will remove the highest bandwidth streams within each resolution category for the next 30 days in Europe wherein users might notice a slight decrease in video quality within each category. Amazon\u2019s Prime Video and YouTube have also committed to slowing their speeds, as has Disney+ which launches in a couple of days. Thailand reported 188 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, its largest daily increase, taking the total to 599 cases, a senior health official said. The majority of the new infections are connected to a previous cluster of cases from a boxing stadium, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a Public Health Ministry spokesman, told a news conference adding one patient had recovered. \u201cMost of the new cases were found in Bangkok and were among young people who continue to have social activities, which can lead to more infections,\u201d he said urging the public to stay home. There has been one death in Thailand. Two female nurses at a medical centre in Japan have contracted the virus, Kyodo newswire said, according to Reuters. One of the nurses was in her 20s and another in her 50s, taking the total at the facility in Oita prefecture to 14. The south-western prefecture is conducting virus tests for about 600 staff and patients who are or were hospitalised, the newswire said, with the view that they may be linked to a cluster. Japan has 1,055 domestically transmitted cases, up 40 from the previous day. The outbreak is gathering pace in Latin America. Colombia has recorded its first death late on Saturday. The victim was a 58-year-old taxi driver from the coastal city of Cartagena, the health ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month he had two Italian tourists in his taxi and two days later presented the first symptoms, the ministry said, adding the man had untreated hypertension and diabetes. The patient was first treated on 13 March and died three days later. Two tests for coronavirus came back negative, the statement said, but one was taken incorrectly. Ecuador\u2019s health and labor ministers resigned on Saturday, just hours after officials announced the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus had shot up to over 500 in the country. The government declared a state of emergency last week, prohibiting travellers from entering and imposing a night-time curfew. Singapore has just declared a raft of restrictions and bans on entrants. According to the Straits Times, Singapore will ban all short term visitors from entering or transiting, from 11.59pm Monday. The only foreigners allowed to return to Singapore will be work pass holders and their dependents, and only if they work in an essential services sector like healthcare or transport. This is a big expansion on the previous measures which allowed people (apart from a small number of countries) to go to Singapore as long as they underwent 14 days of mandatory quarantine. It follows news on Saturday of the first two deaths in Singapore from Covid-19 - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man. News America is reporting the number of Covid-19 diagnoses in the Caribbean has surpassed 400. According to the report the Dominican Republic has the highest number of people confirmed to have Covid-19, with 40 new cases reported on Saturday, bringing the total to 112. Trinidad and Tobago reported 40 new cases on Saturday, having only previously had nine. There were 10 new deaths reported across the region on Sunday. One person has died on Guadaloupe, where 56 vases have been confirmed, and one person has died on Martinique where the total number of cases is 37. It reports the only places without any cases are Belize, Grenada, Turks &amp; Caicos, Anguilla, and the British Virgin Islands. Amazon is raising overtime pay for associates working in its US warehouses as the world\u2019s largest online retailer tries to meet the rapidly growing demand for online shopping from consumers stuck at home during the coronavirus outbreak. CEO Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, said in a message posted on the company website on Saturday: \u201cMy own time and thinking is now wholly focused on Covid-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role.\u201d Hourly workers at Amazon\u2019s US warehouses will receive double pay after 40 hours for overtime, up from the 1.5-times rate, from March 15 through May 9, the rate increase announcement said. This is the second time the e-commerce giant announced an increase in pay for its workers in a week. On Monday, Amazon hiked the minimum hourly rate for associates to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders. Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they do not feel well. It has also staggered workers\u2019 shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact. At least 38 people have tested positive for coronavirus in New York City jails, including at the notorious Rikers Island jail complex, the board that oversees the city\u2019s jail system said Saturday. In the past six days the Board of Correction learned that at least 12 Department of Correction employees, five Correctional Health Services employees, and 21 inmates have tested positive for the virus. In a letter to criminal justice leaders, the board\u2019s interim chairwoman Jacqueline Sherman wrote that at least 58 other people were currently being monitored in contagious disease and quarantine units. It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff, Sherman warned, predicting a sharp rise in the number of infections. New York has consistently downplayed the number of infections, The Associated Press has found in conversations with current and former inmates. More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States more than anywhere in the world and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centres. With limited capacity nationally to test for COVID-19, men and women inside worry that they are last in line when showing flu-like symptoms, meaning that some may be infected without knowing it. The first positive tests from inside prisons and jails started tricking out just over a week ago, with less than two dozen officers and staff infected in other facilities from California and Michigan to Pennsylvania. South Australia has followed Tasmania and the Northern Territory in effectively closing its state borders, enforcing any new arrival to undergo 14 days of quarantine. South Australia, like the Northern Territory and Queensland (which closed its NT border earlier this week) has a number of remote Indigenous communities. These communities are extremely vulnerable and any outbreak would be devastating. New cases in South Korea, Mexico, Philippines South Korea reported 98 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing national infections to 8,897, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The daily increase showed a continued downward trend in new cases, despite a slight jump on Saturday. Mexican health authorities said on Saturday that there are 251 confirmed coronavirus cases in Mexico, 48 more cases than a day earlier. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry has confirmed 73 new cases, bringing the country\u2019s total to 380. India launched a 14-hour long curfew on Sunday to limit the fast-spreading coronavirus epidemic in the country, where 315 people have so far been found to have contracted the disease. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, in an address to the nation last week urged citizens to stay indoors from 7am to 9pm Delhi time - a move that he said would be a crucial test for a country to assess its abilities to fight the pandemic. \u201cLet us all be a part of this curfew, which will add tremendous strength to the fight against the Covid-19 menace,\u201d Modi tweeted minutes before the curfew commenced. \u201cThe steps we take now will help in the times to come,\u2019 he said in the tweet. Guam has reported the death of an 68-year-old woman from the Covid-19 illness, Radio New Zealand has reported. According to Dr Mike Cruz, who is leading Guam\u2019s virus response, the woman had \u201cmultiple co-morbidities\u201d, including end-stage renal disease. She was the relative of a person who returned to Guam with Covid-19. \u201cFive of the first 14 confirmed cases had recent travel, most of which is linked to the Philippines,\u201d Dr Cruz said on Sunday. \u201cThere is strong evidence that Covid-19 cases has spread throughout our community and has affected residents in the northern, central and southern villages,\u201d he added. There are 15 confirmed cases in Guam, where the government has declared a major disaster. It has more cases than any other Pacific Island nation, and the woman\u2019s death is the first in the region. From Reuters: North Korea on Saturday welcomed what it said was a letter from US president Donald Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying it was a sign of \u201cthe special and very firm personal relations\u201d between the two leaders despite recent frictions. A senior Trump administration official confirmed Trump sent the letter and said it was \u201cconsistent with his efforts to engage global leaders during the ongoing pandemic\u201d. The president looks forward to continued communications with chairman Kim, the official said. North Korea state media KCNA said Kim had received a letter from Trump in which the US president said he was impressed by the North Korean leader\u2019s efforts to defend his people from the coronavirus. Trump \u201cexpressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic,\u201d KCNA reported in a statement carried by Kim\u2019s sister, Kim Yo Jong. The report came after North Korea\u2019s missile test on Saturday, which prompted South Korea to urge an immediate halt of \u201cinappropriate action\u201d in the face of the global pandemic. For the first time in four days China has reported a new domestic case of the virus. The case is one of 46 new confirmed diagnoses in mainland China, which is the fourth straight day of an increase. A record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai, and 13 were reported in the capital Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day. As in other Asian nations which had appeared to get their outbreaks under control, China is now fearful of a second wave brought in by people coming into the country. In the Pacific island state of Hawaii, governor David Ige has just announced a mandatory 14 day quarantine period for any new arrival. It is the first US state to enact such measures. The process is much the same as that in other places - on arrival at the airport passengers must declare where they intend to self-isolate for 14 days, and go straight there. They can only leave for medical emergencies or to seek medical care. The order carries a penalty of up to $5,000 or a year in prison for any breaches. Ige says 2,500 tests have been conducted in Hawaii. On Saturday 11 new cases were reported, including two cases of community transmission. Back at the press conference with Australia\u2019s PM: There is an extraordinary story in Australia this weekend, where almost 2,700 people were allowed to disembark a cruiseship in Sydney despite several people on board testing positive. Some of those passengers have since travelled on to other places in Australia. Neither the NSW state government or the federal immigration authorities want to take responsibility for the potentially disastrous oversight. Morrison says he isn\u2019t going to get into commentary on it. \u201cOn every occasion things will not go exactly as we might like it,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are working under extreme stress, often with limited information and we are going to support those people to make the best decisions they can and the states and territories standing shoulder to shoulder with each other and the Commonwealth.\u201d Morrison is asked about the possibility of repatriation flights for Australians overseas who are trying to follow the advice to return from overseas but really can\u2019t get home. He says people stuck on cruise ships and in Peru are the most extreme examples, and says everyone should contact the department of foreign affairs and trade. \u201cThis is one of the many challenges we\u2019re working on but at this stage I\u2019m not going to advance the possibility of any [repatriation flights].\u201d From my colleague Uki Go\u00f1i in Argentina: Argentina could declare a state of siege to enforce the mandatory nationwide lockdown that started Friday, said Security Minister Sabina Frederic, amid concerns about the social effect of the spread of the coronavirus here. \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme measure that we\u2019re trying to avoid,\u201d said the minister. The number of coronavirus cases leapt to 225 Saturday, an increase of 67 cases, more than double the previous highest leap. Four deaths have been reported since the first case was detected on March 5. Not all Argentinians are obeying the enforced quarantine, however. Authorities reported 3200 arrests for violating it since it went into effect Friday. Political leaders are worried that the stoppage imposed on many sectors of the economy could lead to supermarket lootings in some poverty-stricken districts in the Greater Buenos Aires area, in a country where over a third of the population lives below the poverty line. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable thinking that looting might occur,\u201d Buenos Aires province security minister Sergio Berni told the press. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen, but we have to be prepared.\u201d The large number of arrests includes two German tourists, aged 28 and 35, who escaped isolation from a hotel in the central city of C\u00f3rdoba Tuesday. They were caught Saturday at Ezeiza international airport trying to board a plane to neighbouring Brazil. They are being held pending expulsion back to Germany. There was nonetheless some good news for Argentinians, with the announcement that all consumer bank debt, including the payment of credit card debt, has been postponed by government order. \u201cThe deadline for all debt with financial entities that fall due between March 20 and March 31, 2020, have been postponed until April 1,\u201d the Central Bank announced. The Australian government is banning all non-essential domestic travel as it unveils a A$66bn stimulus program to deal with the virus impact. It has warned of more draconian measures to come. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also flagged localised lockdowns after seeing people defy warnings and fill beaches yesterday. What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not OK. And served as a message to federal and state leaders that too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough. So the measures that we will be considering tonight means that state premiers and chief ministers may have to take far more Draconian measures to enforce social distancing particularly in areas of outbreaks than might otherwise be the case. You can get more details on this over at the Australian-focused live blog. Incredibly, people across multiple countries are still ignoring warnings to stay home. We\u2019ve seen the pictures of Australia\u2019s Bondi Beach, and we heard earlier from a UK dentist in Skegness, in Lincolnshire, warning of a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen\u201d as thousands of people flocked to his seaside town in spite of official guidance to stay at home. \u201cI view these actions as massively, massively socially irresponsible. I personally think that those involved should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said Dr Mitchell Clark. Clark joined the local police and crime commissioner in urging for local businesses to shutter their shops and for caravan parks to be closed. It appears similar things are happening in Scotland. Claudio Nardini, a takeaway shop operator at Largs on the west coast, has pleaded with people to stay home. We decided to remain open to provide a takeaway service for what I thought would be a few people grabbing the opportunity to appreciate a walk along Largs prom. Staying open a few more days also allows us to wind things down in and business sense meaning less waste and staff completing their planned shifts. I can\u2019t believe how busy the prom was. Crowds of people walking hand in hand, hugging, grandmothers holding babies, teenagers sharing drinks, elderly people galore mingling with others of all ages. Wow! Just Wow! Now, I have strong links to two other countries in Europe and have witnessed this virus develop by talking regularly to family in both Italy and Spain. This nonchalant attitude was rife in both those countries only a couple of weeks ago. ... Everyone at work today was overcome with a strange feeling of guilt, almost as if we were contributing to this madness. For this reason we have decided to completely close this evening until this whole thing blows over. An announcement not long ago pointed out it\u2019s spreading faster here than it did at this stage in both Italy or Spain. Please please please stay at home if you can, I couldn\u2019t bear seeing what is happening to my relatives happen here too. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. This is Helen Davidson here to take you through the next few hours of developments. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened recently: UK military planners drafted in to help feed vulnerable. Key military officials are to help ensure food and medicines reach vulnerable people isolated at home during the coronavirus crisis, as part of a nationwide campaign to protect more than a million people most at risk of being hospitalised. Italian PM orders businesses to close all operations. Italy\u2019s government announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential production activities\u201d across the country, after the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday. \u201cGrocery stores and pharmacies will remain open,\u201d said the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. \u201cBut all the rest of the non-essential production activities, including plants and offices, will close down.\u201d Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz dies of Covid-19.The former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz has died of coronavirus aged 76, La Liga announced on Saturday. Sanz, Real\u2019s president from 1995 to 2000, had been admitted to hospital with a fever and tested positive for the virus. Rihanna pledges $5m to curb coronavirus. Rihanna has become the latest celebrity to join the effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The singer\u2019s Clara Lionel Foundation announced on Saturday that it has donated $5million to a number of organisations responding to the outbreak. Bolivian presidential elections postponed amid coronavirus outbreak. Bolivia\u2019s interim government announced on Saturday it would postpone presidential elections originally slated for May 3 and institute a mandatory countrywide quarantine for 14 days as coronavirus spread across the Andean nation. The country\u2019s electoral authority said in a statement it would \u201csuspend the elections calendar\u201d for 14 days to match the quarantine, but did not set a new date for the vote. Britons stranded in Peru could be flown home early next week.Hundreds of Britons stranded in Peru due to the coronavirus pandemic could be flown home early next week, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said. More than 400 British and Irish citizens are believed to be in the Andean nation and have been unable to leave following a 15-day government lockdown imposed since Monday. First coronavirus cases in Gaza Strip. The first two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the densely-populated Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials said.",
