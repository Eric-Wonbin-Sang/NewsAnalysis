      "bodyText": "An Australian mother of five held in the deteriorating al-Hawl camp of northern Syria has been stripped of her citizenship \u2013 retroactive by three years \u2013 leaving two of her children potentially stateless and potentially permanently splitting her family. The woman, who held Australian and Lebanese citizenship, was informed by letter this week her citizenship has been extinguished, backdated more than three years. Three of her children were born in Australia and retain Australian citizenship: her two youngest children, born in Syria, are not able to claim Lebanese citizenship (which is passed through paternity) and have no documents to prove their nationality. Under international law, it is illegal for Australia, or any country, to make any person stateless. The children\u2019s father, a former Isis fighter, is currently being held in a Kurdish prison. He also held dual Australian and Lebanese citizenship, but has since been stripped of his Australian nationality. The Australian Department of Home Affairs, while declining to comment on the individual case, said it \u201ctakes seriously its international obligations in relation to the rights and protection of children\u201d. \u201cThere is no consequential loss of citizenship for a child if their parent loses their Australian citizenship. \u201cA child born outside Australia is eligible to register for Australian citizenship by descent if at the time of their birth one of their parents was an Australian citizen.\u201d This may still exclude the woman\u2019s two youngest children because of the retroactive effect of her, and the children\u2019s father\u2019s, de-nationalisation. Currently, there are 19 Australian women and 47 Australian children held in the al-Hawl camp. The Australian government is aware of their identities and the bona fides of their Australian citizenship or right to claim that citizenship. They are family members of former foreign fighters who have been captured or killed. None of the Australian women in the camp were combatants, and many were coerced, forced or tricked into travelling to Syria. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old, born on 30 November last year. Were the children and their mothers able to get to an Australian embassy or consulate, the Australian government would be legally obliged to provide them travel documents to return home. Governments around the world have been repatriating their citizens from the al-Hawl camp. In recent weeks, the governments of the UK, US, Norway, Denmark, Trinidad and Tobago, and Germany, supported by the Kurdish-run Syrian Defence Force, have been repatriating their citizens. Belgium is planning to repatriate 10 orphaned children after being ordered to by a court. Sources inside the camp say Kurdish authorities, who still control the area, have established a safe route across the Iraqi border for foreign citizens, but it is political will from countries such as Australia preventing citizens being repatriated. Observers say Kurdish control of the region is tenuous, and is expected to be challenged by larger military forces in coming months: Russian-backed Syrian regime forces to the south and Turkish forces from the north. Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and three grandchildren are held in al-Hawl and who is a spokesman for the group of Australian women and children, said the government should rescind its decision to strip the Australian mother\u2019s citizenship. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that this is the intent of the legislation, but this is its effect, it has left two children effectively stateless. \u201cI\u2019ve met these children \u2013 the eldest is three or four years old \u2013 we know these children, but they have no documents to prove they even exist, and now Australia is leaving them without a nationality.\u201d Dabboussy said the women in the camp had agreed to subject themselves to the Australian justice system upon return, and that the children held in the camp had done nothing wrong. He said every day left in the dangerous conditions of al-Hawl made the children\u2019s eventual \u2013 and inevitable, given they are Australian citizens \u2013 reintegration into Australian society more difficult. Australia\u2019s unilateral action to retroactively strip citizenship comes as the powerful United Nations Human Rights Council, on which Australia sits, said nations around the world should repatriate their children from camps in Syria and should stop stripping citizenship from its nationals caught up in the war. In an unflinching report, an independent commission reported on the indignities and punishments inflicted upon children during the Syrian conflict, including murder, torture, rape, arbitrary imprisonment, denial of food and water and of medicine, and forced conscription to fight. The commission urged third countries to protect its children caught up in the ongoing violence. It said counties of origin should \u201ctake immediate steps for the simplified registration of their nationals born in Syria with the ultimate aim to repatriate them and their caregivers as soon as possible\u201d. \u201cCountries of origin should also refrain from stripping parents of their nationality in light of the impact on children.\u201d The report said \u201cmothers should be repatriated along with their children to ensure adherence with the best interests of the child principle. Any subsequent legal processes against parents should be undertaken with due regard to international human rights law\u201d. Mat Tinkler, Save the Children\u2019s director of international programs and policy, told the Guardian the UN report was a clear warning to all governments, including Australia\u2019s, of the dire consequences for children of denationalisation. \u201cThe UN makes explicit that denying these children of their right to citizenship puts them at higher risk of exploitation and abuse.\u201d Citizenship is regularly posited as one of the most fundamental of human rights, \u2018the right to have rights\u2019 from which others flow.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of native fish are estimated to have died in northern New South Wales after rains washed ash and sludge from bushfires into the Macleay River. Parts of the Macleay River \u2013 favoured by recreational fishers \u2013 have been turned into what locals described as \u201crunny cake mix\u201d that stank of rotting vegetation and dead fish. One freshwater ecologist told Guardian Australia the impact of the fish kill might be felt for decades to come, with long-lived species like Australian bass hit hard. The NSW Department of Primary Industries has been receiving reports of \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of fish dead in the river since December 2019. Locals say rain in the past 10 days has seen more ash and mud from the parched and burned landscape running into the river. The disaster on the Macleay River is one of eight fish kills reported to the department this year, with the cause of most linked to lack of rainfall. Larry Newberry, a recreational fisher from Frederickton, near Kempsey, said he drove 100km to George\u2019s Creek to survey the river last weekend. \u201cI would say from what I\u2019ve seen I would not be surprised that it\u2019s wiped out every fish in at least 100 kilometres of the river,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stench was overwhelming \u2013 it stank that much it made you heave.

This will be happening in every east coast river that\u2019s been hit by bushfires.\u201d Newberry was critical of commercial fishing operations that had been catching Australian bass, and also the primary industry department for what he called its lack of response. Species seen dead and reported to Guardian Australia were Australian bass, eels, bullhead mullet, yellow-eye mullet, herring, gudgeons and catfish. Upstream from Kempsey at the town of Bellbrook, residents have been using pumps and hoses borrowed from firefighters to try and oxygenate the water. Newberry said he admired the efforts but feared it was \u201clike pissing into a 40 kilometre an hour nor\u2019easter\u201d. James Pritchard, a founder of the Bellbrook Social Fishing Club, said rain on Thursday evening had raised the level of the river, but had \u201cbrought tonnes and tonnes of debris and dirt with it\u201d. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s more ash in the river now than I\u2019ve ever seen before. The top of the river is covered in ash. The water looks like a runny cake mix. It\u2019s terrible. \u201cThe river is finished for generations \u2013 I won\u2019t see this come back in my lifetime. To say I\u2019m fucking gutted isn\u2019t the word.\u201d Aboriginal elders relied on a healthy river for food and to teach culture, he said, and this would devastate those efforts. \u201cThis is so wrong. The DPI knew this was going to happen and they\u2019ve put nothing in place,\u201d he said. Prof Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, said the fish would have suffocated. Adding ash and nutrients to the water promotes bacteria, which in turn removes oxygen from the water. And if the water becomes sludgy, fish are not able to pass enough water over their gills to extract oxygen. Even though efforts to oxygenate the water might seem futile, he said even one saved mature female bass could then go on to spawn and lay hundreds and thousands of eggs. He said there was a precedent for understanding the long-term impacts of an event such as this: major bushfires in 1939 had caused ash to run into the Lachlan River, and \u201cthe fish never recovered\u201d. He said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more of these events as it rains. These things can have decades of impact. It can be really terrible.\u201d The department\u2019s \u201cfish kills\u201d page also has reports of hundreds of dead fish at Tilba Lake on the south coast of NSW, where soot had been reported on the banks, alongside dead bream, flathead, mullet, eels and blue swimmer crabs. Drought had also likely caused the death of thousands of fish in the Hastings River near Port Macquarie, the page reports. A NSW DPI statement said its fisheries department \u201ccontinues to investigate a fish kill event on the Macleay River\u201d. The statement said: \u201cThe suspected cause of the incident is poor water quality leading to low dissolved oxygen. Rainfall events are adding ash from the extensive bushfires throughout the region into local catchments, as well as other organic matter and sediment. This can cause rapid drops to oxygen levels in the water. \u201cFisheries staff have conducted numerous field assessments and the main species affected have been Australian bass, freshwater mullet and eel-tailed catfish. The number of fish impacted is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.\u201d Community members were encouraged to report fish deaths or observations to the Fishers Watch hotline on 1800 043 536.",

The US Anti-Doping Agency, which led the initial investigation into Salazar, had also previously expressed an interest in getting hold of Farah\u2019s samples held in the UK \u2013 a move resisted by Ukad.</p> <p>Ukad\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said she would not agree to a \u201ctrawling expedition\u201d without the evidence to back it up, as she wants to save any samples in its possession in case there are scientific advances in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe supported Usada in their investigation into the Nike Oregon Project,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been any ill-feeling or lack of willingness or assistance on our part. But when you open a sample up, every time you freeze it and thaw it and freeze it again, you are degrading the sample. I was simply saying to Usada: \u2018You need to be able to give me credible evidence about what it is you want to look for, rather than this just being a trawling expedition.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIf any partner comes forward and says: \u2018I have evidence to suggest this might be present in these athletes and this is part of an ongoing investigation,\u2019 I\u2019ll be the first one to say: \u2018Help yourself. How can we help you?\u2019 But I\u2019m not going to risk samples that we hold in storage that could enable us to re-test when the science moves along.\u201d</p> <p>Sapstead also hinted she would resist any order from Wada to hand the Farah samples over. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see whether that comes into play,\u201d she said. \u201cMy view is, any sample collected by UK Anti-Doping is the possession of UK Anti-Doping. If we collected on behalf of the IAAF, it\u2019s the IAAF\u2019s sample. If we collected on behalf of Usada, it\u2019s Usada\u2019s sample.\u201d</p> <p>Farah, who denies any wrongdoing during his career, said recently he would have left Salazar much earlier if he had known what the coach was up to.</p> <p>Sapstead, meanwhile, refused to be drawn on whether the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman would be charged with an anti-doping rule violation after admitting buying testosterone - and then lying about it to Ukad - during his ongoing medical tribunal in Manchester.</p> <p>\u201cIt remains our belief that we let them continue with their case and we just keep a watching brief on it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can assure you that if any information came out of that hearing, we will be responding to it.\u201d</p> <p>She insisted that Ukad was \u201cworking really closely with the GMC\u201d after deciding to \u201cgive them primacy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey have the power to compel certain things from that individual that we don\u2019t,\u201d she explained.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK Anti-Doping Agency has said it will not hand over Sir Mo Farah\u2019s blood and urine samples to any investigation into the Nike Oregon Project unless it is given credible evidence to suggest they might contain a banned substance. The World Anti-Doping Agency is expected to re-test some samples of athletes from the training group, where Farah ran between 2010 to 2017, as part of a new investigation into the Oregon Project that was announced in the wake of Alberto Salazar\u2019s four-year ban for doping offences. The US Anti-Doping Agency, which led the initial investigation into Salazar, had also previously expressed an interest in getting hold of Farah\u2019s samples held in the UK \u2013 a move resisted by Ukad. Ukad\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said she would not agree to a \u201ctrawling expedition\u201d without the evidence to back it up, as she wants to save any samples in its possession in case there are scientific advances in the future. \u201cWe supported Usada in their investigation into the Nike Oregon Project,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been any ill-feeling or lack of willingness or assistance on our part. But when you open a sample up, every time you freeze it and thaw it and freeze it again, you are degrading the sample. I was simply saying to Usada: \u2018You need to be able to give me credible evidence about what it is you want to look for, rather than this just being a trawling expedition.\u2019 \u201cIf any partner comes forward and says: \u2018I have evidence to suggest this might be present in these athletes and this is part of an ongoing investigation,\u2019 I\u2019ll be the first one to say: \u2018Help yourself. How can we help you?\u2019 But I\u2019m not going to risk samples that we hold in storage that could enable us to re-test when the science moves along.\u201d Sapstead also hinted she would resist any order from Wada to hand the Farah samples over. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see whether that comes into play,\u201d she said. \u201cMy view is, any sample collected by UK Anti-Doping is the possession of UK Anti-Doping. If we collected on behalf of the IAAF, it\u2019s the IAAF\u2019s sample. If we collected on behalf of Usada, it\u2019s Usada\u2019s sample.\u201d Farah, who denies any wrongdoing during his career, said recently he would have left Salazar much earlier if he had known what the coach was up to. Sapstead, meanwhile, refused to be drawn on whether the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman would be charged with an anti-doping rule violation after admitting buying testosterone - and then lying about it to Ukad - during his ongoing medical tribunal in Manchester. \u201cIt remains our belief that we let them continue with their case and we just keep a watching brief on it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can assure you that if any information came out of that hearing, we will be responding to it.\u201d She insisted that Ukad was \u201cworking really closely with the GMC\u201d after deciding to \u201cgive them primacy\u201d. \u201cThey have the power to compel certain things from that individual that we don\u2019t,\u201d she explained.",

Diehard Brexiters, including Conservative MP Mark Francois and Brexit party MEP Richard Tice, had reacted furiously to news that Big Ben would not ring out to mark the UK officially quitting the EU at the end of this month. Francois said earlier in the week that it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that \u201cthe most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben\u201d, should not be used to mark Brexit. Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, the prime minister said the government was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. Several crowdfunders were set up to help raise money, one of which had amassed more than \u00a3227,000 by Friday afternoon. But in an increasingly heated and farcical atmosphere, it subsequently transpired that the government had no such plan, and the House of Commons commission had no way of accepting public donations. In a bid to draw a line under the row, No 10 has now arranged a light show, featuring a clock counting down the minutes until 11pm \u2013 midnight Brussels time \u2013 when Britain will formally leave the European Union. Union flags will fly in parliament square, the scene of lively pro- and anti-Brexit protests over many months; and a commemorative coin will finally go into circulation \u2013 a previous iteration having been melted down, when Brexit was postponed. Government buildings on Whitehall will also be lit up for the occasion, and Johnson will deliver a televised address to mark the moment. The costs of the celebration will be borne by the taxpayer. Despite Johnson having won the Tory leadership with the backing of hardline Brexiters and expunging many moderates from his party, he now insists he is keen to heal the divisions between leavers and remainers. The row about Big Ben\u2019s bongs has raged all week. The House of Commons commission, which organises the running of parliament, had said the bell was \u201cunlikely\u201d to sound at 11pm on 31 January, the moment Brexit officially happens, in part due to the estimated cost of \u00a3500,000 to make it happen. Work needed would have included restoring the clock chime mechanism, testing it, building a temporary floor in the belfry to allow the work to take place and delaying other restoration work for several weeks. The new Speaker of the Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, who chairs the commission, said, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at \u00a350,000 a bong\u201d. The cabinet will meet outside London on the week of 31 January, in a bid to highlight the government\u2019s plans for \u201clevelling-up\u201d regions outside London \u2013 and throw the focus forward to the future. Johnson will claim that the UK\u2019s formal departure from the EU at the end of this month fulfils his election pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. But it also marks the start of a race against time to secure a free trade agreement with the EU27 in time for the end of the transition period, in December. The withdrawal agreement bill, which incorporates the Brexit deal struck by Johnson in Brussels last November, has been making rapid progress through parliament since the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority at last month\u2019s general election.",

      "bodyText": "Fred Done, one of the billionaire Tory donors who owns bookmaker Betfred, also bankrolls a company that makes money advising people struggling with high debts, it has emerged. MPs and campaigners raised fresh concerns about the Done family\u2019s business empire, a day after the Guardian revealed that brothers Fred and Peter Done own a company that provides services including gambling addiction counselling to the public sector. Companies House filings reveal that Fred Done also invested \u00a3150,000 in Angel Advance, a debt management company set up in 2013 and part-owned by other members of the Done family. Angel Advance derives its revenues from advising indebted people, some of whom pay the company a fee to negotiate reduced repayments with creditors on their behalf. The website offers \u201cmoney saving tips\u201d, such as switching to a cheaper supermarket, cutting down on takeaways or renting a spare room to a lodger. The tips do not include stopping gambling. Angel Advance\u2019s website also advises customers in difficulty to contact the Samaritans if they are struggling to deal with debt. A list of issues they might be facing includes job-related stress, alcohol or drug abuse and suicidal thoughts. It does not include problem gambling, despite the fact that betting addiction has been linked with elevated rates of suicide. Labour MP Carolyn Harris voiced dismay that the Done family could profit from gambling, counselling for gambling addiction and debt management all at once. \u201cThey get paid when you gamble, they get paid when you seek help for it and they get paid when you try to clear your debts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how they can make the most of the vulnerable and squeeze blood out of a stone. It\u2019s characteristic of the mentality of this industry.\u201d Problem gambling has frequently been linked to high debt, including by industry regulator the Gambling Commission, which announced a ban on betting with credit cards earlier this month. Last year, the Guardian reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction. Debt charity Step Change said people with gambling problems who seek its advice usually have more debts than those who don\u2019t, owing an average of \u00a316,323 to eight creditors. Citizens Advice said the number of people who have asked it for help because they owe money directly to a bookmaker has increased by 83% in two years. Fresh revelations about the Done family\u2019s interests come a day after the Guardian revealed that brothers Fred and Peter, who are worth a combined \u00a31.25bn and have given \u00a3375,000 to the Conservative party, also own Health Assured. The business provides gambling counselling to staff who work at NHS trusts and in parliament, prompting an allegation of \u201chypocrisy\u201d from NHS mental health chief, Claire Murdoch. Both Harris and SNP MP Ronnie Cowan called on parliament to review its contract with the company. Cowan said: \u201cFor the UK parliament to contract them to provide support is beyond the pale. \u201cTo compound matters, for Fred Done to invest in a debt management firm after helping to drive so many people into debt beggars belief. \u201cThe Dones created the problem, then paid money to support the Tory party and then the Tory government uses taxpayers money to pay them to fix the problem they created. And we wonder why people don\u2019t trust politicians!\u201d A spokesperson for Health Assured said people with gambling addiction problems accounted for less than 0.1% of telephone calls it received from its clients\u2019 staff. \u201cThe management and directors of Health Assured and Betfred are also entirely separate and independent of each other,\u201d they added. \u201cWhat is more, Health Assured has always been open, and provided full disclosure on ownership during tender processes and new contracts won have been secured on merit.\u201d A spokesperson for the House of Commons and the House of Lords said: \u201cUK parliament is bound by strict procurement regulations.

The Labour politician\u2019s pledge to tackle air pollution forms part of his first major pitch to voters in the upcoming mayoral race, in which he will go up against Conservative, Lib Dem, Green and independent rivals. Khan\u2019s strategy to go carbon-neutral forms part of his vision for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d for London, which he would roll out during a second term. This will involve a 10-point plan that will be outlined in his manifesto before the mayoral election on 7 May. In a speech to the Fabian Society new year conference in central London on Saturday, he is expected to say the 2030 target is essential to prevent the poorest communities being affected by poor air and the thousands of premature deaths in the capital each year. \u201cMy pledge to deliver a green new deal for the city with a target for London to be carbon-neutral by 2030 will help tackle the climate emergency and the air pollution crisis. \u201cSome may say that a 2030 target isn\u2019t achievable but I say we can\u2019t afford not to try. This is a matter of social justice because it\u2019s the poorest communities that are being hit hardest,\u201d said Khan, who became the first Muslim mayor of any western capital city when he was elected in 2016. The majority of the biggest political parties in the UK have set ambitions for the country to reach net-zero emissions by particular dates that range from the 2030s through to the 2050s. Despite Labour activists passing a commitment at their autumn party conference to work towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, the party ended up softening its pledge for last month\u2019s election after pressure from trade unions and the impact it would have on industrial jobs. Instead they offered to find a \u201cpath\u201d to the date of 2030. The Conservatives have a policy of hitting net-zero by 2050 and the Liberal Democrats pledged a date of 2045. The Green party has pledged to go carbon-neutral by 2030. Across Europe, three Nordic cities \u2013 Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm \u2013 have made firm commitments to be carbon-neutral or fossil fuel-free between 2025 and 2030. Bristol has a net-zero target of 2030, as does Edinburgh, but with a backstop date of 2037. Khan has said green commitments will be a dividing line between his campaign and his nearest rival, Conservative Shaun Bailey, who is behind him in the polls. A survey by Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Mile End Institute found Khan was the first preference candidate of 43% of Londoners. Bailey is on 23%. \u201cThe election on 7 May is a two-horse race between me and the Tory candidate,\u201d Khan told the Guardian. To achieve a carbon-neutral status for London, he said City Hall would lead the way in implementing tougher environmental standards, moving away from fossil fuels and reducing waste. Public transport will become greener, he said, and he will commit to trying to get billions of pounds worth of government investment. One example to help reduce emissions is retro-fitting houses to make them more energy-efficient.",

The draft legislation for a Virginia assault weapons ban, which was originally written to include a ban on the possession of military-style weapons, sparked fears of confiscation among Virginia\u2019s gun owners, and helped fuel a passionate grassroots movement against gun control across the state. \u201c[The extreme right] has been saying for years that an assault weapon ban is going to be their excuse to start killing people,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI tried to have this conversation with my colleagues, but, frankly, a lot of my colleagues don\u2019t want to believe that that\u2019s out there.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t even say it\u2019s like a landmine, because a landmine you can\u2019t see. There\u2019s a big button on the ground that says, \u2018If you step here, it will explode\u2019 and Democrats just stomped on it, because they didn\u2019t want to believe that it exists.\u201d Instead, he said, he believed Democrats had an \u201chead in the sand\u201d mentality, he said, \u201cthat we can enact this policy, and that it will be fine\u201d. \u201cTheir faith in institutions is so strong that they refuse to believe it\u2019s not shared by everyone.\u201d While Carter has previously kept guns for self-defense in his home, he said he has never before regularly carried a gun in public. Now, he said, he will be continuing to monitor internet chatter, and showing up armed to public events when he believes there might be heightened risk of an attack. \u201cI am having to take steps to protect myself and protect my family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019ve gotten to this point.\u201d",

They moved in together and decided to become parents. Naomi says: \u201cI wanted to see what kind of parent I could be and [to] try and bring children into the world that were aware and responsible. So we decided to have a child [and] in one of our drinking times after work, Simon said to me, \u2018I\u2019d like to do that with you.\u2019 That was one of those pivotal things to say that makes you think, \u2018Hmm, that\u2019s interesting\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Although neither of them were fussed, once Naomi fell pregnant, they decided to get married in a very low-key way. \u201cFor us, it wasn\u2019t about a big ceremony. It was something that we wanted to bear witness to each other at that point,\u201d Simon says. They married in a registry office in Sydney, with only two hitherto unsuspecting friends as witnesses, followed by a casual picnic on Observatory Hill overlooking the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48832de2b4ad61bc328a0a85ff1fb3cac9c7a964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48832de2b4ad61bc328a0a85ff1fb3cac9c7a964/0_0_2078_1544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon and Naomi Perry on holiday in Venice in July 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon and Naomi Perry on holiday in Venice in July 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon and Naomi Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the whole thing was deliberately casual, Naomi remembers feeling overwhelmed with emotion during the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s one side of a line and the other side of the line. It shouldn\u2019t really matter which side of the line you\u2019re on five minutes before or five minutes after, but heading right towards that line of being married, it is a nervous time. I definitely felt that [and] lots of love pouring out of me.\u201d</p> <p>Another reason the pair hadn\u2019t wanted a big wedding was because of their families. Simon knew Naomi\u2019s parents and had been warmly welcomed into the family but Naomi hadn\u2019t received the same from Simon\u2019s family, who mostly lived overseas. Sadly, when they announced the news of their surprise wedding and pregnancy, they got similar reactions. Warmth and happiness from one, hostility from the other. It strained Simon\u2019s historically tense relationship with his family. \u201cI\u2019d lost one family but the day Naomi and I married I gained two more; her side of the family, and the one we\u2019ve built together.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately it had little impact on the couple\u2019s relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon it\u2019s affected our relationship as much as what it could have,\u201d Naomi says. \u201cI think that part of that is because of the way Simon has dealt with it. At some points in time that it\u2019s been a bit upsetting for Simon that he doesn\u2019t have a relationship with his family but I always said that he could share mine.\u201d</p> <p>Like most couples, the arrival of their first child tested their relationship. \u201cFinding that time with each other is the toughest part,\u201d Simon says. \u201c But for us, it wasn\u2019t about grand date nights once a month. It was finding the quiet, intimate moments.\u201d They almost always managed to sit down to dinner together when the baby was asleep and tried to spend time just sitting and reading together. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/11/how-we-stay-together-find-a-way-to-love-that-thing-you-want-to-change\">How we stay together : 'Find a way to love that thing you want to change'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family faced further challenges when they were transferred to the US for Simon\u2019s software job. </p> <p> The US was in turmoil as it dealt with the September 11 attacks, and the couple welcomed their second child far from friends and family.

A chance encounter, a sudden recognition, then the realisation that this is your person. Others take a bit longer. That was the case for Simon and Naomi Perry. For more than six years, the couple were close friends. They worked together for a time, they socialised together, but they were in other relationships.

      "body": "<p>A new decade is a fresh start, right?</p> <p>So you make a bunch of resolutions \u2013 anything from getting fitter to getting smarter to taking more risks. But a few weeks in your motivation starts to fade. By March you\u2019re back to the same habits.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to properly change. Experts suggest taking small steps and shifting one or two habits. But what if you tried to improve all aspects of yourself, all at once?</p> <p>As an experiment, I signed up to three self-improvement courses.</p> <p>For improvement of my mind I took an online course in Stoic philosophy. Stoicism is an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy that focuses on ethics, virtue and reason. For spiritual gains I signed up to a course on feminine archetypes, and to tackle my fitness I took a yoga challenge comprising of daily classes, group meetings, a nutrition component and journaling.</p> <p>If I was not a changed person after this, I never would be.</p> <h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2> <p>I check in on Whatsapp with my Stoic group, consisting of 10 friends around the world. Each day we have to do three sets of readings from ancient philosophers and in the chat we discuss them.</p> <p>Day one explored the Greek concept of praxis, interpreted by group member Michael as \u201cif you want to live a better life, the act of trying is just as good (as the act of succeeding)\u201d.</p> <p>Start yoga course. Ninety minutes of level two vinyasa. It is hard. I am unfit. But I least I am bringing praxis to it. Afterwards I have to get an Uber to take me home, a five-minute walk up the hill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/killer-snakes-boring-walks-and-itchy-fingers-the-perils-of-cutting-screen-time-to-an-hour-a-day\">Killer snakes, boring walks and itchy fingers \u2013 the perils of cutting screen time to an hour a day | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That night, I attend the course on the feminine. I entered the room and was encouraged to connect with my inner feminine archetypes through touching my body and making sounds. I didn\u2019t know where to look when other people were connecting with themselves in this way. Is this the right place?</p> <p>I spend two hours in a state of shock. Women here are encouraged to make noises and use touch to shift any sexual suppression.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lot for my repressed, Catholic-school educated self to take in. How is it <em>legal</em> that these women are just allowed to touch themselves in front of strangers? Oh god, where do I look? The ceiling? No, I\u2019ll get a crick in my neck. The ground? No, that sends a message that what these women are doing is doing is shameful, and the whole point of the course is to remove shame. Settle into looking at a spot on the wall, and when encouraged to touch self, touch the elbow area. Stay silent.</p> <p>When the class finally finishes, I don\u2019t even wait to put on my shoes before bolting onto the street, barefoot, flagging down a cab that\u2019s going the wrong way. At home, sit in the dark backyard for a long time \u2013 just thinking to myself \u2013 \u201coh god, what the hell was that?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Day 2</strong></h2> <p>People in the Stoic chat aren\u2019t happy. The readings are difficult, like riddles.</p> <p>Emily was perturbed that \u201cpassion\u201d wasn\u2019t listed as a stoic virtue.</p> <p>After a particularly confusing midday Cicero reading, Trav posts: \u201cSeems a bit much to work out at lunch.\u201d</p> <p>I haven\u2019t done the readings, as I\u2019m trying to fulfil the requirements of the yoga course: another hard vinyasa class, following a nutrition plan (when am I going to have time to do all the juicing?), journaling and meetings.</p> <p>The first yoga meeting is tonight. Around 20 of us sit on the ground in a circle. No one is moaning or touching themselves, which is a relief.</p> <p>When we introduce ourselves and say why we are doing the course the answers are tentative. To get better at yoga? A few of the men in course say they run marathons, and an intensive yoga program is the best way to help with flexibility. They look uncomfortable when told about journaling.</p> <p>The question we have to contemplate this week is quite existential: what is your purpose?</p> <p>In my journal I write the word PURPOSE in big letters across the top \u2026 then a question mark.</p> <p>At home, I check in with the Stoics. One of the members, Emily is already fed up with the philosophy after a close family friend became ill.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming to the stoic readings with a lot of generosity today,\u201d she posts. One of the readings advises to be \u201cshocked at nothing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/22/i-gave-up-everything-i-enjoy-my-day-of-dopamine-fasting-the-latest-silicon-valley-craze\">I gave up everything I enjoy: my day of dopamine fasting, the latest Silicon Valley craze | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt what point does detaching from your emotions become weird as hell,\u201d she asks us.</p> <p>Members of the Stoic group \u2013 many of whom don\u2019t know each other \u2013 message support to Emily and I feel like even if the group fails at stoicism, they are practising empathy.</p> <h2><strong>Day 3</strong></h2> <p>I do a difficult yoga class. Starving. Eat a pie. Feel guilty because have not engaged with the nutrition aspect of the course. There is a mini detox coming up where we fast for a few days, which seems impossible due to the amount of fuel I am using in racing around to all these self-improvement classes.</p> <p>Check into Stoic group. One member, Ivan, has accidentally skipped ahead for the readings of the day and is now talking about parenting. He posts: \u201cWas a weird choice for the reading this morning.

      "bodyText": "A new decade is a fresh start, right? So you make a bunch of resolutions \u2013 anything from getting fitter to getting smarter to taking more risks. But a few weeks in your motivation starts to fade. By March you\u2019re back to the same habits. It\u2019s hard to properly change. Experts suggest taking small steps and shifting one or two habits. But what if you tried to improve all aspects of yourself, all at once? As an experiment, I signed up to three self-improvement courses. For improvement of my mind I took an online course in Stoic philosophy. Stoicism is an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy that focuses on ethics, virtue and reason. For spiritual gains I signed up to a course on feminine archetypes, and to tackle my fitness I took a yoga challenge comprising of daily classes, group meetings, a nutrition component and journaling. If I was not a changed person after this, I never would be. Day 1 I check in on Whatsapp with my Stoic group, consisting of 10 friends around the world. Each day we have to do three sets of readings from ancient philosophers and in the chat we discuss them. Day one explored the Greek concept of praxis, interpreted by group member Michael as \u201cif you want to live a better life, the act of trying is just as good (as the act of succeeding)\u201d. Start yoga course. Ninety minutes of level two vinyasa. It is hard. I am unfit. But I least I am bringing praxis to it. Afterwards I have to get an Uber to take me home, a five-minute walk up the hill. That night, I attend the course on the feminine. I entered the room and was encouraged to connect with my inner feminine archetypes through touching my body and making sounds. I didn\u2019t know where to look when other people were connecting with themselves in this way. Is this the right place? I spend two hours in a state of shock. Women here are encouraged to make noises and use touch to shift any sexual suppression. It\u2019s a lot for my repressed, Catholic-school educated self to take in. How is it legal that these women are just allowed to touch themselves in front of strangers? Oh god, where do I look? The ceiling? No, I\u2019ll get a crick in my neck. The ground? No, that sends a message that what these women are doing is doing is shameful, and the whole point of the course is to remove shame. Settle into looking at a spot on the wall, and when encouraged to touch self, touch the elbow area. Stay silent. When the class finally finishes, I don\u2019t even wait to put on my shoes before bolting onto the street, barefoot, flagging down a cab that\u2019s going the wrong way. At home, sit in the dark backyard for a long time \u2013 just thinking to myself \u2013 \u201coh god, what the hell was that?\u201d Day 2 People in the Stoic chat aren\u2019t happy. The readings are difficult, like riddles. Emily was perturbed that \u201cpassion\u201d wasn\u2019t listed as a stoic virtue. After a particularly confusing midday Cicero reading, Trav posts: \u201cSeems a bit much to work out at lunch.\u201d I haven\u2019t done the readings, as I\u2019m trying to fulfil the requirements of the yoga course: another hard vinyasa class, following a nutrition plan (when am I going to have time to do all the juicing?), journaling and meetings. The first yoga meeting is tonight. Around 20 of us sit on the ground in a circle. No one is moaning or touching themselves, which is a relief. When we introduce ourselves and say why we are doing the course the answers are tentative. To get better at yoga? A few of the men in course say they run marathons, and an intensive yoga program is the best way to help with flexibility. They look uncomfortable when told about journaling. The question we have to contemplate this week is quite existential: what is your purpose? In my journal I write the word PURPOSE in big letters across the top \u2026 then a question mark. At home, I check in with the Stoics. One of the members, Emily is already fed up with the philosophy after a close family friend became ill. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to the stoic readings with a lot of generosity today,\u201d she posts. One of the readings advises to be \u201cshocked at nothing\u201d. \u201cAt what point does detaching from your emotions become weird as hell,\u201d she asks us. Members of the Stoic group \u2013 many of whom don\u2019t know each other \u2013 message support to Emily and I feel like even if the group fails at stoicism, they are practising empathy. Day 3 I do a difficult yoga class. Starving. Eat a pie. Feel guilty because have not engaged with the nutrition aspect of the course. There is a mini detox coming up where we fast for a few days, which seems impossible due to the amount of fuel I am using in racing around to all these self-improvement classes. Check into Stoic group. One member, Ivan, has accidentally skipped ahead for the readings of the day and is now talking about parenting. He posts: \u201cWas a weird choice for the reading this morning. That the parental bond is fundamental and natural basis for the social order seems deeply conservative to me. I guess you might want to make this point if you live in a society where infanticide was an everyday occurrence.\u201d Rein group in and try and return to day\u2019s topic, not parenting but attitudes to wealth and money. Do extra hard yoga class. Think about life\u2019s purpose. Think about parenting. Think about infanticide. Think about money. It\u2019s time to go back to the feminine workshop.

I mean, it was a gift that a low-rise bumster was around then, because you couldn\u2019t make that up could you?\u201d</p> <p>Kitty Stuckey, the series\u2019 inimitable costume designer, was essential to bringing Riley and Turner\u2019s characters \u2013 first devised in the 1994 sketch show Big Girl\u2019s Blouse \u2013 to life. \u201cSome costume gags \u2013 like Kath wearing thin white tights with a big black G string underneath \u2013 were written into the script,\u201d she says. \u201cBut most of the other stuff was just a matter of, \u2018Go out and find something funny\u2019. What a gift as a costume designer.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the first season, Riley, Turner and Stuckey conducted outfit research expeditions in Melbourne\u2019s suburban shopping outlets. Everything Kim wore in the series was bought in these malls, from stores like Supre, Deborah K and Dolly Girl. \u201cI remember we did buy a few things at a store called Gasp. I just loved that name because that\u2019s exactly what the clothes made you do,\u201d Stuckey laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"012a8a62bf792357b3c6aebbd4d0bbd5474fe5c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/012a8a62bf792357b3c6aebbd4d0bbd5474fe5c1/0_67_1920_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Kath and Kim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nice, different, unusual.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kath\u2019s gumnut baby earrings, parrot jumpers and the like were often pillaged from thrift stores. \u201cI liked the idea that Kath is somebody who keeps things,\u201d Stuckey says. \u201cIf she reads in a magazine that says green is in fashion, she\u2019ll pull out something green she bought in 1987 and wear that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKitty would find the most brilliant knit or hilarious jumper,\u201d Riley remembers. \u201cAnd when she bought them in to Jane and I, we would end up in tears on the floor, laughing our heads off.

      "bodyText": "Much time and energy is now spent trying to court the attention of Generation Z \u2013 the \u201ctech-innate\u201d younger siblings of millennials. Who could have guessed that among TikTok and Juuling one would find an Australian sitcom that first aired in 2002? And yet Kath &amp; Kim is having an undeniable moment among a generation who weren\u2019t even born when the first episode debuted. It began in July, when all four seasons landed on Australian Netflix. In the following months, dozens of Instagram fan accounts cropped up; an iconic scene from the series \u2013 in which Kim is fired from her call centre job \u2013 became a brief TikTok sensation, and an Uber Eats ad campaign (a spoof featuring Kim Kardashian as the titular Kim, for which Kardashian was reportedly paid $2 m) went viral. So why does Kath &amp; Kim continue to tantalise us, nearly two decades on? The simplest answer is that \u2013 even with its ill-fated American spin-off, and a lukewarm reaction to the 2012 film adaptation \u2013 the series remains one of our country\u2019s finest comedic exports. And unlike the increasingly un-woke outputs of their contemporary Chris Lilley, Gina Riley and Jane Turner\u2019s loving send-up of a family of Melbourne bogans has stood the test of time fairly unscathed. \u201cThe show was able to perfectly capture middle Australia at the turn of the millennium, so there\u2019s a great sense of nostalgia,\u201d says Luke, the founder of No Context Kath And Kim: a pair of Instagram and Facebook meme accounts with a combined 90,000 followers. Born in 1998, Luke \u2013 who didn\u2019t want to give us his last name \u2013 was only four when the Kath &amp; Kim was released.

It was as if the millennium turned, and suddenly flaunting one\u2019s wealth (and skin) became all the rage again \u2013 logo-mania was back, midriffs and cleavages were on display and Britney Spears was wearing \u201cI AM THE AMERICAN DREAM\u201d T-shirts. In her role as Kim, co-creator Gina Riley had her fair share of shiver-inducing fashion moments. \u201cWhen Jane and I wrote the show, we were told, \u2018Never say where you are or what era you\u2019re in\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we just said, \u2018Nup, we\u2019re going to do the opposite\u2019.

Kath\u2019s Little Bo Peep wedding gown (\u201cThat could be theme of the wedding: mutton dressed as lamb!\u201d); Kim\u2019s crotch-skimming mini skirts (\u201cKim, you look like a bit of a fashion victim.\u201d \u201cThanks Sharon, I do try.\u201d); Kath\u2019s split trousers (\u201cOh no, I just bought these lovely latte capris!\u201d). \u201cThe costumes are, absolutely, another character in the show,\u201d Riley says. \u201cFrom the get-go we had very specific ideas about what the characters would be wearing. Kim especially had to be wearing everything off-the-rack, and completely embody what was happening at that moment. I mean, it was a gift that a low-rise bumster was around then, because you couldn\u2019t make that up could you?\u201d Kitty Stuckey, the series\u2019 inimitable costume designer, was essential to bringing Riley and Turner\u2019s characters \u2013 first devised in the 1994 sketch show Big Girl\u2019s Blouse \u2013 to life. \u201cSome costume gags \u2013 like Kath wearing thin white tights with a big black G string underneath \u2013 were written into the script,\u201d she says. \u201cBut most of the other stuff was just a matter of, \u2018Go out and find something funny\u2019. What a gift as a costume designer.\u201d Ahead of the first season, Riley, Turner and Stuckey conducted outfit research expeditions in Melbourne\u2019s suburban shopping outlets. Everything Kim wore in the series was bought in these malls, from stores like Supre, Deborah K and Dolly Girl. \u201cI remember we did buy a few things at a store called Gasp. I just loved that name because that\u2019s exactly what the clothes made you do,\u201d Stuckey laughs. Kath\u2019s gumnut baby earrings, parrot jumpers and the like were often pillaged from thrift stores. \u201cI liked the idea that Kath is somebody who keeps things,\u201d Stuckey says. \u201cIf she reads in a magazine that says green is in fashion, she\u2019ll pull out something green she bought in 1987 and wear that.\u201d \u201cKitty would find the most brilliant knit or hilarious jumper,\u201d Riley remembers. \u201cAnd when she bought them in to Jane and I, we would end up in tears on the floor, laughing our heads off. It was absolute genius.\u201d Kath Day Knight and Kim Day Craig may seem unlikely style icons for the new decade, but the nature of fashion dictates that whatever goes out of style must come back in again. In 2019, low-rise jeans, heeled thongs, visible G-strings and pedal pushers were all given the high-fashion treatment \u2013 and the 2020s may herald a full-circle moment for the worst of noughties style. So the question remains: are the inimitable ladies from Fountain Lakes aware of their clout \u2013 sartorial or otherwise \u2013 with the next generation? \u201cI\u2019m not on social media myself, but I have a daughter who is, so yes, I\u2019m pretty aware,\u201d Riley says. \u201cJane and I are so happy that the show resonates with the younger generation. It\u2019s an amazing thing. So yes, I do feel the renaissance \u2013 and it feels good.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Gabrielle Wenman is used to spending her long Australian summer holidays outdoors \u2013 swimming, walking and doing anything but being locked up inside. This summer has been different. To go outside in vast areas of Australia this summer has been to step out into a world with an obscured skyline, a red sun, the inescapable smell of smoke, and heavy air. Many, like Wenman, have spent their summer break largely indoors. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be my biggest holiday of the year and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve really done anything,\u201d the Sydney high school teacher says. \u201cIt\u2019s really impacted the way I\u2019m sort of going about my usual business.\u201d The ongoing bushfire crisis in Australia has left large parts of the east and south of the continent blanketed in smoke for days on end over the past few months. Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra have reported some of the worst air quality in the world. \u201cI\u2019ve got a constant asthma cough and I\u2019m constantly breathless, and my throat is really impacted as well,\u201d Wenman says. People on their morning commute are now checking the air quality ratings on their phone. All of a sudden everyone is discussing safe PM2.5 levels. PM2.5 particles are particles in the air like smoke that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and are small enough to be breathed into the lungs. They can make it difficult for people to breathe, particularly those with asthma or other related respiratory issues. \u201cThose particles are small enough to get to the smallest airways that participate in gas exchange in the lung,\u201d Prof John Wilson, the president-elect of the Royal Australian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician at the Alfred hospital, says. \u201cThe increase in load of particulate matter in the distal airway is associated with an increase in presentations to emergency departments by people with established lung disease and advanced cardiac disease. \u201cThere\u2019s also evidence that mortality is increased on days for which there is significant air pollution.\u201d Melbourne this week experienced two hazardous rating days of smoke. Horse racing events were cancelled, public pools and gyms were closed. At the Australian Open qualifiers, Slovenia\u2019s Dalila Jakupovi\u0107 suffered a coughing fit halfway through her qualifying match against Switzerland\u2019s Stefanie V\u00f6gele and was forced to retire. The defending men\u2019s champion, Novak Djokovic, has suggested delaying the flagship tennis tournament given the smoke conditions. Protective P2 face masks are in short supply, with shelves at the Bunnings hardware stores in and around the Melbourne CBD sold out this week. Some have taken to ordering more high-end fashionable masks online. Wenman says that, before the current crisis, she never thought to check the air quality index. Now she has an app on her phone for it and it determines whether she feels she can step outside. \u201cSince the bushfire crisis it\u2019s become a frequent occurrence,\u201d she says. \u201cI check it not only in the morning but throughout the day as well.\u201d At the fire fronts, it\u2019s even worse. Some firefighters have been in the field for close to three months this fire season. Although there is some protective face masks, the masks are less effective at the frontline and the extended fire season is taking its toll. \u201cThe whole of Sydney is whinging about fucking smoke all over the town and how bad it is, but not one of them gives a second thought about us trying to put the fires out,\u201d Greg Hodges, a volunteer firefighter and the strike team leader, says. \u201cI\u2019m a smoker anyway but you wake up feeling like your chest has been stomped on, coughing up crap all the time. I\u2019ve got guys who aren\u2019t smokers who are coughing like they\u2019ve been smoking 20 years.\u201d Asthma Australia has been conducting a survey during the bushfire crisis on the impact of the smoke on people with asthma, and in the few weeks it has been running has received close to 12,000 responses. Hospital admissions have been relatively low, with just two reported at the Alfred in Melbourne this week so far. The majority of people with asthma turn to their GPs. There has been a doubling in ambulance call-outs in Victoria. At the peak of the poor air quality in Melbourne this week, Ambulance Victoria said it had made 167 breathing-related callouts in one day to 4pm, compared with the usual average of around 88 per day to 4pm. Two people so far have been reported to have died from breathing issues that have been associated with the smoke this bushfire season \u2013 an elderly woman who stepped off a plane in Canberra during the worst of the days in the capital, and a 19-year-old Glenn Innes woman, whose family said she suffered an asthma attack in bed. Asthma Australia has called on the federal, state and territory governments to implement real-time and consistent air quality reporting for PM2.5 and 10 nationally. There is currently an inconsistency between the states over how frequently air quality reports are updated. Some only update once a day, while Tasmania and Victoria report hourly averages. The federal government is poised to launch a national inquiry into the bushfires, and the states have also flagged their own potential reviews after the bushfire season is over. There have been dozens of reviews related to the government response to bushfires in the past, but little focus on the short and long term impact on people breathing in bushfire smoke. Wilson says the reviews should be a starting point for research into the impact of smoke. \u201cWe do have an enormous gap in knowledge in terms of the cause of these symptoms and what appropriate prevention we can enact,\u201d he says. \u201cFor some time there has been speculation that exposure to particulate carbon and carbon products emanating from fires may have more serious health consequences than worsening asthma and emphysema.\u201d Wenman says she would like to see the government make it easier and cheaper to buy asthma medication. While Ventolin can be bought over the counter for $8, she is spending around AU$84 a month at the moment on preventer puffers, which require a prescription from a GP. \u201cI think it would help asthmatics a lot more if medications were more easily accessible,\u201d she says. Wenman returns to school later this month and says she is concerned about her health, and the health of her students if the smoke is still lingering. \u201cIt was a real challenge for me as a teacher going into work when the smoke was particularly bad,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to make sure I changed all my classrooms to airconditioned rooms just to get that airflow through \u2013 that\u2019s disruptive when you\u2019ve got to move your students. \u201cI know a lot of parents are feeling that anxiety about sending their kids back as well.\u201d",

The team say the approach could be extended to a broader range of medical equipment, as well as offering a new approach to delivering drugs to the right location at the right time. \u201cWe have the ability to control when those devices break up through the application of light,\u201d said Giovanni Traverso, co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital in the US. At the heart of the approach is a hydrogel \u2013 a squishy, water-absorbing material made of polymers. \u201cYou can imagine that if you put something really stiff and heavy and rigid inside your body, the rest of your tissues\u2013 which are quite soft by comparison\u2013 may have a negative reaction to that,\u201d said Ritu Raman, first author of the research who is also from MIT. However, hydrogels can be tweaked to make them stiffer or stretchier, while it is also possible to engineer them so they break down in certain environments, for example by exposure to acidity or heat. The team said they chose to use light since it was easy to control and could be used across different environments in the body, while the wavelength could be selected so it did not harm surrounding tissues.

Stokes and Pope both reached three figures during a 203-run third-wicket stand that helped Joe Root\u2019s team to 499 for nine declared in their first innings before South Africa reached the end of a rain-shortened day on 60 for two in reply. At 22 years and 15 days Pope\u2019s unbeaten 135 meant he became the youngest England player to score a century since Alastair Cook in 2006. Pope averages 61.14 in first-class cricket and Stokes, whose innings of 120 continued his fine series in South Africa, said of the Surrey batsman: \u201cHis record in first-class cricket is phenomenal, but no matter how well you do at that level, you\u2019re always wanting to put in the big performance and score that hundred to know you can play at this level. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen from Ollie in his short career so far is that he definitely can do it in Test cricket and that makes it an exciting time for him and for the team.\u201d On his first Test hundred, Pope said: \u201cIt was a pretty special moment.

      "bodyText": "The use of isolation booths in state schools has become one of the most contentious issues among teachers in England, even if public concern over pupil behaviour has faded from the headlines since the 1990s. Social media has become an almost nightly battleground between teachers with conflicting views on behaviour management and the use of internal exclusion or removal rooms within schools, where disruptive pupils are taken out of class and sent to study elsewhere under supervision. What the debate reveals is that the more than 20,000 state schools in England have wide variations in discipline and behaviour policies. In some cases pupils are sat at booths, similar to cubicles used in call centres, with a desk and three high sides. It is the use of this furniture that has become controversial within the profession, to the extent that a \u201close the booths\u201d conference for teachers is being held this weekend in Leeds. \u201cLearn how to remove the booths from your school and still have great outcomes,\u201d says the publicity for Lose The Booths Live!, which promises a conference with \u201cchildren\u2019s rights at heart\u201d. But in practice the use of \u201cconsequence rooms\u201d or removal spaces, is just one potential tool in a school\u2019s armoury. While some regularly use internal exclusion as a formal policy for misbehaviour, others reject it \u2013 highlighting the autonomy enjoyed by headteachers. At one end of the scale are schools practising \u201cwarm-strict\u201d behaviour management, which their critics deride as \u201czero tolerance\u201d, with clear rules and sanctions. Those rules can be at a level of detail some parents may find disturbing: not only the lengths of skirts or type of shoes but also maintaining complete silence when moving between classes, and sanctions for what some regard as petty issues such as failure to bring a pen to class, or not keeping eye contact with the teacher during lessons. But the defenders of this approach, including schools such as the Magna Academy in Dorset or King Solomon Academy in Paddington, say that a well-structured behaviour policy is liberating for teachers. By cutting out the background buzz of what the former Ofsted chief inspector Michael Wilshaw called \u201clow-level, persistent disruptive behaviour\u201d, the whole class can then concentrate on learning. One maths teacher who moved to a recently opened \u201cwarm-strict\u201d free school said he was astonished by the difference a successful behaviour policy can make. \u201cI\u2019d worked at four schools before, but this is the first time I\u2019ve been actually able to teach for the whole lesson. At the other schools pupils would arrive making noise and jostling, and take five or 10 minutes just to settle down. Here there\u2019s none of that,\u201d he said. But on social media teachers regularly spar over the need for such detailed rules and sanctions for what in other, more relaxed schools would be minor infringements. There\u2019s little in the way of research to say which approach is more effective in terms of pupil behaviour or academic attainment \u2013 although supporters point to the strong GCSE results produced by the Michaela Free School in Brent, one of the flagships of the stricter approach. While it is impossible to say if pupil behaviour has improved in recent years, statistics show that the rates of expulsions from state schools are well below their peaks of the 1990s.

      "bodyText": "An unexplained \u201csecurity incident\u201d and Royal Air Force operation closed airspace around Heathrow on Friday morning, with dozens of arriving planes forced to stack for an hour or divert to other airports due to lack of fuel. A military flight from nearby RAF Northolt stopped scheduled passenger planes landing at Heathrow, Britain\u2019s busiest airport, for about 20 minutes from 9am. Military and civilian VIP aircraft use RAF Northolt, near Ruislip in west London, home to units from the armed services and the Ministry of Defence. The RAF\u2019s 32 Squadron, which operates flights for the royal family, is based at Northolt. A spokesman for Heathrow said the RAF\u2019s request to close the airspace was \u201cunplanned\u201d. He said: \u201cArrivals were paused briefly this morning due to an RAF request for an operational flight within part of Heathrow\u2019s airspace.\u201d The RAF said the flight had taken longer than anticipated. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe RAF can confirm that a flight was completed this morning by one of our assets from RAF Northolt. \u201cThis flight was coordinated with Heathrow ATC but had to extend by a few minutes to complete its sortie. The minor delays caused to civilian air traffic are regretted.\u201d At least four British Airways flights and one Virgin Atlantic flight were forced to divert to other London airports including Gatwick, Stansted and Luton. Passengers on affected planes said they were told by pilots that the delay was due to a security incident. One passenger on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Los Angeles that diverted to Gatwick shortly before it was due to land spoke of the \u201calarming\u201d experience as the plane circled Heathrow. Anne Henry, a British TV producer, told the Mirror Online: \u201cIt was quite alarming when the captain announced after circling Heathrow for a while: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, we have about five to 10 minutes\u2019 fuel left so we may need to divert to Gatwick.\u2019\u201d After the Virgin plane refuelled, it took off again for Heathrow and landed almost three hours late. Passengers were given a letter apologising for a \u201csecurity incident\u201d disrupting the flight. The air traffic control service, Nats, said: \u201cWe worked closely with Heathrow this morning to minimise disruption following the pause in operations. Services are now operating normally.\u201d",

Beijing on Friday reported its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/chinas-birthrate-falls-to-lowest-level-despite-push-for-more-babies\">lowest birthrate since the founding of Communist China</a> over seven decades ago.</p> <p>Neighbouring Japan\u2019s own struggles to tackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/dementia-towns-japan-ageing-population\">an ageing population</a> and falling births were also thrown into relief this week when the young environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/japan-environment-minister-to-take-two-weeks-paternity-leave\">be taking two weeks of paternity leave</a>.</p> <p>Spread over three months, it might not seem like a radical proposition, but he will be the first cabinet minister ever to take time off to help care for a newborn.</p> <p>There are vast differences in political and social systems between the two countries. But for women with any kind of career ambitions \u2013 and men who might like to spend more time with their families \u2013 there are painful similarities.</p> <p>Few women hold positions of political power either in Beijing or Tokyo, and workplace culture is often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/12/two-more-japanese-medical-schools-admit-discriminating-against-women\">stacked against women</a>, particularly those who hope to combine a career with motherhood.</p> <p>Japan is starting to make the link between parents\u2019 \u2013 and women\u2019s \u2013 choices and the country\u2019s birthrate, though it may have a very long way to go yet. The chief cabinet secretary said he hoped Koizumi\u2019s decision would have a positive impact on attitudes.</p> <p>As the scion of a powerful political family, married to a television celebrity, who has been named as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/shinzo-abe-promotes-rising-star-shinjiro-koizumi-in-cabinet-reshuffle\">potential future premier</a>, his move was widely scrutinised.</p> <p>In China, however, there has been little public recognition of incentives for young people, particularly women, to have small families or none at all.</p> <p>The bureaucrats who laid out the one-child policy didn\u2019t seem to have really grappled with the possibility that demographic changes might not be easily reversible, said Mei Fong, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/04/one-child-story-china-most-radical-experiment-mei-fong-review\">One Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe whole policy was drafted by missile scientists.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s government has been trying to manage a public U-turn on one of its biggest, longest running and most powerful policy and propaganda campaigns for several years now, urging a generation of only-children \u2013 born under its one-child policy \u2013 that they should have more babies themselves. But the posters, public information campaigns and official exhortations appear to have had almost no discernible effect. Beijing on Friday reported its lowest birthrate since the founding of Communist China over seven decades ago. Neighbouring Japan\u2019s own struggles to tackle an ageing population and falling births were also thrown into relief this week when the young environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced he would be taking two weeks of paternity leave. Spread over three months, it might not seem like a radical proposition, but he will be the first cabinet minister ever to take time off to help care for a newborn. There are vast differences in political and social systems between the two countries. But for women with any kind of career ambitions \u2013 and men who might like to spend more time with their families \u2013 there are painful similarities. Few women hold positions of political power either in Beijing or Tokyo, and workplace culture is often stacked against women, particularly those who hope to combine a career with motherhood. Japan is starting to make the link between parents\u2019 \u2013 and women\u2019s \u2013 choices and the country\u2019s birthrate, though it may have a very long way to go yet. The chief cabinet secretary said he hoped Koizumi\u2019s decision would have a positive impact on attitudes. As the scion of a powerful political family, married to a television celebrity, who has been named as a potential future premier, his move was widely scrutinised. In China, however, there has been little public recognition of incentives for young people, particularly women, to have small families or none at all. The bureaucrats who laid out the one-child policy didn\u2019t seem to have really grappled with the possibility that demographic changes might not be easily reversible, said Mei Fong, author of One Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment. \u201cThe whole policy was drafted by missile scientists. It was based around mechanical systems, where you set a target then adjust accordingly. Women\u2019s bodies were treated like engines, you set inputs and expect to get a certain output,\u201d she said. \u201cThe architect of the whole (one-child) project acknowledged many years ago that an ageing population could eventually lead to problems, but just said \u2018that can be adjusted\u2019. As if women\u2019s bodies can just be treated like levers, moved up and down.\u201d Single daughters have grown up in a system that taught whole families that limiting family size was a path to happiness, prosperity and social mobility. Now they work in an environment where women are penalised for their gender even before their first day on the job. Pregnancy and motherhood bring another level of discrimination for many. That combination of deeply sexist constraints and years of propaganda have proven powerfully effective as contraceptives for many women. A government that is very good at coercion \u2013 forcing abortions or heavy fines on those who broke the laws \u2013 struggles with inducements, or indeed with stepping away from the idea of social engineering. Its push for a higher birthrate is within highly constricted boundaries. The government wants more babies, but only the ones that it considers the right kind of babies, born into a traditional marriage of a man and a woman. Single mothers face fines or obstacles to accessing social services for their children. One woman has been suing just for the right to freeze her eggs. With same-sex marriage not legal, gay and lesbian couples struggle to become parents. In the name of \u201cethnic equality\u201d, the government also recently reduced the number of children ethnic minority couples are allowed, which used to be higher than for the majority Han. \u201cUrban educated working women are the ones who are going to suffer the most, they are the ones seen as the ideal birth vehicles for China\u2019s future, the handmaidens,\u201d said Fong. \u201cThey face all kinds of pressure from families, from society, to reproduce.\u201d",

Manchester United are close to buying Bruno, a 25-year-old who looks and sounds like a composite replicant of every generically useful Portuguese footballer of the last two decades. Bruno is not strictly a Mendes player. Mendes is just \u201cbrokering\u201d the deal.</p> <p>But if you want to get something done, well \u2026</p> <p>The Mendes mode of business is well established now, a pattern of working through a circle of European clubs happy to keep selling the same stock to one another.</p> <p>The football blog Tugascout has a list of players who have followed this dance to the music of money. Radamel Falcao has been at Porto, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Monaco; Diogo Jota has been at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Porto and Wolves; Filipe Augusto had five Mendes clubs on his show-reel before the age of 25.</p> <p>Each move generates a slice of pie. Each move keeps the Keynesian multiplier effect running. Although this isn\u2019t command economics, it\u2019s commodity trading, skating ahead of the market but in a world where you have an in at both ends, where there is little regulation and where Mendes has been able to enact a closing in on power from all fronts. </p> <p>There is another plank to this now, one that brings a more tangible sense of unease. Mendes has also seized the means of production. Or at least he has Famalic\u00e3o, a rebranded Portuguese minnow with a \u201cprivileged relationship\u201d to the great rainmaker.</p> <p>Famalic\u00e3o were bought two years ago by the Israeli billionaire and Mendes pal Idan Ofer. Miraculously this tiny club has since managed to sign players from top leagues around Europe \u2013 from nowhere, and with a 5,000-seat stadium. Famalic\u00e3o topped the Primeira Liga in the autumn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a4125fc5408a353ee91d0949cd7b5fe9c936bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a4125fc5408a353ee91d0949cd7b5fe9c936bb/279_46_3213_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Mendes with Cristiano Ronaldo.

The agent\u2019s first deal was the transfer of the young Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Famalic\u00e3o are still in with a shot of reaching the Champions League spots, an event that would have a serious knock-on effect on Mendes\u2019s trading future. To do so they need to overhaul Benfica and Porto, while staying ahead of Sporting Lisbon. But wait: Mendes has just helped rub out Benfica\u2019s key midfielder and is doing his best to whistle away Sporting\u2019s top scorer.</p> <p>The lines of interest and influence are even more complex. Another Mendes-stacked club, Wolves, is competing with United and Spurs for fourth place in the Premier League. The arrival of both Fernandeses will have a knock-on hit here too. Are you following this game of third-party five-dimensional Jenga? Is anyone?</p> <p>There is, of course, no suggestion Mendes would actually consider these calculations. He\u2019s a deal-closer. These are arms-length third-party services. But still it feels problematic that such thoughts could even be possible, that this balance of interests is within his gift. Everyone is accountable to someone in sport, if only to the basic notion of robust competition. Except for the super-agent \u2013 who is in effect God, answerable only to his own design.</p> <p>There are a couple of things worth saying about this. Firstly, is it all bad? Agents enable trade and empower players. Mendes is said to be a fantastic talent scout. On the other hand, is this what sport is for?</p> <p>Mendes has overseen \u00a31bn in player sales while remaining essentially parasitic. Bad habits are feasted upon, the desire for instant fixes fed, a spinning of the roulette wheel encouraged. In agent terms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/17/renato-sanches-bayern-minich-swansea-good-bad\" title=\"\">the career of Renato Sanches</a> is one vast high-fiving success, a cash-drenched miracle. In sporting terms it looks like a disaster, a case of talent monetised but also stunted in the process.</p> <p>The more pointed question is, will it ever stop? The Mendes supremacy has its roots in two elements: the single European market and Ronaldo. His first ever mega-deal was Ronaldo to United, the perfect deal for the perfect agent-player, a deal that has glossed and illuminated every other one since. But there aren\u2019t many Cristiano Ronaldos around. Most of Mendes\u2019s business is quality filler, the kind of competent high-end workers who will soon require visas to work in the UK. For English football this is, in theory, the last pre-Brexit transfer window.</p> <p>It seems laughably naive to suggest this might kill, or even impair, what Mendes does. The Premier League is convinced it can agree a process with the Home Office to keep the pipelines open. The prosperous tend to prosper.</p> <p>This is heading only one way. Your club, your sport, your nominally coherent league. We all live on Mendes island now.</p>",

Radamel Falcao has been at Porto, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Monaco; Diogo Jota has been at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Porto and Wolves; Filipe Augusto had five Mendes clubs on his show-reel before the age of 25. Each move generates a slice of pie. Each move keeps the Keynesian multiplier effect running. Although this isn\u2019t command economics, it\u2019s commodity trading, skating ahead of the market but in a world where you have an in at both ends, where there is little regulation and where Mendes has been able to enact a closing in on power from all fronts. There is another plank to this now, one that brings a more tangible sense of unease. Mendes has also seized the means of production. Or at least he has Famalic\u00e3o, a rebranded Portuguese minnow with a \u201cprivileged relationship\u201d to the great rainmaker. Famalic\u00e3o were bought two years ago by the Israeli billionaire and Mendes pal Idan Ofer. Miraculously this tiny club has since managed to sign players from top leagues around Europe \u2013 from nowhere, and with a 5,000-seat stadium. Famalic\u00e3o topped the Primeira Liga in the autumn. Famalic\u00e3o are still in with a shot of reaching the Champions League spots, an event that would have a serious knock-on effect on Mendes\u2019s trading future. To do so they need to overhaul Benfica and Porto, while staying ahead of Sporting Lisbon. But wait: Mendes has just helped rub out Benfica\u2019s key midfielder and is doing his best to whistle away Sporting\u2019s top scorer. The lines of interest and influence are even more complex. Another Mendes-stacked club, Wolves, is competing with United and Spurs for fourth place in the Premier League. The arrival of both Fernandeses will have a knock-on hit here too. Are you following this game of third-party five-dimensional Jenga? Is anyone? There is, of course, no suggestion Mendes would actually consider these calculations. He\u2019s a deal-closer. These are arms-length third-party services. But still it feels problematic that such thoughts could even be possible, that this balance of interests is within his gift. Everyone is accountable to someone in sport, if only to the basic notion of robust competition. Except for the super-agent \u2013 who is in effect God, answerable only to his own design. There are a couple of things worth saying about this. Firstly, is it all bad? Agents enable trade and empower players. Mendes is said to be a fantastic talent scout. On the other hand, is this what sport is for? Mendes has overseen \u00a31bn in player sales while remaining essentially parasitic. Bad habits are feasted upon, the desire for instant fixes fed, a spinning of the roulette wheel encouraged. In agent terms the career of Renato Sanches is one vast high-fiving success, a cash-drenched miracle. In sporting terms it looks like a disaster, a case of talent monetised but also stunted in the process. The more pointed question is, will it ever stop? The Mendes supremacy has its roots in two elements: the single European market and Ronaldo. His first ever mega-deal was Ronaldo to United, the perfect deal for the perfect agent-player, a deal that has glossed and illuminated every other one since. But there aren\u2019t many Cristiano Ronaldos around. Most of Mendes\u2019s business is quality filler, the kind of competent high-end workers who will soon require visas to work in the UK. For English football this is, in theory, the last pre-Brexit transfer window. It seems laughably naive to suggest this might kill, or even impair, what Mendes does. The Premier League is convinced it can agree a process with the Home Office to keep the pipelines open. The prosperous tend to prosper. This is heading only one way. Your club, your sport, your nominally coherent league. We all live on Mendes island now.",

For the first time, an American president will face the ultimate sanction not because he walked into a legal trap set by his opponents, or because of some broader, underlying rift in society, but because of the actual \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d on the charge sheet.

But it is worth bearing in mind, as you watch 53 Republican members of the Senate \u2013 now remade as a jury, every senator having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/trump-impeachment-sketch-senate-oath-controversial-hyperpartisan-age\" title=\"\">sworn an oath</a> to \u201cdo impartial justice according to the constitution and laws\u201d \u2013 echo the vocabulary of the accused and blithely dismiss the whole business as a \u201choax\u201d or \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.</p> \n<p>They\u2019re wrong because Trump\u2019s is the standout case in a category of notoriety that is already vanishingly small. Andrew Johnson was the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000c9rc\" title=\"\">first president to be impeached</a> \u2013 in effect, indicted \u2013 by the US House of Representatives, back in 1868. No one would want to defend Johnson or his politics. He was a foul-mouthed, racist drunk, the accidental president who\u2019d only been vice-president for a few weeks when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, leaving him in the top job. Johnson was only ever meant to be a symbolic number two: the governor of Tennessee who until a year earlier had been a slave owner, he\u2019d been picked by Lincoln as a gesture of reconciliation towards the slave-owning south defeated in the civil war. With Lincoln dead, Johnson found himself facing a Congress determined to grant at least a modicum of rights to 4 million former slaves. Johnson was bent on thwarting that effort at every turn.</p> \n<p>Still, you don\u2019t have to feel a shred of sympathy for Johnson to recognise that his foes on Capitol Hill set for him what the constitutional law expert, Noah Feldman, calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/01/16/is-trump-above-the-law/\" title=\"\">an impeachment trap</a>\u201d. They passed a law compelling him to keep in post appointees of his predecessor \u2013 including officials willing to grant basic liberties to newly freed black Americans. Congress even wrote into law that any violation would constitute a \u201chigh misdemeanor\u201d, ensuring that such a violation would automatically count as an impeachable offence. So when Johnson sacked his secretary of war, he promptly walked right into the impeachment trap.</p> \n<p>The circumstances for the second impeachee, Bill Clinton, were rather different, but he, too, could claim entrapment. Remember, he was asked under oath whether he had had a sexual relationship with the White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. His inquisitors knew what he did not: that they had DNA evidence proving just such a relationship. Clinton denied it, lying under oath. He had walked into a perjury trap, and it was for that crime that he was tried in the Senate more than 20 years ago.</p> \n<p>No such chicanery was necessary to ensnare Trump. Of his own volition and requiring no prodding, he made that fateful 25 July phone call to the president of Ukraine in which he pressured him to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s political rival, Joe Biden, on pain of losing $400m in essential military aid or forfeiting a coveted meeting at the White House. That is as clear an abuse of power as it is possible to imagine, using the muscle of the US government for personal gain. It took no canny drafting of laws or sneaky questioning under oath. Unlike Johnson and Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/lev-parnas-ukraine-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani\" title=\"\">Trump did this all by himself</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c6f0f3c7-3e73-454b-90ea-e584b5693e8a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-2zS1x83cNc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump has no access to the hiding places where his predecessors in the presidential dock took refuge. He cannot claim, as Johnson could, that any violation of the law was on a narrow technicality.

They conceived of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d much more broadly: merely to break the public trust should merit removal. But as a matter of political reality, impeachment has tended to come down to a balder question: has a law been broken? And with Trump the answer could not be louder or clearer.</p> \n<p>The Trump case is more straightforward than the others in another sense, too. The Johnson episode was all about race, about a nation emerging from the smoking ruins of a civil war fought over slavery.

His impeachment was the culmination of a near-decade-long effort to suggest that Clinton\u2019s character alone made him unfit for the White House and therefore an illegitimate president.</p> \n<p>You could probably build an impeachment case against Trump that rested on either race or gender.

On gender, this is a man who has been credibly accused of sexual assault and who bragged of doing so. Similarly, there are those who see Trump, like Johnson or Clinton before him, as an essentially illegitimate occupant of the White House, not least because in 2016 he won 3m fewer votes than his defeated opponent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/16/donald-trump-narcissists\">Closure is hard to come by in a world run by narcissists like Trump | Emma Brockes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And yet the actual impeachment case against Trump does not relate to, or depend on, any of that.

      "body": "<p>The actor Derek Fowlds, who has died aged 82, enjoyed long-running stardom on the small screen in popular TV shows ranging from children\u2019s programmes to sitcom and drama.</p> <p>To a generation of young viewers, he was familiar as \u201cMr Derek\u201d in The Basil Brush Show. For four years (1969-73) he weathered bad jokes and puns from the waistcoat-wearing fox puppet, who usually followed them up with his catchphrase: \u201cBoom! Boom!\u201d During the first day of recording, it occurred to Fowlds: \u201cI\u2019ve had 10 years as a straight actor \u2013 what are people going to think?\u201d However, he became a household name, adopting a slightly stern demeanour to keep the furry star in check, in response to constant interruptions, such as Basil rustling a bag of jelly babies and offering him one at a critical moment.</p> <p>Each week, alongside a series of sketches and a musical guest, came \u201cstory time\u201d, in which Fowlds would read Basil a tale about one of his fictional ancestors.

      "bodyText": "The actor Derek Fowlds, who has died aged 82, enjoyed long-running stardom on the small screen in popular TV shows ranging from children\u2019s programmes to sitcom and drama. To a generation of young viewers, he was familiar as \u201cMr Derek\u201d in The Basil Brush Show. For four years (1969-73) he weathered bad jokes and puns from the waistcoat-wearing fox puppet, who usually followed them up with his catchphrase: \u201cBoom! Boom!\u201d During the first day of recording, it occurred to Fowlds: \u201cI\u2019ve had 10 years as a straight actor \u2013 what are people going to think?\u201d However, he became a household name, adopting a slightly stern demeanour to keep the furry star in check, in response to constant interruptions, such as Basil rustling a bag of jelly babies and offering him one at a critical moment. Each week, alongside a series of sketches and a musical guest, came \u201cstory time\u201d, in which Fowlds would read Basil a tale about one of his fictional ancestors. The wily fox was the creation of Peter Firmin, and was operated and voiced by Ivan Owen in the cultivated style of the caddish comedy actor Terry-Thomas. The Basil Brush Show was rare for a children\u2019s programme in featuring topical political jokes \u2013 and politics was at the core of Fowlds\u2019s next TV success. The satirical sitcom Yes Minister (1980-84), written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, was disarmingly realistic in its depiction of the machinations of government and the power wielded by civil servants. \u201cIts closely observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy,\u201d declared the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Fowlds played Bernard Woolley, the private secretary struggling to keep the peace between the idealistic but inept new minister of administrative affairs, Jim Hacker (played by Paul Eddington), as he tries to shake up his department, and Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne), the permanent under-secretary, speaking in gobbledegook as he attempts to block change. Nervously steering a moderating course in the role \u2013 with Bernard\u2019s loyalties split between his political and civil service bosses \u2013 Fowlds then appeared with Eddington and Hawthorne in the sequel, Yes, Prime Minister (1986-88), in which Hacker achieves his ultimate political ambition of running the country \u2013 and the writers revealed him to be a Tory. Both sitcoms were showered with accolades, including five Bafta awards. Just a short time afterwards, Fowlds began a long run as the crotchety Oscar Blaketon throughout all 342 episodes and 18 series of the feelgood Sunday evening drama Heartbeat (1992-2010), set around the fictional North Yorkshire village of Aidensfield in the 1960s and based on the Constable novels by Nicholas Rhea \u2013 the pen name of a former police officer, Peter Walker. Fowlds was joined in the original cast by Nick Berry as PC Nick Rowan, Niamh Cusack as Nick\u2019s wife, Kate, and Bill Maynard as the lovable rogue Claude Jeremiah Greengrass.

During the second world war, when Derek was three, his father, a sales rep, died of cancer, so he, his sister Babs and their mother moved to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, to live with his grandmother.

Other roles included Randolph Churchill in Edward the Seventh (1975), Oliver Davidson in the political thriller Rules of Engagement (1989), Michael Coley in the 1991 series of the crime drama Chancer and John Gutteridge in Firm Friends (1992-94). Fowlds\u2019s autobiography, A Part Worth Playing, was published in 2015. His first marriage, to Wendy Tory (1964-73), ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to the Blue Peter presenter Lesley Judd (1974-78), from whom he separated after less than a year. Jo Lindsay, Fowlds\u2019s partner of 36 years, died in 2012. He is survived by the two sons of his first marriage, Jamie and Jeremy. \u2022 Derek James Fowlds, actor, born 2 September 1937; died 17 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "The White House has unveiled Donald Trump\u2019s legal team for his Senate impeachment trial, a list of attorneys whose own ageing controversies threaten to overshadow their efforts to defend the president. As the impeachment process enters a major new phase next week, Trump\u2019s defense team will include Alan Dershowitz, known for defending the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and Kenneth Starr, the dogged prosecutor who led the investigation that culminated in the 1998 impeachment of former president Bill Clinton and lost a university post in 2016 for mishandling sexual assaults on campus. \u201cThis is definitely an \u2018are you fucking kidding me?\u2019 kinda day,\u201d tweeted Monica Lewinsky, whom Starr reportedly threatened with criminal charges in 1998 to get her to testify in forensic detail about her relationship with Clinton, which became a central focus of the impeachment inquiry against him. Dershowitz sought to deny in a radio interview Friday afternoon that he was a \u201cmember of the Trump legal team\u201d, saying that he would speak on behalf of the US constitution. But he has been invited to speak by Trump, he is expected to speak during the time allotted to Trump\u2019s defense and he will make an argument that effectively and exclusively encourages the president\u2019s acquittal. The question of how Trump\u2019s legal team will defend him sharpened as the House of Representatives, which impeached Trump last month, handed over the process to the Senate, where a trial will culminate in a vote on whether to remove Trump from office. The trial is expected to last at least two weeks and could feature testimony by close Trump advisers and former advisers who have yet to speak out on allegations that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine in an effort to manufacture damaging headlines about the former vice-president Joe Biden, a political rival. Trump was impeached for abuse of power in the scheme and for obstructing the efforts of Congress to investigate it. A two-thirds majority of senators present would be required to remove Trump from office. Most political observers think he is safe, given the lockstep loyalty of Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate. But an element of unpredictability in the impeachment trial means that neither Trump nor his Republican surrogates are quite in control of the president\u2019s political fate. If Democrats can recruit just a few Republican senators to join their call for witnesses to testify at the Senate trial, new details about Trump\u2019s attempt to extract a \u201cfavor\u201d from Ukraine could emerge, with unknown consequences for his approval rating as he seeks re-election in November. A majority of American voters have consistently said in opinion polls that Trump abused his power and deserves impeachment, including in polling directed by conservative media organizations. Trump\u2019s legal team will be led by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and by Jay Sekulow, a longtime personal lawyer to Trump. Also defending Trump will be Pam Bondi, a White House impeachment adviser; Jane Raskin, who defended Trump during the Robert Mueller inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US election; and Robert Ray, who was on the independent counsel team with Starr in the Clinton era. As White House counsel, Cipollone\u2019s strict role is to give legal advice pertaining to the presidency, as opposed to defending Trump personally. But he has been embroiled in impeachment since he signed an October letter declaring that the White House would not turn over documents or otherwise cooperate with impeachment investigators \u2013 a letter that Democrats later made exhibit A of Trump\u2019s obstruction of Congress. Dershowitz, 81, a retired professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, and Starr, 73, formerly president of Baylor University in Texas, have demonstrated their loyalty to Trump in frequent appearances on cable television. But their presence in the Senate chamber for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial could complicate certain features of Trump\u2019s defense, including the attempt by top Republicans to block new witness testimony. In arguing for witnesses, Democrats will be able to point to the extraordinarily wide net for testimony that Starr cast in his five-year investigation of Clinton, which included interviews with ex-boyfriends of Lewinsky and the White House window washers. Continuing controversies attached to Starr and Dershowitz, both of whom worked as lawyers for Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell last year, could distract from the effort to exculpate Trump. Starr stepped down as president of Baylor in 2016 following an investigation into allegations that he failed to respond to a sexual assault crisis involving the school\u2019s football team. Starr was not found guilty of wrongdoing and the two sides described the separation as a mutual agreement. Dershowitz, a prominent first amendment litigator, found deeper notoriety as a friend and adviser to Epstein. One of Epstein\u2019s victims has accused Dershowitz in court of sexually abusing and defaming her; in November, he countersued, denying any misconduct and claiming that he was being defamed and subjected to emotional distress. Dershowitz has said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn the \u201cextent\u201d of Epstein\u2019s crimes and said Epstein\u2019s case was the one from his career that he regretted taking. Apart from Lewinsky, the announcement of Trump\u2019s team was met with degrees of disgust and mirth. David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush, tweeted: \u201cCannot believe it\u2019s possible to hire this calibre of representation without paying a nickel for it.\u201d",

Even as David Attenborough warned of Earth\u2019s \u201ccrisis moment\u201d, the UK government rescued ailing airline Flybe on the basis that some people can\u2019t get to work between Wales and Scotland or wherever any other way. Eventually, surviving businessmen will be able to row between mountain peaks, but for now corporate efficiency trumped the climate emergency. Or the \u201cclimate debate\u201d, as some still have it, even though it\u2019s the sort of debate that should ideally ensue when I tell my children not to run in the road \u2013 ie, none. And so to the global backdrop. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, must be religious, on the basis he\u2019s offered \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims of Australia\u2019s raging bushfires. In any reasonable theology, however, Morrison\u2019s decision to serve in a cabinet that abolished the country\u2019s climate commission, to slash fire and rescue budgets, and to ignore repeated concerns of fire chiefs would suggest he\u2019s going to burn in hell. Or in Australia, which will probably be quicker. Watching the unprecedented fires provokes a strong sense that the Earth is bored with the series, and is fast-forwarding to the end. In fact, there\u2019s a school of thought that says we should stop having the climate emergency discussion in terms of us killing the planet, and reframe it to acknowledge that it will be the planet killing us. Instead of seeing Mother Nature as a sort of ethereally benign matriarch, it would probably get more people in the right headspace if we thought of her as Medea, or Karen Matthews. Morrison has a spiritual twin in Richard Branson, who \u2013 as part-owner of Flybe \u2013 was one of the rescue plan\u2019s impoverished beneficiaries. Branson\u2019s private Necker Island has twice been ravaged by the effects of extreme weather events in the past few years, an eventuality that always sees him pose for angry but determined photos among the wreckage, presumably in a bid to garner sympathy.

It\u2019s time to wind down today\u2019s weekend preview blog, because ... well, to be brutally honest, it\u2019s been a long week, I\u2019m thirsty and want to go for a pint. Here\u2019s hoping you enjoy whatever it is you do to unwind this weekend, particularly if it involves going to the football. Peace out. Preview: Watford v Tottenham Preview: Arsenal v Sheffield United Preview: Brighton v Aston Villa Preview: Norwich City v Bournemouth Preview: West Ham v Everton Preview: Manchester City v Crystal Palace Preview: Southampton v Wolves Carlo Ancelotti speaks ... Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed claims Everton\u2019s trip to West Ham this weekend has taken on added significance because he got the job at Goodison Park ahead of David Moyes. The Scot was linked with a return to the club he managed for more than a decade last month but the availability of Ancelotti saw the decorated Italian handed a four-and-a-half-year contract. Since then, Moyes has been reappointed as West Ham boss, and Ancelotti is convinced he will be focused on his own club and not how he was overlooked by the Everton hierarchy. \u201cThe motivation is there to try to improve West Ham\u2019s position in the table, to try to do the best at his job,\u201d said Ancelotti. \u201cHe has no extra motivation to play against Everton. He was here for a lot of years, he did really well at this club and everyone respects him. It will be an interesting game and I hope that we play a good game and try to win.\u201d Ancelotti revealed he will be without Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson for the trip to the London Stadium, as both players are nursing minor injuries. Yerry Mina is in contention for a place in the back four after recovering from a knock. Fitba corner: Hearts have announced that Steven Naismith has been appointed club captain by manager Daniel Stendel, following the German\u2019s decision to drop Christophe Berra and tell him to find a new club. With Hearts anchored to the bottom of the Scottish Premiership table, six points from safety, their own fans and those of other Scottish teams have reacted with humour to the appointment of the injury prone Naismith. Rodgers: Slimani-to-Villa could prove too complicated Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has warned Aston Villa that a loan move for Foxes forward Islam Slimani is likely to be \u201ctoo complicated\u201d. Villa are desperately chasing a new striker after Wesley was recently ruled out for the season with an ACL injury, while Keinan Davis is also on the sidelines, and Jonathan Kodjia is set to move to Qatari side Al Gharafa. It is understood Villa will this weekend sort out the international clearance paperwork that will allow Tanzania international Mbwana Samatta to complete an \u00a38.5m move from Belgian side Genk. But they are also believed to be chasing Slimani, who in August joined Monaco on a season-long loan from Leicester. City\u2019s former record signing, who moved to the Foxes for \u00a329m in August 2016 from Sporting Lisbon, has scored seven goals in 13 Ligue 1 appearances for Monaco. However, a move to Villa means Monaco would have to consent to release the 31-year-old Algeria international, as well as Leicester sanctioning the deal. \u201cI think that looks like it\u2019s probably going to be too complicated,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cThere is interest in him, but he is there at Monaco and due to be there for the season. I\u2019m not sure if anything will happen on that or not, but it will just make it a little bit complicated.\u201d Jurgen Klopp on the Africa Cup of Nations ... During his press conference this afternoon, Jurgen Klopp answered questions on the decision to reschedule the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations back to January and the accompanying ramifications for Liverpool, who are likely to lose Egypt\u2019s Mo Salah, Senegal\u2019s Sadio Mane and Guinea\u2019s Naby Keita for up to six weeks before and during the competition. He is understandably unhappy about the switch. \u201cThe African Cup of Nations going back to January is, for us, a catastrophe,\u201d said the Liverpool manager, who claims the decision will affect the club\u2019s transfer policy. \u201cWe will not sell Sadio, Mo or Naby now because they have a tournament in January and February - of course not. \u201cBut if you have to make a decision about bringing in a player, it is a massive one because before the season you know for four weeks you don\u2019t have them. That\u2019s a normal process and as a club you have to think about these things.\u201d If it\u2019s any consolation to Jurgen, Jonathan Wilson stated on the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast yesterday, that he reckons there\u2019s a good chance the competition will be moved from Cameroon and staged in a country with a more suitable climate in its original summer slot. Ashley Young speaks: On the verge of signing for Inter, the Manchester United winger told waiting reporters that it was a very nice day, the weather was very good and that it was his first time in Milan. So now you know. Lampard: Ross Barkley is going nowhere Frank Lampard has insisted Ross Barkley will not be leaving Stamford Bridge any time soon, despite West Ham admitting interest in signing the Chelsea midfielder on loan. \u201cThere\u2019s no talk here of Ross Barkley going anywhere; he\u2019s our player,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cHe\u2019s played the last couple of games and done very well. I\u2019ve got a lot of faith in Ross.\u201d Klopp rails against fixture schedule ... again Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes the injury to Harry Kane which could force him to miss Euro 2020 may eventually force action from the FA on fixture congestion. The England captain had surgery on a ruptured hamstring tendon at the weekend and, although the initial prognosis was he could return by April, doubts are now being expressed that he will be out for longer and miss this summer\u2019s tournament. Klopp, a vocal opponent of what he considers a bloated schedule, felt that may force a change in thinking among the powers that be. \u201cI feel massively for Harry Kane, I now hear he may not be in the Euros,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the first time some English people in the FA may think \u2018Oh, too many games maybe\u2019. Something has to happen for them to really start thinking about it.\u201d WSL preview: The Arsenal manager, Joe Montemurro, is down to 17 players before the crucial Women\u2019s Super League game against Chelsea on Sunday, wirtes Suzanne Wrack. Nuno issues Wolves rallying call With his team winless in five games and a trip to revitalised Southampton ahoy this weekend, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo has called on his weary troops to rally ahead of their 39th match of a gruelling season. \u201cEveryone knows how we play,\u201d he said. \u201cTeams are trying to find new things and we have to raise our standards. This is the process we have and we have to try new solutions.\u201d Nuno also revealed that defender Ruben Vinagre has been ruled out for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury. Wales to face Austria and the USA Wales have announced March friendlies against Austria and the United States as part of their build-up to this summer\u2019s European Championship. Ryan Giggs\u2019 side will play fellow Euro 2020 finalists Austria at the Liberty Stadium on Friday, 27 March - the first time Wales will have played in Swansea for seven years. Wales will then host the USA at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday, March 30 in what will be only the second-ever fixture between the two nations. Christian Eriksen to play for Spurs against Watford Christian Eriksen will play when Tottenham visit Watford on Saturday, despite speculation about his future. The midfielder is out of contract in the summer and has been heavily linked with a move to Inter this month but Jose Mourinho insists the Serie A club have not yet made an offer. \u201cYou have to ask the agent and Inter because they know more than me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are confident it is because they are ready to make us an offer, which didn\u2019t happen yet. When I see people speaking, especially people with responsibilities, it makes me surprised. He is trying to do his best and it is normal until 31 January his brain is not totally focused. \u201cIt is a normal consequence of the situation. I still don\u2019t understand that optimism. For a few matches people are saying he is playing his last game. Eriksen plays tomorrow.\u201d The latest on Olivier Giroud-to-Inter Inter are understood to be extremely eager to sign the Chelsea striker this month, but Frank Lampard insists that no deal has yet been agreed between the clubs. \u201cIf everything is right it might happen, but it\u2019s not, so whilst it\u2019s not, he\u2019s our player,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cAnd the great thing about Ollie is that he\u2019s got great experience and professionalism, and he\u2019s been nothing but great with us.\u201d In other news around Stamford Bridge, Reece James signed a new Chelsea deal this week, committing himself to his home club until 2025. \u201cI rate him very highly, I knew him as a youth player in the academy here,\u201d said Lampard of the young full-back. \u201cHe did fantastically well at Wigan last year and I tried to get him to Derby but we couldn\u2019t get him in mid-season. There\u2019s a lot more to come from Reece James, he\u2019s a really talented player.\u201d Roy Hodgson has been trash-talking ... \u201cWe need to go there in full humility and to understand we will be confronted with a team that is one of the best in Europe and quite capable of winning the Champions League,\u201d said the Crystal Palace manager ahead of his side\u2019s trip to Manchester City. \u201cI appreciate the way his (Guardiola\u2019s) teams play and the way he handles himself in interviews,\u201d added Hodgson. \u201cIt will be a pleasure to meet him again.\u201d Norwich City news Norwich boss Daniel Farke has been boosted by the return of several players as his side prepare to host Bournemouth in a Premier League relegation battle. Top scorer Teemu Pukki is available, with Ben Godfrey also expected to make his comeback from injury. \u201cA victory is always good for the confidence, for the mood, for the table,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one victory is not enough. To stay in this league we need to win seven out of our next 16 games.\u201d Fabinho and Matip are fit for Sunday In good news for Liverpool fans, Jurgen Klopp has revealed that both Joel Matip and Fabinho are available for selection for the league leaders\u2019 match against Manchester United on Sunday. Matip has been sidelined with injury since the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford on 20 October, while Fabinho has not played since Liverpool\u2019s draw with Napoli in the Champions League at the end of November. David Lammy: We\u2019ll beat racism in football by working with fans (and scanning their retinas and fingerprints) The Labour MP for Tottenham has written an interesting article in Parliament\u2019s The House magazine, in which \u2013 among other things \u2013 he makes the extremely controversial call for the introduction of retina and fingerprint technology to be used at football grounds. \u201cIf anything,: he writes. \u201cRacism in football has become more prevalent [than in the 1980s]; the proliferation of social media has made it easier to target players with vitriol.\u201d Lammy goes on to say that \u201cas a nation, we\u2019re good at condemning loutish incidents of racism\u201d before claiming, in what is appears to be a dig at the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that \u201cwe\u2019re less good at condemning the more articulate forms of racism spouted by our politicians, which is why Gary Neville stood out when he courageously bucked the trend. And we\u2019re less good at coming out strongly against forms of racial bias in our own media.\u201d Lammy believes \u201cthe FA needs to get serious about punishments and enforcements\u201d and ventures the controversial opinion that \u201cwe also need to reduce anonymity so that it\u2019s easier to keep offenders out of stadiums, via effective and equitable use of retina and fingerprint technology.\u201d A wise idea or a gross invasion of privacy? Would you, as a football fan, have a problem with Big Brother watching you? Let us know in the comments section below ... Your indoctrination starts here Exciting news from Southampton, who are celebrating their improved form under Ralph Hassenhuttl by staging their annual Family Day before, during and after their match against Wolves at St Mary\u2019s tomorrow. The Saints Brass will be providing musical entertainment, while fans are invited to try their hand on a climbing wall, \u201ctake on the pros with ICON Skills in the Fanzone\u201d, get a photo with club mascots Sammy and Mary, \u201cbe wowed\u201d by our incredible circus performers and buy discounted replica kit in the Saints Store. Right, that concludes my involvement for the moment. Barry, it\u2019s over to you. Eriksen will play on - for now Speaking at his presser today, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says Christian Eriksen will play when Tottenham visit Watford on Saturday, despite speculation he will be joining Internazionale. Mourinho insists the Serie A club have not yet made an offer. He said: \u201cYou have to ask the agent and Inter because they know more than me. If they are confident it is because they are ready to make us an offer, which didn\u2019t happen yet. When I see people speaking, especially people with responsibilities, it makes me surprised. He is trying to do his best and it is normal until January 31 his brain is not totally focused. It is a normal consequence of the situation. I still don\u2019t understand that optimism. For a few matches people are saying he is playing his last game. Eriksen plays tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhen I see people speaking, especially people with responsibilities, it makes me surprised\u201d is a classic of the Jos\u00e9 genre. Good to have his sunshine back. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Following Chelsea signing Sam Kerr, another Australian is heading to the Women\u2019s Super League. Hayley Raso, the forward, has joined from Brisbane Roar for an undisclosed fee. She will be free to play for Everton from mid-February, after featuring in Olympic qualifiers for the Matildas. Meanwhile, an Ev legend has been getting behind the women\u2019s team. Derby being investigated over their ground purchase, and Sheffield Wednesday were charged in November. Looks like that show has come to the end of its run, though clubs resorting to it shows the unsustainable nature of the Championship. On the Ashley Young being the oldest English Serie A debutant question, there\u2019s been a shout for David Beckham but he was 33 when he made his AC Milan bow in 2009 and Ashley Cole, who was also 33 when he made his Roma bow in 2014. Jamie Jackson has interviewed one of Manchester City\u2019s young stars unable to get into that glittering first team. Have to say, Joleon Lescott as the club\u2019s loan manager came as a revelation. Ashley Young arrives for his medical in Milan. Would he become the oldest Englishman to make his debut in Serie A at 34? Answer BTL if you fancy. On that impending Ashley Young transfer from BTL and Twitter. Premier League match previews are here. Ok, these are big shoes to fill on a red-hot day of soccer news but I will give it my best try. Let\u2019s start with memory lane. This game will also be remembered as Rio Ferdinand\u2019s last before he began his ban for skipping a drugs test. He limped off in the first-half. John Brewin will be taking over here for the next hour or two. Please be gentle with him ... What now for Glenn Murray? The Argus reports that Brighton manager Graham Potter is not inclined to let his striker, Glenn Murray, go to a Premier League rival. Reduced to the role of bit-part player at Brighton this season, the 36-year-old has been linked with a move to Aston Villa, who travel to the Amex Stadium tomorrow, but they are about to sign Genk striker Mbwana Samatta for \u00a38.5 instead. It has been reported that Murray is in talks with Nottingham Forest about a possible move to the City Ground. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to help the opposition,\u201d said Graham Potter yesterday. \u201cYou never know in football, of course, but Glenn was a sub for us and came on at Everton last week, so clearly he\u2019s someone we think can help us.\u201d Potter later insisted that Murray was welcome to stay at Brighton and insisted he had a healthy working relationship with the striker, despite rumours to the contrary. \u201cGlenn is with us,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked with him this morning and have no problems with him whatsoever. I\u2019m happy for him to be with us. I enjoy working with him and I hope he stays.\u201d Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to return to the UK? Lyon striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was linked with a possible move to the Premier League earlier this week, prompting his club president Jean-Michel Aulas to say that the player is not for sale. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, formerly of Celtic and Fulham, is believed to be the subject of interest at Chelsea, Manchester United and Newcastle. This morning, the Newcastle Chronicle report that Lyon are on the verge of signing Villarreal striker Karl Toko-Ekambi, whose agent had previously offered the Cameroonian forward to Newcastle for \u00a321m. Should Ekambi finalise his deal with Lyon, our colleagues in the north-east reckon President Aulus may reconsider his position on Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. More from Eddie Howe ... Bournemouth\u2019s manager has been waxing lyrical on the difficulties of bringing in attracting quality players to a club that\u2019s struggling and in the Premier League\u2019s relegation zone. \u201cI think a combination of things makes it very difficult for us in this window to recruit,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLeague position, availability of players, resources available to improve the squad. It\u2019s potentially going to be loans that we\u2019re looking at and it is not easy to find the right players to improve the squad. \u201cI could sign a whole host of players but I need someone to come in and actually improve what I\u2019ve got and I think that\u2019s the most difficult part. \u201cWe\u2019ll search until the end of the window because if there is that one player out there that can make the difference then we need to find him.\u201d Lend us your ears ... The latest edition of The Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast is here for your listening pleasure. Max Rushden chairs proceedings, soliciting controversial, highbrowed and often amusing opinion from esteemed guests Jonathan Wilson, Jon Brodkin and ... eh, me.

Ole on Ashley young\u2019s move to Inter Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has said that Manchester United weren\u2019t prepared to offer Ashley Young a two-year contract extension and intimated that the winger/wing-back/full-back/whatever he is these days had his heart set on a move to pastures new. Young will cough for the doctor at Inter today, before moving to the Serie A side for \u00a31.5m. \u201cHe\u2019s 35 in the summer and if he gets a two year contract somewhere I think it\u2019s up to him to take that,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to offer that. He has been a good servant, captain ... won trophies, league cups, but we\u2019ve got players coming through and when Ashley\u2019s head and mindset was on [a move to Inter] so why not now.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r refused to comment on United\u2019s ongoing pursuit of Sporting midfielder Bruno Fernandes. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you about any players that play for other teams,\u201d he said. Howe denies being asked to stand down at Bournemouth Eddie Howe has rubbished the suggestion that he was asked to resign his position at relegation-threatened Bournemouth, who have taken just four Premier League points from the past 33 available. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no truth in that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult moment, a negative moment. We\u2019ve got to find ways to improve and change our results, change our performances.\u201d Bournemouth travel to Norwich City tomorrow, for the mother of all six-pointers. Rashford unlikely to be fit for Liverpool In much the same way that Steve Bruce isn\u2019t going to jump into any windows for the sake of it, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r isn\u2019t going to be holding his breath. At least that\u2019s what he said upon being asked if Marcus Rashford, his star striker, would be fit for Manchester United\u2019s trip to Anfield on Sunday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold my breath,\u201d he said. \u201cI would probably think he won\u2019t be ready.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r sent Rashford on as a second half substitute during United\u2019s 1-0 win over Wolves in the FA Cup on Wednesday night, only to see the 22-year-old hobble off with a back injury a little over 15 minutes later. The Manchester United manager has been criticised for introducing the player, as it led to him exacerbating an existing injury. Steve Bruce hoping to freshen up his Newcastle squad Having sat down with Mike Ashley following Newcastle\u2019s midweek FA Cup win over Rochdale, Steve Bruce seems confident that Newcastle\u2019s owner will support him in the remaining fortnight of the January transfer window. \u201cWe just reiterated what I\u2019ve been saying to you guys,\u201d said Bruce to the Tyneside press posse this morning. \u201cWe showed what we\u2019re trying to do and he was very supportive of that. We\u2019ve got one or two plates spinning and we hope that we can add to the squad by the end of the month. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said from the start is we\u2019ve got one or two targets in mind; if they don\u2019t come off, then I\u2019m not just going to jump into the window for the sake of it. They have to improve us if we\u2019re going to act.\u201d Chris Wilder hails Sheffield United\u2019s success The Sheffield United manager has been speaking to the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate, who have been asking him about the remarkable manner in which his team have adapted to life in the Premier League. \u201cIt\u2019s an outstanding news story so far and I\u2019d love for it to be a brilliant story come the end of the season,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is one of the stand-out stories so far. A newly-promoted team coming up, playing the way we\u2019ve played and the position we are in and how we have done it - over the last two or three years as well and from a financial point of view too. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be talk about Liverpool and Manchester City, and while Leicester are going well, for us to be in sixth position is quite remarkable. We\u2019ve done fantastically well, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d You can sense there\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d coming, can\u2019t you? \u201cBut it\u2019s only this stage of the season and I\u2019m not into that,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m into the end of season\u2019s and reflection and how we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s still a lot of football to be played.\u201d Wilder\u2019s side take on Arsenal at the Emirates tomorrow afternoon, having already done a number on them courtesy of a Lys Mousset winner at Bramall Lane Bramall Lane in October. Maguire named Manchester United club captain Following the announcement that Ashley Young is off to Inter for a fee of \u20ac1.5m (\u00a31.3m), Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has revealed that Harry Maguire will be taking over from the 34-year-old as Manchester United\u2019s club captain. With the weekend upon us, it\u2019s time to bring you all the news that\u2019s fit to print - and much that probably isn\u2019t \u2013 ahead of another couple of days of hectic football action. Throughout the day we\u2019ll bring you news from assorted managerial press conferences, keep you updated on all the latest transfer tittle-tattle and generally keep you posted on anything else of note that\u2019s occurring on Planet Football.",

It had felt, he said, like having a steady job, and funded comfortable final years. In the last phase of his TV career, Fowlds also benefitted from the profession\u2019s pension top-up for older, frailer performers, playing patients in the BBC1 medical soaps Casualty and Doctors \u2013 the latter, in 2017, his final screen appearance.",

Anne Longfield said she had heard \u201chorror stories\u201d about children\u2019s experiences in isolation booths \u2013 spaces in which pupils sit in silence for hours as punishment for breaking school rules and disruptive behaviour.

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have ended the day with strong gains FTSE 100: up 64 points or 0.85% at 7674 German DAX: up 94 points or 0.7% at 13,524 French CAC: up 62 points or 1% at 6,100 So with Wall Street heading for new highs, again, that\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s our full story on the Chinese growth report which appears to have lifted stocks today: With the FTSE holding onto its six-month high, and stocks up around Europe, David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the day: The largely positive data from China combined with the dip in the pound pushed the FTSE 100 to a level last seen in July. In the final-quarter of 2019 the Chinese economy grew by 6%, meeting forecasts. The growth for the year was 6.1%, which was at the lower end of Beijing\u2019s guidance. The annual growth rate was the lowest in 29 years, but then again it is no secret that China\u2019s economy is slowing down. The fixed asset investment, industrial output plus retail sales reports from China all topped forecasts. In recent months the Chinese authorises have been introducing measures to spur-on economic activity, such as loosening lending restrictions, and the tactics appear to be working. Mining stocks like Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton plus Glencore are being helped by the China numbers. While internationally focused firms like GlaxoSmithKline, Diageo and AstraZeneca are benefitting from the slide in the pound \u2013 overseas revenues are given a lift. Boom! The FTSE 100 index of top UK-listed shares has just hit a new six-month high. The Footsie has gained 70 points, or 0.9%, to 7681, its highest level since July. That\u2019s partly due to the weak pound following the retail sales shocker, and partly due to hopes that China\u2019s economy is turning the corner after a tough 2019. Next Monday, the World Economic Forum kicks off in Davos. Climate chance is high on the agenda -- WEF\u2019s agenda-setters and policy-makers say it\u2019s now the top threat to the global economy. And WEF\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, is urging the companies attending to produce plans for achieving net zero carbon emissions, within 30 years. That might not be ambitious enough for campaigners, such as Greta Thunberg, who will be calling for immediate action on fossil fuels. This is the full text of Schwab\u2019s letter sent to Davos attendees, called \u201cActing on Climate Change\u201d. Dear Participant to the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting The opportunity and the need for companies and investors to show leadership on climate change is more eminent than ever before. Making a commitment to help tackle the urgent issue of climate change is also in line with the stakeholder imperative of the 2020 Davos Manifesto and the theme of the 50th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting: Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World. Consequently, as a leader of one of the world\u2019s foremost global companies and a valued partner of the World Economic Forum, we encourage you to use the opportunity of your upcoming participation to make a commitment to act on climate change. If you have not done so already, we invite you to set a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. A short accompanying note to this letter provides some options to help you in this regard. This initiative will be addressed at various Community Meetings taking place at the Annual Meeting. We look forward to the Annual Meeting 2020 being a breakthrough moment for business action on climate change and thank you in advance for your consideration and leadership in helping the world address this urgent global issue.  Something to read on the winding road up the mountain to Davos, or in the private jet..... Here\u2019s our news story on the retail sales slide: High street sales in Britain slumped in December as consumers reined in their spending over the key Christmas shopping period, adding to the gloom facing embattled retailers across the country and increasing the likelihood of an interest rate cut later this month. According to the Office for National Statistics, retail sales failed to rise for a record fifth month in a row in December as household spending in high street shops and online plunged by 0.6% from the previous month. Sounding the alarm over the health of the economy at the end of last year as Brexit uncertainty weighed on growth, the ONS said that sales had not risen on a monthly basis since July, the longest period since records began in 1996. Consumer spending over the final three months of the year fell by 1% compared with the previous quarter, while sales growth for the year dropped to 0.9%, below all estimates made by City economists in a Reuters poll.... More here: The pound has fallen almost half a cent today, back to $1.304, as the retail sales slump worries traders...and makes a rate cut more likely. If you strip out car sales, then UK retail sales slid by 0.8% last month -- much worse than expected, and the third decline in a row. Here are the key points from today\u2019s healthcheck on the UK retail industry. In the three months to December 2019, the quantity bought in retail sales decreased by 1.0% when compared with the previous three months. All sectors except household goods stores and fuel saw a decline in the quantity bought for the three-month on three-month movement; driven mainly by non-food stores at negative 1.0%. The quantity bought in December 2019 fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month; the fifth consecutive month of no growth. The quantity bought in food stores fell by 1.3% for the monthly growth rate, which was the largest fall since December 2016, also at 1.3%. Comparing the three months to December 2019 against the same three months a year ago, growth in the quantity bought increased by 1.6% in December 2019, despite a strong decline of 2.2% for department stores. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing was 19.0% in December 2019, compared with the 18.6% reported in November 2019 December\u2019s retail sales slump follows a flurry of bad news from the sector High street stores have struggled particularly badly, with consumers shunning physical stores in favour of web shopping. Already this year we\u2019re learned that: Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group has begun closing a fresh wave of stores after suffering a tough Christmas Primark, one of retail\u2019s success stories in recent years, saw sales drop over the festive period The latest inflation data show that retailers slashed prices last month, particularly clothing, in an attempt to attract customers Department store Beales is on the brink of collapse, while SuperDry and Joules have issued profits warnings John Lewis has warned that its staff bonus could be axed, after profits tumbled last year Mothercare and Links of London have both closed their UK shops, costing over 3,000 jobs, while Debenhams has shuttered 19 stores Duncan Weldon of The Economist reckons there\u2019s a real chance that The Bank of England cuts interest rates back to 0.5% at its next meeting (the decision comes on 30th January). Ryan Broomfield, partner at business services firm RSM, agrees that the 1.0% drop in UK retail sales in October-December is \u2018very disappointing\u2019. \u2018This is a particularly poor result given this is meant to be the Golden Quarter where seasonal sales are supposed to provide a revenue boost. In addition, these figures will not show the potential sting in the tail \u2013 the impact of consumers returning unwanted gifts after Christmas. \u2018This brings to an end what has been a pretty torrid 2019 for many high street operators, described by the British Retail Consortium as the worst for 25 years. Shoppers will have noticed the impact of store vacancies in retail parks and town centres, notably in areas which have lost large department stores and with further closures expected in 2020. Britain\u2019s retailers have suffered a grim Christmas, says Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. \u201c2019 was miserable for retailers, topped off by a dismal Christmas trading season. Today\u2019s figures will raise further questions around how robust the UK economy really is going into the year ahead. \u201cThe picture we\u2019re seeing from trading figures is that shoppers reined in spending in the months ahead of Christmas, with the December monthly figure showing there was no festive bounce to make up for lost ground. The Government has pledged action to help retailers and calls for action are likely to grow now. Economists and investors are alarmed by December\u2019s grim retail figures. The 0.5% slump in retail sales has dashed hopes of a recovery, and a so-called Boris Bounce in confidence. Paul Kavanagh of investment managers Patronus Partners says the figures are \u201ctruly awful\u201d Ranko Berich of Monex Europe says there\u2019s no silver lining in the report -- which could force the Bank of England to cut interest rates in two weeks. NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales fell unexpectedly in December, as Britain\u2019s high street crisis escalates. Retail sales volumes fell by 0.6% in December, the fifth monthly decline in a row. Economists has expected a rise to 0.5%. It means that retail sales fell by 1.0% in the October-December period compared to the previous quarter, despite Black Friday, Christmas and the Boxing Day sales all falling in the final two months of 2019. Food and clothing sales both fell over the last three months, with department stores continuing to struggle badly. The Office for National Statistics says: Food stores quantity bought fell by 0.6% in the three-month on three-month measure, with a strong monthly decline of 1.3% in December. This was the joint largest decline seen in food stores since December 2016 and the largest monthly decline since October 2015 of negative 1.8%. Anecdotal evidence from a number of stores stated that goods did not sell as well as expected in December 2019. Clothing experienced strong declines both on the month at negative 2.0% and in the three months to December at negative 2.3%. This is the sixth consecutive month of no growth for clothing stores for the three-month on three-month movement. The quantity bought within department stores continued the downward trend, with a monthly decline of 1.8% and a three-month on three-month decline of 0.3%. More to follow... European stock markets are rallying this morning, on hopes that China\u2019s economy could be turning a corner. The main indices are all positive, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gaining 21 points or 0.3%. That may be surprising, given China\u2019s worrying slowdown in 2019. Investors, though, are cheered that Chinese retail spending and industrial output both jumped in December. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says optimism is bubbling in the City. Friday\u2019s trading session began with optimism taking over the market sentiment. The positivity came mainly from China, where industrial production and retail sales both exceeded the forecast, appearing to signal the turn of a corner for the growth of the Chinese economy. This good news, together with American retail sales above forecasts, compounded the lingering positive feeling left by the signing of a trade deal between the US and China earlier in the week. A bit of history. Google floated on the US stock market back in 2004 at $85 per share, valuing the firm at around $24bn. It was a troubled process (enlivened when its founders gave an interview to Playboy which was published during the IPO \u2018quiet period\u2019). Some investors were wary of tech stocks in the aftermath of the dot-com crash, with some warning that internet companies were over-valued. But anyone who bought shares then, and held them, has enjoyed strong growth - with Alphabet\u2019s share price nearly tripling in the last five years. Christopher Rossbach, CIO of private investment firm J. Stern &amp; Co, reckons Google\u2019s value is going to keep climbing, having smashed through the $1tn barrier last night. The company\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning should boost its business, Rossbach says. And that means it could potentially double in value to $2bn in the \u2018near term\u2019. That might seem a stretch, except Alphabet\u2019s shares did rise by 28% last year. \u201cAs Alphabet joins Apple, Microsoft and (from time to time) Amazon among tech companies that have reached this level, it marks just the start for the company. It still has significant further room to grow, both in its core online advertising business as it innovates in advertising monetization and formats and in its cloud computing business. \u201cAlphabet is laying the foundations for a much larger company as it is the unequivocal leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning. \u201cIt is also disrupting new multi-trillion dollar markets, for example healthcare, with this technology. Its sizeable investments give Alphabet a sustainable competitive advantage as it applies this technology across its business. The other big news of the morning is that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is now worth a staggering one trillion dollars. Barely 21 years after PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin created their pioneering search engine, the company has become the fourth tech giant to hit a $1tn valuation - after a late surge on Wall Street last night. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all hit the milestone, during the remarkable rally in FAANG tech stocks in the last few year. Google\u2019s value has steadily surged as it has tightened its grip on the search market, boosted its advertising revenues from web searches and YouTube, created and grown its Android mobile operating system, and launched a series of smart-tech products including Google Home and Google Assistant. It has also invested heavily in future technologies, including AI, virtual reality, and a self-driving car project - which could ensure its dominant position long into the future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Along with death and taxes, the other certainty in life is that China will expand in line with Beijing\u2019s targets. But thanks to the US trade war, and the global slowdown, that means the weakest growth in almost 30 years. New GDP figures out today show that China achieved a 6.0% annual growth rate in the final three months of 2019. That means growth for the entire year came in at 6.1%, down from 6.8% in 2018, and the lowest rate in 29 years. It confirms that China\u2019s economy has taken a significant hit from the tariffs imposed on its goods by Donald Trump during the trade conflict which is now easing. The recent slowdown in the global economy, and Beijing\u2019s attempts to rein in its shadow banking sector, also weighed on growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Investors are hoping that Phase One trade deal signed this week, although limited, could help thaw relations between the two sides. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA explains: It\u2019s clear that the trade war has taken its toll on China\u2019s already decelerating economy and the deal that was signed this week may enable it to find some form, again. But there are also reasons for optimism in today\u2019s economic data. China\u2019s industrial production grew 6.9% year-on-year in December, which is the strongest in nine months. Retail sales grew by 8.0%, which was also stronger than expected, while fixed asset investment beat forecasts with 5.4% growth. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says: Overall a strong set of December numbers came out from China pointing to a gradual recovery in economic activity. More reaction to follow....

Parnas has been speaking to Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow about his involvement with the Ukraine quid pro quo scandal. Trump has claimed never to have met him but Parnas has said that each time he denies this, he will release another photo of them together. \u201cYou know the game is real when someone is threatening to open their camera roll,\u201d Noah said. He also joked about the increasing number of names who are becoming implicated. \u201cSo many people are involved they\u2019re gonna have to take a party bus to the trial,\u201d he said. While events are heating up in DC, Trump has been speaking about dishwashers, showers and toilets at rallies. \u201cI knew it, he\u2019s terrified,\u201d Noah commented. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the new evidence that has come out this week. \u201cFor weeks Republicans have ignored mounting evidence that Trump knew everything that was happening with the Ukraine scheme and Democrats have been waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d he said. \u201cWell last night, an entire Foot Locker fell out of the sky.\u201d He referred to Parnas as \u201ca recently indicted goon\u201d and played footage of him speaking to Maddow, claiming that Trump knew what was happening despite his denials. \u201cThis is the first time anyone has used the phrase \u2018Trump knew exactly what was going on\u2019,\u201d he said. Parnas has confessed to being a big fan of Trump\u2019s with a shrine of sorts at his home. \u201cI can understand that because every time I look at Trump I say \u2018Jesus\u2019,\u201d Colbert said. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host referred to it as \u201can all-caps kinda day\u201d before commenting on the fact that senators will need to stand when they cast votes during the trial. \u201cFor a lot of these senators, this will be the first time they\u2019ve stood for anything,\u201d he joked. Kimmel then talked about Parnas, referring to him as \u201cthe smoking goon\u201d and joking about the \u201cdisorganised crime\u201d that was happening around Trump. \u201cMaybe the most shocking revelation of all is that Lev Parnas is 46 years old,\u201d he quipped. He continued: \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when Rudy drinks your blood.\u201d Kimmel also found time to joke about Time\u2019s awkward cover image of Jared Kushner. \u201cHow are we supposed to trust him with the Middle East when he doesn\u2019t even know what to do with his arms?\u201d he said. \ufeff",

Anglican vicars have declined the suggestions of Brexiters that they should ring the bells of their churches to hail the beginning of the \u201cgolden age\u201d that, as Boris Johnson has assured us, will be inaugurated by Brexit on 31 January. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/big-ben-unlikely-to-chime-on-brexit-day-no-10-indicates\" title=\"\">Big Ben will not bong</a>. The silence that Westminster\u2019s great clock tower has maintained since its clapper was removed while restoration works are in progress will not be broken. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/big-ben-unlikely-to-chime-on-brexit-day-no-10-indicates\" title=\"\">Johnson claimed</a> that he was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. The plan turned out to be like all his other Brexit plans, which is to say nonexistent. So at this moment of destiny the prime minister will surely adapt John Donne. Ask not for whom the bell doesn\u2019t toll. It doesn\u2019t toll for thee.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The problem with a revolt against imaginary oppression is that you end up with imaginary freedom</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Never mind that the bongs would, rather deliciously, mark the supremacy of Brussels time: midnight in the EU\u2019s capital being the rather less resonant 11pm in London. Never mind that the \u00a3500,000 cost of a temporary restoration would work out at \u00a345,000 per bong, surely the most expensive rings since Richard Burton bought jewellery for Elizabeth Taylor.</p> \n<p>Still, like some fan fiction version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_p8khzyK-E\" title=\"\">Charles Laughton in The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>, the true believers cry: \u201cThe bells! The bells!\u201d Tory MP Mark Francois has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51133614\" title=\"\">donated \u00a31,000</a> to a crowdfunding appeal for cash to pay for temporary works on Big Ben. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom\u2019s rather more curbed enthusiasm has yielded a contribution of \u00a310 \u2013 enough presumably for a millisecond micro-bong.</p> \n<p>But the underlying point of the campaign seems to lie not so much in the expectation that the chimes will actually sound to herald the new dawn of British greatness as in the hope that they will not. This will prove again that the elites will stop at nothing to stifle the joy of the risen people of England. (The joy of the people of Scotland being unconfined by virtue of being almost entirely absent.)</p> \n<p>Why, even in their moment of triumph, do the Brexiters need this self-pitying narrative? It is another episode in the blame game that has been implicit from the start of the Brexit saga. Brexit is inherently anticlimactic. This is not just because the botched process of negotiating withdrawal has turned the gush of liberation into a dribble, with Independence Days (29 March; 31 October) coming and going like a millenarian preacher\u2019s predictions for the end of the world. It is not just because the special memorial 50p coins had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/brexit-meltdown-50p-coins-with-31-october-date-to-be-recycled\" title=\"\">melted down</a>. It is because the act of liberation itself is fundamentally spurious.</p> \n<p>Revolutions unleash euphoria because they create tangible images of change and inaugurate, at least in the fevered minds of their supporters, a new epoch. Brexit can\u2019t do either of these things. The problem with a revolt against imaginary oppression is that you end up with imaginary freedom. How do you actually show that the yoke of Brussels has been lifted?

      "bodyText": "There will be no chimes at midnight. Anglican vicars have declined the suggestions of Brexiters that they should ring the bells of their churches to hail the beginning of the \u201cgolden age\u201d that, as Boris Johnson has assured us, will be inaugurated by Brexit on 31 January. And Big Ben will not bong. The silence that Westminster\u2019s great clock tower has maintained since its clapper was removed while restoration works are in progress will not be broken. Johnson claimed that he was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. The plan turned out to be like all his other Brexit plans, which is to say nonexistent. So at this moment of destiny the prime minister will surely adapt John Donne. Ask not for whom the bell doesn\u2019t toll. It doesn\u2019t toll for thee. Never mind that the bongs would, rather deliciously, mark the supremacy of Brussels time: midnight in the EU\u2019s capital being the rather less resonant 11pm in London. Never mind that the \u00a3500,000 cost of a temporary restoration would work out at \u00a345,000 per bong, surely the most expensive rings since Richard Burton bought jewellery for Elizabeth Taylor. Still, like some fan fiction version of Charles Laughton in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the true believers cry: \u201cThe bells! The bells!\u201d Tory MP Mark Francois has donated \u00a31,000 to a crowdfunding appeal for cash to pay for temporary works on Big Ben. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom\u2019s rather more curbed enthusiasm has yielded a contribution of \u00a310 \u2013 enough presumably for a millisecond micro-bong. But the underlying point of the campaign seems to lie not so much in the expectation that the chimes will actually sound to herald the new dawn of British greatness as in the hope that they will not. This will prove again that the elites will stop at nothing to stifle the joy of the risen people of England. (The joy of the people of Scotland being unconfined by virtue of being almost entirely absent.) Why, even in their moment of triumph, do the Brexiters need this self-pitying narrative? It is another episode in the blame game that has been implicit from the start of the Brexit saga. Brexit is inherently anticlimactic. This is not just because the botched process of negotiating withdrawal has turned the gush of liberation into a dribble, with Independence Days (29 March; 31 October) coming and going like a millenarian preacher\u2019s predictions for the end of the world. It is not just because the special memorial 50p coins had to be melted down. It is because the act of liberation itself is fundamentally spurious. Revolutions unleash euphoria because they create tangible images of change and inaugurate, at least in the fevered minds of their supporters, a new epoch. Brexit can\u2019t do either of these things. The problem with a revolt against imaginary oppression is that you end up with imaginary freedom. How do you actually show that the yoke of Brussels has been lifted? You can\u2019t bring prawn cocktail-flavoured crisps back into the shops, or release stout British fishermen from the humiliation of having to wear hair nets at work on the high seas, or unban donkey rides on beaches, or right any of the other great wrongs that fuelled anti-EU sentiment \u2013 because all of it was make-believe. And so is the golden age to come. Almost no one actually believes in the dawning of the post-Brexit Age of Aquarius. The real public mood in this month of liberation was revealed in a survey commissioned by the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue at the beginning of January: \u201cThe UK public is fairly pessimistic about the next five years. A majority of the UK public expects levels of undesirable trends \u2013 poverty (72%), crime (71%), inequality (71%) and national debt (72%) \u2013 to increase or stay the same.\u201d Thus the great moment of departure on 31 January will be like the last lines in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot, in which Vladimir asks: \u201cWell, shall we go?\u201d and Estragon answers: \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d The stage direction is: \u201cThey do not move.\u201d Nothing will really move.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s going for it? Being an introvert, it\u2019s the lonely spots that attract me most. Sedbergh is only 15 twisty-turny minutes up the steep western escarpment of the Yorkshire Dales from the M6, a little longer from Kendal, but high up, all alone in the fells, it might be halfway to the moon. Bald moors, big skies and Alfred Wainwright\u2019s beloved Howgill Fells loom all about, and there\u2019s not much bar sheep, the Wensleydale Creamery and the odd village or teeny town between you and the other side of the UK. Bliss. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been lonelier, in a good way, than waiting on the platform at Garsdale station with only crows for company. Still, Sedbergh itself is a convivial spot, despite its isolation, and utterly unpretentious in the way only this part of the world can be \u2013 home to doughty shops, hardy people and excellent pubs where hikers battle farmers for space at the bar. And, as one of three of Britain\u2019s \u201cbook towns\u201d (with Wigtown and Hay-on-Wye), filled with bookshops, writing retreats and poetry festivals, even the most taciturn hermit is never short of a conversation opener, even if it\u2019s just your take on the latest Jack Reacher plot twist. The case against\u2026 When the wind blows, Sedbergh gets blown away. The lonely spots aren\u2019t for everyone. Well connected? Trains: the nearest station is a 20-minute drive away (give or take the odd stray sheep) at Garsdale, with trains on the scenic line to Settle (25 mins), Skipton (just under an hour) and Leeds (an hour and a half) one way, and Carlisle the other (just over an hour). Trains from Kendal connect to Windermere (17 mins), Lancaster (25 mins) Preston (45 mins) and beyond. Driving: the bright lights of Kendal are 25 minutes away, the M6 is 15 minutes, and Lancaster, the seaside or the Lakes are reachable in 45 mins. Schools Primaries: Sedbergh and Dent Church of England are both \u201cgood\u201d, according to Ofsted. Secondaries: Settlebeck is \u201cgood\u201d. Or there\u2019s the independent Sedbergh School. Hang out at\u2026 The Three Hares cafe, bistro and bakery: Japan in the Dales by way of Germany, and more brilliant than it sounds. The owners\u2019 new Black Bull hotel in the town is splendid, too. Where to buy Anywhere you like, just so long as it\u2019s made from stone, raw or whitewashed. Well, OK, there\u2019s the odd bit of brickwork or render\u2026 but think cottages, townhouses and Victorian villas, and farms or barns. There are some lovely farming villages beyond, such as Garsdale or Dent, for those who like it even more remote. Detacheds and townhouses, \u00a3280,000-\u00a3800,000.

Northampton are in Lyon playing for second place and a slot in the last eight as one of the best runners-up. They have made 10 changes from the side who stuttered to victory over Treviso last weekend with Dan Biggar, Cobus Reinach, Owen Franks and Teimana Harrison among the players returning.

The Chiefs have Dave Dennis and Jonny Hill back in the second row with Harry Williams starting at tight-head prop after serving his suspension following his red card against Saracens. The Top 14 club are already out, but they won in Glasgow last month and include Uini Atonio and Gregory Alldritt in their lineup. Glasgow need to win at Sale and hope two out of Saracens, Gloucester and Northampton lose.

Clermont have picked their strongest available side which includes Nick Abendanon at full-back while Quins, who have no chance of going through, have picked a largely second-string team, potentially in breach of the regulations, although Joe Marler and Alex Dombrandt are in the pack. Ulster will make the last eight regardless of the result at the Stoop if they beat a Bath side yet to win a match in the pool at Kingspan Stadium. The home side have Will Addison and Billy Burns, both named in the Ireland squad this week, in their back division. The England wing Ruaridh McConnochie makes his first appearance for a month for Bath.</p> <p><strong>Harlequins v Clermont</strong> and <strong>Ulster v Bath</strong> (both Saturday 3.15pm)</p> <h2>Pool 4</h2> <p>All attention will be on Saracens on Sunday, who will hope for some relief from their continued salary cap strife. The champions include eight of their England World Cup players in the starting lineup with Brad Barritt returning to lead the side from midfield. Saracens started the round as one of the three best runners-up because of their superior points difference over Northampton and Gloucester, unable to catch Racing who need to win to ensure they play at home in the quarter-finals, and they could go through even if they lose. Racing also have a team rippling with internationals, including Finn Russell, Virimi Vakatawa and Juan Imhoff. If Saracens slip up, Munster could steal second place.

The Premiership club are without the injured Danny Cipriani and Lloyd Evans starts at fly-half with the Wales squad member Owen Williams on the bench. Louis Rees-Zammit and Ollie Thorley are on the wings with Mark Atkinson returning to midfield.

Other religious groups hire the arena for similar closed events and we are happy to accommodate them as long as the law isn\u2019t being broken. \u201cAs an organisation, we take matters such as this immensely seriously. We are aware of views from some of our city\u2019s councillors and understand their concerns. [But] it is the view of the board of trustees that freedom of speech, and the ability to disagree with someone\u2019s beliefs, are to be encouraged. If individuals or groups aren\u2019t breaking the law then their right to speak freely should be respected.\u201d The tour during May and June will also include venues in Glasgow, Newcastle, Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Cardiff, Birmingham and London. Graham said: \u201cI\u2019m not coming to Sheffield to preach against anyone. I\u2019m coming to tell everyone about a God who loves them. \u201cThe gospel\u2019s life-saving truth and power applies to everyone in this great city.\u201d",

A day utterly dominated by England and marred, for South Africa (and perhaps cricket in general) by the ICC clutching its pearls over Kagiso Rabada and also by a limp performance in the field. But take nothing away from England - to think we were bemoaning the absolute state of England\u2019s Test batting at the turn of the year. Now, suddenly, we\u2019re talking about steady openers and a dream of a middle-order, thanks, today, to the glorious displays by Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope who showcased both the best of traditional Test match batting and the most thrilling and innovative side of the modern game. Mark Wood\u2019s hitting with the bat and pace with the ball was fun too. Plus the stand-in spinner struck twice. All is suddenly rosy for the tourists. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Anyway, thanks for all your emails, attention and ever more inventive/tortured Pope puns, for which I should probably now atone by going to Confession. It never leaves you.</p> <p>The OBO will be back bright and early tomorrow, join us then. Bye.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e21daab8f08a6950eb43e7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T16:20:36.029Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ollie Pope speaks:</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to watch Sibley get his 100, Foakes against Sri Lanka [in 2018] and thought what a feeling that must be, so yeah when that ball hit the boundary it was a pretty special moment. I though it was only going to be two initially.</p> <p>\u201cOur plans this morning were me and Stokesy to carry on from where we were last night, push towards 350-400 and the way he played was awesome. I took a bit of a back role for a bit and it was awesome to watch from the other end. It just shows how Test cricket ebss and flows as I was scoring a bit faster last night. They bowled nicely yesterday but when that new ball came it came onto the bat more and it was a bit easier.</p> <p>\u201cThe lbw review [when Pope was reprieved on appeal], Stokesy made the call, he told me with two seconds to go to review it. Luckily, it had just done enough to miss. To get that century milestone is a relief, I\u2019ve hit a couple of 50s but to get that first one under your belt it\u2019s such a nice feeling, a good benchmark to build from and take a lot of condeicen from it.</p> <p>As for those ramp shots: \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t really know how I did that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played that shot till last week, it\u2019s just I thought if I can just get some bat on it as it goes over fast, I\u2019ll give it a go. </p> <p>As for the bowlers \u2026 \u201cThe response Dom got out of the pitch and the way Woody came out and got 150kmph was encouraging and we\u2019ve got the fire power to go out and win it.\u201d</p> <p>Pope is followed by an understandly much more downcast Mark Boucher: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough day, we didn\u2019t start too well this morning, and by the time we tried to pull it back it was sort of out of our grasp. Ben Stokes was excellent and fair play to Ollie Pope - he was exceptional. To spend 150 overs in the field, it takes its toll, though you can always question body language but they\u2019re human beings.\u201d</p> <p>As for the Rabada controversy: \u201cAm I allowed to say?\u201d he quips. \u201cKagiso\u2019s got a bit of history with this sort of things. He probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, the way you read the law and the words \u2018and/or\u2019 can be looked at differently. Unfortunately he has too many demerit points, and he shouldn\u2019t be [putting the team in this position] but we all played in days when players were swearing all the time. We don\u2019t want him into his shell too much but he\u2019s got to look at that and we\u2019ve got to accept it. His aggression though is part of why he\u2019s good.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules are there and you\u2019ve got to abide by them and the way the match referee saw it iit was a level one [offence] and we\u2019ve got to live with it. Maybe we\u2019ve got to have a conversation with him. We were very aggressive on the field when we were playing. You don\u2019t seem to be able to do so much these days. </p> <p>As for targets and quotas, with Rabada out of Johannesburg: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough question, we\u2019ve got our challenges in our country. We\u2019ve got a couple of options, a squad of 16 players, but for now we\u2019ve got to get out there and save a Test match.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T16:33:23.059Z\">at 4.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e21d9a38f08a6950eb43e78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T16:00:15.034Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ll hopefully have some chat from players soon; in the meantime, here\u2019s some chat from you, the public, and a literary recommendation from Brian Spurrell:</p> <p>\u201cA bit late in the day to be responding to this, but Ian Sergeant\u2019s \u201cWell I declare\u201d story seems to be half-remembered from this: <a href=\"https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/umpiring-conundrums-in-cricket-10-how-long-can-you-run-632620\">a short story by playwright Herbert Farjeon</a>.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e21d8638f08e97ed2125515\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T15:53:59.518Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve been having so much fun watching events in Port Elizabeth that we\u2019ve almost forgotten another cricket match coming to its conclusion, and it looks as if Australia might actually be about to lose.

On the one hand, the umpire applied the spirit of the game; everyone knew England were going to declare as soon as Wood or Pope got out, so reversing the declaration is just the application of common sense. On the other hand, rules is rules. Root should have been aware enough of the updated protocols not to wave them in until the review had been completed, and captains will know for next time.

Middle-order partnerships are an underappreciated part of cricket. We know all about the great opening pairs, yet we rarely talk about those down the order. And while they don\u2019t bat together as often as the openers, they can still rack up thousands of runs together.</p> <p>There are a few things that help to make a good partnership: contrasts (left and right hand, tall and short, dasher and blocker), off-field friendship, telepathic running between the wickets. But perhaps the most important is an indefinable chemistry. You could sense it in England\u2019s best middle-order partnerships of modern times: Lamb and Smith, Hussain and Butcher, Flintoff and Jones, Pietersen and Collingwood. </p> <p>And now, perhaps, Stokes and Pope. It\u2019s early in their relationship - you want me to grab a dictionary? - and they sound like a firm of funeral directors. But they look great together and could put on thousands of runs for the fifth wicket in the next few years. They are good readers of the game, naturally positive but not too proud or dumb to sit in when required, and have the age-old advantage of a left/right partnership. </p> <p>They first batted together against India at Trent Bridge in 2018, a union that lasted precisely four balls. But since being reunited this winter, all three of their partnerships have exceeded fifty. They added 76 yesterday evening, calmly taking England to 224 for four at the close, and have the chance to bat South Africa out of the game today.</p> <p>They messed up a similar opportunity in the first Test of the winter at Mount Manganui, when batting became a bit too easy, but the sluggish nature of this pitch should enhance their concentration. </p> <p>And if Stokes carts the first ball of the day to midwicket, this preamble never happened.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T07:24:49.573Z\">at 7.24am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

A day utterly dominated by England and marred, for South Africa (and perhaps cricket in general) by the ICC clutching its pearls over Kagiso Rabada and also by a limp performance in the field. But take nothing away from England - to think we were bemoaning the absolute state of England\u2019s Test batting at the turn of the year. Now, suddenly, we\u2019re talking about steady openers and a dream of a middle-order, thanks, today, to the glorious displays by Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope who showcased both the best of traditional Test match batting and the most thrilling and innovative side of the modern game. Mark Wood\u2019s hitting with the bat and pace with the ball was fun too. Plus the stand-in spinner struck twice. All is suddenly rosy for the tourists. What could possibly go wrong? Anyway, thanks for all your emails, attention and ever more inventive/tortured Pope puns, for which I should probably now atone by going to Confession. It never leaves you. The OBO will be back bright and early tomorrow, join us then. Bye. Ollie Pope speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to watch Sibley get his 100, Foakes against Sri Lanka [in 2018] and thought what a feeling that must be, so yeah when that ball hit the boundary it was a pretty special moment. I though it was only going to be two initially. \u201cOur plans this morning were me and Stokesy to carry on from where we were last night, push towards 350-400 and the way he played was awesome. I took a bit of a back role for a bit and it was awesome to watch from the other end. It just shows how Test cricket ebss and flows as I was scoring a bit faster last night. They bowled nicely yesterday but when that new ball came it came onto the bat more and it was a bit easier. \u201cThe lbw review [when Pope was reprieved on appeal], Stokesy made the call, he told me with two seconds to go to review it. Luckily, it had just done enough to miss. To get that century milestone is a relief, I\u2019ve hit a couple of 50s but to get that first one under your belt it\u2019s such a nice feeling, a good benchmark to build from and take a lot of condeicen from it. As for those ramp shots: \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t really know how I did that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played that shot till last week, it\u2019s just I thought if I can just get some bat on it as it goes over fast, I\u2019ll give it a go. As for the bowlers \u2026 \u201cThe response Dom got out of the pitch and the way Woody came out and got 150kmph was encouraging and we\u2019ve got the fire power to go out and win it.\u201d Pope is followed by an understandly much more downcast Mark Boucher: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough day, we didn\u2019t start too well this morning, and by the time we tried to pull it back it was sort of out of our grasp. Ben Stokes was excellent and fair play to Ollie Pope - he was exceptional. To spend 150 overs in the field, it takes its toll, though you can always question body language but they\u2019re human beings.\u201d As for the Rabada controversy: \u201cAm I allowed to say?\u201d he quips. \u201cKagiso\u2019s got a bit of history with this sort of things. He probably shouldn\u2019t have done it, the way you read the law and the words \u2018and/or\u2019 can be looked at differently. Unfortunately he has too many demerit points, and he shouldn\u2019t be [putting the team in this position] but we all played in days when players were swearing all the time. We don\u2019t want him into his shell too much but he\u2019s got to look at that and we\u2019ve got to accept it. His aggression though is part of why he\u2019s good. \u201cThe rules are there and you\u2019ve got to abide by them and the way the match referee saw it iit was a level one [offence] and we\u2019ve got to live with it. Maybe we\u2019ve got to have a conversation with him. We were very aggressive on the field when we were playing. You don\u2019t seem to be able to do so much these days. As for targets and quotas, with Rabada out of Johannesburg: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough question, we\u2019ve got our challenges in our country. We\u2019ve got a couple of options, a squad of 16 players, but for now we\u2019ve got to get out there and save a Test match.\u201d We\u2019ll hopefully have some chat from players soon; in the meantime, here\u2019s some chat from you, the public, and a literary recommendation from Brian Spurrell: \u201cA bit late in the day to be responding to this, but Ian Sergeant\u2019s \u201cWell I declare\u201d story seems to be half-remembered from this: a short story by playwright Herbert Farjeon.\u201d We\u2019ve been having so much fun watching events in Port Elizabeth that we\u2019ve almost forgotten another cricket match coming to its conclusion, and it looks as if Australia might actually be about to lose. Might. And that\u2019ll be our lot, as the rain begins to fall and the umpires bring the players in. Ollie Pope, appropriately, leads them off \u2013 man of the day, though he\u2019s had some worthy assistants. 17th over: South Africa 60-2 (Elgar 32, Nortje 0) Bess vindicates the decision to bowl him early by picking up a second wicket, that of Hamza - you wonder whether Wood\u2019s working-over of him the previous over helped. Whatever, England are buzzing now, as Nortje is sent out into the gloaming as nightwatchman. Away from the excitement \u2026 \u201cI recall a story from days of yore (I\u2019m sure someone will know the full details if true),\u201d says Ian Sergeant, reclining by the fireside (presumably), \u201cwhen very early on in a teams innings the batsman / skipper received a nasty lifter. This being the 1930\u2019s or earlier, swearing either hadn\u2019t been invented or wasn\u2019t allowed in the game, the skipper exclaimed \u2018well I declare\u2019 as the ball passed his nose. The fielding captain took the initiative and said \u2013 \u201cyou heard him \u2013 we\u2019re batting now\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u2013 and apparently the umpires upheld the declaration. Spirit of cricket right there.\u201d Bess strikes again, changing angle to round the wicket at Hamza, it straightens at him, finds his inside edge, and rebounds off pad into the hands of Pope at short leg - you can\u2019t keep him out of this game. 16th over: South Africa 60-1 (Elgar 32, Hamza 10) This is the stuff: Wood peppers Hamza with two fast, searing short ones right at him, which the batsman has to fend away awkwardly. Then an inside-edge brings him four awkward runs before a genuinely classy back-foot punch adds another single to the total. It\u2019s getting gloomy out there \u2013 not sure how much longer they\u2019ll stay out for. 16th over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 32, Hamza 5) Bess is keeping it pretty tight at the other end, finding some drift and turn, and concedes only one from his fourth over. \u201cOK if we have to have puns, I am going to call that stroke the Papal Pull,\u201d toots Chris Pockney as if it\u2019s some sort of obligation. 15th over: South Africa 54-1 (Elgar 32, Hamza 4) Such is the pitch that, even at 151kmph, there\u2019s only a slip and a gully in for Wood, though he\u2019s extracting a bit of vim from the surface, and gives Elgar nothing to have a go at in what is an impressively accurate maiden, 14th over: South Africa 54-1 (Elgar 32, Hamza 4) Elgar copped a crack on the elbow facing Wood in the previous over, which delays the start of this one while he receives some physio attention. Bess keeps the new man Hamza honest, until a half-volley is pumped through the covers for four \u2013 a lovely shot with which to get off the mark. Bess\u2019s comeback ball, spinning into the pads, prompts a half-hearted lbw shout but no one is minded to take it any further. Replays confirm it\u2019s spinning down leg. 13th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 32, Hamza 0) The Wood man cometh. And he gets some pace, but also alarms everyone by sprawling onto the deck on his follow-through with his second ball, as he too often does. There\u2019s pace and variety there, and as long as he\u2019s used sensibly, Wood looks an asset here, even on a placid pitch such as this. The declaration debate is raging on apace in countless emails (form an orderly queue, suitors). Thomas Atkins attempts a balanced perspective. \u201cThe discussion over the revoked declaration is a fun bit of \u201cYou Are The Umpire\u201d theory, but I can\u2019t be the only one not to be fussed either way. On the one hand, the umpire applied the spirit of the game; everyone knew England were going to declare as soon as Wood or Pope got out, so reversing the declaration is just the application of common sense. On the other hand, rules is rules. Root should have been aware enough of the updated protocols not to wave them in until the review had been completed, and captains will know for next time. Either decision by the match officials is, to my mind, a reasonable and fair one. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d Yeah, let\u2019s Get Declarations Done. 12th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 32) Did Malan scoop this up? Bess reviews after the umpire\u2019s finger fails to go up and cameras confirm that, contrary to the initial verdict, it bounced onto bat and dollied up to Bess rather than the other way round and Malan has gone. England have a key breakthrough to go into drinks. Before that, I\u2019d jinxed South Africa by banging on about how pleased they would be with this start, so just as well I\u2019ve deleted it now. 11th over: South Africa 48-0 (Elgar 32, Malan 16). Root gives Curran another chance to find his range, but it\u2019s all meat and drink to Elgar who drives a half-volley to the boundary for four more. The home choir are treating us to an absolute concert now - raucous and rousing, though not totally in tune. Though who are we to talk. \u201cBeing pedantic,\u201d begins Peter Board with the two words that are the foundation of all chat-up opening gambits, \u201cwe could say that gesturing your own batsmen in, from the balcony, does not constitute \u201cinforming the umpires and opposing captain. Being pragmatic, whatever the Laws say, it doesn\u2019t seem right that if the external factor for the decision changes, that the decision itself can\u2019t....\u201d 10th over: South Africa 44-0 (Elgar 28, Malan 16). Bess finds Malan\u2019s edge, but the right-hander\u2019s hands are good and control admirable as he keeps it along the ground to steer it past slip for two. \u201cFour words: GIVE. IT. TO. STOKES\u201d bellows Mark Hooper. I\u2019d give it to Wood first. 9th over: South Africa 40-0 (Elgar 27, Malan 13). Curran is swapped round, replacing Broad at the end that may help his inswing at right-handers, though Malan nudges his first one away easily enough, adding one. Line and length again not quite what\u2019s required, and someone as accomplished as Elgar doesn\u2019t need to do much to tickle another stray one slanted across him down to the fine leg boundary. A push for two and a steer to third man for another four round up an expensive over. Time to toss that ball to Mark Wood I feel. 8th over: South Africa 29-0 (Elgar 17, Malan 12). Not unwisely on this track, spin gets an early airing, with Bess replacing Curran. And he extracts some decent turn, forcing Edgar to stretch and miss at a ripper of an off-break. One from the over. 7th over: South Africa 28-0 (Elgar 17, Malan 11). Broad\u2019s first bad ball of the innings, back-of-a-length and wide outside off stump, is cut to the extra cover boundary by Elgar. Broad responds with a jagged cutter into Elgar\u2019s body but he nudges that away smartly for a single - the first time the batsmen have changed ends. They swiftly change back again as Malan pushes his first ball from Broad for a single. The Pope puns just keep coming, and may do for all Eternity: \u201cConsidering some of the awful challenges made by England in recent years (Yes, you, Stuart Broad!), a little \u2018Infallibility\u2019 might be useful,\u201d parps Matthew Dony. 6th over: South Africa 22-0 (Elgar 12, Malan 10). Curran\u2019s line isn\u2019t quite right \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the strong breeze - and he drops one a little short that\u2019s comfortably helped down to the fine leg boundary for four by Malan. Both Bess and Wood look to be warming up. More dead-ball pedantry from Rendell Harris. \u201cRe Richard O\u2019Hagan\u2019s assertion that the ball isn\u2019t dead whilst an appeal/wicket is being reviewed, if it was still live why couldn\u2019t the batters keep on running, or in this case why couldn\u2019t the fielding side have run out Woods and/or Pope as they\u2019d left the crease? Or is the ball in a sort of Schroedinger\u2019s state during a review, both alive and dead?\u201d This one will run and run. And that\u2019s why I love you people. Each and every one of you. 5th over: South Africa 18-0 (Elgar 12, Malan 6). Elgar drives freely for two but Broad comes back at him with a jaffa that\u2019s angled in and moves away past the outside edge. Another four follows, when Elgar reacts well to one that keeps low-ish and steers it past the slips with soft hands. South Africa are scoring with ease, but Broad is looking dangerous. \u201cPresumably a Pope shot for 6 would be a Pontifex Maximus?\u201d honks Matthew Brown. Not to pedants like me it wouldn\u2019t, since a six is not a maximum. 4th over: South Africa 12-0 (Elgar 6, Malan 6). A loose one down leg from Curran is nonchalantly punished by Malan, who clips through midwicket for four. There\u2019s a stiff breeze blowing across the field, which probably isn\u2019t helping his natural inswinging trajectory at right-handers, though he asks a few more questions with a teaser across the right-hander outside off stump to round off the over. Lee Hammond wants to enthuse about England\u2019s newly perky batting: \u201cAs a long suffering England fan, this feels like the first time England have had actual fun batting for what feels like years. Yes, Stokes especially have had big knocks, but usually breathless innings where we have been staring at the barrel, do or die efforts. It\u2019s great to see an end of innings \u2018Go out there and smash it\u2019 mentality from the tail after the main batting line-up provides a platform for it to happen.\u201d Yeah suddenly all that agonising about where to slot in Bairstow, Moeen and Buttler across the middle order seems a long time ago, suddenly. And call me hasty, but I reckon Jason Roy\u2019s Test career\u2019s a goner now. 3rd over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 6, Malan 2). Broad is finding that edge of the left-hander from round the wicket here, Elgar prodding uneasily to slip, along the ground. It\u2019s a fine over, and already Broad, like the wily old great he is, is getting more of a tune out of this new ball than South Africa did. Richard O\u2019Hagan has a better, less jobsworthy though somehow agreeable more jobsworthy, interpretation of the declaration issue. \u201cI think the umpires may have been correct. The ball has to be dead for there to be a declaration. The ball is only dead once the umpire upholds an appeal, or it is returned to either the bowler or the wicketkeeper. In this instance the appeal wasn\u2019t upheld, because it was being reviewed, so the ball wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d And it gave us another 15 minutes or so of fun. 2nd over: South Africa 8-0 (Elgar 6, Malan 2). Sam Curran, who six months ago was very much a fringe England Test player, is now a new-ball bowler, giving the tourists a welcome variety of angles early on. Malan, so impressive at Cape Town, plays the over out watchfully, before getting off the mark with a nudge for two when Curran strays a fraction to the legside One more Pope shot epithet for now: \u201cEcumenisized,\u201d suggests Matt Robins. That would be an ecumenical matter. 1st over: South Africa 6-0 (Elgar 6, Malan 0). So what can England muster on this largely zipless pitch? Some movement early on, for starters, Broad\u2019s sharp away-swinger being cannily steered down to third man for two by Elgar to get the innings going. A squired thick-edge for four ensures the opening over is an expensive one, but England have plenty of runs to play with and the movement off the seam will buoy them. More talking points: Hot on the heels of the Rabada pearl-clutching and counter-outrage, might there be words about Root\u2019s withdrawn declaration? Kevin Foster quotes law 15.3, \u201ca captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of any decision to declare or to forfeit an innings. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. Officiating really poor in this series from no balls, to demerits, to comprehensive knowledge of the rules...\u201d Justin Horton and Dominic Sayers raise the same question. So, who said this was a \u201ccursed\u201d tour with England\u2019s batting in confused disarray? Well me, for one, a couple of weeks ago on the OBO, but they\u2019ve batted here with intelligence, discipline, panache and, today, swagger to put themelves in a great position. Pope\u2019s innings was masterful, and he\u2019s surely cemented his place for a very, very long time to come this winter. Which is just as well, given the number of names you\u2019re all coming up with for his inventive behind-the-wicket shots. \u201cPope-a-dope\u201d (Brian Withington), \u201cPope-a-Scoop\u201d (Facsimile Benson) and \u201cPapal Scoop\u201d (Harry Coleman) are among them while John Starbuck adds: :You wouldn\u2019t call it \u2018Popeshot\u2019 for fear of inadvertent headlines, but how about \u2018Popeflip\u2019?\u201d 152nd over: England 499-9 declared (Pope 135) I can\u2019t keep up with this. Wood clouts Maharaj for another SIX to close on a half-century - South Africa want to get him off strike to the spinner. They do, eventually, by getting him out, one last slog finding a fielder, Nortje, and Joe Root calls them in one short of 500. 151st over: England 491-8 (Pope 134, Wood 35) A two, a two and a SIX for Pope, who is thrillingly undaunted by Rabada, this latest not-maximum being a hook backward of square. A tremendous niche-stat from the redoubtable Tim de Lisle: \u201cWhen Pope went to 123, his Test average went past 50. Surely the first person ever to get there just after playing two reverse pulls.\u201d Are they reverse-pulls? Here\u2019s some other Pope-shot suggestions: \u201cOllieScoop\u201d (Daniel Forman) \u201cPuntiflex\u201d (George Davidson) 150th over: England 481-8 (Pope 124, Wood 35) Pope reverse sweeps another easy single off Maharaj before Wood, the Durham Dasher, clears the ropes again with another sweetly connected slogged on-drive. England aren\u2019t going to lose this, I just about feel assured of saying. 149th over: England 473-8 (Pope 121, Wood 29) This is enormous, dizzying fun now: Pope once again responds to a quick back-of-a-length delivery by ramping it again over the keeper\u2019s head. And next ball \u2013 HE DOES IT AGAIN, this time towards the third man boundary for another four. This is a shot, hit with more follow through and power than most ramps, that should be named after him, a la Natmeg and Dilscoop, a sort of Pope-ramp, or something. Any suggestions? Then we think the innings is over when Wood is caught and Root declares, but he changes his mind when the no-ball is discovered, and South Africa\u2019s punishment must continue. Which it does, with Wood shellacking a short-ish one outside off stump to the cover point boundary. These two have added 46 from 35 balls. Wood\u2019s slogfest is seemingly ended when he holes out on the offside. Root calls them in, then the replay shows Rabada oversteps and sends them back out again. What a day Rabada is having. 148th over: England 457-8 (Pope 111, Wood 25) Pope is happier letting Wood have the strike to Maharaj, cutting effortlessly away for a single. And why wouldn\u2019t he? Everyone\u2019s favourite north-east-based AFC Wimbledon fan absolutely leathers one out of the blockhole straight down the ground for the mightiest of SIXES. The Barmy Army, unfortunately, decide to greet this with a leaden version of the Great Escape. He\u2019s not done though, Wood, and swipes another SIX on the onside. He\u2019s into his 20s in no time, and England are over 450 and into all manner of recently uncharted territory. 147th over: England 443-8 (Pope 110, Wood 12) South Africa\u2019s field is well scattered now, with no slips at all. It\u2019s like a pre-fielding restrictions B&amp;H Cup match or something. Pope\u2019s declining singles though, dabbing deep into the offside but deciding not to run. He then cheekily calls Wood to run a bye off the last ball of the over, another short one that flies over his head to the keeper. He\u2019s clever as well as talented, this lad. Adrian Foster is thinking ahead: \u201cWithout Jimmy\u2019s guile or Archer\u2019s pace do you think Root might be tempted to let Stokes have a go with the new ball? Picking up a couple of wickets before the close in this situation would be a very Ben Stokes thing to do.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it just? Though a spinner on early could also pay off on this surface. 146th over: England 442-8 (Pope 110, Wood 12) Tail-end high-jinks as Wood clouts Maharaj over deep midwicket for six and follows it up with a lovely, deft square sweep that also pierces the field for four. Maharaj then raps him on the pad after turning a quicker ball into him but the umpire\u2019s having none of it. Wood has a big heave again, high into the air on the offside but that bounces in no man\u2019s land too. Textbook. 145th over: England 430-8 (Pope 110, Wood 0) Rabada suddenly finds some menace in the pitch, jagging a length ball straight up into Pope\u2019s grille. That\u2019s canny cross-seam bowling by the looks. Pope then has a big let-off as he appears to be strangled down leg. Rabada can\u2019t review, though replays suggest it glanced the glove. He cashes in by concluding an over of short stuff by hooking for four. It\u2019s all going his way, and England should look for quick runs now. 144th over: England 426-8 (Pope 105, Wood 0) And they\u2019re back out, and straight away Maharaj finds extravagant turn to beat Wood outside off stump as he completes the over he started before tea. That turn will encourage England. \u201cCan we move Pope up the holy orders yet then? Where will he end up, 5? Can he be a 3?\u201d says Adam Hirst A trinity, if you will, yeah, why not? Talking of name riffs, it\u2019s a shame England don\u2019t have a Gerry in their ranks, thereby depriving us of ice-cream themed pairings (Ben and Gerry) and long-forgotten 1984 breakdance hits themed pairings (Ollie and Gerry) 144th over: England 426-8 (Pope 105) Maharaj picks up his fourth wicket, well deserved on that workload for a first innings, and they all go off for some sustenance. As will I. See you in a bit. England aren\u2019t going to have the option to declare by the looks. Bess pushes square on the off and it\u2019s snaffled up by Malan at silly point. 143rd over: England 425-7 (Pope 105, Bess 1) Mikey Holding, who\u2019s clearly been following the OBO, suggests \u201cFrancis\u201d as a nickname for Pope. Of course, if the previous Pontiff was still in the gig we could have called him Benedict, which would have dovetailed with our culinary theme (eggs \u2026 etc). Pope then, appropriately, plays a near miraculous shot, more or less toe-ending an uppercut while on his knees and it sails straight behind, up and over, for four. It was a venomous old ball from Nortje too. What a player we have here. Gavin Facey emails in to suggest his ruination by making him captain. 142nd over: England 420-7 (Pope 100, Bess 1) Maharaj beats Bess all ends up with a ripper past the outside edge, angled in at leg stump and then turning sharply past the batsman. It\u2019s a fine over and a rare, of late, maiden. \u201cWhat IS that tune the band is playing?\u201d asks Peter Gibbs, \u201cSounded to me like George Michael, and appropriate for something I\u2019m sure... Anyway, take my ear-worm, I\u2019ve had enough of it now. 140th over: England 420-7 (Pope 100, Bess 1) Nortje returns to the attack \u2013 South Africa have been uncertain about their pace attack options today \u2013 and Pope adds a single to move within a boundary of you know what. Bess brings his teammate swiftly back on strike by getting off the mark with a nudged single off his hips. Nortje tucks Pope up neatly though, bowling full-ish and at the stops, but that can\u2019t becalm him long and he clips the next ball past mid-on for four for his first Test 100. Not before time and richly, richly deserved. This has been a delicious, classy Test match innings. Suddenly the middle-order future looks bright indeed. 140th over: England 414-7 (Pope 95, Bess 0) Maharaj comes on at the other end now \u2013 because what\u2019s 51 overs between friends? \u2013 and Curran punishes a short ball by cutting with conviction for four, and then gets down the track and clatters another boundary past a diving deep mid-off before he perishes caught in the deep. England won\u2019t mind overmuch, Curran having done precisely the job needed. Now that newly-frail England tail has a chance to wag with the pressure off. Back to culinary nicknames, Peter Nower reminds us: \u201cUnfortunately the nickname \u201ccheeseboard\u201d is already taken\u2026\u201d Ah, my kind of cricketer. Curran\u2019s cameo is curtailed, following two fours by holing out to deep midwicket where Elgar sees a swirling sky-high ball safely down into his hands. 139th over: England 404-6 (Pope 94, Curran 35) South Africa mix up their slow-bowling options, replacing Maharaj (who\u2019s bowled 51 overs) with the part-time left-arm spin of Dean Elgar. Declaration bowling? It enables England to reach 400! anyhow, with Pope nudging a single to bring up the all too rare landmark. He almost induces a wicket too, as Curran miscues a high off-drive and Rabada at long-off is a bit too slow out of the blocks and it bounces in front of him. The strike is rotated agreeably to bring up a very handy 50 partnership. 138th over: England 399-6 (Pope 92, Curran 32) Pope moves into the 90s with a confident late cut off Nortje for two, and then takes a bit of a risk by getting too early and too forward on a pull from a short ball and it dollies dangerously high but doesn\u2019t reach the man at deep midwicket, so it\u2019s a single instead. \u201cIs the pinnacle of Root\u2019s captaincy getting himself out for not much in order to get Rabada suspended?\u201d wonders Elliott Carr-Barnsley. \u201c4D chess from the lad.\u201d 137th over: England 396-6 (Pope 89, Curran 32) The Barmy Army\u2019s (absent?) trumpeter has been wholly eclipsed by the South African band\u2019s full-on orchestra today - watch and learn, infernal Sheffield Wednesday/England band (actually, don\u2019t). Pope nudges a single off Maharaj, and Curran ends the over with another blast down the ground for four. You know what, I reckon England are actually going to get 400 here. 136th over: England 391-6 (Pope 88, Curran 28) Nortje replaces the subdued Philander - he\u2019s got a bit of an air of Mournie Morkel about him, I reckon - and Curran greets him by slashing hard and getting four hacked behind gully. He\u2019s just what England need at the moment, even if not every attempted big hit comes off, as when he misjudges a not-short-enough ball next up and pulls it onto his pads. \u201cWhy not go the dessert route on naming the Stokes/Pope combination?\u201d drools Nick Killick. \u201cBenOllie isn\u2019t too far from Banoffee - solid technical base (pastry), sticky when the going is tough (toffee), a bit mad on occasion (bananas) and all topped off with some luxuriously indulgent stroke play (whipped cream). The perfect combo.\u201d Maybe, but I\u2019d like to ask about the cheeseboard first. 135th over: England 386-6 (Pope 87, Curran 24) Some pyrotechnics! The first for a while. Curran steps forward to Maharaj, meeting it on the bounce and cracks it with precision over the bowler\u2019s head, and the boundary, for SIX. Pope scurries another single to mid-on to move within 13 of that thing they I won\u2019t mention. Curran then cuts deftly for two to round off a productive over for the tourists. 134th over: England 376-6 (Pope 86, Curran 15) Curran cuts Philander fiercely for one, bringing back Pope to the strike, who pierces the field stylishly on the off for two. Rob\u2019s chat about early Noughties Vaughan and the earlier riffs on great non-retiring international retirements (Bell et al) reminds me of another whose disappearance from the international game went largely unheralded - Andy Caddick, who signed off with a seven-for at Sydney in the most significant of all dead-rubber wins in the Lean Years, and was never seen for England again. Matthew Hoggard rather shuffled away too without doing too much wrong. 133rd over: England 373-6 (Pope 84, Curran 14) Thanks Rob. I hope to be telling you about that hundred too, but I\u2019m determined not to jinx it like I often do, so enough of this. Not least because Pope\u2019s just endured a dicey over from Maharaj, facing a shout for a glance-behind, but there\u2019s no reviews and it was brushing the pad not bat anyway. And two balls later, he gets even closer, drifting one past Pope\u2019s outside-edge, De Kock whips off the bails but the batsman\u2019s back foot is just inside the crease. Excellent over from the left-arm spinner. Drinks That\u2019s it from me. Tom Davies will hopefully tell you all about Ollie Pope\u2019s maiden Test hundred \u2013 you can email him here. Thanks for your company and emails. Happy Friday! 132nd over: England 373-6 (Pope 84, Curran 14) Curran blasts Philander through extra-cover for four more. If Vern wasn\u2019t retiring, and if Kagiso Rabada hadn\u2019t been banned, there would be a case for leaving him out of the final Test. He suddenly looks very old, and England have neutralised him since the first innings of the series. That said, this pitch does him precisely no favours. Johannesburg should be better. \u201cInteresting that you mentioned Ramps just before Buttler got out,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cAfter 40 Tests I\u2019m beginning to wonder if Jos isn\u2019t this generation\u2019s Ramprakash, a player whose myriad talents never quite appear in the five-day game.\u201d I know what you mean, but I don\u2019t completely agree. Ramps cracked first-class cricket, and then some, whereas Buttler has never done that. 131st over: England 368-6 (Pope 83, Curran 10) There\u2019s plenty of turn for Maharaj to the left-handed Curran, who flicks him round the corner for three. \u201cThe best name my housemate Iain and I can come up with, following the OBO from our couch in Auckland, using all the letters, is Spookepest,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cAn anagram generator also suggests Pekepoos, but I prefer ours.\u201d Yours doesn\u2019t have a Siouxsie and the Banshees soundtrack, though. 130th over: England 364-6 (Pope 82, Curran 7) The Vern returns. Sam Curran, after an unusually sedate start of two from 14 balls, laces an uppish drive wide of short extra cover for four. It was a risky shot but he played it well. England are inching towards the promised land of 400. The last time they did in the first innings of a Test (as opposed to their first innings) was at Perth in 2017, when Dawid Malan and Jonny Bairstow scored fine centuries. Life moves pretty fast. \u201cFor many, Jos Buttler is meant to take over from Root as captain,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cPerhaps his batting will improve once he has all that other stuff to worry about.\u201d 129th over: England 359-6 (Pope 82, Curran 2) \u201cVaughan had the nervous 190s,\u201d says Dominic O\u2019Reilly, \u201cand never did make it through them.\u201d Yes, good one. Normally the failure to reach a milestone is bittersweet, but with Vaughan I can\u2019t help but smile. If I could go back in time to watch one England batsman from my cricket-watching lifetime, it would be Vaughan from July 2002 to January 2003. 128th over: England 356-6 (Pope 82, Curran 1) Replays show that Curran would have survived any review for that LBW appeal - but only just. It was hitting the stumps, but the point of contact with the pad was umpire\u2019s call. Pope has been becalmed either side of lunch, with only eight runs from his 32 deliveries. I hope he doesn\u2019t panic and try to force things. \u201cWithout wishing to stray into controversial territory, Bairstow and Stokes always seemed to bat very well together during the period before Ed Smith\u2019s strange selection ideas saw Bairstow shuttled up and down the batting order at random,\u201d says James Dark. I think that\u2019s a bit harsh on Ed Smith, not least because that partnership was producing diminishing returns long before he arrived. That said, their 399-run partnership at Cape Town was one for the books. 127th over: England 354-6 (Pope 80, Curran 0) Permission to start worrying whether Jos Buttler will ever crack Test cricket granted. Since his apparent breakthrough summer of 2018, he averages 28 from 15 Tests. The new batsman Sam Curran, meanwhile, survives a big shout for LBW after pushing around a good delivery. South Africa have used both their reviews. Oh, Jos. That\u2019s such a soft dismissal, a back-foot force that went straight back to the bowler Maharaj. It was a poor delivery, far too short, and it may have stopped in the pitch. Dominic Sibley fell in almost identical fashion in the second innings of the first Test. 126th over: England 353-5 (Pope 80, Buttler 1) Big Vern has only bowled 13 overs in this innings. Paterson continues to Buttler, who does well to repel a delivery that keeps a bit low. Uneven bounce on day two is England\u2019s friend. \u201cExtraordinary that Test cricket is \u2018so difficult\u2019 that we apparently should allow adults to act like overtired kids,\u201d says Dominic O\u2019Reilly. \u201cThis is not a war zone or a natural disaster - it\u2019s a game. If someone wants to embarrass themselves by acting like an arse then just ignore them. Don\u2019t fine them and don\u2019t justify them either. Treat them like a streaker by looking the other way until it\u2019s over.\u201d 125th over: England 353-5 (Pope 80, Buttler 1) I thought South Africa might bring Vernon Philander back to bowl at his new friend Jos Buttler. For now Maharaj continues, and Buttler gets off the mark with an easy drive through the covers. The match situation means he can treat this a bit like an ODI innings - 20 balls to have a look, and then the violence. \u201cIt seems to me that Pope gets a bit stuck in the 70s,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cI was just wondering if it is his version of the legendary \u2018nervous nineties\u2019. After all, it doesn\u2019t have to be the nineties. KP had a problem with 158, and I always seem to be dismissed in the tens when I bat.\u201d You had to bring Ramps into this, didn\u2019t you. You had to break our hearts all over again. (Also, if we\u2019re playing a game of onedownmanship, I\u2019ll see your tens and raise you the nervous noughties.) 124th over: England 351-5 (Pope 79, Buttler 0) That\u2019s Paterson\u2019s first Test wicket. He bowled an accomplished defensive spell to frustrate Stokes, who was increasingly desperately to push things forward. It was a magisterial innings from Stokes, all things considered: 120 from 214 balls with 12 fours and two sixes. South Africa\u2019s off-theory pays off. Stokes slaps a wide ball from Paterson straight to point, where Elgar takes a smart catch. 123rd over: England 351-4 (Stokes 120, Pope 79) Stokes wants another piece of Maharaj. Several, ideally. He fails to pierce the field with a reverse sweep and then drags an inside edge to short third man. \u201cI always thought Collingwood and Pietersen batted well together,\u201d says Peter Norman. \u201cVery different but somehow complimentary playing styles and characters, with the results to go with it.\u201d If not always the team results. But yes, absolutely. They\u2019d be high on the list of England\u2019s best middle-order partnerships of the last 50 years. 122nd over: England 350-4 (Stokes 119, Pope 79) \u201cGiven the discussion this morning, can I ask a genuine but clearly totally out of date question?\u201d asks Gary. \u201cWhy ISN\u2019T Ian Bell in the Test team? I think I missed something along the way - I\u2019m sure his average is pretty good and he was at times almost Gower-like to watch \u2026\u201d He was dropped \u2013 for a tour of South Africa in fact \u2013 after a dodgy 2015. I suspect England thought he would be back at some stage, but whenever there was a vacancy he wasn\u2019t in great form. 121st over: England 348-4 (Stokes 118, Pope 78) Pope survives a run-out chance, with Rabada\u2019s throw from mid-on just missing the stumps. And then Stokes is dropped by Nortje! He lifted Stokes high in the air towards wide long-on, where Nortje misjudged the flight of the ball. He managed to reach it, just about, but the ball went through his fingertips as he fell forward. Another single brings up the 200 partnership between Stopes and Pokes. 120th over: England 345-4 (Stokes 117, Pope 76) Nothing much to report. South Africa are bowling very defensively, and for the time being England are content to bat at a natural tempo. \u201cIn these informal times, we need to look at Stokes and Pope\u2019s first names,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThis partnership is clearly Bellie.\u201d 119th over: England 343-4 (Stokes 115, Pope 76) Pope takes a single off Maharaj to move to his highest Test score. \u201cAre we seriously suggesting that Rabada is a better Test bowler than Brian Statham or Malcolm Marshall,\u201d says John Murray. \u201cThey both hit top of off stump repeatedly and never engaged in hysterical reactions. Rabada has a temperament problem and has paid the price inevitable under the current demerit rules.\u201d I wasn\u2019t aware anyone was suggesting that, seriously otherwise. I agree about the hysterical reactions, but imagine how it might be twisted if Rabada said, as Marshall did of Dilip Vengsarkar, \u201cI not only wanted to get him out, I didn\u2019t mind if I decapitated him in the process.\u201d 118th over: England 341-4 (Stokes 114, Pope 75) Paterson starts after lunch to Stokes with the funkiest of fields: fifth slip, point, cover point, extra cover and mid-off. The hell Stokes cares. He takes the ring of fielders out of the game by walking down the track to cuff a boundary to the left of mid-off. \u201cHow about going with alternative letters of Stokes and Pope\u2019s names - creates a lovely sense of the baton being passed back and forth between batsmen,\u201d says Nick Watts. \u201cAnd who can argue with Sptookpees?\u201d That sounds a bit like Greg Davies\u2019s secret language. Cu-shawn! \u201cWhen was the last time the lowest score in the England top six was a quarter century?\u201d asks AJ. From memory I think it was the second innings of the third Test against Pakistan in 2016, but would have to check. \u201cLast night, the consensus among the commentariat appeared to be that the game (at 224-4) was roughly even, or England were slightly ahead, but in his interview Zak Crawley said it was \u2018a very good day for us\u2019,\u201d says Andrew Waters. \u201cYouthful enthusiasm, I tutted. But in retrospect, it struck me that he was right. \u201cThe new balls had been blunted, the bowlers tired in the heat, and two attacking batsmen well in at the crease with more to come. The game was completely set up for Stokes and co this morning, so it was a very good day. Now, it means nothing if they then don\u2019t deliver, but Crawley\u2019s quote made clear to me that England at the least have a coherent plan about how to win this cricket match, and possibly others, utilising their strengths. And that has been sorely lacking of late (other than - just go out and hit it).\u201d Yes, I like the way they have tried to bat this winter. I do think we obsess a bit too much about tempo, though. I wonder whether, as a consequence, certain players - Denly, Buttler - are torn between their natural game and their assumed role. But generally the signs are encouraging. \u201cThere can be no better evidence of England\u2019s newfound confidence,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan, \u201cthan electing to go into a break on triple Nelson.\u201d Lunchtime chitchat \u201cDoes Cook and Pietersen count as a middle-order partnership?\u201d says Stephen Brown. \u201cThey had a lot of great innings together and exemplify a lot of the contrasts you speak of: left/right, blocker/basher etc.\u201d I\u2019d say you need two middle-order batsmen, although I don\u2019t make the rules. I agree they were brilliant together, which made the fallout even sadder. Nasser Hussain is on one about the decision to ban Kagiso Rabada \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the decision. From what I saw yesterday, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a demerit point. What did he do wrong? Was there any physical contact? Was there any sledging? A bowler shows some emotion. We sit in air-conditioned rooms and have this righteous, holier-than-thou attitude. I think we forget what it\u2019s like out there in the heat of battle. \u201cIf Jos Buttler - the calmest bloke on the planet - can stand behind the stumps and swear four times at Vernon Philander, you know the emotions of a game of cricket. This lad has had no physical contact, hasn\u2019t said a word, he\u2019s shown some emotion for bowling a jaffa. I tell you what, let\u2019s have 11 robots out there, let\u2019s take emotion out of the game. \u201cWhen you saw yesterday, did you think [points aggressively into the middle distance], \u2018He must be banned for that, let\u2019s get this lad out of the next game?\u2019 [Would you want your kids celebrating like that, Nass?] Yes. I\u2019d want my kids to show emotion. We\u2019ll have robots, 11 robots. You can sit in an air-conditioned comm box and say, \u2018Oh calm down, isn\u2019t it a lovely game.\u2019 We know it\u2019s not a lovely game - we\u2019ve played Test cricket. We know how much it takes out of you.\u201d That was sheer delightful punditry. Breaking news: Virat Kohli is batting I forgot to say thanks for all your emails. I\u2019m a bit behind - I swear it was easier to deal with an OBO inbox 15 years ago - so if your superior email hasn\u2019t been published, that\u2019s probably why. It\u2019s definitely me. Oh aye. 117th over: England 335-4 (Stokes 108, Pope 75) A quiet over from Maharaj completes a near perfect morning for England: 27 overs, 111 runs and no wickets. Ben Stokes was imperious, Ollie Pope merely superb, and by the end South Africa\u2019s collective spirit required an X-ray. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session. One final thought: the absolute state of Ben Stokes right now. 116th over: England 333-4 (Stokes 107, Pope 74) My colleague Martin Rose tells me it was Stokes who encouraged Pope to review that LBW decision with only a couple of seconds remaining on the DRS timer. Stokes can do nothing wrong at the moment. If he fell into a barrel of Brexit, he\u2019d come up clutching a united society. 115th over: England 331-4 (Stokes 105, Pope 74) Stokes skips back in his crease to drive Maharaj beautifully through the covers for four. Technically, he is close to the complete batsman. That\u2019s another reason to admire Stokes - he works harder on his game than anyone in the England team. Not all geniuses rely on their natural ability; Kevin Pietersen was another one who spent half his life in the nets. \u201cRe: your earlier thoughts on England middle-order partnerships,\u201d says Tim Barry, \u201care we seeing the emergence of Stopes?\u201d I know what you\u2019re all thinking \u2013 POKES, YOU IDIOT, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I\u2019LL TRACK YOU DOWN AND TEACH YOU A THING OR TWO ABOUT PORTMANTEAUS WITH MY FISTS \u2013 but Tim might have a point. Stokes has to be the senior partner, surely. Stopes does sound a bit weird, though, and is not exactly challenging \u2018cellar door\u2019 when it comes to phonetic beauty. 114th over: England 326-4 (Stokes 100, Pope 74) \u201cIs it just me that doesn\u2019t like the narrative \u2018Pope and Stokes lead England fightback after slow start\u2019,\u201d says Chris Lingwood. \u201cI\u2019d much rather it was \u2018Pope and Stokes capitalise on unusually competent opening batting.\u2019 Especially in the light of this morning. Look what happens when you are 20 for 3!\u201d Agreed. I think England have made good progress as a Test batting line-up this winter. Their cloth-cutting has noticeably improved. Ollie Pope has an LBW decision overturned on review. He walked across his stumps to Paterson, missed a flick across the line and was hit on the pad. Bruce Oxenford gave it out on the field, and although Pope reviewed I thought it would be Umpire\u2019s Call. But replays showed it was missing leg stump, so Pope survived. \u201cYou beauty!\u201d shouted Joe Root on the England balcony. 113.3 overs: England 326-4 (Stokes 100, Pope 74) Stokes drives Paterson for a single to reach a masterful century from 174 balls. He celebrates modestly, taking off his glove to salute his unwell father Ged, and then gets on with business. It\u2019s Stokes\u2019 third hundred in the last nine Tests - before that he had six in 53 - and another reminder, not that it\u2019s required, that he has become England\u2019s best batsman. 113th over: England 325-4 (Stokes 99, Pope 74) Maharaj changes ends and bowls a maiden to Pope. Although Pope has struggled slightly to rotate strike this morning, he has scored enough boundaries to keep things moving. He has 74 from 132 balls, Stokes 99 from 171. 112th over: England 325-4 (Stokes 99, Pope 74) Dane Paterson replaces Maharaj. South Africa\u2019s seamers are bowling wide of off stump to a 7/2 field, an impromptu tribute to Jacques Kallis. Stokes plays a clever late cut for two to move within one run of giving us all another opportunity to get all misty-eyed about his greatness. 111th over: England 323-4 (Stokes 97, Pope 74) South Africa have looked pretty flat this morning, although that shouldn\u2019t detract from the brilliance of England\u2019s batting. Listen to him: the brilliance of England\u2019s batting! Meanwhile, here\u2019s more on Kagiso Rabada\u2019s ban. 110th over: England 319-4 (Stokes 95, Pope 72) Stokes moves into the nineties with a reverse sweep off Maharaj, and then clouts another slog sweep for four. That takes Stokes to 4,000 Test runs, and there are unconfirmed reports that he has done a bit of bowling as well. 109th over: England 313-4 (Stokes 89, Pope 72) Pope swivel-pulls Rabada gracefully round the corner for another boundary. That takes him into the seventies; I\u2019d imagine his inner chimp is already raising the bat too all corners of the ground. Here\u2019s Mark Hooper. \u201cThe best example of Stokes as the thinking/versatile cricketer was the sight of him in that World Cup final, dead on his feet, doing the sums in his head after every ball working out whether to stick or twist.\u201d And even recalling a match between India and Bangladesh in 2016. How he had such clarity I\u2019ll never know. 108th over: England 308-4 (Stokes 88, Pope 68) After a quiet spell for England - three runs in four overs - Pope threads Maharaj to the extra-cover boundary. Lovely shot. 107th over: England 303-4 (Stokes 88, Pope 64) \u201cThere seems to be a lot of \u2018political correctness gone mad\u2019 reaction to Rabada\u2019s ban,\u201d says Andrew Moore, \u201cbut I would say two things. Firstly, it didn\u2019t look great to run up to the stumps and scream in Root\u2019s personal space, even if it wasn\u2019t in his face. Secondly, he hasn\u2019t been banned just for yesterday\u2019s incident. If I\u2019m on 9 points and I get clocked doing 33 in a 30 surely most of the blame for losing my licence is on me?\u201d Yes, as the chaps on Sky said earlier, he isn\u2019t the quickest learner, as he has been in trouble a few times before. It was provocative, I agree with that, but I think we should show a bit more empathy for players who make slight, instinctive misjudgements when elite sport is at its most intense. Most of us struggle to control our temper on social media, never mind in the heightened environment of Test cricket. But I do appreciate the alternative view. I suppose we all put different amounts of salt in the stew. 106th over: England 302-4 (Stokes 87, Pope 64) A maiden from Maharaj to Pope. South Africa have gone on the defensive, and probably feel they are playing for a draw now. This is why Stokes is so good - not only is he willing to take risks that others would not, but he has the intelligence to calculate those on each given day. He really is the most admirable cricketer. 105th over: England 302-4 (Stokes 87, Pope 64) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Pete. \u201cWith the emergence of Ollie Pope do you think it\u2019s about time Ian Bell retired from international cricket. He\u2019s done a great job for England in the last couple of years but I don\u2019t think we need him anymore.\u201d It was really sad, but kind of fitting given the way he was undervalued for much of his career, that Bell never even had a press conference \u2013 never mind a standing ovation on the field \u2013 to mark the end of his Test career. 104th over: England 300-4 (Stokes 86, Pope 63) Stokes cuts Maharaj for a couple to bring up a rapid 150 partnership from just 236 balls. The crescendo of England\u2019s batting line-up brings to mind the Flower/Strauss teams, although Strauss, Cook and Trott were a higher-class version of Crawley, Sibley and Denly. \u201cHello from hot, polluted (but non-rainy) Bangkok,\u201d says Leo Nine. \u201cA question: I noticed, while watching the last Test in the pub, that the S. Africans have very low player numbers on the front of their shirts compared to those from other Test nations. Did they only start the player numbers after readmission,? Also thought to mention that I just booked to go and see the Test in Galle in March. A bit of a stretch perhaps, but might there be any other OBO readers going who\u2019d like to share a car (as much for company as cost) from the airport in Colombo to Galle around midday on March 17?\u201d If anyone is interested, let me know and I\u2019ll forward your email to Leo. And yes, I\u2019m pretty sure the numbers started after readmission. 103rd over: England 296-4 (Stokes 83, Pope 62) Rabada replaces Nortje, not much happens, and that\u2019s drinks. 102nd over: England 295-4 (Stokes 83, Pope 61) A rare poor ball from Maharaj is dragged round the corner for four by Stokes. Scratch that, they were leg byes. Stokes makes amends by launching the next ball over midwicket and out of the ground. This is glorious batting. Apart from a five-minute spell when he lost concentration, he has played an almost perfect innings. England have scored at 5.92 per over today, more than double their rate yesterday. \u201cHe took his time,\u201d says Tom Bowtell, \u201cbut in his 13th over Philander finally reached the ultimate Benaud career stats of 222 wickets at 22.22.\u201d I haven\u2019t been this emotional since I learned that Alec Stewart (born 8 April 1963) finished his Test career with 8463 runs. 101st over: England 285-4 (Stokes 77, Pope 61) Pope has a full range of strokes, and he demonstrates another with a crisp square drive for four off Nortje. I suppose the precedent of Haseeb Hameed should encourage caution, but Pope looks so good. \u201cI\u2019m all in on the Pope hype,\u201d says Adrian Foster. \u201cDo we think the selectors might pick Ian Bell this summer so we can have the pleasure of watching them bat together? Or would the world collapse in on itself at the sheer beauty of it?\u201d You say that like it would be a bad thing. Maybe the beauty of their partnership would be reset everything, and the world would be sane again. 100th over: England 279-4 (Stokes 76, Pope 56) Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack. Stokes, who usually goes after Maharaj, hacks his second delivery through midwicket for four - and slog-sweeps the last ball of the over for six. Lovely batting from Stokes, who has been in a hurry this morning. It\u2019s not without risk, far from it, but he wants to give England as much time as possible to take 20 wickets on this slow pitch. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI missed the Rabada celebration that has earned him a ban. I assume it was the full effin and jeffin in the England captain\u2019s face, with associated hand gestures, all the way to the boundary rope?\u201d Yes. I suppose, on reflection, he was a bit out of order with that suplex. 99th over: England 267-4 (Stokes 64, Pope 56) \u201c\u2019Morning, Rob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIn your preamble about Stokes and Pope, it was noticeable that you didn\u2019t mention their red hair. As an ex-redhead myself, this was welcome, since it\u2019s really a form of racism. The Talk-Talk guys haven\u2019t got the message yet.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen the phrase \u201cex-redhead\u201d before, even though I\u2019m also one. I was going to suggest forming an Ex-Redhead Society, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be in charge of verifying membership. 98th over: England 264-4 (Stokes 62, Pope 55) Pope plays a nice late cut off Philander that is well stopped by the diving Hamza in the gully. Those late cuts are another homage, deliberate or otherwise, to Ian Bell. \u201cOn Thorpe\u2019s partnerships,\u201d says Timothy, \u201cyou seem to have Statsguru in your head. He seemed to be a good influence on Hick too.\u201d That\u2019s interesting. I can\u2019t remember too many partnerships with Hick, apart from that biggie at Brisbane in 1994. 97th over: England 260-4 (Stokes 60, Pope 53) Stokes plays a disdainful short-arm jab for two off Nortje. Batting is starting to look easy for him, but with Stokes that isn\u2019t always a good sign. It often means he is losing concentration, and that\u2019s definitely the case here. He is lucky to get away with an edge that flies through the vacant second-slip area for four. \u201cYour Pope/Stokes preamble is proving pleasingly prescient,\u201d says Emma John. \u201cThanks for keeping me updated on the rain delay, it meant I got an extra half hour in bed.\u201d I would have made a great weatherman. 96th over: England 252-4 (Stokes 52, Pope 53) Vernon Philander replaces Kagiso Rabada. Pope late cuts him for four, bringing up his first century partnership with Stokes. Spoiler: it isn\u2019t their last. He repeats the stroke later in the over to bring up another high-class fifty, his third in the last four innings. If you\u2019re not excited about what Ollie Pope might achieve in the next decade, you should seek urgent medical advice. This is a load of idealistic crap. 95th over: England 243-4 (Stokes 51, Pope 45) Stokes is beaten, flashing at a short ball from Nortje. Careful now. Those lapses of concentration are his biggest weakness as a batsman. He walks right across his stumps to the next ball, flicking it in the air on the leg side for a single. It was probably a safer shot than it looked. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cWould like to add to your list of great England middle-order partnerships: Graham Thorpe and anyone.\u201d Ha, yes. I\u2019m trying to think who was his best partner. Nasser, maybe, though he also had some terrific partnerships with Freddie Flintoff in the second part of his career. 94th over: England 241-4 (Stokes 50, Pope 44) A short ball from Rabada does nothing off the pitch, which gives Stokes plenty of time to cart a pull to the midwicket boundary. He repeats the stroke later in the over to reach another masterful half-century from 102 balls. He has never batted better than in the last nine months, and his career average (36.62 and rising) is the highest it has been since he made that glorious hundred at Perth in only his second Test. 93rd over: England 231-4 (Stokes 40, Pope 44) Pope gets the first boundary of the day with a lovely stroke, flashing a shortish delivery from Nortje wide of gully. England have found a player, no point denying it. He\u2019s class. 92nd over: England 225-4 (Stokes 39, Pope 39) In a surprising development, Kagiso Rabada will open the bowling from the Duckpond End. Stokes punches a couple of confident drives without piercing the field, and it\u2019s a maiden. 91st over: England 225-4 (Stokes 39, Pope 39) Anrich Nortje opens the bowling to Ben Stokes, who turns a short ball off the hip for the first run of the day. Stokes has a good winter with the bat, with an average in excess of 50, though he\u2019ll be annoyed that he hasn\u2019t scored a century. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Jamie Gordon. \u201cThe sun\u2019s just come out over Woking and the weather is heading in the direction of Port Elizabeth - we should be in for a fine day once we get started.\u201d This will be a two-hour morning session, despite the delayed start, with lunch put back to 12.45pm local time, 10.45pm in England. There are rumours that Kagiso Rabada is in trouble for his celebration of Joe Root\u2019s wicket yesterday. This ongoing attempt to impose the genteel ambience of a tea party upon international sport really is lamentable nonsense. \u201cIt seems that subscription channels, with their big pockets, are hoovering up the Test series in different countries,\u201d says Jim Todd. \u201cMy question is: how long before we have to subscribe and pay for OBO text commentary? And when that happens will the star OBO commentators be worth millions from all our subscription cash?\u201d Now that\u2019s an IPL-style auction I\u2019d like to see. \u2018I have five over here, do I hear ten? Ten pence for Rob Smyth?\u2019 Play will start at 8.45am, it says here. The covers have come off, though there\u2019s no scheduled start time yet. It\u2019s raining again. Play won\u2019t be starting at 8.20am, that\u2019s for sure. The upside of the delay is a fascinating chat about the minutiae of batting between Nick Knight, Dawid Malan and Rob Key in the Sky studio. Key, in particular, is a sensational pundit. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cFrom an aptly very soggy and dark Salford, seems like it\u2019s raining everywhere today. Hopefully Pope and Stokes can drip runs from a tired South African attack, the scoreboard will begin to flow and they\u2019ll thunder us into a healthy 350+ total with a storm of boundaries. Or not.\u201d \u201cThis rain rather goes against the \u2018Port Elizabeth, weather fine\u2019 earworm I get whenever I see or hear the name Port Elizabeth,\u201d says Andy Hockley. Never trust an earworm. I drank Pepsi for a decade, thinking it was good for energy, and now look at my crooked smile. Play will start at 8.20am/10.20am local time, weather permitting. If you need a live cricket fix, Jonathan Howcroft is your man. Ach, it\u2019s raining again and the covers are going back on. It looks like it could be an on-off morning, though the forecast is better after lunch. There\u2019s been a bit of rain in Port Elizabeth, so the start will be delayed by 10 minutes. Breakfast reading Hello. Middle-order partnerships are an underappreciated part of cricket. We know all about the great opening pairs, yet we rarely talk about those down the order. And while they don\u2019t bat together as often as the openers, they can still rack up thousands of runs together. There are a few things that help to make a good partnership: contrasts (left and right hand, tall and short, dasher and blocker), off-field friendship, telepathic running between the wickets. But perhaps the most important is an indefinable chemistry. You could sense it in England\u2019s best middle-order partnerships of modern times: Lamb and Smith, Hussain and Butcher, Flintoff and Jones, Pietersen and Collingwood. And now, perhaps, Stokes and Pope. It\u2019s early in their relationship - you want me to grab a dictionary? - and they sound like a firm of funeral directors. But they look great together and could put on thousands of runs for the fifth wicket in the next few years. They are good readers of the game, naturally positive but not too proud or dumb to sit in when required, and have the age-old advantage of a left/right partnership. They first batted together against India at Trent Bridge in 2018, a union that lasted precisely four balls. But since being reunited this winter, all three of their partnerships have exceeded fifty. They added 76 yesterday evening, calmly taking England to 224 for four at the close, and have the chance to bat South Africa out of the game today. They messed up a similar opportunity in the first Test of the winter at Mount Manganui, when batting became a bit too easy, but the sluggish nature of this pitch should enhance their concentration. And if Stokes carts the first ball of the day to midwicket, this preamble never happened.",

The action gets underway at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium at 7pm AEST.</p> <p>In recent times it\u2019s been rare to find the mighty Indian cricket leviathan under the pump but a 10-wicket ODI defeat on home soil with a near-fully fit squad (one skippered by no less than Virat Kohli) will have that effect. Not only that, but Tuesday\u2019s mauling in Mumbai was India\u2019s fourth consecutive home defeat to Australia. A reaction can be expected in Rajkot.</p> <p>Kohli lamented after the defeat earlier this week that his side failed to bat with enough purpose during a first innings that was allowed to meander during the middle overs like the bad old days of one-day cricket. Surely he will restore himself to first drop and ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again tonight. </p> <p>It\u2019s not all about Kohli though. Australia have acclimatised quickly to Indian conditions and boast a well balanced side in excellent form. The pair of opening centurions meant the likes of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were not required to bat, while the bowling attack covered all bases, highlighted by Pat Cummins\u2019s discipline, Adam Zampa\u2019s bravery and Mitchell Starc\u2019s unerring wicket-taking yorkers. </p> <p>Another fascinating duel lies in store.

      "bodyText": "To Banglalore! Thanks for your company today. We\u2019ll be back with you for the third, final and deciding ODI on Sunday at Chinnaswamy Stadium. Bye for now! KL Rahul is player of the match. Well, the mystery is solved. He\u2019s now talking to Harsha Bhogle. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better start and he\u2019s enjoying the various roles. Coming in at No5 he had to just give himself a couple of balls before going at it. Pleased he played his role with the gloves too - Kuldeep is very happy with him. Hasn\u2019t done it a lot at the top level but has been a bit at domestic level recently. Kohli and Dhawan get trophies. Kuldeep gets a trophy. Everyone gets a trophy. I\u2019m still not entirely sure who the player of the match is. Kohli speaks! Social media means panic button is hit too early, especially with where he was batting in the first ODI. Thrilled with KL Rahul, who moved to five and batted with maturity and class. They don\u2019t focus on the panic inside the dressing room. Important few games for Dhawan to get on a run after a period where he was short of runs. When he plays well, India play well. On Rohit\u2019s left shoulder, there\u2019s no tear so he should be good for Sunday\u2019s match. Very pleased with how the quicks closed out the game with their yorker barrage. Aaron Finch is up. He\u2019s given trophy for not winning today - I wonder where that will go? Right, he\u2019s talking. They were one wicket short at crucial times when India were batting and then chasing. Zampa a big positive in the series so far. Smith\u2019s batting a big plus too, also Marnus. They love batting together. Only time they aren\u2019t together is when they are asleep. \u201cJust as well,\u201d adds Harsha. Very good. Kuldeep Yadav speaks. I think he\u2019s man of the match? He should be. It\u2019s hard to tell at these presentation ceremonies. He\u2019s happy with how he bowled. We\u2019ll hear from the captains shortly, who I expect will have a bit more to say. Good fun, that. Yes, Australia end up falling a fair bit short of the total but they gave it a decent crack without ever taking the ascendancy in the chase. The critical over was the 38th when Kuldeep picked up Carey and Smith within four balls. The latter was two short of a ton and looked for a time, especially when he was with Labuachagne earlier, like it could be on... but not to be. To the presentation. Bumrah gets his wicket, Zampa edging him through to Rahul. And that\u2019s the win! 49th over: Australia 304-9 (Richardson 24, Zampa 6) Target 341. RICHO MAN! He\u2019s swinging to the last, lifting Shami through midwicket for a second boundary. And a third too - what a shot! It was a low full toss, which he got underneath, and middled over mid-on. Will he keep going? WHY NOT?! SIX over extra cover! Brathwaite-esque, that. Final ball... and four more over mid-off, inside-out! Well, there we go, Richardson has nailed 19 off the over, the best of the chase. In case you were wondering, that leaves them 37 to win off the final over. I know, I know. 48th over: Australia 285-9 (Richardson 6, Zampa 5) Target 341. Bumrah to bowl his ninth, so far going for just 26. He was outstanding at the start, refusing to let Australia\u2019s openers get off to another flyer, banking two early maidens. He deserves a wicket from one of these pristine yorkers but it isn\u2019t to be. Richardson makes room and swings at the one he doesn\u2019t quite land, slapping a straight four. In response, Bumrah sends a sharp bouncer down, which hits him somewhere other than the bat - maybe the arm guard? He\u2019s straight up and smiling, though. 47th over: Australia 279-9 (Richardson 1, Zampa 4) Target 341. The third over tonight where two wickets have fallen. Zampa ends it on a high note for the tourists, slapping an uppercut over point for four, but it counts for nothing now. Starc swings at a short one but only manages to edge it through to Rahul, who has had a very good night with the gloves after an excellent turn with the bat. Saini earned that, beating Agar with another great yorker - they\u2019ve landed them magnificently at the death. DRS is called upon but the decision is upheld. 46th over: Australia 274-7 (Agar 25, Starc 6) Target 341. Shami\u2019s penultimate over to Starc and Agar, attacking the stumps throughout. They\u2019re able to get bat on ball to each well-directed delivery, but only to the sweepers for singles. The required rate for Australia is now up to 17 an over; it\u2019d take something miraculous. 45th over: Australia 268-7 (Agar 22, Starc 3) Target 341. Credit to Saini, kept his cool in his previous over and got out of it with three excellent yorkers to build the pressure before Shami cashed in with two wickets in two balls. He played his role. 44th over: Australia 263-7 (Agar 20, Starc 0) Target 341. Apologies, the technology problem from earlier has returned. I\u2019ll do my best to keep the updates coming. Shami had another lbw shout before he over was done. THE HAT-TRICK BALL WAS VERY CLOSE! Given not out only just missing Starc\u2019s leg stump, the projection shows. India didn\u2019t have a review in any case. Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v! A carbon copy. Shami is on a hat-trick! Turner missed, Shami hit. A yorker on middle and off, the Australian backed away to make space but couldn\u2019t get his bat down in time. Perfect death bowling. 43rd over: Australia 259-5 (Turner 13, Agar 20) Target 341. Shot, Ashton. Mindful that Saini has three overs left and that the have to take him down, the left-hander hammers a pull shot for four. He makes it back to back boundaries with an equally emphatic cut shot. Rohit has hurt his shoulder trying to cut off the second of those shots, straight away grabbing his left arm and hitting the deck. We\u2019ll keep an eye on that - he\u2019s off the field receiving treatment. Agar goes in that direction again after the re-start, using the pace behind point for a couple more. So, that\u2019s ten from three balls to start. How will Saini bounce back? Nicely, with a very good yorker; one down the ground the rest. Turner has a couple to look at but he cops an excellent yorker too. Another to finish, the best of the lot - a dot. Great fightback. They need 82 off 42 from here, which is just a tick under 12 an over. 42nd over: Australia 247-5 (Turner 12, Agar 9) Target 341. Kuldeep is back now for his tenth and final over, using his wrong\u2019un - the ball that did Smith in - to Turner whenever he\u2019s bowling at the right hander. They\u2019re able to get him away to the sweepers, the pressure building, so Turner takes a swipe at the final delivery... it hangs in the sky for a long, long time... but there\u2019s nobody there to claim the catch at square leg. They come back for a couple. He deserved a third - well bowled. 41st over: Australia 241-5 (Turner 8, Agar 7) Target 341. Bumrah: he\u2019s so good, rinse and repeat. Agar steered him with skill to begin, down to the rope - that put the pressure back onto the Indian No1. But you wouldn\u2019t know it the way he landed the rest, his yorker a thing of beauty. The required rate is now 11. 40th over: Australia 235-5 (Turner 7, Agar 2) Target 341. Right, after the appeal there was a ropey wide to Agar - a misdirected slower ball, by the looks. But Shami was back on his yorker length shortly thereafter, a quick single considered by Turner; they\u2019re lucky the bowler didn\u2019t successfully throw down the stumps. On paper Australia are still in this but one of these two need to start middling it. NOT OUT! Didn\u2019t look a bad shout live but it swung plenty after hitting in line, missing leg stump entirely. No umpire\u2019s call, so India lose their review. IS TURNER LBW TO SHAMI? Kohli is sending it to the TV ump. Looked a decent shout live. Stand by. 39th over: Australia 228-5 (Turner 3, Agar 1) Target 341. Well, the obvious thing to say is that Turner has been here before. Give or take, this was the situation he walked into at Mohali in March last year when Australia chased 360 from nowhere. Bumrah is brought back by Kohli after the two wickets from Kuldeep, frustrated by four leg byes off Turner\u2019s front pad when missing his line. 10.3 an over needed. 38th over: Australia 221-5 (Turner 1, Agar 0) Target 341. Watching that replay back, it was the lack of pace on the ball to Smith that sorted him out. Superb variation. Kuldeep has reached 100 ODI wickets two matches quicker than Warne. Handy! Make that 101 for Kuldeep! Smith chops on two short of a ton. He made room for himself outside the leg stump to cut but an inside edge ends his evening. A checked drive, staight to the captain at cover! Kuldeep now has 100 ODI scalps. 37th over: Australia 219-3 (Smith 97, Carey 18) Target 341. Saini has four more to get through, so he\u2019ll be bowling in that final ten. I\u2019m not sure this was the plan but he\u2019s bowled pretty well so far and at decent pace. He gives Smith some width though, carved away with relative ease to the boundary. They need 9.4 an over. 36th over: Australia 212-3 (Smith 91, Carey 17) Target 341. Well bowled, Kuldeep. He\u2019s turning past Smith\u2019s inside edge, up for lbw. He\u2019s getting some spin on this road. Three singles are their lot. Meanwhile on TV, I don\u2019t understand the context but Hayden and Slater are talking about having a fist fight or something? 35th over: Australia 209-3 (Smith 89, Carey 16) Target 341. Jadeja\u2019s last over and SMITH LANDS A BLOW before he\u2019s done, dancing and launching him waaaay over the rope at midwicket for SIX MORE. We know from his efforts in Canberra earlier this summer in a T20 against Pakistan that he has the ability to put the foot down just as effectively as he does occupy the crease in Test cricket. Put it this way: if he can bat for another ten overs, they should be most of the way to the finish line. 34th over: Australia 199-3 (Smith 81, Carey 14) Target 341. By pull the trigger, that doesn\u2019t mean swinging at everything quite yet - as they note on telly, ten or 12 an over in the final ten isn\u2019t that problematic in modern ODI cricket. In any case, Carey is the man making a play in this over, slog-sweeping Kuldeep for SIX - the first of the chase! He didn\u2019t get all of it, but we know Carey doesn\u2019t need to - a very powerful player. He goes again in the same direction next up, albeit along the carpet, beating the sweeper to the rope for four more. 13 off it... they needed that. 33rd over: Australia 186-3 (Smith 78, Carey 4) Target 341. Jadeja is doing a wonderful job as Kohli\u2019s Mr Fix It, giving Carey nothing unfurl the arms at in a manner that could threaten the boundary. Smith needs to pull the trigger shortly. 32nd over: Australia 182-3 (Smith 77, Carey 2) Target 341. Carey can\u2019t get Kuldeep away reversing, off the mark with the conventional sweep instead. A period of brief consolidation after losing Labuschagne, drinks taken with 159 needed in 18. To close the loop on that odd leg before referral, I\u2019m reminded that hotspot is never used in India. Time we standardised all that too, isn\u2019t it? 31st over: Australia 178-3 (Smith 75, Carey 0) Target 341. So, it\u2019s the former captain and the next captain with the better part of nine an over to get. Strap in. Kohli rewarded! He\u2019s used Jadeja across four spells to tie Australia up at various intervals and it\u2019s worked here in prompting a rare false stroke from Labuschagne, miscuing out to deep extra cover where he\u2019s taken safely by Shami. 30th over: Australia 171-2 (Smith 69, Labuschagne 45) Target 341. Bumrah on for his sixth over - surely the last we\u2019ll see of him before the death. Australia must be mindful of this too, happily playing India\u2019s main man out for three singles. Ahhh, there is no use of hotspot in this series, Michael Slater confirms. So much for the heavyweight title fight or whatever that nonsense that was from earlier. 29th over: Australia 168-2 (Smith 67, Labuschagne 44) Target 341. I don\u2019t want to skewer Michael Gough here - this isn\u2019t his fault. But, for mine, that\u2019s another assessment that builds the case for specialist TV umps. NOT OUT! Kohli retains his review for an umpire\u2019s call on leg stump. The ump upstairs, Michael Gough, insisted there was daylight between bat and pad. It didn\u2019t look that clear cut to me? Far from it. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter - he\u2019s still there. BIG MOMENT! Has Jadeja trapped Smith lbw? Kohli is sending it upstairs! 28th over: Australia 163-2 (Smith 64, Labuschagne 42) Target 341. Ooooh, shooooooot! Labuschagne gets his first look at Bumrah and strokes him down the ground: a magnificent on-drive for four on the up. The summer of Marnus continues. This is turning into a very dangerous union, now worth 81. \u201cRegarding your dismay (over #24) on the TV guys still talking about the stumping,\u201d notes Krishnamoorthy, \u201cyou do not know Indians. We still talk about Kapil Dev\u2019s 175 during every World Cup.\u201d Perhaps, but this is hardly that! 27th over: Australia 156-2 (Smith 62, Labuschagne 37) Target 341. They needed that from Marnus. With one ball to go in Jadeja\u2019s set, just a single from it to that point, the new man to this Australian middle order plays a supreme inside-out cover drive to the boundary. For the first time, the required rate is above eight. 26th over: Australia 151-2 (Smith 61, Labuschagne 33) Target 341. Saini is attacking the stumps and doing it really well. In excess of 140 clicks throughout, they are forced to play mostly inside the V, adding only one single. Those are the overs that do a lot of damage to a batting team when embarking upon a big chase. What gibberish the clash of the titans branding around this series. I mean, yes, these teams are good. But I heard Hayden call it a \u2018heavyweight title fight\u2019 earlier. It\u2019s a three-game jolly six months after the World Cup. Let\u2019s just be fine with that. 25th over: Australia 150-2 (Smith 60, Labuschagne 33) Target 341. Such good batting from Smith, picking up Jadeja\u2019s straight one and helping it fine of the man on the 45 for his seventh boundary. At the halfway point of the chase, Australia need 191 further runs at 7.64 an over. Winviz has that at 91 per cent for India but I don\u2019t share that view. Sure, still India\u2019s game but the visitors aren\u2019t badly placed. Mark Wood is going wild at Port Elizabeth. There\u2019s a movie in that. 24th over: Australia 144-2 (Smith 55, Labuschagne 32) Target 341. Saini now for his fifth over, presumably the bowler Kohli won\u2019t want delivering too many in the final ten given his relative inexperience. This isn\u2019t a bad one though, sending down a couple of nicely angled yorkers. A poor ball follows to Smith, giving him a good look at a cut shot, but he can\u2019t put it away. They are still talking about the stumping on television some 62 runs after Finch was dismissed. Give me strength. 23rd over: Australia 138-2 (Smith 52, Labuschagne 29) Target 341. Kuldeep keeps Labuschagne quiet for the first three balls of his fresh over so the Queenslander gets resourceful, successfully lapping a couple. He backs that up with a stand-and-deliver flat-bat swat through midwicket. As you do! Brilliantly timed. He\u2019s well in. \u201cSurely that is five penalty runs there,\u201d argues Dechlan Brennan of Rohit\u2019s effort there when pretending throw after collecting the sweep down at long leg. 22nd over: Australia 132-2 (Smith 52, Labuschagne 23) Target 341. Shami has now bowled six overs, going for 45. Kohli might have a bit of a mathematical issue to deal with later in the innings. It\u2019s where Kedar Yadav was useful in this team. \u201cSmith and Labuschagne,\u201d emails Krishnamoorthy. \u201cOne a disgrace to the law of averages (thanks to Rob Smyth) and the other an autocorrect\u2019s dream.\u201d 21st over: Australia 127-2 (Smith 50, Labuschagne 21) Target 341. Kuldeep is up with a shout for leg before against Labuschagne, who misses his sweep. It\u2019s less \u2018howzat?\u2019 and more series of insistent pants at the umpire. I\u2019ve often wondered about this obnoxious appealing technique... surely it doesn\u2019t help? Alas, it is given not out but would have been umpire\u2019s call on the off-stump had he put up the finger. Make of that what you will. Smith takes one off his hip to raise a half-century in 47 deliveries, a fine effort after a challenging start. Has to go big now. 20th over: Australia 121-2 (Smith 48, Labuschagne 17) Target 341. Sorry again about these delays, it is been looked into and hopefully won\u2019t take long to resolve. Shami has been brought back on and just as it was the previous time when Kohli turned to his opening bowler, it hasn\u2019t gone to plan. And just as it was in the previous over of this innings, Steve Smith has finished the over with a boundary. It\u2019s a beautiful shot too, using the pace of the ball to angle his upper cut fine of third man. There was no edge about that, he knew exactly what he was doing. 19th over: Australia 112-2 (Smith 42, Labuschagne 14) Target 341. Unbelievably, they are still talking about the Finch stumping on the TV coverage. But these two have put that behind them, Smith finishing another productive over with a lavish inside-out cover drive. He has that look in the eye, all of a sudden. Here we go. 19th over: Australia 112-2 (Smith 42, Labuschagne 14) Target 341. Unbelievably, they are still talking about the Finch stumping on the TV coverage. But these two have put that behind them, Smith finishing another productive over with a lavish inside-out cover drive. He has that look in the eye, all of a sudden. Here we go. 18th over: Australia 104-2 (Smith 38, Labuschagne 12) Target 341. Smith\u2019s turn to take it to the Indian spinners, pinning his ears back to clobber Jadeja through cover for four. Nobody is stopping that. These two have put on 22 in 17 balls. 17th over: Australia 95-2 (Smith 30, Labuschagne 9) Target 341. Apologies for the delay, we\u2019re experiencing some technical issues. Back to regular programming asap. Marnus played a lavish lofted drive over long-off though - what a start. 16th over: Australia 86-2 (Smith 28, Labuschagne 2) Target 341. Who woulda thought it? Smith and Labuschagne batting together. We\u2019re going to say that a lot over the next decade. The new man, playing his first ODI innings in his second match, is off the mark straight away with a confident drive down the ground, adding another in the same direction later in the over. Confident start. Finch jumped down the track at Jadeja, tried to put him on the moon over midwicket but missed, the bails taken tidily by Rahul. Many replays were looked at by the third umpire to satisfy himself that the Australian captain\u2019s boot wasn\u2019t behind the line, which feels like the right call from what we\u2019ve seen. An unconvincing stay ends as the players take a drink. India are on top. IS FINCH STUMPED? We\u2019re going to find out! Stand by! 15th over: Australia 74-1 (Finch 30, Smith 21) Target 341. Kuldeep is on, he has 99 wickets and Smith was just one. Sorry. It is true - the wristspinner is one away from 100 ODI scalps in his excellent career so far, only once dismissing Smith. That\u2019s not far from twice with the final ball of his initial over here, the former captain trying to hammer him straight over his head, a fat edge clearing extra cover. 14th over: Australia 74-1 (Finch 30, Smith 21) Target 341. Good captaincy from Kohli to get a fouth over out of the inexperienced Saini while the Australians are battling to pile on the runs, and for the second time he does Finch for bounce, the skipper less than thrilled. There\u2019s an ambitious yet enthusiastic appeal from Kohli at midwicket later in the over, keen to find out is his opposing number has been strangled down the legside, but it was all pad. It\u2019s a poor finish though, giving Finch a short ball on his hip, dealt with with a pull shot to the backward square rope. It has taken a while and he\u2019s far from fluent, but into the 30s he goes. 13th over: Australia 66-1 (Finch 23, Smith 20) Target 341. Another tight over with plenty of oohs and aahs as Jadeja pins both batsmen largely to the crease. 12th over: Australia 63-1 (Finch 22, Smith 18) Target 341. Saini stays on for now and beats Finch with a bit of extra bounce. Ooh, some real drama later in the over with Smith miles from his ground when Rohit\u2019s underarm flick from four metres passes the stumps from midwicket. A direct hit and Smith is gone by a metre. And they know it too. Saini backs it up with a bumper, Finch swinging and missing. With the exception of Smith\u2019s one big over, this is far from convincing batting. Over at Port Elizabeth, England have moved beyond 400 for the first time since the Mesolithic Era as Ollie Pope creeps slowly towards a maiden Test ton. 11th over: Australia 60-1 (Finch 20, Smith 17) Target 341. Jadeja is on with his tweakers and darts, four singles exchanged down the ground as they start again against the first of what will almost certainly be 20 overs of slow bowling. Finch keeps the strike. Good batting to begin this second phase of the chase. 10th over: Australia 55-1 (Finch 17, Smith 15) Target 341. That\u2019s better from Smith, playing one of his best strokes - the clip through midwicket - out to the rope early in the new Saini over. Building on that confidence, he busts out one of his T20 shots, flicking from outside the off-stump through the air on the legside, beating the fielder for back to back boundaries. With that, Australia move beyond 50. And he keeps going too, Smith now driving with authority after opening up his stance, beating mid-off for his third four in the set - their best so far in this chase. The required rate is 7.15 as the field spreads and the spinners are introduced. 9th over: Australia 43-1 (Finch 17, Smith 3) Target 341. After four overs going for just one scoring shot, Shami is swung around to follow the mighty Bumrah. Finch doesn\u2019t mind that, immediately getting on the back foot to carve down hard on some width, through the gap and backward point for four. Shami is back on the pegs right away but Finch tries to play the same shot and is fortunate not to inside edge back towards his timber. The better strategy for the captain is to get inside the line, which he does to the next delivery, hammering it for four behind square on the pull. It\u2019s taken him a while, but he\u2019s slowly getting into his groove now. With one ball at Smith, he\u2019s short at him again with leg-gully in place. Tasty. 8th over: Australia 33-1 (Finch 8, Smith 3) Target 341. Ooh! Navdeep Saini is on for his first twist and he nearly gets Smith to chop on! The second-gamer also wins a play and miss from Finch. He has good wheels and an accurate radar - nice start. 7th over: Australia 30-1 (Finch 6, Smith 2) Target 341. Bumrah again, sensing that the window is open for them to strike a second time in this all-important power play as the sun sets behind the grandstands. That\u2019s not to be but he does bank back to back maidens, keeping Smith in defence throughout, with the exception of another bouncer hurrying him up. He\u2019s wise not to take a pop at it. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Smith deals with this new challenge with every team now trying to blast him out with bumpers each time he walks out to bat. 6th over: Australia 30-1 (Finch 6, Smith 2) Target 341. Big shout turned down off Shami for leg before - perhaps caught behind. Either way, he\u2019s through Smith for pace with an off-cutter. They were productive earlier in the over, Finch successfully lofting a checked drive over cover for three. Before it\u2019s done, the Indian quick goes short, hitting Smith on the stomach when missing his pull shot. 5th over: Australia 23-1 (Finch 1, Smith 1) Target 341. Another outstanding over from Bumrah to Finch, the man he had so much success against in 2018 and early 2019. He\u2019s all over the Australian captain, finding his inside edge when bringing it back, keeping him quiet when shaping away. He\u2019s faced 15 balls for his single run. Meanwhile, a huge result in the opening game of the Under 19s World Cup, Afghanistan thrashing South Africa, the hosts. How about those bowling figures! 4th over: Australia 23-1 (Finch 1, Smith 1) Target 341. Shami misses his line to begin at Smith, a bouncer down the legside. He\u2019s short again later in the over, right on the money. Is that an early sign that the bouncer barrage that has followed Smith recently in Test cricket is going to follow him to the white-ball caper? He\u2019s off the mark with a single to long leg from the penultimate delivery of this successful over, Finch then doing likewise from the final ball, out to midwicket. Super catch! Warner tried to slash Shami through the off-side but Pandey, on the edge of the circle at cover, stuck one hand up and it stuck. Brilliant fielding! 3rd over: Australia 16-0 (Warner 11, Finch 0) Target 341. An early and rare gift from Bumrah, spraying a full ball down the legside beyond the diving glove of Rahul, five wides the result. Of course, the superstar is back on his shoebox line and length before long, beating Finch with a beauty. Oooh, and he does it again to finish the over too. Finch yet to score from eight deliveries. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 10, Finch 0) Target 341. Shami gets the new ball from the other end and is taken around the corner by Warner for a couple. He overcorrects next up, giving the opener a half-volley, timed beautifully through cover for four. \u201cHardly any flourish,\u201d says Harsha. He tries to go again later in the over beyond midwicket but doesn\u2019t much of it, still trickling away for three. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Finch 0) Target 341. Forward in defence to begin from Warner before slashing at a delivery well outside the off-stump that jagged and bounced off the seam to beat the edge. He\u2019s off the mark with a tuck behind square. Finch is also beaten to finish this very tidy over, missing an off-drive. \u201cI loved the Greg Rowell interview,\u201d writes Nick Toovey. \u201cI hope it goes down well with the man himself, as the end of the career left a bitter taste. Feels there was something a bit fishy with his action, sure, but before the days of proper testing it\u2019s impossible to know. Hope he doesn\u2019t growl or grumble about his treatment.\u201d He was very good discussing the end of his career. Yes, a senior cap never came but the memories of that summer, at least in some part, gave him a special moment. A lot of excellent players from his generation never had that. The players are back on the field. The hosts, as Harsha Bhogle notes, only have five front-line bowlers. Can they find a way to break up this outstanding Australian partnership before they get busy? David Warner is going to take the first delivery of the chase, to be sent down by Jasprit Bumrah. They require 341. PLAY! Before we return, if you\u2019re into the history Australian one-day cricket, you\u2019re probably an expert on what happened 25 years ago when Australia \u2018A\u2019 joined the World Series Cup. In turn, you\u2019ll certainly enjoy this chat we had with Greg Rowell, the fast bowler who so nearly denied the senior side in that famoust first final. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any English,\u201d says Harbhajan Singh on the Star coverage, \u201cuntil I played against these guys\u201d he says pointing to Matthew Hayden. Banter! \u201cGood afternoon, Adam.\u201d Hello, Krishnamoorthy. \u201cAfter accounting for the usual 35 runs from Bumrah\u2019s 10 overs, Australia needs to score 306 runs from 40 overs. Tough indeed. Some Finch hitting maybe? Or a Warner innings? Anything to take that smirk off Kohli\u2019s face. Your obsession with the Indian captain fascinates me! But to the game: is there any situation not suited to Warner right now? So, forget about Bumrah\u2019s frugality, he needs to get his name into the book early on. If you want to keep an eye on the Test Match, join Rob Smyth in a second tab. Thank you, JP. Any relation to Albie Howcroft, I wonder? We\u2019ll have to find out when we next hear from him on Sunday. Might it be that you\u2019re tuning in here after seeing Ben Stokes just get out, keen to see how they got on in the PJs? If so, welcome to Rajkot, where India have timed their run well after being sent in. Can they bounce back with the ball as well after the lashing they copped on Tuesday in Mumbai? Let\u2019s find out. Keep me company as we work through the chase. A well-constructed 340 then for India, which feels just on the positive side of par on a tremendous batting pitch in the middle of a ground with a lightning outfield. Three of the top five reached 78 but none went on to make a century, but the spread of runs ensured constant momentum for India throughout. Dhawan shone at the top, KL Rahul at the close, with Kohli knitting it all together and providing the impetus that was missing in Mumbai. The ball did nothing in the air or off the seam for Australia on a flat pitch of true bounce. All of which makes Zampa\u2019s figures of 3/50 quite exceptional. Finch captained boldly, searching for wickets throughout, but only once did Australia look to be gaining a foothold in the contest and that was quickly ended by KL Rahul. After Tuesday\u2019s display from Finch and Warner Australia will be undaunted by the chase. To find out if they can rewrite more records stick around for more of this but with Adam Collins on the keys. 50th over: India 340-6 (Jadeja 20, Shami 1) Shami only just avoids a golden duck when Starc executes a perfect yorker before Jadeja hits the in-field and jogs a single. Excellent final over for Australia. Starc ends with 0/78 from his 10. That must be up there with his very worst returns. Starc with the final over of the innings. One. One. Bye. Run out. Starc has been tough to get away in his final over and after beating the bat twice in succession, India\u2019s risky singles to the keeper final prove KL Rahul\u2019s undoing. He goes for a scintillating 80 from 52 balls. 49th over: India 335-5 (KL Rahul 79, Jadeja 18) Cummins is back for one final over, and it\u2019s a decent effort, quick, full of variety, and yet he still manages to concede six over third man from a KL Rahul thick edge then four more when the Indian star turns his attention to fine leg. India\u2019s No 5 has really given this innings the impetus it demanded after that strong start, but it was no given considering Australia\u2019s burst of wickets just before the final assault. 0/53 from Cummins\u2019s 10 overs. 48th over: India 321-5 (KL Rahul 66, Jadeja 17) Glorious square drive from KL Rahul to greet the start of Starc\u2019s penultimate over. That shot brings up 1,000 ODI runs for the versatile batsman-keeper. No more boundaries from the remainder of the over, but Starc is staring down historically bad figures for his extraordinary career. 47th over: India 310-5 (KL Rahul 60, Jadeja 13) Richardson with his final over of an up and down afternoon and it passes by without a boundary. He started poorly, he\u2019s conceded plenty, but Richardson finished strongly and collected a couple of wickets for his troubles. 10 overs 2/73 from Australia\u2019s third seamer. 46th over: India 302-5 (KL Rahul 58, Jadeja 7) Mitchell Starc returns to see out the innings from his end. He\u2019s too quick for Jadeja and catches his gloves with a well directed lifter but KL Rahul is much more on song and he\u2019s quickly onto a low full toss, slicing it over cover for four. If you liked that, you\u2019ll love what he did next, stepping onto his front foot and dismissing a 140kph Starc length deliver over extra cover for six! What a hit! 300 up for India and the crowd in Rajkot is ecstatic. 45th over: India 287-5 (KL Rahul 46, Jadeja 5) Richardson loses his line and Jadeja glances fine for four, but it\u2019s otherwise a good death over for the South Australian. Another first ball of the over wicket for Australia and for the second match in a row India are losing wickets when they should be accelerating. Pandey made only two before mistiming a Richardson slower ball to Agar at deepish midwicket. 44th over: India 280-4 (KL Rahul 44, Pandey 2) Zampa finishes with 3-50 on a road against Rohit, Dhawan and Kohli all with their eyes in. Superb performance. India really should have been on for 350 today but Zampa has been a major factor why they\u2019re likely to come up short. Zampa gets Kohli again! This time in unconventional circumstances. Kohli tries to put the first ball of the leggie\u2019s final over into the sight-screen but Agar intercepts it on the boundary, offloading it Starc before he overbalanced into the rope. Superb skill but one we now take for granted we see it so often. No Kohli for the onslaught. How much will that damage India\u2019s total? 43rd over: India 277-3 (Kohli 78, KL Rahul 42) Good over from Richardson, lots of variation and off-paced deliveries. India throw the kitchen sink at plenty but but can\u2019t find much timing. Michael Slater has made an excellent point on TV about Kohli running along the danger area of the pitch, without the transgression being picked up by the umpires. He\u2019s done it on a number of occasions now. 42nd over: India 270-3 (Kohli 76, KL Rahul 38) KL Rahul has come to play tonight, he\u2019s been busy alongside Kohli and now he\u2019s putting the foot down, lofting Agar into the sight-screen for six. Very few dot balls on offer any more with plenty of hard running. Abhijato Sensarma has emailed in: \u201cKohli is set. The death overs are approaching. There is plenty of batting left in the bank to give him the license to go for the kill. His average has been crossed too. Unless something anomalous happens, the greatest ODI batsman of all time is going to compile an incredible total by the time this innings comes to a close.\u201d 41st over: India 257-3 (Kohli 73, KL Rahul 28) Zampa returns for his ninth over and three good deliveries are undone by a fourth (that isn\u2019t a bad ball) but Kohli somehow sweeps a delivery on off stump through mid-on, between two boundary riders in the cow corner region. Remarkable. India still yet to tee-off, but they\u2019re on course for a handy total. 40th over: India 249-3 (Kohli 67, KL Rahul 26) Richardson returns and an over of dabbed singles looks to be another decent over for Australia, until - yet again - the final ball of the over goes for four, this time KL Rahul with the short-arm jab. Earlier, there was a sniff of a run out chance butchered by Steve Smith. 39th over: India 241-3 (Kohli 65, KL Rahul 20) Australia were just starting to wrest a bit of control and rattle India a touch, but a loose delivery from Agar carved behind point for four by KL Rahul nipped that in the bud. It\u2019s new bat time out in the middle with the heavy artillery brought out for the final slog. 38th over: India 234-3 (Kohli 64, KL Rahul 14) Cummins gets another over. Finch must be banking on a Kohli or bust strategy because some of these death overs are going to be delivered by bowlers who would not like to be sending them down. The strategy almost pays off when the first delivery of the day misbehaves and shoots shin height off a length past the Indian skipper\u2019s off stump. 37th over: India 231-3 (Kohli 63, KL Rahul 12) Finch crosses his fingers and throws the ball to Agar again. The damage is acceptable, four singles a dot and a two. What has Kohli got up his sleeve for the sprint home? 36th over: India 225-3 (Kohli 59, KL Rahul 10) Finch goes back to Cummins (who is going to bowl the death overs!?) and Kohli welcomes Australia\u2019s star man to the crease with back-to-back fours of majestic skill. Both deliveries landed in the same spot, the first was whipped with an orchestra conductor\u2019s flick to square leg, the second guided effortlessly through the covers. \u201cKoh-li, Koh-li, Koh-li\u201d booms the crowd. Marvellous cricket. 35th over: India 216-3 (Kohli 50, KL Rahul 10) Zampa has grown into this innings, bowling uncomplicatedly full and straight. He and Cummins are the only Australians with creditable economy rates today. 34th over: India 211-3 (Kohli 47, KL Rahul 8) Finch retains Starc in the attack, but it might be a bit of a waste to the new batsman with so many overs left to be bowled by the spinners. KL Rahul reinforces that opinion with a textbook cover drive for four, then Kohli rubber stamps it, cutting well in front of square (is that even a thing? It was a cut-style shot, but played so early with arms in front of body) for four more. 33rd over: India 199-3 (Kohli 42, KL Rahul 1) Zampa has not been flash today. There\u2019s nothing out there for him, but he has two wickets courtesy of persevering on a stump-to-stump line and waiting for the mistake. Meanwhile, over in South Africa, Ben Stokes is doing Ben Stokes things again. Zampa gets a third spell, but his first without Dhawan out in the middle. Kohli gets off strike first ball, then Zampa dots up Shreyas two deliveries in a row before the batsman tries to use his feet and attack through the on-side but succeeds only in yorking himself and being castled. An unconvincing 17-ball seven. 32nd over: India 197-2 (Kohli 41, Shreyas 7) Pace from both ends now as Finch senses he might be able to blast Shreyas out. Starc first has to navigate Kohli, who controls strike for the first half of the over. When he gets his shot at the new man his line and length are awry and there\u2019s no damage done. Interestingly, the TV coverage has pointed out how deep Shreyas gets in his crease with his exaggerated trigger back and across. It\u2019s a very bold movement, that\u2019s for sure, a bit Gary Ballance if you ask me, and one I expect is susceptible to some late movement. 31st over: India 194-2 (Kohli 38, Shreyas 7) Australia fancy Sheryas with the short ball but Richardson is popgun on this surface with this ball and India\u2019s No4 pulls him well in front of square for four. It might have been the old fast bowler\u2019s double bluff, but the follow up bumper also wasn\u2019t nasty enough. 30th over: India 187-2 (Kohli 37, Shreyas 1) Zampa\u2019s back into the attack, and he bamboozles Sheryas early and is inches away fro a return catch after inducing a loopy leading edge. 29th over: India 184-2 (Kohli 32, Shreyas 0) Time for Kohli to take over after allowing Dhawan to dominate their partnership. Can he put his foot on the accelerator today unlike India\u2019s middle-order on Tuesday? Finch cannot trust Agar any longer so he returns to Richardson. Dhawan doesn\u2019t care, he just stands and delivers, drilling a six-iron into the sight-screen. Then he\u2019s out! Out of nowhere! A rank delivery from Richardson on the batsman\u2019s hip but all the left-hander can do is shovel it straight to deep backward square leg. A gift for Australia, and Finch\u2019s change works. 28th over: India 177-1 (Dhawan 92, Kohli 32) Labuschagne gets a second over and he\u2019s starting to get a touch of purchase, more than Australia\u2019s other two spinners have managed so far. The doubt he\u2019s put into Dhawan\u2019s mind earns him three dots, but he\u2019s lucky to escape with a single when a hefty swipe goes straight to the boundary rider. But just like the early overs, when Australia look to be building momentum ball six goes for four, this time Dhawan collecting a boundary with a very well executed paddle sweep that leaves short fine-leg no chance of making an interception. 27th over: India 171-1 (Dhawan 87, Kohli 31) Dhawan is opening his shoulders now, skipping down the pitch and swinging Agar in his arc over midwicket for six. That forces a drag down from the bowler which is whipped behind square on the on-side for four. Kohli is just calmly rotating strike, advancing to 31 largely by inviting Dhawan to keep hitting boundaries. India flying. 26th over: India 159-1 (Dhawan 76, Kohli 30) Australia need something out of nothing, so they\u2019ve turned to Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s leg-spin. His first ball doesn\u2019t land in a terrible spot, but there is no turn on offer so his off stump line to Dhawan turns into an easy cut for four. The follow up is fuller and Dhawan fails to time it, almost offering a leaping caught and bowled opportunity that Labuschagne isn\u2019t tall enough to take. 25th over: India 151-1 (Dhawan 70, Kohli 28) Dhawan enlivens a slightly becalmed passage of play by lofting Agar over midwicket for four, and backing it up with a cute reverse sweep. 24th over: India 141-1 (Dhawan 61, Kohli 27) Peculiar over from Starc, full of varying lines, lengths and speeds, nothing much happening for Australia out there right now though. 23rd over: India 136-1 (Dhawan 58, Kohli 26) Humdrum middle-overs fare from Agar. Five singles. No spin. Even bounce. 22nd over: India 131-1 (Dhawan 55, Kohli 26) Mitchell Starc\u2019s return means helmets replace caps. It also means Shikhar Dhawan collects back-to-back 50s with a nudged single. Bat raised, Dhawan raises his bat in anger to Starc but can only get a thick edge to a wild slash, but it\u2019s enough to skim away for four through the vacant cordon. 21st over: India 123-1 (Dhawan 49, Kohli 22) Better from Agar in his second over, especially to Dhawan who is unsure what to do with some well flighted deliveries from around the wicket. Eventually he goes over the top, straight, but for just a single. Kohli is in run-a-ball mode, finding gaps at will. 20th over: India 120-1 (Dhawan 48, Kohli 20) Australia set perfect fields on Tuesday and their attack bowled to them. There\u2019s been much more fiddling around today as India bat with greater fluency. Four singles from a routine middle-overs set of six from Zampa. 19th over: India 116-1 (Dhawan 46, Kohli 18) Spin from both ends with Ashton agar coming into the attack. Between overs Kohli and Dhawan replaced their helmets with caps, both men prowling like tigers eager to get their teeth stuck into the new bowler. And Dhawan doesn\u2019t waste much time, calmly placing a non-spinning delivery from outside off stump through the covers for four. India are on autopilot, and their destination is 300+. 18th over: India 107-1 (Dhawan 40, Kohli 17) Kohli brings up India\u2019s 100 with the latest in a series of controlled drives in the arc between mid-off and cover that earn him one or two every time. The strike rotation eventually gets to Zampa whose excellent control finally lets him down and Kohli doesn\u2019t miss out on a rare long-hop, whipping it to leg for four. 17th over: India 99-1 (Dhawan 38, Kohli 11) Cummins into his seventh over very early in this innings, but he remains wicketless. He does liven Kohli up with a sharp bouncer, but it flies away for four byes, then he has the Indian skipper flirting outside off stump but there aren\u2019t enough fielders in the cordon to make it anything resembling a chance. 16th over: India 93-1 (Dhawan 37, Kohli 10) Kohli has breezed to double figures. When he\u2019s on he just doesn\u2019t allow dot-balls, not even against Zampa. He\u2019s clearly trying to set a much more urgent tone during these middle overs than we saw on Tuesday. 15th over: India 87-1 (Dhawan 35, Kohli 6) The die is cast. Kohli\u2019s arrival means Cummins\u2019s return and the resumption of the line wide outside off stump. It doesn\u2019t work this over though, Kohli imperiously driving for four through extra cover to a delivery that shows how good a track this is to bat on. It was a fraction short of half-volley length but once Kohli had the line he could trust the pitch and hit through it securely. 14th over: India 82-1 (Dhawan 35, Kohli 1) Before he perished, Rohit was Ro-hitting the ball all over Rajkot, swatting Zampa powerfully through the on-side for four, but he picked the wrong bowler to sweep. Zampa is stump-to-stump and he was full enough to not worry about height with his appeal too. Are India going to make the same mistake they made in Mumbai and not convert their starts? Standard leggie from Zampa, it holds its line without turning much, Rohit attempts to sweep but misses, the ball hits the pad and the finger goes up. Rohit is adamant the line was sliding down leg so he makes the T sign but DRS only confirms the bad news. Rohit, in supreme form before that, is gone, and India lose their review in the process. Huge, welcome, and unexpected breakthrough for Australia. Adam Zampa with the golden arm again. And guess who\u2019s out at No 3? His bunny, Virat Kohli. India review! Rohit is given out LBW to Zampa. 13th over: India 76-0 (Rohit 38, Dhawan 34) Richardson continues and Rohit treats him with disdain, stepping down the track and slapping a bouncer off the front foot wide of mid-on for a one-bounce four. That was a very alpha play. India motoring. 12th over: India 68-0 (Rohit 32, Dhawan 33) Adam Zampa gets an early whirl and after a couple of respectful dabs Dhawan drills a missile that knocks the non-striker\u2019s off stump out of the ground. Rohit was fortunate Zampa didn\u2019t get a fingertip onto that because he was out of his ground. Zampa was also probably not to get a fingertip on it because his fingertip might well have lost contact with the rest of his finger; that was firmly hit. Not a great deal to report in terms of spin or drift. 11th over: India 64-0 (Rohit 30, Dhawan 32) Right on cue Rohit tries one of those meaty pulls with fast hands but he doesn\u2019t get all of it and settles for two in front of midwicket. A delicate late cut then rotates the strike. Dhawan peels off his first ramp of the night, that got him into a spot of bother in Mumbai, but this time he glides Richardson safely up and down to third man. No gliding ball six of the over - yet again a boundary to end the over - this time Dhawan tucking into a nothing short ball from Richardson. Time for spin. Big passage of play coming up with Australia lacking control in these early exchanges. 10th over: India 55-0 (Rohit 26, Dhawan 27) Cummins is still going and he makes his mark in his fifth over, getting one to lift on Dhawan, the ball bouncing up into his ribcage, winding the Indian opener who has to have a little lie down and a stretch before he can continue. I\u2019m working through something in my head - is it possible for Rohit to have hands that are both soft and heavy? I hope it\u2019s not a contradiction. He hist shots phenomenally hard without applying a great deal of force. The majority of the time he\u2019s happy to let the ball come to him, and he uses his wrists to great effect too. It\u2019s largely timing, a joy to watch in full flow. 9th over: India 52-0 (Rohit 25, Dhawan 26) Om-i-nous. Rohit ticks India beyond 50 with a nudged single and a back-foot drive that could not have been timed more sweetly. 8th over: India 46-0 (Rohit 19, Dhawan 25) Change of ends for Cummins and he extracts a genuine edge from Dhawan but the two slips he opened with are long gone and the batsman continues on his merry way. That way includes another boundary from the final ball of an otherwise decent Australian over but Cummins lost his line and the batsman was onto it in a flash, whipping four runs behind square leg. 7th over: India 39-0 (Rohit 18, Dhawan 20) Kane Richardson replaces Pat Cummins and a decent over is ruined when he slips onto Rohit\u2019s pads and that sledgehammer of a bat comes down and sends the ball scudding to the square leg boundary with nary a tickle. Looks like we\u2019re in for a couple of big old scores today at this rate. I wonder if Australia\u2019s spinners can dig in when they get a chance? 6th over: India 32-0 (Rohit 13, Dhawan 18) Rohit\u2019s arrived. Becalmed for five overs he finds the boundary in magnificent fashion, holding his pose after caressing a textbook cover driven boundary from a Starc half volley. He picks up two more with a cut that is almost caught brilliantly at backward point by Steve Smith but his full-length dive could only parry the shot with his right hand low to his right. Smith is good enough to take those, but it\u2019s only a half-chance really. Rohit hoicks another two to finish a productive over for India. 5th over: India 23-0 (Rohit 5, Dhawan 18) Cummins has dragged his length bat a fraction and it causes both batsmen issues. First Rohit plays over a pull shot then Dhawan is beaten for pace trying to cut before risking a chop on with another cut attempted close to his body. Cummins follows that up with the first genuine jaffa of the day, pushing the ball back up to that good length, finding a touch of movement away from the left-hander and beating the outside edge. 4th over: India 20-0 (Rohit 4, Dhawan 16) Starc has yet to settle into a groove and this pitch is much easier to hit through the line than that at the Wankhede meaning the margin for error is much smaller. Dhawan increases his score by six, two cut through point and four flicked down to fine-leg so firmly it practically took the diving Adam Zampa over the rope with it. 3rd over: India 14-0 (Rohit 4, Dhawan 10) A single from the final ball of Starc\u2019s over means Cummins gets a go at Dhawan after his maiden to Rohit. He doesn\u2019t find the same line and length to the left-hander though and his second delivery is slapped to the cover boundary on the up after offering enough width for the batsman to free his hands. The left-right combination then does for Cummins\u2019s radar after the strike is rotated with Rohit helping a leaky leg-side delivery to the midwicket fence. 2nd over: India 5-0 (Rohit 0, Dhawan 5) Mitchell Starc has a brand new ball of his own to bowl with, but his first delivery is too full and straight allowing Dhawan to check drive with an economy of movement that is four runs from the second it leaves the bat. There\u2019s little else to report besides a play and a miss well outside off stump to a delivery that was asking to be spanked. No obvious swing or seam either from Starc. Meanwhile, Michael Slater has just made a dreadful kookaburra impression on commentary. 1st over: India 0-0 (Rohit 0, Dhawan 0) Would you expect any less? Cummins is on the spot from the get-go and Rohit responds with a respectfully straight bat. A Test-like maiden to start us off. Nothing to report in the air or off the pitch. This looks to be a very true surface. Pat Cummins is going to take the first over the match, Rohit Sharma on strike, here we go! The players are on their way out into the middle, we\u2019ll be underway shortly. The pitch promises to be flat and hard and full of runs. Things are looking good for Australia, very good indeed, as Sam Perry writes in The Guardian Australia\u2019s weekly cricket column. For the men\u2019s team, the shoots could scarcely be more green: undefeated this summer, a generational No 3 unearthed and an arguably unrivalled bowling attack. It has been 15 years since Australia could lay claim to consistent cricketing dominance, and for the first time since then, they appear to be giving themselves a decent shot at it. Then again, as has been pointed out, the supposed Battle of the Titans could also be understood as a belated World Cup third-place play-off. There\u2019s probably a while to go yet. The weather is mild in Gujarat, in India\u2019s north west today. Temperatures will be in the low 20sC during the match , accompanied by bright sunshine and a gentle northerly breeze. In case you missed any of the action from the first ODI, here\u2019s the match report from Mumbai. Two changes for India, one of them forced, with Rishabh Pant suffering a concussion during the first ODI when he was struck on the helmet by a Cummins bouncer. KL Rahul will deputise behind the stumps with batsman Manish Pandey slotting into the middle order. Elsewhere, paceman Navdeep Saini comes in for just his second ODI, in place of Shardul Thakur. India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), KL Rahul (wk), Shereyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah The visitors are unchanged, unsurprisingly. Although Josh Hazlewood must be a tad disappointed at not being rotated into the XI. Australia: David Warner, Aaron Finch (c), Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Ashton Turner, Alex Carey (wk), Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa Aaron Finch has done it again, he\u2019s called correctly and invited India to have a bat. Let\u2019s see if we get the same result as Tuesday... How about a really tortured musical segue to kick us off? Ok, ok, well, David Warner\u2019s ton in Mumbai was his 18th in ODIs. He\u2019s only two away from becoming a 20th Century boy. I\u2019ll get my coat. And my feather boa. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the second ODI between India and Australia in Rajkot. The action gets underway at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium at 7pm AEST. In recent times it\u2019s been rare to find the mighty Indian cricket leviathan under the pump but a 10-wicket ODI defeat on home soil with a near-fully fit squad (one skippered by no less than Virat Kohli) will have that effect. Not only that, but Tuesday\u2019s mauling in Mumbai was India\u2019s fourth consecutive home defeat to Australia. A reaction can be expected in Rajkot. Kohli lamented after the defeat earlier this week that his side failed to bat with enough purpose during a first innings that was allowed to meander during the middle overs like the bad old days of one-day cricket. Surely he will restore himself to first drop and ensure that doesn\u2019t happen again tonight. It\u2019s not all about Kohli though. Australia have acclimatised quickly to Indian conditions and boast a well balanced side in excellent form. The pair of opening centurions meant the likes of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were not required to bat, while the bowling attack covered all bases, highlighted by Pat Cummins\u2019s discipline, Adam Zampa\u2019s bravery and Mitchell Starc\u2019s unerring wicket-taking yorkers. Another fascinating duel lies in store. And you can join in the fun throughout the night via email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com or Twitter: @JPHowcroft.",

The author was not out as trans when the story was published, but felt pressured into publicly outing herself, as a defence against the attacks. Clarke said: \u201cThat should never be the case and is very disturbing to me.\u201d The editor apologised \u201cto those who were hurt by the story or the ensuing storms\u201d, adding that he had learned that even with sensitivity reading, it is \u201cstill possible to miss something\u201d. \u201cIn this case we can see two groups of trans readers with directly opposing views that are deeply rooted in their own experience and perspectives. In some cases, what made the story speak to some is also what alienated others. Neither perspective is wrong, but they appear to be incompatible with one another on some level. Knowing that this was a potentially controversial story, we should have employed a broader range of sensitivity readers,\u201d said Clarke. He said he had also privately apologised to Fall, who is donating her payment for the story to the trans charity Trans Lifeline. \u201cInspired by her actions, I have decided to match the gift,\u201d said Clarke.",

The almost identical blonde, blow-dried hairstyles, worn with short sheath dresses and stilettos by the channel\u2019s female anchors are also a key feature of Bombshell, Jay Roach\u2019s biographical film, which opened in UK cinemas on Friday.</p> <p>The film centres on accusations of sexual harassment levelled at the former chief executive Roger Ailes by Fox News employees, while also depicting a toxic workplace culture imbued with sexism and secrecy.</p> <p>Meanwhile the film\u2019s wardrobe plays a crucial role in conveying its themes, with Bombshell\u2019s costume designer, Colleen Atwood, having watched \u201ctons of news footage\u201d to ensure accuracy. This is a world where women bow to the male gaze.</p> <p>Atwood\u2019s recreation of the channel\u2019s wardrobe reveals an array of similarly shaped dresses, push-up bras, control pants and heels.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not often a TV channel can be credited with creating its own fashion \u201clook\u201d but, in the case of Fox News, fashion and style have become central to the broadcaster\u2019s brand. The almost identical blonde, blow-dried hairstyles, worn with short sheath dresses and stilettos by the channel\u2019s female anchors are also a key feature of Bombshell, Jay Roach\u2019s biographical film, which opened in UK cinemas on Friday. The film centres on accusations of sexual harassment levelled at the former chief executive Roger Ailes by Fox News employees, while also depicting a toxic workplace culture imbued with sexism and secrecy. Meanwhile the film\u2019s wardrobe plays a crucial role in conveying its themes, with Bombshell\u2019s costume designer, Colleen Atwood, having watched \u201ctons of news footage\u201d to ensure accuracy. This is a world where women bow to the male gaze. Atwood\u2019s recreation of the channel\u2019s wardrobe reveals an array of similarly shaped dresses, push-up bras, control pants and heels. Charlize Theron, playing the anchor Megyn Kelly, is confined to tailored dresses and heavy makeup for her scenes at the studio, in stark contrast to her out-of-office looks. According to Juliet Huddy, an anchor who has worked on shows including Fox and Friends and the Morning Show, the film\u2019s fashion is \u201cspot on\u201d. \u201cThey absolutely got our appearances down perfectly, from the lip gloss to the clothing,\u201d Huddy says. \u201cThe executives \u2026 understood the simple fact that TV is a visual medium, and the [viewer] demographic was overwhelmingly male.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS</strong></h2> <p>After the best part of a decade at Manchester United, it\u2019s arrivederci to Ashley Young, who has departed for pastures new. Specifically, the verdant grass rectangle at San Siro, where he will line up for Internazionale.

      "body": "<p>Families of the victims of the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry have reacted with fury that the trial of an ex-paratrooper accused of murdering two men in the atrocity may be moved to Belfast.</p> <p>A judge suggested on Friday that due to \u201csecurity concerns\u201d the first hearing in a case against a soldier alleged to have killed Bloody Sunday victims should be relocated to Belfast.</p> <p>Thirteen unarmed civilians were shot dead during a civil rights/anti-internment march in Derry 48 years ago this month.</p> <p>A former member of the Parachute Regiment known as Soldier F stands accused of murdering James Wray and William McKinney when troops opened fire on the demonstration in the city\u2019s Bogside area in 1972.</p> <p>At a pre-trial hearing at Derry magistrates court on Friday, the district judge, Barney McElholm, said: \u201cWe cannot convene this in just some hall or public space. There are considerations of security. We are willing to listen to any reasonable opposition put to us.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, despite trying to get somewhere closer to the city, I am afraid Belfast looks like the venue.\u201d</p> <p>Soldier F, who has been granted anonymity, did not appear at Friday\u2019s hearing.</p> <p>John Kelly, whose brother Michael was shot dead on Bloody Sunday, said moving the trial to Belfast was \u201cadding injury\u201d to the feelings of the victims\u2019 families.</p> <p>He said it was an injustice that \u201cthe crimes committed in Derry were not being tried in the city where they took place\u201d.</p> <p>Kelly added: \u201cMany of the families are old people. They are in their late 60s, 70s and 80s and they worry about having to make the long journey every day of the trial itself to Belfast.</p> <p>\u201cThe Court Service could easily accommodate the families at Derry courthouse if they opened another courtroom and beamed in the proceedings through video link. This happened during the Bloody Sunday inquiry when a separate building was opened across the road from the Derry Guildhall housing the tribunal. Every day a live video link was run to cope with the overspill.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, the Bloody Sunday inquiry report found that all of the 13 victims were innocent unarmed civilians. David Cameron, the then prime minister, apologised in the House of Commons to the victims and their families on behalf of the British government.</p> <p>Kelly pointed out that during the inquiry in the mid-2000s, the families of victims had to travel to London more than a dozen times in order to attend hearings involving soldiers and politician, including the prime minister at the time of the massacre, Ted Heath.</p> <p>\u201cToday the families are worried once more that they having to endure more unnecessary pressure and travel to see justice done for their loved ones.</p> <p>\u201cAs for security concerns raised today I would say there is more security problems for the police in Belfast because if the trial was heard there then supporters of Soldier F would feel safe enough to turn up and protest against the trial, and this could lead to counter protests against the Para\u2019s supporters,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Outside the Derry courthouse, Mickey McKinney, whose brother Willie was shot dead allegedly by Soldier F, said: \u201cWhat happened on Bloody Sunday happened here 200 yards from where we now stand and Soldier F should be appearing at this courthouse.\u201d</p>",

A judge suggested on Friday that due to \u201csecurity concerns\u201d the first hearing in a case against a soldier alleged to have killed Bloody Sunday victims should be relocated to Belfast. Thirteen unarmed civilians were shot dead during a civil rights/anti-internment march in Derry 48 years ago this month. A former member of the Parachute Regiment known as Soldier F stands accused of murdering James Wray and William McKinney when troops opened fire on the demonstration in the city\u2019s Bogside area in 1972. At a pre-trial hearing at Derry magistrates court on Friday, the district judge, Barney McElholm, said: \u201cWe cannot convene this in just some hall or public space. There are considerations of security. We are willing to listen to any reasonable opposition put to us. \u201cAt the moment, despite trying to get somewhere closer to the city, I am afraid Belfast looks like the venue.\u201d Soldier F, who has been granted anonymity, did not appear at Friday\u2019s hearing. John Kelly, whose brother Michael was shot dead on Bloody Sunday, said moving the trial to Belfast was \u201cadding injury\u201d to the feelings of the victims\u2019 families. He said it was an injustice that \u201cthe crimes committed in Derry were not being tried in the city where they took place\u201d. Kelly added: \u201cMany of the families are old people. They are in their late 60s, 70s and 80s and they worry about having to make the long journey every day of the trial itself to Belfast. \u201cThe Court Service could easily accommodate the families at Derry courthouse if they opened another courtroom and beamed in the proceedings through video link. This happened during the Bloody Sunday inquiry when a separate building was opened across the road from the Derry Guildhall housing the tribunal. Every day a live video link was run to cope with the overspill.\u201d In 2010, the Bloody Sunday inquiry report found that all of the 13 victims were innocent unarmed civilians. David Cameron, the then prime minister, apologised in the House of Commons to the victims and their families on behalf of the British government. Kelly pointed out that during the inquiry in the mid-2000s, the families of victims had to travel to London more than a dozen times in order to attend hearings involving soldiers and politician, including the prime minister at the time of the massacre, Ted Heath. \u201cToday the families are worried once more that they having to endure more unnecessary pressure and travel to see justice done for their loved ones. \u201cAs for security concerns raised today I would say there is more security problems for the police in Belfast because if the trial was heard there then supporters of Soldier F would feel safe enough to turn up and protest against the trial, and this could lead to counter protests against the Para\u2019s supporters,\u201d he added. Outside the Derry courthouse, Mickey McKinney, whose brother Willie was shot dead allegedly by Soldier F, said: \u201cWhat happened on Bloody Sunday happened here 200 yards from where we now stand and Soldier F should be appearing at this courthouse.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I am going to talk to Wendy Wood about my bad habits. Professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, Wood researches how habits guide behaviour and has written a new book about it: Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes That Stick. Not market-driven self-help, it is based on research, data, actual science. I hope she will help me to understand my bad habits, change them, and maybe even pick up a few good ones.</p> <p>What are my unwanted habits, though, since I quit smoking? I should probably look at Twitter a little less, but that\u2019s everyone, right? Or Facebook, Instagram; whatever it is you look at your phone for. There is a chapter at the end of Wood\u2019s book, How to Stop Looking at Your Phone So Often. You have to start off by noticing you are doing it, then use some of the tools you have hopefully picked up in the preceding pages, such as controlling the cues to the behaviour, adding friction ... we will get to some of that.</p> <p>I bite my nails, habitually. It is gross, I know. But apart from that, I am struggling to think of anything. I will just confirm that I am otherwise perfect, with my girlfriend \u2026</p> <p>Ah, so it seems there are a couple more \u2013 quite a long list, actually. I won\u2019t bore you with the details (most of it isn\u2019t even true). Top of her list, though, is something I do recognise: I suck air in through my teeth sporadically when I\u2019m talking, especially if I\u2019m concentrating. It makes a noise. And sometimes I do something with my face at the same time, kind of screw it up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a10a6bcfd406270765770a5bd753e5ff444b62e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a10a6bcfd406270765770a5bd753e5ff444b62e8/1613_143_1804_2255/800.jpg\" alt=\"I suck air in through my teeth when I\u2019m concentrating \u2026 Wollaston at work.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I suck air in through my teeth when I\u2019m concentrating \u2026 Wollaston at work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know, to be honest, it kind of sounds charming,\u201d says Wood, down the line from Baja California in Mexico, where she is on holiday. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you would want to change that, but I suppose if it bothers your family then that would be something to work on.\u201d</p> <p>You know what, no, I\u2019m going to leave it. Being bothered by it is the only problem here. A leading expert on habits says that this one sounds charming, and I\u2019m taking that. Next!</p> <p>Wood asks which of my bad habits I would most like to change. Change is challenging and motivation will add to the chance of success. Let\u2019s tackle the nailbiting, then, because I admit to it and it is disgusting.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you about the origins of your nailbiting except that most people develop the habit when they are anxious and it distracts them,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a little bit of pain and it makes you focus away from the anxiety, it is rewarding. So the next time you feel anxious, you go back to biting your nails.\u201d</p> <p>That figures. She asks me about the cues that activate the behaviour. Are there particular times and places it happens? Is it anxiety from work, sitting at the desk, trying to write and generate stuff? I think so, yeah, my high-pressure media job, calling up eminent scientists during their Mexican holidays.</p> <p>She explains that habit memories change only slowly, if at all; that habits keep being triggered by the circumstances around you; and that your habit automatically comes to mind before you have a chance to do something else. \u201cAll of this makes our habits resistant to change.\u201d Oh dear, no quick fix, it seems. But the way forward can be pared down into three parts.</p> <h2><strong>1 Add friction to the habit so that it is not easy to perform</strong></h2> <p>So I could wear gloves at times of high-nailbiting likelihood. Or coat them with that foul-tasting stuff they used to \u2013 and may still \u2013 give to kids. \u201cAnother possibility is to sit on your hands,\u201d suggests Woods. Might make writing tricky.</p> <p>\u201cWhat women do, and there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t consider this, is get a nice manicure,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes it more difficult for you to bite your nails because it is really obvious, plus you\u2019ll have just spent a lot of money.\u201d I could get extensions, she suggests. They wouldn\u2019t have to be long, if I didn\u2019t fancy going the full Selena Gomez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1ccbe46589601be0110ced0197373eb3e29575c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ccbe46589601be0110ced0197373eb3e29575c/0_306_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I will get a dog and go running regularly with it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I will get a dog and go running regularly with it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Paget/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2 Change the cues that activate the habit, so </strong><strong>it doesn\u2019t come to mind</strong></h2> <p>If it is my work environment that is triggering the behaviour, could I change that? \u201cMaybe getting a standing desk would make it less likely that you bite your nails,\u201d she says. She tells me about a colleague of hers who got a treadmill desk, after which he was surprisingly productive. A treadmill desk! I like it, and that might even encourage one of my other good-habit targets; to do a bit of exercise.</p> <h2><strong>3 Develop a conflicting habit that you practise until it becomes what automatically springs to mind</strong></h2> <p>Something to do with my hands, instead of chewing them. Are fidget-spinners still a thing? A stress ball, perhaps, or an executive toy. I will think about it. \u201cThe thing to bear in mind is that willpower is going to get you started, but there is good research that it doesn\u2019t stick around long enough for us to be successful when we are trying to change a strong habit.\u201d Think about that diet that went the way of the one before. Or the gym membership that didn\u2019t become a habit. We need the situation to help as well.</p> <p>What about the positive changes, then? How am I going to turn my occasional, reluctant run into a habit? It is something Wood did. It wasn\u2019t easy, getting up early \u2013 that was the only time to fit the run in. But she liked feeling fit and it helped her to control her weight. Goals and rewards help in starting to do something. It took time, too. She says she struggled for about a year with that one. A year!</p> <p>Again, the suggestion is to use the environment to make the challenge easier. \u201cI started sleeping in my running clothes and I would put my running shoes by the door,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I had a dog at the time, whom I started running with. She loved it; she would come and wake me up.\u201d</p> <p>Great. I\u2019m desperate for a dog and if it can help develop good-habit formation, that\u2019s an added bonus. It might be tricky to get past the rest of my family, who want a cat. I\u2019m not sure how sleeping in my running gear is going to go down either.</p> <p>Talking to Wood is making me think about my relationship. There is a bit in her book where she talks about what she calls \u201chabituation\u201d in long-term relationships, whereby partners repeatedly do the same things together, settling into each other\u2019s presence \u2013 and it is striking a chord. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt means you are dependent on each other. But it can also get to a point where you are not feeling a whole lot in a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>How do I change that? \u201cDo something new together, that creates new patterns and allows you to experience your partner in new ways. It could be as simple as cooking classes.\u201d Yes, we like to cook; stick a dim-sum course on the list.</p> <p>And that is probably enough for now, for 2020. It\u2019s going to take time to form new habits. It\u2019s true, old habits do indeed die hard. But I have a better understanding of how it works and some new tools. I\u2019m going to create new patterns \u2013 and pork dumplings \u2013 with my partner, and this will enable us to experience each other in new and emotional ways.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to spice things up further by sleeping in my tracksuit. We will have a dog, too, not just for Christmas, and it will run with me every morning and that will feel \u2013 eventually \u2013 not like a chore but normal and good.</p> <p>I\u2019ll also run on a treadmill as I work. And I\u2019m booking myself into a nail bar for a set of top-of-the-range acrylic extensions. But I will continue to suck air through my teeth. And to gurn, charmingly.</p> <p><em>Good </em><em>Habits, Bad Habits by Wendy Wood is published by Pan Macmillan.

I bite my nails, habitually. It is gross, I know. But apart from that, I am struggling to think of anything. I will just confirm that I am otherwise perfect, with my girlfriend \u2026 Ah, so it seems there are a couple more \u2013 quite a long list, actually. I won\u2019t bore you with the details (most of it isn\u2019t even true). Top of her list, though, is something I do recognise: I suck air in through my teeth sporadically when I\u2019m talking, especially if I\u2019m concentrating. It makes a noise. And sometimes I do something with my face at the same time, kind of screw it up. \u201cYou know, to be honest, it kind of sounds charming,\u201d says Wood, down the line from Baja California in Mexico, where she is on holiday. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you would want to change that, but I suppose if it bothers your family then that would be something to work on.\u201d You know what, no, I\u2019m going to leave it. Being bothered by it is the only problem here. A leading expert on habits says that this one sounds charming, and I\u2019m taking that. Next! Wood asks which of my bad habits I would most like to change. Change is challenging and motivation will add to the chance of success. Let\u2019s tackle the nailbiting, then, because I admit to it and it is disgusting. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you about the origins of your nailbiting except that most people develop the habit when they are anxious and it distracts them,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a little bit of pain and it makes you focus away from the anxiety, it is rewarding. So the next time you feel anxious, you go back to biting your nails.\u201d That figures. She asks me about the cues that activate the behaviour. Are there particular times and places it happens? Is it anxiety from work, sitting at the desk, trying to write and generate stuff? I think so, yeah, my high-pressure media job, calling up eminent scientists during their Mexican holidays. She explains that habit memories change only slowly, if at all; that habits keep being triggered by the circumstances around you; and that your habit automatically comes to mind before you have a chance to do something else. \u201cAll of this makes our habits resistant to change.\u201d Oh dear, no quick fix, it seems. But the way forward can be pared down into three parts. 1 Add friction to the habit so that it is not easy to perform So I could wear gloves at times of high-nailbiting likelihood. Or coat them with that foul-tasting stuff they used to \u2013 and may still \u2013 give to kids. \u201cAnother possibility is to sit on your hands,\u201d suggests Woods. Might make writing tricky. \u201cWhat women do, and there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t consider this, is get a nice manicure,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes it more difficult for you to bite your nails because it is really obvious, plus you\u2019ll have just spent a lot of money.\u201d I could get extensions, she suggests. They wouldn\u2019t have to be long, if I didn\u2019t fancy going the full Selena Gomez. 2 Change the cues that activate the habit, so it doesn\u2019t come to mind If it is my work environment that is triggering the behaviour, could I change that? \u201cMaybe getting a standing desk would make it less likely that you bite your nails,\u201d she says. She tells me about a colleague of hers who got a treadmill desk, after which he was surprisingly productive. A treadmill desk! I like it, and that might even encourage one of my other good-habit targets; to do a bit of exercise. 3 Develop a conflicting habit that you practise until it becomes what automatically springs to mind Something to do with my hands, instead of chewing them. Are fidget-spinners still a thing? A stress ball, perhaps, or an executive toy. I will think about it. \u201cThe thing to bear in mind is that willpower is going to get you started, but there is good research that it doesn\u2019t stick around long enough for us to be successful when we are trying to change a strong habit.\u201d Think about that diet that went the way of the one before. Or the gym membership that didn\u2019t become a habit. We need the situation to help as well. What about the positive changes, then? How am I going to turn my occasional, reluctant run into a habit? It is something Wood did. It wasn\u2019t easy, getting up early \u2013 that was the only time to fit the run in. But she liked feeling fit and it helped her to control her weight. Goals and rewards help in starting to do something. It took time, too. She says she struggled for about a year with that one. A year! Again, the suggestion is to use the environment to make the challenge easier. \u201cI started sleeping in my running clothes and I would put my running shoes by the door,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I had a dog at the time, whom I started running with. She loved it; she would come and wake me up.\u201d Great. I\u2019m desperate for a dog and if it can help develop good-habit formation, that\u2019s an added bonus. It might be tricky to get past the rest of my family, who want a cat. I\u2019m not sure how sleeping in my running gear is going to go down either. Talking to Wood is making me think about my relationship. There is a bit in her book where she talks about what she calls \u201chabituation\u201d in long-term relationships, whereby partners repeatedly do the same things together, settling into each other\u2019s presence \u2013 and it is striking a chord. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt means you are dependent on each other. But it can also get to a point where you are not feeling a whole lot in a relationship.\u201d How do I change that? \u201cDo something new together, that creates new patterns and allows you to experience your partner in new ways. It could be as simple as cooking classes.\u201d Yes, we like to cook; stick a dim-sum course on the list. And that is probably enough for now, for 2020. It\u2019s going to take time to form new habits. It\u2019s true, old habits do indeed die hard. But I have a better understanding of how it works and some new tools. I\u2019m going to create new patterns \u2013 and pork dumplings \u2013 with my partner, and this will enable us to experience each other in new and emotional ways. I\u2019m going to spice things up further by sleeping in my tracksuit. We will have a dog, too, not just for Christmas, and it will run with me every morning and that will feel \u2013 eventually \u2013 not like a chore but normal and good. I\u2019ll also run on a treadmill as I work. And I\u2019m booking myself into a nail bar for a set of top-of-the-range acrylic extensions. But I will continue to suck air through my teeth. And to gurn, charmingly. Good Habits, Bad Habits by Wendy Wood is published by Pan Macmillan. To buy for \u00a317.60 (RRP \u00a320) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0203 176 3837.

In the months leading up to the attack, he was subject to two community orders \u2013 one for attacking a police officer with his own incapacitant spray, the second for growing cannabis.</p> <p>From the summer of 2014, Braddon was being supervised by an inexperienced probation services officer (PSO), Kathryn Oakley, who assessed him of being of medium risk.</p> <p>Bashir highlighted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/07/officer-supervising-conner-marshall-killer-was-overwhelmed-inquest-hears\">Braddon was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/07/officer-supervising-conner-marshall-killer-was-overwhelmed-inquest-hears\"> one of 60 cases Oakley oversaw</a>. Braddon missed a string of appointments and admitted that he was drinking and had come off medication that helped his mental health problems. Oakley accepted in court that if she had more time she would have made more checks and had a more investigative approach.</p> <p>But the coroner said her shortcomings were not her fault but the result of her excessive workload and failure of senior staff to supervise her properly.</p> <p>At the time, the controversial Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) government reforms were being implemented. Thirty-five probation trusts in England and Wales were dismantled and replaced with 21 privately run community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- or medium-risk offenders, while the National Probation Service looked after those posing a higher risk.</p> <p>The coroner said: \u201cThe circumstances in which she found herself, a brand new probation [services] officer, with woefully inadequate management and supervision structure \u2026 was not of her own making but rather that of both Wales Probation Trust and Wales CRC in the levels of staffing, caseload and structures they had in place for managing and supervising new PSOs.\u201d</p> <p>The coroner said Oakley was \u201cfailed\u201d by Wales Probation Trust and added: \u201cWhen employed by Wales CRC Ltd, her management and supervision was too little and too late.\u201d He said: \u201cKathryn Oakley was overwhelmed with her caseload and workload.\u201d</p> <p>Bashir continued: \u201cShe was essentially left to her own devices, burdened as she was with a heavy and difficult caseload in an environment which was chaotic and stretched due to the impending implementation of the TR programme.\u201d</p> <p>The coroner criticised the evidence of some of Oakley\u2019s seniors. He described the deputy head of Wales CRC, Terry Reddington, and team leader, Heather Nichols, as unreliable and evasive witnesses.</p> <p>But he said Marshall\u2019s murder could not have been foreseen or prevented. \u201cTo suggest that a more robust approach in the management and supervision of David Braddon would have \u2026 brought [him] back before the courts [is] purely speculative.\u201d</p> <p>Outside court, Marshall\u2019s mother, Nadine, said: \u201cThe coroner\u2019s findings have vindicated what we have always known to be true \u2013 that the supervision of David Braddon was not robust and the management systems were wholly inadequate. This was a direct consequence of the chaos caused by the privatisation of probation services. The coroner identified seven major failures. Had these failures not occurred we will never know if our son Conner would be here today.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Barrow, Director of National Probation Service Wales, said: \u201cThis was an awful crime and our thoughts remain with Conner Marshall\u2019s family and friends.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the coroner found Conner\u2019s death could not have been avoided, there is no doubt David Braddon\u2019s probation supervision was not good enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe have now taken responsibility for managing all offenders on licence in Wales from the community rehabilitation company and 800 more probation officers are in training across England and Wales which will help to improve public protection.\u201d</p> <p>The union Napo, which represents probation workers, said the case showed that its members faced unrealistic workloads that affected their ability to keep the public safe.</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, said: \u201cThe Ministry of Justice and those responsible for the Transforming Rehabilitation programme must now take a long hard look at the consequences of their actions. The rushed privatisation of an essential service was done in the interests of profit over public safety.\u201d</p>",

Bashir highlighted that Braddon was one of 60 cases Oakley oversaw. Braddon missed a string of appointments and admitted that he was drinking and had come off medication that helped his mental health problems. Oakley accepted in court that if she had more time she would have made more checks and had a more investigative approach. But the coroner said her shortcomings were not her fault but the result of her excessive workload and failure of senior staff to supervise her properly. At the time, the controversial Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) government reforms were being implemented. Thirty-five probation trusts in England and Wales were dismantled and replaced with 21 privately run community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- or medium-risk offenders, while the National Probation Service looked after those posing a higher risk. The coroner said: \u201cThe circumstances in which she found herself, a brand new probation [services] officer, with woefully inadequate management and supervision structure \u2026 was not of her own making but rather that of both Wales Probation Trust and Wales CRC in the levels of staffing, caseload and structures they had in place for managing and supervising new PSOs.\u201d The coroner said Oakley was \u201cfailed\u201d by Wales Probation Trust and added: \u201cWhen employed by Wales CRC Ltd, her management and supervision was too little and too late.\u201d He said: \u201cKathryn Oakley was overwhelmed with her caseload and workload.\u201d Bashir continued: \u201cShe was essentially left to her own devices, burdened as she was with a heavy and difficult caseload in an environment which was chaotic and stretched due to the impending implementation of the TR programme.\u201d The coroner criticised the evidence of some of Oakley\u2019s seniors. He described the deputy head of Wales CRC, Terry Reddington, and team leader, Heather Nichols, as unreliable and evasive witnesses. But he said Marshall\u2019s murder could not have been foreseen or prevented. \u201cTo suggest that a more robust approach in the management and supervision of David Braddon would have \u2026 brought [him] back before the courts [is] purely speculative.\u201d Outside court, Marshall\u2019s mother, Nadine, said: \u201cThe coroner\u2019s findings have vindicated what we have always known to be true \u2013 that the supervision of David Braddon was not robust and the management systems were wholly inadequate. This was a direct consequence of the chaos caused by the privatisation of probation services. The coroner identified seven major failures. Had these failures not occurred we will never know if our son Conner would be here today.\u201d Ian Barrow, Director of National Probation Service Wales, said: \u201cThis was an awful crime and our thoughts remain with Conner Marshall\u2019s family and friends. \u201cWhile the coroner found Conner\u2019s death could not have been avoided, there is no doubt David Braddon\u2019s probation supervision was not good enough. \u201cWe have now taken responsibility for managing all offenders on licence in Wales from the community rehabilitation company and 800 more probation officers are in training across England and Wales which will help to improve public protection.\u201d The union Napo, which represents probation workers, said the case showed that its members faced unrealistic workloads that affected their ability to keep the public safe. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, said: \u201cThe Ministry of Justice and those responsible for the Transforming Rehabilitation programme must now take a long hard look at the consequences of their actions. The rushed privatisation of an essential service was done in the interests of profit over public safety.\u201d",

But he also revealed that it contained allegations about the treatment of at least one other patient. He declined to give details.</p> <p>Warby said the allegations concerned \u201ca previous incident which is not being looked at here and we can\u2019t comment on\u201d. He could not confirm whether the allegations involved the death of another patient at WSH \u2013 the local hospital of the health secretary, Matt Hancock.</p> <p>Last month the Guardian revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/11/matt-hancock-wont-talk-to-us-say-bullied-doctors-at-hospital-in-suffolk\">anonymous letter had prompted an unprecedented \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d</a> by the hospital bosses to try to identify the staff member who had sent the letter. This week the Guardian further revealed that the trust had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/staff-say-hospital-bosses-misled-them-in-hunt-for-whistleblower\">spent more than \u00a32,500 on handwriting and fingerprint experts</a> after demanding samples from staff.</p> <p>Asked by reporters whether he was upset by such tactics, Warby said: \u201cI was quite surprised the lengths they went to, but that was also part of a criminal investigation as well. So I can understand that aspect of it to a degree, because the allegations involved in the letter could potentially involve a criminal case.\u201d</p> <p>In a written statement issued after the adjournment, Warby added: \u201cTransparency is important in maintaining confidence in the NHS and upholding patient safety, and hospital staff should feel able to speak out on any issues they identify in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Warby said he was satisfied that the inquest had addressed all allegations in the letter specifically relating to his wife\u2019s treatment.</p> <p>The inquest heard that during one of Mrs Warby\u2019s operations the wrong fluid had been used in an IV drip. Instead of saline, a solution containing glucose was injected into Warby\u2019s artery and as a result her blood sugar increased to very high levels. Doctors did not realise the mistake and then treated her with insulin to bring the blood glucose levels down, despite the risk this carried of brain damage. The inquest also heard that Warby\u2019s lung had been punctured during a procedure to insert a central line into her inner jugular vein.</p> <p>Frances McClenaghan, a lawyer for WSH, told the inquest: \u201cThe trust accepted at a very early stage that the incorrect fluids had been administered.\u201d</p> <p>She described the punctured lung incident as a \u201crecognised complication\u201d of the operation.</p> <p>Before the inquest was adjourned Warby\u2019s lawyer, Conor Dufficy, said the family accepted that these errors had not contributed to her death. But he asked the coroner to seek expertise from an independent witness, because all the witnesses called to the inquest so far worked, or had worked, at WSH.</p> <p>The coroner agreed to the request and adjourned the hearing.</p> <p>Warby said he welcomed the decision. In his statement he said: \u201cSadly, questions still remain about whether Sue could have survived if these errors had not been made, and I will continue to seek answers in relation to this.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe one positive to come out of all of this is the changes that have been put in place to protect future patients and prevent future incidents. Nobody should have to go through what we have been through.\u201d</p> <p>Senior doctors at West Suffolk hospital said the trust\u2019s demand for fingerprints and handwriting typified a bullying management style. They were also angered when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/11/matt-hancock-wont-talk-to-us-say-bullied-doctors-at-hospital-in-suffolk\">Hancock failed to respond to concerns about the trust\u2019s treatment of staff</a>.</p> <p>Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, said: \u201cThe witch-hunt for a whistleblower following the tragic death of Mrs Warby highlights a deep-seated toxic culture at West Suffolk hospital. A culture where alleged bullying and intimidation of senior doctors is the chosen strategy by senior managers to silence whistleblowers concerned about patient safety.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cRather than address the widespread patient safety issues leading to Mrs Warby\u2019s death, the senior management at the trust sought instead to divert their attention to targeting the whistleblower. Meanwhile the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, who purports to champion patient safety, and in whose local hospital this is happening, has simply buried his head in the sand when approached about the matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe very fact that a clinician felt it was necessary to contact the family directly in an anonymous manner is all too telling of a draconian blame culture where staff feel too afraid to speak up when things go wrong. There is no doubt that staff\u2019s worst fears have been confirmed by the trust\u2019s subsequent punitive and needlessly high-handed response.\u201d</p>",

Last month the Guardian revealed that the anonymous letter had prompted an unprecedented \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d by the hospital bosses to try to identify the staff member who had sent the letter. This week the Guardian further revealed that the trust had spent more than \u00a32,500 on handwriting and fingerprint experts after demanding samples from staff. Asked by reporters whether he was upset by such tactics, Warby said: \u201cI was quite surprised the lengths they went to, but that was also part of a criminal investigation as well. So I can understand that aspect of it to a degree, because the allegations involved in the letter could potentially involve a criminal case.\u201d In a written statement issued after the adjournment, Warby added: \u201cTransparency is important in maintaining confidence in the NHS and upholding patient safety, and hospital staff should feel able to speak out on any issues they identify in the workplace.\u201d Warby said he was satisfied that the inquest had addressed all allegations in the letter specifically relating to his wife\u2019s treatment. The inquest heard that during one of Mrs Warby\u2019s operations the wrong fluid had been used in an IV drip. Instead of saline, a solution containing glucose was injected into Warby\u2019s artery and as a result her blood sugar increased to very high levels. Doctors did not realise the mistake and then treated her with insulin to bring the blood glucose levels down, despite the risk this carried of brain damage. The inquest also heard that Warby\u2019s lung had been punctured during a procedure to insert a central line into her inner jugular vein. Frances McClenaghan, a lawyer for WSH, told the inquest: \u201cThe trust accepted at a very early stage that the incorrect fluids had been administered.\u201d She described the punctured lung incident as a \u201crecognised complication\u201d of the operation. Before the inquest was adjourned Warby\u2019s lawyer, Conor Dufficy, said the family accepted that these errors had not contributed to her death. But he asked the coroner to seek expertise from an independent witness, because all the witnesses called to the inquest so far worked, or had worked, at WSH. The coroner agreed to the request and adjourned the hearing. Warby said he welcomed the decision. In his statement he said: \u201cSadly, questions still remain about whether Sue could have survived if these errors had not been made, and I will continue to seek answers in relation to this.\u201d He added: \u201cThe one positive to come out of all of this is the changes that have been put in place to protect future patients and prevent future incidents. Nobody should have to go through what we have been through.\u201d Senior doctors at West Suffolk hospital said the trust\u2019s demand for fingerprints and handwriting typified a bullying management style. They were also angered when Hancock failed to respond to concerns about the trust\u2019s treatment of staff. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, said: \u201cThe witch-hunt for a whistleblower following the tragic death of Mrs Warby highlights a deep-seated toxic culture at West Suffolk hospital. A culture where alleged bullying and intimidation of senior doctors is the chosen strategy by senior managers to silence whistleblowers concerned about patient safety.\u201d He added: \u201cRather than address the widespread patient safety issues leading to Mrs Warby\u2019s death, the senior management at the trust sought instead to divert their attention to targeting the whistleblower. Meanwhile the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, who purports to champion patient safety, and in whose local hospital this is happening, has simply buried his head in the sand when approached about the matter. \u201cThe very fact that a clinician felt it was necessary to contact the family directly in an anonymous manner is all too telling of a draconian blame culture where staff feel too afraid to speak up when things go wrong. There is no doubt that staff\u2019s worst fears have been confirmed by the trust\u2019s subsequent punitive and needlessly high-handed response.\u201d",

The IVF may have brought to a head a situation that has been brewing for a long time. \u201cIVF is not a subject that everyone understands,\u201d Toxavidi explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of loss, pain \u2013 even envy \u2013 that\u2019s difficult for others who have not been through it to understand.\u201d I\u2019m sorry your niece isn\u2019t well, but you didn\u2019t mention how your mother or younger brother had supported your older brother and his wife through IVF. They may be now projecting how they feel they have been treated on to the rest of you (which is completely wrong, of course). There\u2019s also no real expression of how you feel, other than stuck in the middle with a need to sort things out. Your every emotion is filtered through how it is for others. Concentrate on your relationships with your mother and brothers. The moment you are tempted to go into \u201cparty line\u201d mode, stop and bring it back to you and that other person, not how it feeds back to the others. That is really all you can do. It\u2019s up to your elder brother if he wants to see his brother and his mother. This doesn\u2019t stop you being a good daughter/sister/aunt, by the way. But it does stop you being a pinball shunted between these warring factions. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com. Annalisa regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.

      "body": "<p>At 5.30pm in Manchester\u2019s Piccadilly Gardens, three police officers are gathered around a wheelchair parked in front of a gold postbox commemorating Team GB\u2019s Olympic cycling success. Sitting in the chair, bent double, is a tiny woman with one leg. \u201cCan you sit up, love?\u201d the officers ask, coaxing her gently upright. They know her name. \u201cWe just wanted to check you were OK.\u201d She mumbles that she\u2019s fine. As they head off towards the statue of Queen Victoria, the woman immediately slumps forward again.</p> <p>On a bench near the tram tracks, another drug casualty is frozen \u2013 a different kind of statue. He is holding a rolled-up cigarette, long extinguished in the evening drizzle. In a doorway by a branch of Greggs, three men with sleeping bags are sharing some pasties. In front of them, a preacher with a megaphone is telling commuters to repent or burn in hell. Outside Boots, two charity fundraisers working for Shelter flirt with commuters on their way up to Piccadilly station.</p> <p>Welcome to the civic square that makes the news for all the wrong reasons. On Thursday night, a 19-year-old man was taken to hospital after being assaulted in Piccadilly Gardens by a man with a broken bottle. This came a few days after four homeless people were stabbed in a fight at the Market Street end, and six days after a 15-year-old was stabbed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c2029ed88f5949b5fe35feb58b2ae6703d65028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c2029ed88f5949b5fe35feb58b2ae6703d65028/0_396_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piccadilly Gardens\u2019 benches and grassy areas have become a magnet for homeless people and all-day drinkers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piccadilly Gardens\u2019 benches and grassy areas have become a magnet for homeless people and all-day drinkers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, 18 years after councillors took the postwar <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/piccadilly-gardens-campaign-city-centre-6993615\">\u201csunken\u201d gardens</a> out of Piccadilly Gardens and flattened them to make a chaotic, hybrid no-man\u2019s land, Manchester city council (MCC) has vowed to restore the area and make it a source of civic pride. Earlier this week, it announced the appointment of architects to lead on the revamp, which it said would \u201chelp deter anti-social behaviour\u201d and create a more \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d space. With that, it set up a test case for a vital question in modern cities: can you drive behaviour by changing public spaces \u2013 or merely get distracted from the underlying problems?</p> <p>LDA Design will produce several plans that will go out for public comment in the spring, with the hope that the new and improved Piccadilly Gardens will be finished by the end of 2022.</p> <p>LDA\u2019s director, Mark Graham, knows the huge task must prioritise public safety. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking opportunities away for unsafe things to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cSimple things like lighting and taking certain hiding places out, by which I mean the higher walls and corners and edges that don\u2019t necessarily need to be there and which provide spaces for antisocial behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>One particular wall in Piccadilly Gardens has become notorious among Mancunians. When the square was last overhauled, in 2002, it received the controversial addition of a concrete pavilion designed by the Japanese architect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando\" title=\"\">Tadao Ando</a> \u2013 his only UK work. The pavilion, housing a restaurant, is less contentious than its accompanying slab of concrete, dubbed Manchester\u2019s Berlin Wall by its many critics, which not only provides shade on rare sunny days but also, many say, sanctuary for antisocial behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"679502a1c6360c51a6d3591e272fa2e0c0af81f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679502a1c6360c51a6d3591e272fa2e0c0af81f2/0_0_1000_665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How it used to look: LS Lowry\u2019s depiction of the demolished gardens, \u2018Piccadilly Gardens, 1954\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How it used to look: LS Lowry\u2019s depiction of the demolished gardens, \u2018Piccadilly Gardens, 1954\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Art Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Leese, the council leader since 1996, is a fan of the pavilion but accepts he is a minority voice and that the wall will probably go. He is less keen to accept the area\u2019s reputation as a no-go zone. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m a 68-year-old bloke, I\u2019m the sort of person who is supposed to be petrified of spaces like that and I just am not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Leese wants to move the bus station but is loath to remove the grass, despite it being a regular topic of despair in the <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/piccadilly-gardens-fake-hybrid-grass-16836170\">Manchester Evening News</a>. Get rid of it, argues Eddy Rhead, co-founder of the Manchester Modernist Society: \u201cI can think of no other world-class public square in the world that has grass and yet MCC continue to replace the grass, only for it be destroyed by people, heaven forbid, actually using the square for recreation or \u2013 as was the case this winter \u2013 with the woeful Christmas markets.\u201d</p> <p>Rhead believes the architecture is a convenient scapegoat: \u201cThe biggest and hardest problem, and the one civic leaders seem unable to face up to, is to solve the wider social issues that currently make Piccadilly Gardens an unattractive space. Stop blaming the architecture \u2026 for wider social ills.\u201d</p> <p>The architect Liza Fior \u2013 whose practice, muf, won the 2008 European prize for public space for a town square in Barking, east London \u2013 says changing longstanding behaviour is difficult. Getting rid of what she calls the \u201cstains of use\u201d is not easy: she notes how <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17062735\">Charles Booth\u2019s Victorian poverty map</a> of London \u201cdescribes pockets of crime some of which persist until now, eg there is a little triangle off Old Street where there is a lot of street robbery and it was always thus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a536c29f7f233203ac2791834d7a8a2126f6e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a536c29f7f233203ac2791834d7a8a2126f6e5c/0_382_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester\u2019s \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester\u2019s \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kate MacDonald, MCC\u2019s city centre strategic lead, is leading on the social side of the revamp. She works with Manchester\u2019s street community \u2013 she knows the one-legged woman in the wheelchair \u201cvery well\u201d \u2013 and wants to make sure they are not simply shunted elsewhere and forgotten about.It\u2019s a complex picture, she says, backdropped by cuts to police and social services. </p> <p>\u201cBut we do get people congregating in Piccadilly Gardens who make other people feel uncomfortable,\u201d she acknowledges. She hopes to complement the new architecture with a team of friendly \u201chosts\u201d who will welcome visitors and be trained to help rough sleepers and drug addicts.</p> <p>She has already sanctioned the removal of some benches near the gold postbox after observing that they were never used by older shoppers but by drinkers (who now rest their cans on a huge new bin). When redesigning <a href=\"http://www.gillettsquare.org.uk/whats-here\">Gillett Square</a> in Dalston, east London, Fior was unable to banish the street drinkers but worked to outnumber them. \u201cWe introduced a mirrored box of \u2018loose parts play\u2019 which is opened up for play sessions three days a week, so that instead of the street drinkers dominating, they become are a smaller percentage of activity,\u201d she says, noting that the presence of children makes \u201ca huge difference\u201d.</p> <p>Macdonald is keen to introduce more regular activities into Piccadilly Gardens, such as a community choir, and her dream is that by 2023 the square will be on every tourist\u2019s itinerary. \u201cArchitecture on its own can\u2019t change everything, but it can support a new use of the space and a much clearer identity for it,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the moment, nobody coming to Manchester would say: \u2018Oh, we must go and get a selfie in front of whatever in Piccadilly Gardens\u2019. We can change that.\u201d</p> <h2>Other notable city squares</h2> <p><strong>Times Square, New York: </strong>In 2017, a six-year overhaul of this Big Apple landmark was completed, turning the once-congested tourist trap into a people-friendly piazza. The famous screens remain but pedestrians now have twice the space they used to. Architects Sn\u00f8hetta installed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/10/the-benches-are-the-coolest-part-of-times-squares-redesign/\">five different benches</a> throughout the space, each encouraging a range of sitting postures. Critics said <a href=\"https://snohetta.com/projects/327-times-square\">a</a><a href=\"https://snohetta.com/projects/327-times-square\">n amphitheatre</a> in the middle of the road would encourage vagrancy and prostitution but their fears were unfounded and Times Square has become a vastly more welcoming place.</p> <p><strong>Bradford City Park: </strong>Considered one of the UK\u2019s most successful public realm revamps, this large public square in front of the Grade I-listed City Hall has become truly beloved of Bradfordians. In the summer, families picnic by the Mirror pool, while children splash in the water, darting in and out of more than 100 fountains, the largest of which, \u201cthe Bradford Blast\u201d, rises to 30 metres. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-48294574\">Plumbing problems</a> meant the pool ran dry in 2019, proving the importance of a decent maintenance budget.</p> <p><strong>Alexanderplatz, Berlin:</strong> A vast concrete piazza in the heart of former East Berlin dominated by an invincible branch of C&amp;A and the futuristic Fernsehturm (TV tower), Alexanderplatz has been under construction pretty much since reunification. In 1993, the architect Hans Kollhoff won a competition to redesign the square as part of an American-style city centre, but the 10 high-rise buildings in his plan have never materialised and the perennially broke city senate has never found a way to make the cold grey space more welcoming.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At 5.30pm in Manchester\u2019s Piccadilly Gardens, three police officers are gathered around a wheelchair parked in front of a gold postbox commemorating Team GB\u2019s Olympic cycling success. Sitting in the chair, bent double, is a tiny woman with one leg. \u201cCan you sit up, love?\u201d the officers ask, coaxing her gently upright. They know her name. \u201cWe just wanted to check you were OK.\u201d She mumbles that she\u2019s fine. As they head off towards the statue of Queen Victoria, the woman immediately slumps forward again. On a bench near the tram tracks, another drug casualty is frozen \u2013 a different kind of statue. He is holding a rolled-up cigarette, long extinguished in the evening drizzle. In a doorway by a branch of Greggs, three men with sleeping bags are sharing some pasties. In front of them, a preacher with a megaphone is telling commuters to repent or burn in hell. Outside Boots, two charity fundraisers working for Shelter flirt with commuters on their way up to Piccadilly station. Welcome to the civic square that makes the news for all the wrong reasons. On Thursday night, a 19-year-old man was taken to hospital after being assaulted in Piccadilly Gardens by a man with a broken bottle. This came a few days after four homeless people were stabbed in a fight at the Market Street end, and six days after a 15-year-old was stabbed. Now, 18 years after councillors took the postwar \u201csunken\u201d gardens out of Piccadilly Gardens and flattened them to make a chaotic, hybrid no-man\u2019s land, Manchester city council (MCC) has vowed to restore the area and make it a source of civic pride. Earlier this week, it announced the appointment of architects to lead on the revamp, which it said would \u201chelp deter anti-social behaviour\u201d and create a more \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d space. With that, it set up a test case for a vital question in modern cities: can you drive behaviour by changing public spaces \u2013 or merely get distracted from the underlying problems? LDA Design will produce several plans that will go out for public comment in the spring, with the hope that the new and improved Piccadilly Gardens will be finished by the end of 2022. LDA\u2019s director, Mark Graham, knows the huge task must prioritise public safety. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking opportunities away for unsafe things to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cSimple things like lighting and taking certain hiding places out, by which I mean the higher walls and corners and edges that don\u2019t necessarily need to be there and which provide spaces for antisocial behaviour.\u201d One particular wall in Piccadilly Gardens has become notorious among Mancunians. When the square was last overhauled, in 2002, it received the controversial addition of a concrete pavilion designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando \u2013 his only UK work. The pavilion, housing a restaurant, is less contentious than its accompanying slab of concrete, dubbed Manchester\u2019s Berlin Wall by its many critics, which not only provides shade on rare sunny days but also, many say, sanctuary for antisocial behaviour. Richard Leese, the council leader since 1996, is a fan of the pavilion but accepts he is a minority voice and that the wall will probably go. He is less keen to accept the area\u2019s reputation as a no-go zone. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m a 68-year-old bloke, I\u2019m the sort of person who is supposed to be petrified of spaces like that and I just am not,\u201d he said. Leese wants to move the bus station but is loath to remove the grass, despite it being a regular topic of despair in the Manchester Evening News. Get rid of it, argues Eddy Rhead, co-founder of the Manchester Modernist Society: \u201cI can think of no other world-class public square in the world that has grass and yet MCC continue to replace the grass, only for it be destroyed by people, heaven forbid, actually using the square for recreation or \u2013 as was the case this winter \u2013 with the woeful Christmas markets.\u201d Rhead believes the architecture is a convenient scapegoat: \u201cThe biggest and hardest problem, and the one civic leaders seem unable to face up to, is to solve the wider social issues that currently make Piccadilly Gardens an unattractive space. Stop blaming the architecture \u2026 for wider social ills.\u201d The architect Liza Fior \u2013 whose practice, muf, won the 2008 European prize for public space for a town square in Barking, east London \u2013 says changing longstanding behaviour is difficult. Getting rid of what she calls the \u201cstains of use\u201d is not easy: she notes how Charles Booth\u2019s Victorian poverty map of London \u201cdescribes pockets of crime some of which persist until now, eg there is a little triangle off Old Street where there is a lot of street robbery and it was always thus.\u201d Kate MacDonald, MCC\u2019s city centre strategic lead, is leading on the social side of the revamp. She works with Manchester\u2019s street community \u2013 she knows the one-legged woman in the wheelchair \u201cvery well\u201d \u2013 and wants to make sure they are not simply shunted elsewhere and forgotten about.It\u2019s a complex picture, she says, backdropped by cuts to police and social services. \u201cBut we do get people congregating in Piccadilly Gardens who make other people feel uncomfortable,\u201d she acknowledges. She hopes to complement the new architecture with a team of friendly \u201chosts\u201d who will welcome visitors and be trained to help rough sleepers and drug addicts. She has already sanctioned the removal of some benches near the gold postbox after observing that they were never used by older shoppers but by drinkers (who now rest their cans on a huge new bin). When redesigning Gillett Square in Dalston, east London, Fior was unable to banish the street drinkers but worked to outnumber them. \u201cWe introduced a mirrored box of \u2018loose parts play\u2019 which is opened up for play sessions three days a week, so that instead of the street drinkers dominating, they become are a smaller percentage of activity,\u201d she says, noting that the presence of children makes \u201ca huge difference\u201d. Macdonald is keen to introduce more regular activities into Piccadilly Gardens, such as a community choir, and her dream is that by 2023 the square will be on every tourist\u2019s itinerary. \u201cArchitecture on its own can\u2019t change everything, but it can support a new use of the space and a much clearer identity for it,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the moment, nobody coming to Manchester would say: \u2018Oh, we must go and get a selfie in front of whatever in Piccadilly Gardens\u2019. We can change that.\u201d Other notable city squares Times Square, New York: In 2017, a six-year overhaul of this Big Apple landmark was completed, turning the once-congested tourist trap into a people-friendly piazza. The famous screens remain but pedestrians now have twice the space they used to. Architects Sn\u00f8hetta installed five different benches throughout the space, each encouraging a range of sitting postures. Critics said an amphitheatre in the middle of the road would encourage vagrancy and prostitution but their fears were unfounded and Times Square has become a vastly more welcoming place. Bradford City Park: Considered one of the UK\u2019s most successful public realm revamps, this large public square in front of the Grade I-listed City Hall has become truly beloved of Bradfordians. In the summer, families picnic by the Mirror pool, while children splash in the water, darting in and out of more than 100 fountains, the largest of which, \u201cthe Bradford Blast\u201d, rises to 30 metres. Plumbing problems meant the pool ran dry in 2019, proving the importance of a decent maintenance budget. Alexanderplatz, Berlin: A vast concrete piazza in the heart of former East Berlin dominated by an invincible branch of C&amp;A and the futuristic Fernsehturm (TV tower), Alexanderplatz has been under construction pretty much since reunification. In 1993, the architect Hans Kollhoff won a competition to redesign the square as part of an American-style city centre, but the 10 high-rise buildings in his plan have never materialised and the perennially broke city senate has never found a way to make the cold grey space more welcoming.",

      "bodyText": "A counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings included Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups as well as neo-Nazis, the Guardian has learned. The guide, produced by Counter Terrorism Policing, is used across England as part of training for Prevent, the anti-radicalisation scheme designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence. Last week, police said documents uncovered by the Guardian that listed the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) alongside far-right extremists and jihadists were a local error. But the list of groups viewed as a potential concern contained in the new 24-page document includes Extinction Rebellion. It also includes Greenpeace \u2013 among whose supporters are Dame Judi Dench, Stephen Fry, Gillian Anderson and Joanna Lumley \u2013 and the ocean pollution campaigners Sea Shepherd, whose supporters include Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. Also included is Stop the Badger Cull, which is backed by Sir Brian May, the Queen guitarist. They appear alongside a number of extremist rightwing groups including Combat 18 and the National Front, as well as National Action, which has been banned for terrorist violence. The last page of an accompanying visual guide seen by the Guardian advises people to report \u201cany concerns identified via this document\u201d using an online portal for reporting suspicious activity that is operated by Counter Terrorism Policing under the slogan: \u201cAction counters terrorism\u201d. Police insist the guide is not meant to portray all the groups that it features as extremist and thus needing to be reported to them. They said it is meant to boost understanding of the signs and symbols people may come across, and point to a statement in the document that \u201cnot all of the signs and symbols noted within this document are of counter terrorism interest\u201d. However, on the visual guide the disclaimer appears to refer specifically to a set of religious and historical symbols used by white supremacists including \u201cOdin\u2019s Rune\u2019, \u201cSS Runes\u201d and \u201cThor\u2019s Hammer\u201d. Mainstream leftwing and environmental groups are not similarly marked. Non-violent groups featured in the document were furious at their inclusion. \u201cTarring environmental campaigners and terrorist organisations with the same brush is not going to help fight terrorism,\u201d said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. \u201cIt will only harm the reputation of hard-working police officers \u2026 How can we possibly teach children about the devastation caused by the climate emergency while at the same implying that those trying to stop it are extremists?\u201d Peta\u2019s director, Elisa Allen, said: \u201cThis appears to be a sinister attempt to quash legitimate campaigning organisations \u2013 something that is as dangerous as it is undemocratic.\u201d A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion said: \u201cThe guidance document makes it clear that not all the signs and symbols are of counter-terrorism interest. However, if that\u2019s the case, why include them in a counter-terrorism document?\u201d Politicians were also critical of the document, with Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy called the inclusion of peaceful climate crisis groups \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. Among the groups listed with no known link to terrorist violence or known threat to national security are Stop the War, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, vegan activists, anti-fascist groups, anti-racist groups, an anti-police surveillance group and campaigners against airport expansion. Communist and socialist political parties are also on the list. They feature alongside numerous groups associated with the ideology of violence of the far right, and the terrorist group National Action, which is proscribed, as well as two other banned groups. There are also a set of symbols and tattoos commonly associated with white supremacy, from a swastika and a \u201cwhite pride worldwide\u201d poster to tattoos of an iron eagle and the second world war German general Erwin Rommel. The guide, from June 2019, bears the logo of Counter Terrorism Policing on every page, and was presented in briefings to public sector workers. One senior teacher, who supports the efforts to thwart radicalisation, said they received the document as part of Prevent training at their educational establishment: \u201cThe document was given with the guidance that teaching staff could use it to identify symbols that students might draw or have about them and to enable staff to make a decision about whether it is a Prevent concern or not. \u201cThe document is extraordinarily vague and leaves a great deal down to the interpretation of the individual member of staff,\u201d the teacher added. \u201cClustering relatively innocuous groups like Greenpeace and CND in with genuine extremist groups seems to imply that these organisations are on the radar of the counter-terrorism police and should also be interpreted as such by the teaching staff coming across them.\u201d Police said it was \u201cunhelpful and misleading\u201d to suggest non-violent groups in the document were being smeared. They said it would be provided to Prevent partners as \u201ca guide to help them identify and understand the range of organisations they might come across\u201d and should not be viewed as suggesting that membership of \u201cnon-proscribed groups would be sufficient to trigger a Prevent referral\u201d. \u201cOur focus is definitely not on lawful protest, or legitimate causes taken up by activists across the country,\u201d Counter Terrorism Policing\u2019s senior national coordinator, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon told the Guardian. Dated June last year, the document was sent to doctors, schools and safeguarding children boards as a resource for practitioners of Prevent. A spokesman for Worcestershire Acute NHS Trust said the documents were available for staff to access as part of Prevent awareness. The documents were supplied to the trust\u2019s safeguarding and Prevent lead. It is also in use in the West Midlands. Last week, police claimed it was an error for a guide explicitly about extremism to include Extinction Rebellion alongside terrorist-supporting Islamist and extreme rightwing groups. They further said such an approach in the guide meant for police, teachers and other public sector workers was limited to the south-east of England. After the Guardian revealed the guide\u2019s existence it was recalled. Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said the latest document was evidence that peaceful protest was under threat. \u201cWe have long warned that the government\u2019s counter-terror agenda is one of the greatest threats to free speech in the UK. If you are passionate about anything from climate change to social justice or fighting racism in the UK today you risk being labelled extremist and your details being passed to the police. \u201cThe UK\u2019s counter-terror measures are designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to spy on young people in their care \u2013 this guide will only add to the confusion and pressures they face. It also reinforces long held concerns that the government\u2019s staggeringly broad definition of extremism gives the police cover to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish.\u201d Additional reporting by Russell Scott",

I was really in a good state of mind.\u201d When they met for the 55th time, in the second singles match of the ATP Cup final in Sydney last Sunday, they knew the winner would be laying down a marker for Melbourne. Nadal lost and, suspicious of looming burnout before the Australian Open, opted out of the deciding doubles. It was a psychological victory for Djokovic, who played with his old friend Viktor Troicki and lifted the Cup. Djokovic has been upbeat since his arrival, sharp in practice and in the sort of mood reminiscent of his best years. He has the measure of Federer and Nadal. He knows it, and so do they \u2013 but all three will strain to their respective limits in an extension of the most glorious rivalry between three champions in modern individual sport.",

      "body": "<p>You know the conversations you have with infrequent visitors to the UK, who think we eat and drink nothing but fish and chips and warm beer? Well, it must be like that for the Argentinians, too, when we assume that they live off malbec and steak. (Although there is a shred of truth in that: I ate more beef in a week on a recent visit than I normally do in six months.) But, even though there\u2019s obviously more to Argentinian wine than malbec, practically everyone I know loves it (which I\u2019ll come on to next week), so why drink anything else?</p> <p>Well, the country makes some other great reds that the locals love and tend to drink right through a meal. There\u2019s some really good cabernet sauvignon (honestly, the Bordelais must gnash their teeth with envy at the near-perfect growing conditions in Argentina) and some excellent cabernet francs (the up-and-coming grape variety). There are also delicate, silky pinot noirs; some interesting albeit less feted bonardas; and, as elsewhere, grenache is on the up.</p> <p>But it\u2019s Argentina\u2019s whites that are the real ones to watch. Until recently, these have been typified by the rather heavy, oaky style of chardonnay you\u2019d expect from California (the US is Argentina\u2019s main export market). But now, thanks to pushing the boundaries of viticulture farther south (south, of course, meaning colder in the southern hemisphere) and higher-altitude sites to the north, they\u2019re being made in a much fresher, more elegant style. That\u2019s where you tend to find Argentina\u2019s main white calling card, torrontes, a love-it-or-hate-it gew\u00fcrztraminer-like variety, though it\u2019s hard to know quite when to drink it (with ceviche or coconut curries, I\u2019d suggest). It also works well in a blend like the Susana Balbo white featured below. I tasted interesting examples of chenin blanc, friulano, gr\u00fcner veltliner, malvasia, sauvignon blanc and semillon \u2013 still rare sightings here in the UK, but you might find them in cooler wine bars.</p> <p>You\u2019ll notice that the wines recommended this week are quite a bit more expensive than the prices you\u2019re used to paying for malbec. Even so, comparing their quality with similar wines from elsewhere, they still represent good value, aided in no small part by the dire state of Argentina\u2019s currency. And at least the Argentinians love us: we\u2019re their second-biggest export market after the US, and post-Brexit we\u2019ll need all the friends (and trade deals) we can get.</p> <h2>Four Argentinian wines that aren\u2019t malbec</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spacer small\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin:12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb8dbbd9d9f2b3cbf562e8fb2de790d30ad49bc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8dbbd9d9f2b3cbf562e8fb2de790d30ad49bc9/0_0_4900_4900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finca Ambrosia Vin\u0303a Unica Cabernetsq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Vi\u00f1a Unica </strong><strong>Ambrosia 2015</strong></p> <p>Gualtallary <a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/products-57849-2015-ambrosia-vina-unica-cabernet-sauvignon-gualtallary-uco-valley\" title=\"\">\u00a319.95 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a>, 15%. </p> <p>Smooth, polished, velvety cab sav for a fraction of the price of a top Napa cab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spacer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"54c31313dd63a6d69b78c5fda896849c511f7efa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54c31313dd63a6d69b78c5fda896849c511f7efa/0_0_4009_4009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Verum PinotNoir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Verum Pinot Noir 2018</strong></p> <p>Patagonia <a href=\"https://www.southdownscellars.co.uk/shop_detail/Red+Wine/Verum+Pinot+Noir/A27P8077\" title=\"\">\u00a314.95 Southdown Cellars</a> (Talking Wines has <a href=\"https://talkingwines.co.uk/product/verum-pinot-noir/\" title=\"\">the 2017 for \u00a313.99</a>), 13.5%.</p> <p>Gorgeously sexy.

      "bodyText": "You know the conversations you have with infrequent visitors to the UK, who think we eat and drink nothing but fish and chips and warm beer? Well, it must be like that for the Argentinians, too, when we assume that they live off malbec and steak. (Although there is a shred of truth in that: I ate more beef in a week on a recent visit than I normally do in six months.) But, even though there\u2019s obviously more to Argentinian wine than malbec, practically everyone I know loves it (which I\u2019ll come on to next week), so why drink anything else? Well, the country makes some other great reds that the locals love and tend to drink right through a meal. There\u2019s some really good cabernet sauvignon (honestly, the Bordelais must gnash their teeth with envy at the near-perfect growing conditions in Argentina) and some excellent cabernet francs (the up-and-coming grape variety). There are also delicate, silky pinot noirs; some interesting albeit less feted bonardas; and, as elsewhere, grenache is on the up. But it\u2019s Argentina\u2019s whites that are the real ones to watch. Until recently, these have been typified by the rather heavy, oaky style of chardonnay you\u2019d expect from California (the US is Argentina\u2019s main export market). But now, thanks to pushing the boundaries of viticulture farther south (south, of course, meaning colder in the southern hemisphere) and higher-altitude sites to the north, they\u2019re being made in a much fresher, more elegant style. That\u2019s where you tend to find Argentina\u2019s main white calling card, torrontes, a love-it-or-hate-it gew\u00fcrztraminer-like variety, though it\u2019s hard to know quite when to drink it (with ceviche or coconut curries, I\u2019d suggest). It also works well in a blend like the Susana Balbo white featured below. I tasted interesting examples of chenin blanc, friulano, gr\u00fcner veltliner, malvasia, sauvignon blanc and semillon \u2013 still rare sightings here in the UK, but you might find them in cooler wine bars. You\u2019ll notice that the wines recommended this week are quite a bit more expensive than the prices you\u2019re used to paying for malbec. Even so, comparing their quality with similar wines from elsewhere, they still represent good value, aided in no small part by the dire state of Argentina\u2019s currency. And at least the Argentinians love us: we\u2019re their second-biggest export market after the US, and post-Brexit we\u2019ll need all the friends (and trade deals) we can get. Four Argentinian wines that aren\u2019t malbec Vi\u00f1a Unica Ambrosia 2015 Gualtallary \u00a319.95 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 15%. Smooth, polished, velvety cab sav for a fraction of the price of a top Napa cab. Verum Pinot Noir 2018 Patagonia \u00a314.95 Southdown Cellars (Talking Wines has the 2017 for \u00a313.99), 13.5%. Gorgeously sexy. Burgundy would struggle to deliver at this price. Drink with duck. El Esteco Old Vines Torrontes 1945 2018 \u00a313.55 Exel Wines, 14%. Sophisticated, exotic, aromatic. Lovely acidity. Susana Balbo Signature White Blend 2018 \u00a316.95 The Whisky Exchange (Hennings has the 2017 for \u00a317.99), 13.5%. Like white bordeaux with a Latin twist: here, torrontes is blended with semillon and sauvignon to create a deliciously fragrant white to drink with light Mexican or Asian fish dishes. . \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

      "bodyText": "Utah\u2019s Republican governor, Gary Herbert, has suspended an HIV prevention campaign over condoms that used sexual innuendo to promote their use. The condoms featured Utah-specific locations and jokes, such as \u201cSL,UT\u201d as a shorthand for Salt Lake City, Utah, and \u201cUintah sex?\u201d as a reference for a Utah county. Officials had planned to distribute 100,000 condoms as part of an HIV prevention effort. In a statement to local TV station KUTV, Herbert\u2019s office said he \u201cunderstands the importance of the Utah department of health conducting a campaign about HIV prevention. \u201cHe does not, however, approve the use of sexual innuendo as part of a taxpayer-funded campaign, and our office has asked the department to rework the campaign\u2019s branding.\u201d The governor\u2019s office had also taken down a website associated with the campaign. Utah is not the first state to use cheeky condoms to encourage people to use them. Campaigns in Wyoming and Alaska used visual puns to attract attention. Alaska\u2019s campaign had an image of a fishing boat and said \u201cAvoid bycatch\u201d, and an oil rig with the words \u201cdrill safely\u201d. Wyoming\u2019s showed the famous Devil\u2019s Tower rock formation and read: \u201cProtect your landmark.\u201d Health officials are now struggling to put the genie back in the bottle. Even after shutting down the website and ordering health officials to stop handing out the condoms, KUTV reported 42,000 of 130,000 condoms had already been distributed. \u201cI have not heard yet from our staff what we are actually going to do with them,\u201d Jenny Johnson, a spokesperson for the Utah health department told the Salt Lake Tribune. \u201cWe\u2019re still scrambling to get them back.\u201d According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 40,000 people were diagnosed in 2015 in the US with HIV. Utah ranked 36th among the 50 states in the number of HIV diagnoses in 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Since Roger Scruton\u2019s death on Sunday, virtually the entire Conservative establishment has united in eulogising him. The prime minister hailed him as \u201cthe greatest modern conservative thinker\u201d; Daniel Hannan called him \u201cthe greatest conservative of our age\u201d. But when it comes to politics, Scruton\u2019s greatest contribution has been to help make a modernised version of Enoch Powell\u2019s bigotry \u2013 the idea that it is impossible for immigrants to integrate successfully \u2013 part of the mainstream debate. Writing in Powell\u2019s defence, Scruton once attacked liberal politicians for believing \u201cthe proposition that pious Muslims from the hinterlands of Asia would produce children loyal to a secular European state\u201d. He was clear that just being born and brought up here didn\u2019t make someone \u201cone of us\u201d; indeed, for certain ethnic and religious categories, the very idea was laughable. His view that Christianity was an essential component of English identity, and that of other European countries, meant that Muslim immigrants could only be seen as a threat. So Scruton\u2019s \u201cconservative\u201d conception of national identity, much praised over the last week, was not just about his love of foxhunting or the countryside. It was explicitly exclusionary. And his views on what that meant for public policy were not confined to architecture, but ranged far wider. He argued that European countries should explicitly discriminate (in jobs, housing or welfare benefits) in favour of \u201cindigenous European communities\u201d, on the grounds that \u201call coherent societies are based on discrimination\u201d. Scruton\u2019s thinking has been influential both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. His focus specifically on the \u201cMuslim threat\u201d predated that of his friend Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister of Hungary, and most other European \u201cnational populists\u201d, who have now made it their near-exclusive focus. His continued popularity among British conservatives \u2013 and Conservatives \u2013 reflects the fact that Islamophobia is respectable, acceptable, and indeed electorally useful, in a way in which anti-black racism or antisemitism, by and large, is not (at least in public).

Murray\u2019s bestselling book, The Strange Death of Europe, has been lauded by Orb\u00e1n and other leaders of the European far right. Meanwhile, Eric Kaufmann, professor of politics at Birkbeck, takes a more moderate tone. But he implicitly echoes Scruton in arguing that we should prioritise the \u201cethnic self-interest\u201d of the \u201cwhite majority\u201d by explicitly introducing racial and religious preferences into immigration policy. So what does Scruton\u2019s continued influence mean for British politics and policy? There are certainly those on the right who embrace the connection between his views on national identity and the success of national populists elsewhere in Europe, and would like to see policies to match.

We have sprinted past the moment when they were the limp cousin of the jumper, worn only if one wanted to signal a love of secondhand paperbacks. Now, in an era of aggressive layering, the associations of feyness have faded and the cardigan has become an essential part of a man\u2019s winter wardrobe. Worn over a T-shirt or a shirt \u2013 and with large thanks to Gucci and Harry Styles, Tyler, the Creator and Brian Cox in Succession \u2013 wearing the cardigan is now (dundundun!) cool. Coolcardie\u2122 nods towards the Ivy Look (the 50s preppy and freshly groomed look; see actor Steve McQueen). But in its boldest iteration, when rendered in strong colours by Marni or Bottega Veneta, it takes a step up from layered piece to statement piece. Today I\u2019ve gone for The Statement Cardie: maroon with pockets, over a jumper. As with a shirt, all buttons done up is a good way to wear it (it looks a bit too slouchy otherwise). Preppy is nice, but the Coolcardie\u2122 is all about changing up the traditional ways a cardigan is worn. You should avoid wearing it with a shoe that\u2019s too smart (unless you want to go full Jude Law in The Talented Mr Ripley). A stacked trainer or even a Converse looks good here. Do I like it? The moment I place my hands in the pockets, there\u2019s a definitely a hygge vibe; I feel centred and peaceful. It hangs snugly, like wearing a cloud (see also: duvet jackets and tracksuit bottoms). I can see that Coolcardie\u2122 and I will be friends for quite a while..",

      "bodyText": "Frogmore Cottage, the home of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, is in the process of being shuttered, according to reports, fuelling speculation the couple do not intend to spend any meaningful time in the UK in the near future. Key live-in staff \u2013 a house manager and a cleaner \u2013 are being moved to other duties within the Queen\u2019s household. Other staff members, used on an ad hoc basis and including chefs, maids and footmen, have been told their services are no longer required at the couple\u2019s Windsor residence, the Daily Mail reported. The claim comes as Harry and Meghan begin a period of \u201ctransition\u201d, splitting their time between the UK and Canada, with the reluctant blessing of the Queen. Meghan is already in Canada, with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, and their two dogs, having flown back to the Vancouver Island hideaway where the couple spent six weeks on a break from royal duties over the Christmas period. Harry is understood to have private engagements in the UK early next week, with speculation he will then join Meghan and Archie. Senior royal officials are still in the process of thrashing out details of a plan to allow the couple to carve out new roles. The Sussexes want to \u201cstep back\u201d from frontline royal duties, be able to earn an income and become financially independent of the taxpayer. A source said: \u201cNo members of staff have been let go. In quiet periods, staff are often redeployed elsewhere around the estate.\u201d When they made their announcement last week, the Sussexes indicated on their new website that they intended to use Frogmore Cottage, gifted by the Queen and refurbished at a cost of \u00a32.4m to the public purse, as their official residence while in the UK \u201cso that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom\u201d. The Grade II-listed building was converted from five quarters back to a single residence for the couple and their baby son. Reports that staff are being redeployed followed Harry\u2019s first official engagement since the couple\u2019s announcement blindsided Buckingham Palace nine days ago. He conducted the draw for the Rugby League World Cup 2021, with speculation it was his last official engagement in the UK for some time.",

A prohibition lasting between three and five years is seen as a way for Brussels to manage the risks said to be posed by the breakneck speed at which the software is being adopted. The option is contained in an early draft of a European commission white paper obtained by the news website Euractiv. The final version is due to be published in February as part of a wider overhaul of the regulation of artificial intelligence. The draft document points to the right under the general data protection regulation for EU citizens \u201cnot to be subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling\u201d. Under the proposal, a new regulatory framework for artificial intelligence could \u201cinclude a time-limited ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces\u201d. The paper states that the \u201cuse of facial recognition technology by private or public actors in public spaces would be prohibited for a definite period (eg three to five years) during which a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed\u201d. The possibility of driving forward in the field of artificial intelligence is often cited by Brexit enthusiasts as one of the major advantages for the UK as it leaves Brussels\u2019 regulatory orbit.

The coming negotiation over the future relationship will determine how closely the UK will align to EU rules, including on data handling and collection. Facial recognition software is one of the fastest-growing technologies and is becoming a staple of Europe\u2019s private and public surveillance networks. Three UK police forces \u2013 the Met, South Wales and Leicestershire \u2013 are trialling such software as an \u201cinnovative\u201d way to identify people suspected of committing a crime or on watchlists. The German government is planning to roll out facial recognition technology in 134 railway stations and 14 airports after a successful trial in Berlin. France is set to become the first EU country to allow its citizens to access secure government websites through such software. In July, the French parliament recommended a new regulatory framework to allow experimentation. In September, the high court in London ruled that South Wales police acted lawfully and did not breach human rights or data protection laws in its use of facial recognition software. Civil rights organisations have voiced their concern at the speed at which the technology is being adopted. The UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, has urged caution on the use of what it describes as an \u201cintrusive\u201d technology. Last weekend, football supporters and civil rights activists expressed their anger after two surveillance vans equipped with the technology were seen patrolling outside Cardiff City\u2019s stadium before a derby match with Swansea. The campaign group Big Brother Watch organised a protest and a banner was unfurled inside the stadium during the Championship game reading \u201cNo facial recognition\u201d. More broadly, Brussels is looking at a range of options for dealing with the ethical and legal questions posed by artificial intelligence. Under one plan, developers would be asked to follow a voluntary ethical code. They would receive a gold-standard label in return.

So, this week, I wanted to throw you some left-field options to add a few bells and whistles to your repertoire.</p> <p>Most of this week\u2019s recipes are from south and south-east Asia, as that\u2019s where I take most inspiration for my column, <a href=\"http://The new vegan www.theguardian.com/food/series/the-new-vegan\">the New Vegan</a> \u2013 many of the countries and cultures within these regions have happily put plants at the centre of their tables for centuries, on account of religious or economic reasons. Some of these cuisines are extremely well developed, making them a joy to explore and they give me a true sense that I\u2019m never missing out \u2013 unlike the feeling I get when I eat ultra-processed alternative meats.</p> <p>Are you wondering what happens next? Perhaps you will continue eating a vegan diet, like just under half of those who signed up to <a href=\"https://uk.veganuary.com/\">Veganuary</a> reportedly did last year. Or perhaps you\u2019ll just eat more plants as part of a flexitarian diet and be a bit more pro-carrot than you were before.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re now heading into week 4 and I\u2019m sure that if you\u2019ve got this far, you have a handle on how to eat a plant-based diet, from breakfasts and quick pasta dishes to snacks and sweet treats. So, this week, I wanted to throw you some left-field options to add a few bells and whistles to your repertoire. Most of this week\u2019s recipes are from south and south-east Asia, as that\u2019s where I take most inspiration for my column, the New Vegan \u2013 many of the countries and cultures within these regions have happily put plants at the centre of their tables for centuries, on account of religious or economic reasons. Some of these cuisines are extremely well developed, making them a joy to explore and they give me a true sense that I\u2019m never missing out \u2013 unlike the feeling I get when I eat ultra-processed alternative meats. Are you wondering what happens next? Perhaps you will continue eating a vegan diet, like just under half of those who signed up to Veganuary reportedly did last year. Or perhaps you\u2019ll just eat more plants as part of a flexitarian diet and be a bit more pro-carrot than you were before. I hope, if nothing else, you\u2019ll have seen how easy and delicious cooking with plants can be. If that\u2019s the case, my job here is done. Breakfast Travel to Japan via this miso soup with either noodles or rice for breakfast, create some warmth in the belly with Simon Hopkinson\u2019s congee with bok choy \u2013 or tuck into some aloo paratha and pickles, like the Punjabis do. Snacks I\u2019m really enjoying drinks as snacks at the moment. In particular, Taiwanese bubble tea, which isn\u2019t as obscure as you might think. Bubble tea culture has been flourishing in London for years and, it\u2019s easy to make at home if you have these tapioca balls. Henry Dimbleby has a recipe here but if that\u2019s too much of a stretch, this date and banana smoothie looks great (and quick) or, easier still, pour yourself a glass of heavenly Innocent hazelnut milk. Lunch Laab is the unnoficial dish of Laos. Traditionally, it is a meat-based salad with plenty of flavour to tickle all five tastes, but Yotam Ottolenghi has a version using mushroom and peanuts with noodles.

Tuesday, I need speed and I\u2019ll be making these peanut and cucumber noodles, subbing the egg noodles for whole wheat.

The case is closed when the delivery man who brought the cyanide-laced alcohol and soft drinks to the house kills himself, leaving an apparently incriminating note, but Inspector Teru is convinced that he knows the identity of the real culprit. So, apparently, does neighbour Makiko Saiga, who writes a bestselling book about the case, though the \u201cclues\u201d in her narrative are somewhat oblique. We hear from these two and various others, including the sole surviving member of the Aosawa family, mysterious Hisako, 30 years after the murder. Tantalising as a scene glimpsed through a half-open door, this is an utterly immersive puzzler in which nothing is entirely cut and dried.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f50e00972bae09d5807ce5462319ea3f467ba18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f50e00972bae09d5807ce5462319ea3f467ba18/0_0_640_1000/640.jpg\" alt=\"Our Fathers Rebecca Wait\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The past also has a devastating impact on the present in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/our-fathers-9781529400052.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Rebecca Wait\u2019s <strong>Our Fathers</strong></a> (Riverrun, \u00a314.99). Tom Baird returns to the remote Scottish island of his birth, where, more than 20 years earlier, his father John shot his mother Katrina, brother and baby sister before turning the gun on himself. Tom, who was eight at the time, survived by hiding in a wardrobe, and lived with his uncle Malcolm until he was old enough to leave the island. Now, racked with survivor guilt and trapped by the past, he\u2019s looking for answers. Malcolm wants to help, but is weighed down by his own feelings of guilt for not preventing the massacre; rendered inarticulate by an act of such horrific and inexplicable violence, the two men struggle to communicate. A second narrative strand, written from Katrina\u2019s point of view, shows how she came to marry John, the corrosive nature of their relationship, and the inevitability \u2013 \u201cOf course he would kill her\u201d \u2013 of its ending.

For police officer and single mother Mickey Fitzpatrick, it\u2019s not only her beat, but the place where her sister, Kacey, turns tricks in order to fund her addiction. A time-slip narrative describes how drugs have blighted Mickey\u2019s life before \u2013 they killed her mother, and her dad, long disappeared, is presumed dead \u2013 and how, in the present day, a serial killer appears to be targeting sex workers. Although this police-procedural-meets-family-drama is not about the opioid crisis per se, it paints a stark picture of the devastation caused by drug abuse.

      "bodyText": "The ambitious first standalone novel from Steph Cha is a fictional treatment of the 1991 shooting of African American schoolgirl Latasha Harlins by Korean-born shop owner Soon Ja Du. Du suspected the 15-year-old of shoplifting, and her lenient treatment by the court, which caused tension between the two communities, is often cited as one of the causes of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In Your House Will Pay (Faber, \u00a312.99), the action moves between 1991, when black teenager Ava Matthews is killed after an altercation in a Korean convenience store, and 2019, when the wounding of Grace Park\u2019s mother in a drive-by shooting leads to a shocking revelation about her past. Seen through the eyes of both Grace and Ava\u2019s ex-convict brother Shawn, who is trying to put his past behind him, this is a nuanced and convincing portrait of two communities at loggerheads. Cha does not shy away from moral ambiguity as she explores cultural burdens, anger and unintended consequences. The Aosawa Murders by Riku Onda (translated by Alison Watts, Bitter Lemon, \u00a38.99) also deals with the aftermath of a crime: here, it\u2019s the poisoning of 17 people, including children, during a family party in 70s Japan. The case is closed when the delivery man who brought the cyanide-laced alcohol and soft drinks to the house kills himself, leaving an apparently incriminating note, but Inspector Teru is convinced that he knows the identity of the real culprit. So, apparently, does neighbour Makiko Saiga, who writes a bestselling book about the case, though the \u201cclues\u201d in her narrative are somewhat oblique. We hear from these two and various others, including the sole surviving member of the Aosawa family, mysterious Hisako, 30 years after the murder. Tantalising as a scene glimpsed through a half-open door, this is an utterly immersive puzzler in which nothing is entirely cut and dried. The past also has a devastating impact on the present in Rebecca Wait\u2019s Our Fathers (Riverrun, \u00a314.99). Tom Baird returns to the remote Scottish island of his birth, where, more than 20 years earlier, his father John shot his mother Katrina, brother and baby sister before turning the gun on himself. Tom, who was eight at the time, survived by hiding in a wardrobe, and lived with his uncle Malcolm until he was old enough to leave the island. Now, racked with survivor guilt and trapped by the past, he\u2019s looking for answers. Malcolm wants to help, but is weighed down by his own feelings of guilt for not preventing the massacre; rendered inarticulate by an act of such horrific and inexplicable violence, the two men struggle to communicate. A second narrative strand, written from Katrina\u2019s point of view, shows how she came to marry John, the corrosive nature of their relationship, and the inevitability \u2013 \u201cOf course he would kill her\u201d \u2013 of its ending. Wait wisely avoids the temptations of melodrama to create an astonishingly powerful story of toxic masculinity, regret and the possibility of redemption. A far cry from its London namesake, the district of Kensington in Philadelphia \u2013 the setting for Liz Moore\u2019s Long Bright River (Hutchinson, \u00a312.99) \u2013 is the largest market for narcotics on the US\u2019s east coast. For police officer and single mother Mickey Fitzpatrick, it\u2019s not only her beat, but the place where her sister, Kacey, turns tricks in order to fund her addiction. A time-slip narrative describes how drugs have blighted Mickey\u2019s life before \u2013 they killed her mother, and her dad, long disappeared, is presumed dead \u2013 and how, in the present day, a serial killer appears to be targeting sex workers. Although this police-procedural-meets-family-drama is not about the opioid crisis per se, it paints a stark picture of the devastation caused by drug abuse. As Mickey realises the first time that Kacey \u2013 then aged 16 \u2013 is brought back to life with Narcan after an overdose: \u201cNone of them want to be saved. They all want to sink backward toward the earth again, to be swallowed by the ground, to keep sleeping.\u201d After a mostly slow pace, the book\u2019s conclusion feels overly hasty, but strong characters and some truly evocative writing more than make up for it.

It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.</p>\n    <p>It is intended to incentivise passengers to seek alternative arrangements from flying, which is the most carbon-intensive form of transport. By reducing demand for flights, it seeks to decrease carbon emissions from the air industry.</p>\n    <p>Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates \u2013 effectively for economy class, premium economy and business/first-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from \u00a313 in economy to \u00a378 in first class.

      "bodyText": "Flybe has admitted to having secured a \u00a310m tax holiday and confirmed ongoing negotiations over a state loan, as rival airlines stepped up attacks on the government\u2019s rescue of the struggling carrier. The Exeter-based airline said that, contrary to reports, only a small amount of its annual air passenger duty (APD) bill \u2013 believed to be \u00a3106m \u2013 had been deferred, in what it said was a standard arrangement for businesses in difficulty. Flybe said: \u201cA payment plan was agreed with HMRC for a debt of less than \u00a310m. This agreement will only last a matter of months before all taxes and duties are paid in full.\u201d On Thursday, Mark Anderson, the chief executive of Flybe\u2019s parent company, Connect Airways, told staff the airline was seeking a loan on commercial terms from the government, rather than a bailout, according to the BBC. The playing down of the rescue package by Flybe is unlikely to mollify airline competitors, after the Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary accused the UK government of covering up the true terms of the deal to rescue Flybe and threatened to launch legal action at home and in Brussels over what he claims is illegal state aid. The outspoken airline chief said he did not believe the government, which has insisted it has not offered unlawful state aid to the ailing company. He hit out at the refusal by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, to reveal the terms of the rescue deal that was struck on Tuesday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe them and the reason we don\u2019t believe them is they won\u2019t publish the deal,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cFlybe is not a viable business; it never has been. It has lurched from reconstruction to reconstruction and this is the government misusing state funds to discriminate in favour of Flybe. It\u2019s in breach of competition rules, it\u2019s in breach of state aid rules, which is why the government are covering up the deal,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Friday morning. As well as agreeing the deferral of the outstanding APD payments and the possible loan, the government has promised to review APD levels before the March budget, potentially cutting the rate on domestic flights. O\u2019Leary warned that he would take legal action against the UK government at home and in Brussels, unless the deal was revealed or its terms were extended to other airlines. \u201cWe\u2019ve given the chancellor of the exchequer seven days. If he doesn\u2019t publish the deal within seven days or at least extend the same holiday to all of the other UK airlines, so that we can pass it on to our customers as well, I think we launch competition law proceedings in the UK and state aid proceedings against the UK government for breach of state aid rules in Brussels.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments come a day after he wrote to Javid demanding that the government extend any \u201ctax holiday\u201d granted to Flybe to other airlines, and accused them of subsiding the \u201cbillionaire owners\u201d. After the Connect Airways takeover last year, Flybe is ultimately owned by Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic, Stobart and Cyrus Capital. Flybe serves almost two in five domestic UK flights and employs more than 2,000 people. It carries 8.5 million passengers a year and is the main airline at several regional airports, including Belfast, Southampton and Exeter. However, O\u2019Leary said its services were not essential to the UK economy and competitors such as Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways would step in to cover most domestic flights. \u201cThe point is the government can\u2019t keep lending a non-viable airline \u00a3100m every three months to keep non-essential services available,\u201d O\u2019Leary told the BBC. \u201cThe reason Flybe loses money at airports like Exeter and Newquay is because most people use the train or use the motorway.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Like most other political journalists I am struggling to come to terms with the new reality. After three and a half years of intense and, at times, increasingly surreal activity, Westminster has returned to a much slower pace where not a lot is going on. Brexit is now a done deal; there are no knife-edge votes as the government can now do pretty much as it pleases; the Labour party is more focused on choosing a new leader than opposing; and no select committees have yet been established \u2013 partly because no one is yet sure what departmental reorganisations might be in store after 31 January but mainly because the government rather enjoys the lack of scrutiny. Obviously it may all change later in the year, but for now it still comes as a surprise when the highlight of the day is departmental questions. Even so, you still don\u2019t have to look too hard for signs of grubbiness. Today I watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/13/nicky-morgans-journey-of-forgetfulness-leads-her-to-seat-in-lords\">Nicky Morgan and Zac Goldsmith get togged up in ermine</a> for their introduction to the House of Lords. The Nicky Morgan who said she could never serve in a Boris Johnson government, told her constituents she was standing down to spend more time with her family, told journalists that she definitely had not been offered a job or a peerage during the election campaign and is now a cabinet minister subject to no democratic accountability. The Zac Goldsmith who once petitioned for voters to be allowed to recall MPs they don\u2019t like and is now back in government having been kicked out of parliament by his Richmond Park constituency. They must both have been absolutely desperate for a title. Personally I don\u2019t see the attraction. Then I\u2019m not a politician.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>There are some questions that are best left unanswered. Like just who are these people who have bought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop\">Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s \u00a358 vagina scented candles</a> in such quantities that they have now sold out. Like to what lengths a parfumier had to go to ensure the right top notes of geranium had been found to replicate the smell of Gwynnie\u2019s vagina. But the by now infamous candles have opened up an intriguing possibility. For some years now it\u2019s been taken as read that Paltrow is a member of a vacuous Hollywood elite, who has far too much time and money with which to indulge any new age nonsense with a po-faced total seriousness. But now I\u2019m coming round to the idea that she has been trolling us all along. The reality is that she\u2019s got a fantastic sense of humour. All the time we\u2019ve been laughing at the \u00a330 Martini Emotional Bath Soak or the \u00a328 G-Day Ginger and Ashwagandha (me neither) Energy Body Wash, Gwynnie has been laughing right back at us because her Goop empire is now worth an estimated $250m. She actually doesn\u2019t believe in any of this and the candles were only intended as a joke to see what she could get away with. Take it from me, this Christmas\u2019s top seller will be a \u00a310,000 total immersion in Gwynnie\u2019s amniotic fluid where you get to replicate the sense of security of being inside her womb. And I\u2019ve taken no chances and have decided to copy her business model by patenting an aftershave smelling of my rancid gym kit. Eau de Coq Pour Homme. Yours for just \u00a375.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"793a7580e6bd2169aaa078a9372752e7c0c43fbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/793a7580e6bd2169aaa078a9372752e7c0c43fbd/0_75_4304_2582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry hosts the Rugby League World Cup draws at Buckingham Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Just wait for my scented candle range.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research has found that you are likely to be at your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/14/out-of-nowhere-i-felt-really-sad-readers-on-how-they-felt-at-47\">most miserable at the age of 47.2</a>. Having long since passed this age and been fairly miserable for most of my life I can\u2019t write with too much personal experience, but it feels more or less accurate. My late 40s were roughly the time I realised I could no longer claim to have \u201cpotential\u201d and that I was almost certain to always remain something of a disappointment to myself. Also, it was around that age that I think I finally accepted I wasn\u2019t immortal. For a long time in my 40s and early 50s, I was a terrible hypochondriac. Any symptom I got, I would instantly self-diagnose as something potentially fatal. By my own delusional reckoning, I must have had cancer dozens of times and would spend hours at the surgery pleading for ever more invasive tests. My doctor must have dreaded seeing my name on his list. At its worst my hypochondria got so bad, I no longer imagined diseases for which there was any easy diagnosis and fixated on ones for which there was no possible cure. That way there was no possible end to the anxiety and sleeplessness. An episode of imagined BSE landed me in a psychiatric ward. But over the last 10 years or so, my hypochondria has eased off. As if part of me has come to terms with the idea that one day I will get a fatal illness but until then a cough is just a cough until proved otherwise. Whether I\u2019ll be so sanguine when I do get really ill remains to be seen. Obviously it goes without saying that I am just as anxious as I always was. Just that I now worry more about things other than dying. Like my embedded sense of impending failure and futility. Which, on a good day, feels like an improvement.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>The hysteria surrounding Meghan and Harry\u2019s decision to become part-time royals shows no sign of letting up, with all the tabloids \u2013 and some of the broadsheets \u2013 devoting pages and pages each day to stories that are usually based on one unnamed source who might or might not have some intel on the subject. Often the stories on one page seem to contradict the one on the page before. It\u2019s almost as if the editors know that 80% of their coverage is complete nonsense, but have no idea which of their stories are in the 20% that might have a kernel of truth. So they print the lot on the basis you can never have too many royal stories and it\u2019s best to cover all the bases in case another paper scoops them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/queen-gives-reluctant-blessing-to-harry-and-meghans-plans\">With Megxit being more or less a done deal</a> with merely the details (good luck with that) to be sorted, much of the focus this week has been on comparisons between Meghan and Kate. Whatever Meghan does, she gets it in the neck. A visit to a women\u2019s refuge in Vancouver was reported as a cynical attempt to manipulate the media into getting more positive coverage and a sign of a complete lack of gratitude from a foreigner who was fortunate enough to be allowed to marry into the British royal family. Meanwhile Kate only has to get out of a car without falling over to get a double page spread on how the fact she was prepared to walk 10 metres under an umbrella to a public engagement is a mark of her sense of duty and undying devotion to the Queen. Bizarrely, I reckon Meghan might be the one counting her blessings. As each day passes she must be more convinced than ever she has made the right decision to detach herself. On the other hand, Kate must know she has decades more of this to come. When the media gets fed up \u2013 as it surely will \u2013 with hounding Meghan, it is bound at some point to turn its poison on Kate again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e92d7b29893a9ec010842673fd552a83f2e067a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e92d7b29893a9ec010842673fd552a83f2e067a/0_149_2277_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen is driven away from a church service at Sandringham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sod it.

The whole episode has been a farce of Boris Johnson\u2019s own making. Prior to this week, only Nigel Farage and a few hardcore Brexiters had given much thought to whether Big Ben should ring or not. And even then only half-heartedly as the Elizabeth Tower has been undergoing major renovation works and the bell has been out of action for years. But in a TV interview, Boris started making up policy on the hoof by saying it might be possible for the public to raise \u00a3500k to get the bell ringing for a few minutes. Almost immediately the few sensible people inside No 10 tried to kill off the idea \u2013 not only does the government not want to appear too triumphalist and divisive in its celebration, it also appears to be illegal to raise money in this way \u2013 but by then some Brexit enthusiasts, led by the Tory MP Mark Francois, had already launched an appeal that has already raised over \u00a3100K from the public. It\u2019s a classic Boris own goal and doesn\u2019t say much for the state of the country. First that so many are prepared to shell out for a bell \u2013 why not just play a recording if you\u2019re desperate: it\u2019s not as if more than a few thousand people would actually hear Big Ben live anyway \u2013 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/15/gyula-remes-died-on-parliaments-doorstep-was-the-outcry-of-mps-just-for-show\">homeless people are dying in the tube subway just beneath it</a>. Second that Big Ben makes front page news when the government\u2019s attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/15/matt-hancock-accident-emergency-nhs-waiting-targets-likely-scrapped\">scrap the A&amp;E targets</a> that it consistently misses barely rates a mention.</p> <p><strong>Digested week: Bung a Bob for Big Ben Bongs</strong></p>",

The whole episode has been a farce of Boris Johnson\u2019s own making. Prior to this week, only Nigel Farage and a few hardcore Brexiters had given much thought to whether Big Ben should ring or not. And even then only half-heartedly as the Elizabeth Tower has been undergoing major renovation works and the bell has been out of action for years. But in a TV interview, Boris started making up policy on the hoof by saying it might be possible for the public to raise \u00a3500k to get the bell ringing for a few minutes. Almost immediately the few sensible people inside No 10 tried to kill off the idea \u2013 not only does the government not want to appear too triumphalist and divisive in its celebration, it also appears to be illegal to raise money in this way \u2013 but by then some Brexit enthusiasts, led by the Tory MP Mark Francois, had already launched an appeal that has already raised over \u00a3100K from the public. It\u2019s a classic Boris own goal and doesn\u2019t say much for the state of the country. First that so many are prepared to shell out for a bell \u2013 why not just play a recording if you\u2019re desperate: it\u2019s not as if more than a few thousand people would actually hear Big Ben live anyway \u2013 when homeless people are dying in the tube subway just beneath it. Second that Big Ben makes front page news when the government\u2019s attempts to scrap the A&amp;E targets that it consistently misses barely rates a mention.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>According to the ONS, all sectors of the retail trade, except stores selling household goods, and petrol stations, recorded a decline in sales.</p> \n<p>Spending on food fell by 1.3% in December, the biggest monthly decline for four years.</p> \n<p>The quantity of goods bought in department stores continued a downward trend, with a monthly slide of 1.8%, reflecting difficulties facing well known chains including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/06/high-street-crisis-big-names-job-losses-store-closures\">Debenhams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/12/beales-department-store-chain-close-to-collapse\">Beales</a>.

The Office for National Statistics said retail sales failed to rise for a record fifth month in a row in December as household spending in high street shops and online plunged by 0.6% from the previous month. Sounding the alarm over the health of the economy at the end of last year as Brexit uncertainty weighed on growth, the ONS said sales had not risen on a monthly basis since July, the longest period since records began in 1996. Consumer spending over the final three months of the year fell by 1% compared with the previous quarter, while sales growth for the year dropped to 0.9%, below all estimates made by City economists in a Reuters poll. The latest snapshot comes after retailers said 2019 was the worst year for sales in a quarter of a century and follows several dire festive trading updates from major high street chains, including John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer. Ryan Broomfield, a partner and retail specialist at the accountancy firm RSM, said: \u201cShoppers will have noticed the impact of store vacancies in retail parks and town centres, notably in areas which have lost large department stores and with further closures expected in 2020.\u201d The retail sales slump fuelled mounting speculation in the City for an immediate interest rate cut when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next on 30 January.

Spending on food fell by 1.3% in December, the biggest monthly decline for four years. The quantity of goods bought in department stores continued a downward trend, with a monthly slide of 1.8%, reflecting difficulties facing well known chains including Debenhams and Beales. Thousands of jobs have been cut in retail in the past year, as weaker consumer spending and rising costs have damaged company profits. Jake Berry, the high streets minister, said the government was acting to support troubled retailers by cutting business rates for small firms and investing \u00a33.6bn in town centres. \u201cWe absolutely recognise that rapidly changing shopping habits are a challenge for high streets across the country,\u201d he added. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing stood at 19% in December, up from 18.6% the previous month, as consumers increasingly shift away from spending money on the high street to do their shopping online. Consumer spending had been helping to support continued growth in the British economy since the EU referendum three years ago, buoyed by record employment levels and rising wage growth.

The man said: \u201cI had to spend one year and two months in hiding after the Home Office returned me to Sudan because it was too dangerous to go out. When I went to the airport in Khartoum hoping to board a flight and saw all the weapons flying around when the Sudanese soldiers and security intelligence officials were fighting each other I was very frightened and didn\u2019t know if I would make it back to the UK.\u201d Sonja Miley,a co-executive director of the charity Waging Peace, which campaigns against human rights abuses in Sudan, welcomed the man\u2019s return to the UK. \u201cIt was very exciting and emotional to see him return,\u201d she said: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling to have him back here. We were in touch with him for about a year and a half in the UK before the Home Office removed him to Sudan and maintained contact when possible to do so, while he was in hiding in Sudan.\u201d The man\u2019s solicitor, Jamie Bell, of Duncan Lewis, said: \u201cThe Home Office had clear evidence of this man\u2019s ethnicity but chose to ignore it. It was with great joy that we welcomed him back to Heathrow yesterday. He and his supporters had fought a 14-month battle for his return since the dreadful mistake to remove him in October 2018.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK only ever returns those who both we and the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain in the UK.\u201d",

Everything from nuclear war to the utter collapse of American democracy looms large in the imaginations of otherwise sober-minded people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/17/trump-impeachment-trial-live-news-senate-sanders-warren-2020-election-latest-updates\">Warren and Sanders appear to move on following debate tensions \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In truth, the damage may be less immediately obvious. Life, in many ways, would go on. But the planet we inhabit will continue to heat up, and the most powerful government on Earth would be doing everything it can to further destabilize the environment around us. Just after the new year, the Trump administration announced it planned to radically revise the National Environmental Policy Act, a landmark measure that forced federal infrastructure projects to take into account their impact on the environment. Under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/09/white-house-projects-permits-climate-impact-plan\">rewritten rules</a>, builders of highways, pipelines, and other major infrastructure projects would no longer have to consider climate change when assessing their impact.</p> <p>It is, without question, one of the most grievous blows Trump has inflicted since taking office three years ago. It follows more than 100 environmental rollbacks, including relaxing rules limiting emissions from coal plants and weakening protections for endangered species.</p> <p>Fossil fuel projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline would have free rein, undaunted by court challenges that ruled the Trump administration didn\u2019t properly consider climate change when analyzing the pipeline\u2019s impact. The new rules would dramatically narrow which projects would require environmental review, with many infrastructure initiatives sailing through the approval process without having to disclose plans to discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.</p> <p>The new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the \u201ccumulative\u201d consequences of new infrastructure, a requirement interpreted as a mandate to study the effects of ruinous greenhouse gas emission and rising sea levels. The act currently requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have major environmental effects.</p> <p>It was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who enacted the law in 1970 after the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire and a tanker spilled 3m gallons of crude off the coast of California. Though Nixon was a perpetual villain for leftists of the era, he created the Environmental Protection Agency, developing the crucial regulations under attack today. Even conservatives at the time acknowledged that the government had a role to play in being stewards of the environment we all share.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/climate-science-deniers-environment-warning\">'There are no excuses left': why climate science deniers are running out of rope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are in a new, terrifying age.

      "bodyText": "What are the consequences of a second term of Donald Trump? To even consider the question sends the left-leaning mind into a paroxysm. Everything from nuclear war to the utter collapse of American democracy looms large in the imaginations of otherwise sober-minded people. In truth, the damage may be less immediately obvious. Life, in many ways, would go on. But the planet we inhabit will continue to heat up, and the most powerful government on Earth would be doing everything it can to further destabilize the environment around us. Just after the new year, the Trump administration announced it planned to radically revise the National Environmental Policy Act, a landmark measure that forced federal infrastructure projects to take into account their impact on the environment. Under the rewritten rules, builders of highways, pipelines, and other major infrastructure projects would no longer have to consider climate change when assessing their impact. It is, without question, one of the most grievous blows Trump has inflicted since taking office three years ago. It follows more than 100 environmental rollbacks, including relaxing rules limiting emissions from coal plants and weakening protections for endangered species. Fossil fuel projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline would have free rein, undaunted by court challenges that ruled the Trump administration didn\u2019t properly consider climate change when analyzing the pipeline\u2019s impact. The new rules would dramatically narrow which projects would require environmental review, with many infrastructure initiatives sailing through the approval process without having to disclose plans to discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution. The new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the \u201ccumulative\u201d consequences of new infrastructure, a requirement interpreted as a mandate to study the effects of ruinous greenhouse gas emission and rising sea levels. The act currently requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have major environmental effects. It was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who enacted the law in 1970 after the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire and a tanker spilled 3m gallons of crude off the coast of California. Though Nixon was a perpetual villain for leftists of the era, he created the Environmental Protection Agency, developing the crucial regulations under attack today. Even conservatives at the time acknowledged that the government had a role to play in being stewards of the environment we all share. We are in a new, terrifying age. Trump\u2019s Republican party is far more savagely conservative than any version that came before it. It\u2019s important to understand that the shredding of environmental regulations is not something that would have been unique to a Trump presidency, unlike his Twitter inanities or nonstop campaign rallies.

Meanwhile, according to our friends at Information is Beautiful, the number of mountain gorillas has tripled in the last two decades. What we liked WoW! news is a new European operation producing solutions-type news for children in both English and French. You can sign up for the WoW revolution here. We also liked this brainy article in Nature about \u201csystems thinking\u201d. We should all do more of it, probably. What we heard Dr Tove Skutnabb-Kangas wrote in with a recommendation from Sweden: The Swedish daily ETC, which describes itself as a red-green newspaper, is the first newspaper in the Nordic countries that does NOT accept any ads that are related to any fossils. It is a fantastic newspaper \u2013 but they don\u2019t only have a newspaper; they do masses of other things, with solar energy, building, book publishing, etc etc. Please check! It is one of the best things in Sweden. Worth leaning Swedish for, perhaps \u2026 Wolfgang Jabs meanwhile had a suggestion following our piece last week about Bangladesh\u2019s response to climate change. Can you look at ways in which buildings \u2013 houses \u2013 are being adjusted to rising sea levels? Have people in low-lying/flood-prone areas begun to build on stilts/create artificial hills/built floating homes, adopted techniques from oceanic parts of Asia? We did a piece on this last year, but certainly worth returning to \u2026 Where was the Upside? In Australia, where the rains finally came. Thanks for reading. What else? Where should the Upside direct its formidable resources next? Let us know. If you have few ideas but lots of cash, do help support the work that goes into the Upside with a modest single or recurring contribution to the Guardian.",

      "body": "<p>My brother, Tom, and I were never close. He was two years older than me. I don\u2019t know why, but my parents sheltered him. They were farmers and we lived in Kansas with three older half-siblings. All us kids were in competition for their attention.</p> <p>I moved out at 18 and found work at a local dairy farm where they were willing to teach me. My parents and Tom lived five miles away but I didn\u2019t visit much. By the time I was 23, I was living with my wife and our two young sons. We\u2019d been married three years but the relationship was rocky. That August, my wife\u2019s sister, Camille, who was 14, moved in with us.</p> <p>One Friday evening in November, I was at work when my mother-in-law called asking if I\u2019d seen Camille. I told her I hadn\u2019t and she could check our house. Camille wasn\u2019t there. That night we made calls and drove around, but there was no sign of her. Night turned into day and our dread grew. We searched and passed out flyers. </p> <p>On Monday morning, we were home when the police said they\u2019d found her body. They told us they\u2019d arrested a murder suspect and it was my brother. He\u2019d turned himself in, saying he\u2019d shot her. I felt like someone had taken a plank of wood and hit me in the chest.</p> <p>We were in shock and mourning. A couple of days later, a detective asked me to do a polygraph test. I went willingly, but afterwards was told I\u2019d failed the test and my brother had passed; I didn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>I was put in jail. I wasn\u2019t allowed to call anyone and it was my first night away from my sons. For three days I was left in a cell. I was numb, walking around in confusion. I tried sleeping but it was so cold. I was given food but no one talked to me. I felt crazy.</p> <p>They moved me into a communal cell and gave me an attorney who kept saying he\u2019d be in touch. I saw on the news that my brother had been released. The whole thing was the final straw for my marriage and my wife filed for divorce.</p> <p>My parents visited but avoided the reason I was there. I told my mum: \u201cMum, I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d and she said, \u201cWell, I know Tom didn\u2019t do it.\u201d She added that I\u2019d be blaming my dad next.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Six months later I was put on trial.

      "bodyText": "My brother, Tom, and I were never close. He was two years older than me. I don\u2019t know why, but my parents sheltered him. They were farmers and we lived in Kansas with three older half-siblings. All us kids were in competition for their attention. I moved out at 18 and found work at a local dairy farm where they were willing to teach me. My parents and Tom lived five miles away but I didn\u2019t visit much. By the time I was 23, I was living with my wife and our two young sons. We\u2019d been married three years but the relationship was rocky. That August, my wife\u2019s sister, Camille, who was 14, moved in with us. One Friday evening in November, I was at work when my mother-in-law called asking if I\u2019d seen Camille. I told her I hadn\u2019t and she could check our house. Camille wasn\u2019t there. That night we made calls and drove around, but there was no sign of her. Night turned into day and our dread grew. We searched and passed out flyers. On Monday morning, we were home when the police said they\u2019d found her body. They told us they\u2019d arrested a murder suspect and it was my brother. He\u2019d turned himself in, saying he\u2019d shot her. I felt like someone had taken a plank of wood and hit me in the chest. We were in shock and mourning. A couple of days later, a detective asked me to do a polygraph test. I went willingly, but afterwards was told I\u2019d failed the test and my brother had passed; I didn\u2019t understand. I was put in jail. I wasn\u2019t allowed to call anyone and it was my first night away from my sons. For three days I was left in a cell. I was numb, walking around in confusion. I tried sleeping but it was so cold. I was given food but no one talked to me. I felt crazy. They moved me into a communal cell and gave me an attorney who kept saying he\u2019d be in touch. I saw on the news that my brother had been released. The whole thing was the final straw for my marriage and my wife filed for divorce. My parents visited but avoided the reason I was there. I told my mum: \u201cMum, I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d and she said, \u201cWell, I know Tom didn\u2019t do it.\u201d She added that I\u2019d be blaming my dad next. Six months later I was put on trial. My brother had withdrawn his confession and my parents testified that, at the time of the murder, he was home with them, sleeping. I can\u2019t describe how much that hurt. They didn\u2019t look at me. Not all my alibi witnesses were called. When the jury found me guilty, I bawled my head off. I was sentenced to life. I was so angry towards the prosecutor, the detectives, Tom, my parents. I had bouts of depression in prison. Christmas and birthdays were hardest. But I met a lot of good people who believed me.

      "body": "<p><strong>The book I\u2019m currently reading</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-tall-history-of-sugar-9781786898579.html\" title=\"\">A Tall History of Sugar</a></em> by Curdella Forbes. Set in mid-20th century Jamaica, it tells the story of Moshe Fisher, a boy adopted after being discovered in a basket as a baby, who falls in love with his best friend, Arrienne. The premise \u2013 Moshe was born with skin that can\u2019t be classified as either black or white \u2013 is ingenious, and the novel is an epic modern fairytale that offers the pleasure of being steeped in Forbes\u2019s poetic, intoxicating sentences right from the opening line: \u201cLong ago, when teachers were sent from Britain to teach in the grammar schools of the West Indian colonies (it was Great Britain then, not Little England as it is now, after Brexit, and the fall of the empire).\u201d</p> <p><strong>The book I wish I\u2019d written</strong><br>The surest way to spoil your enjoyment of a book is by writing it, so I\u2019ll just be glad I got to read all those masterpieces rather than having to write them.</p> <p><strong>The book I think is most underrated</strong><br>I have long admired James Baldwin\u2019s essays yet I was guilty of underrating his novels until I read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-garth-greenwell-60th-anniversary-gay-novel\" title=\"\">Giovanni\u2019s Room</a></em>. It\u2019s a perfect love story, not least because it\u2019s tragic.</p> <p><strong>The book that </strong><strong>had the greatest influence on me</strong><br>Toni Morrison\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/08/fiction.tonimorrison\" title=\"\">Beloved</a></em>. If I hadn\u2019t read it as a teenager I would never have dared to write. It wasn\u2019t just the instant urge to attempt my own imitations of Morrison\u2019s style, but the fact that I didn\u2019t think black women could ever be taken seriously as writers until her work reshaped the possibilities, demonstrating that our \u201cspecific\u201d could indeed become universal. Bernardine Evaristo is doing a similar thing now.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me cry</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/01/nina-x-ewan-morrison-review\" title=\"\">Nina X</a></em> by Ewan Morrison. A deep, cathartic, last\u2011page sob.</p> <p><strong>The last book that made me laugh</strong><br>Ali Wong\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dear-girls-9781838850562.html\" title=\"\">Dear Girls</a></em>, filthy and funny in equal measure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Good essays give all the joy of being electrified by clever conversation, minus the social anxiety</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The book I couldn\u2019t finish</strong><br>I can\u2019t even start James Joyce\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/13/is-james-joyce-ulysses-the-hardest-novel-to-finish\" title=\"\">Ulysses</a></em>, let alone finish it. Stately, plump Buck Mulligan comes downstairs bearing his bowl of lather \u2026 and I\u2019m out.</p> <p><strong>The book I\u2019m ashamed not to have read</strong><br><em>Middlemarch</em> by George Eliot. Every so often I slink back to it but I always give up after a few pages. </p> <p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br>Crying in a corner of the living room because the little match girl of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s short story had died. I remember feeling stunned that such a terrible thing could have happened. I had only encountered fairytales with happy endings before then; that story was my introduction to the real world, with its capricious, corroding griefs.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read</strong><br>Good essays give all the joy of being electrified by clever conversation, minus the social anxiety. When in need of that kind of comfort I\u2019ll reach for anything by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebeccasolnit\" title=\"\">Rebecca Solnit</a>, Zadie Smith, Nora Ephron, Roxane Gay, Samantha Irby, to name a few. I\u2019m also a sucker for a love story, especially if it\u2019s written by Josie Silver, Marian Keyes or Jojo Moyes.</p> <p><strong>The book I give as a gift</strong><br>For children it will usually be <em>Goodnight Moon </em>by Margaret Wise Brown, a Pippi Longstocking story, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird </em>by Harper Lee, or Jane Austen\u2019s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton (Viking) has won this year\u2019s Costa first novel award.

      "bodyText": "The book I\u2019m currently reading A Tall History of Sugar by Curdella Forbes. Set in mid-20th century Jamaica, it tells the story of Moshe Fisher, a boy adopted after being discovered in a basket as a baby, who falls in love with his best friend, Arrienne. The premise \u2013 Moshe was born with skin that can\u2019t be classified as either black or white \u2013 is ingenious, and the novel is an epic modern fairytale that offers the pleasure of being steeped in Forbes\u2019s poetic, intoxicating sentences right from the opening line: \u201cLong ago, when teachers were sent from Britain to teach in the grammar schools of the West Indian colonies (it was Great Britain then, not Little England as it is now, after Brexit, and the fall of the empire).\u201d The book I wish I\u2019d written The surest way to spoil your enjoyment of a book is by writing it, so I\u2019ll just be glad I got to read all those masterpieces rather than having to write them. The book I think is most underrated I have long admired James Baldwin\u2019s essays yet I was guilty of underrating his novels until I read Giovanni\u2019s Room. It\u2019s a perfect love story, not least because it\u2019s tragic. The book that had the greatest influence on me Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved. If I hadn\u2019t read it as a teenager I would never have dared to write. It wasn\u2019t just the instant urge to attempt my own imitations of Morrison\u2019s style, but the fact that I didn\u2019t think black women could ever be taken seriously as writers until her work reshaped the possibilities, demonstrating that our \u201cspecific\u201d could indeed become universal. Bernardine Evaristo is doing a similar thing now. The last book that made me cry Nina X by Ewan Morrison. A deep, cathartic, last\u2011page sob. The last book that made me laugh Ali Wong\u2019s Dear Girls, filthy and funny in equal measure. The book I couldn\u2019t finish I can\u2019t even start James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, let alone finish it. Stately, plump Buck Mulligan comes downstairs bearing his bowl of lather \u2026 and I\u2019m out. The book I\u2019m ashamed not to have read Middlemarch by George Eliot. Every so often I slink back to it but I always give up after a few pages. My earliest reading memory Crying in a corner of the living room because the little match girl of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s short story had died. I remember feeling stunned that such a terrible thing could have happened. I had only encountered fairytales with happy endings before then; that story was my introduction to the real world, with its capricious, corroding griefs. My comfort read Good essays give all the joy of being electrified by clever conversation, minus the social anxiety. When in need of that kind of comfort I\u2019ll reach for anything by Rebecca Solnit, Zadie Smith, Nora Ephron, Roxane Gay, Samantha Irby, to name a few. I\u2019m also a sucker for a love story, especially if it\u2019s written by Josie Silver, Marian Keyes or Jojo Moyes. The book I give as a gift For children it will usually be Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown, a Pippi Longstocking story, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, or Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice. \u2022 Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton (Viking) has won this year\u2019s Costa first novel award.

      "body": "<p>Ivan Passer, who has died aged 86, was one of the new wave of Czech film directors who emerged during the social and cultural democratisation of the mid-60s that afforded them unprecedented artistic freedom. With his childhood friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/milos-forman-obituary\" title=\"\">Milo\u0161 Forman</a>, Passer co-wrote A Blonde in Love (1965, released as Loves of a Blonde in the US) and The Firemen\u2019s Ball (1967), and directed Intimate Lighting (1965), his brilliant feature film debut.</p> <p>In that short period, Passer, Forman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/14/vera-chytilova\" title=\"\">Vera Chytilov\u00e1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/09/1\" title=\"\">Jir\u00ed Menzel</a> and Jan N\u011bmec, among others, made films that rejected the official state socialist-realist aesthetic and produced eclectic, highly assured features that captured the world\u2019s attention.</p> <p>The \u201cCzech film miracle\u201d reached its peak when the reformist politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/alexander-dubcek-czech-republic-slovakia-1991\" title=\"\">Alexander Dub\u010dek</a> became first secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist party in January 1968 and continued until August, when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, ending the Prague spring. When Intimate Lighting and The Firemen\u2019s Ball were banned, the two directors decided to seek exile in the US.</p> <p>After some years of struggle, Forman made it big in Hollywood, but Passer\u2019s American career remained patchy. He made two masterpieces, Born to Win (1971), a sensitive and realistic film about drugs, and the film noir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/04/cutters-way-is-a-cinematic-masterpiece\" title=\"\">Cutter\u2019s Way</a> (1981). Although these were his best, they were the darkest in a body of work in which comedy and satire predominated.</p> <p>Born in Prague, Passer grew up under Nazi occupation. He was eight when his father was sent to a labour camp. As his mother had joined the resistance, Passer was brought up by his grandfather. He was in his teens when Czechoslovakia became a communist state. He was expelled from high school three months before graduation for being an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d. After spending a year travelling around Czechoslovakia, he was accepted at <a href=\"https://www.famu.cz/en/\" title=\"\">Famu</a>, the celebrated national film and TV school in Prague, on the basis of a couple of scripts he had written on his travels.</p> <p>Forman and Passer, fellow students, got together to discuss how \u201cin this godforsaken country\u201d they could make good movies. \u201cWe took a piece of paper and we wrote down several points like \u2018it should be a comedy\u2019, because the Communist party and the censorship were more tolerant with comedies,\u201d Passer recalled. Rather than shooting in a studio, they would film in the streets, \u201cbecause they would not look over our shoulder that much\u201d. They decided to use non-actors and natural light.</p> <p>Passer\u2019s first film, using these precepts, was a 20-minute short, A Boring Afternoon (1964), \u201cabout all the things that happen when, ostensibly, nothing is happening\u201d. This wry observation of human characteristics was further explored in Intimate Lighting, about a professional cellist who comes to a provincial town with his fiancee (played by Vera Kresadlov\u00e1, Forman\u2019s wife) to visit old friends. They eat, drink, play music and reminisce. It seems inconceivable that this tender, well-observed, almost plotless comedy should have been banned for 20 years. Passer believed that the party was worried when it saw ordinary people, with all their weaknesses and strengths, depicted on screen, and also that it preferred to be attacked directly than to be ignored completely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87c997a833d15ef667ebc8d643b7f9dc3a7aa3cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87c997a833d15ef667ebc8d643b7f9dc3a7aa3cf/0_314_1847_1108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Heard in Cutter\u2019s Way, 1981, directed by Ivan Passer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Heard in Cutter\u2019s Way, 1981, directed by Ivan Passer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artists/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a couple of years trying to survive in New York, Passer was able to bring his gentle humour to bear on the world of the city\u2019s junkies in his US debut Born to Win, though its blend of European and American sensibilities disoriented many critics at the time. The film followed JJ (played by George Segal), an ex-hairdresser needing $100 a day for his heroin habit, his buddy Billy (Jay Fletcher), who helps him get his supply, a kooky hanger-on (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/09/karen-black\" title=\"\">Karen Black</a>) and a detective played by an emergent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro\" title=\"\">Robert De Niro</a>. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about drugs, so I learned a lot of new things,\u201d Passer said. \u201cIt interested me because here in the country of freedom \u2013 for me who came from a country of restricted freedom \u2013 there are these people who voluntarily give their freedom away, and are enslaved by drugs. That fascinated me.\u201d</p> <p>Law and Disorder (1974), his second US film, was an insightful and amusing satire on the decline of neighbourhood life in which Carroll O\u2019Connor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/09/ernest-borgnine-obituary\" title=\"\">Ernest Borgnine</a> set about organising a vigilante force to combat the rising tide of crime. However, the film suffered from the sudden shift of tone towards the end. \u201cThe audience was laughing all the time, suddenly this guy was killed and the audience was stunned,\u201d Passer said. \u201cI learned that you should never do that.\u201d</p> <p>Passer found it hard to get personal ventures off the ground, and had to do his best with mediocre material such as the slight comedy Crime and Passion (1976), in which a shady investment banker (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/10/omar-sharif\" title=\"\">Omar Sharif</a>) convinces his lover/secretary (Black) to marry a tycoon to whom he is heavily in debt. Silver Bears (1978), about a scam involving an Iranian silver mine, remained unconvincing despite its elegant cast \u2013 Michael Caine, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-martin-balsam-1318926.html\" title=\"\">Martin Balsam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/15/louis-jourdan\" title=\"\">Louis Jourdan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/27/stephane-audran-obituary\" title=\"\">St\u00e9phane Audran</a> and Cybill Shepherd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e778d104c6247235d054b6552d44eade6e5622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e778d104c6247235d054b6552d44eade6e5622/0_108_2719_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roshan Seth, left, as Beria and Robert Duvall as Stalin in Ivan Passer\u2019s film Stalin, 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roshan Seth, left, as Beria and Robert Duvall as Stalin in Ivan Passer\u2019s film Stalin, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Novofilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His most cohesive movie, Cutter\u2019s Way, a subversive, paranoid thriller that questions American values and myths, tells of an injured Vietnam vet, Alex Cutter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/23/john-heard-obituary\" title=\"\">John Heard</a>), seeking revenge on a local California bigwig, whom he suspects of having murdered a teenage girl. Heard, Lisa Eichhorn as his alcoholic wife, and Jeff Bridges as his friend Bone, give fervid performances. According to Passer, Cutter\u2019s Way was \u201ca damaging account of a nation that has lost its final illusions in the Vietnam war and of a society eaten away by corruption.\u201d</p> <p>It took some years for Cutter\u2019s Way to be appreciated. In the meantime, Passer continued to turn out quirky movies such as Creator (1985), a jumbled comedy-drama starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/peter-o-toole-dies-81\" title=\"\">Peter O\u2019Toole</a>, and Haunted Summer (1988), a portrayal of the meeting between Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Godwin and John Polidori in Italy in 1816. There was a return to form in another biographical drama, Stalin (1992) starring, Robert Duvall as the Soviet dictator.</p> <p>In 2004 Passer started to direct Nomad: The Warrior, an epic set in 18th-century Kazakhstan. Due to financial and weather problems on location, the film shut down halfway through. It was then bought by the producer brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who replaced Passer with Sergei Bodrov, and released it the following year.</p> <p>Passer is survived by his second wife, Anne, and by a son, Ivan, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Ivan Passer, film director, born 10 July 1933; died 9 January 2020</p>",

He made two masterpieces, Born to Win (1971), a sensitive and realistic film about drugs, and the film noir Cutter\u2019s Way (1981). Although these were his best, they were the darkest in a body of work in which comedy and satire predominated. Born in Prague, Passer grew up under Nazi occupation. He was eight when his father was sent to a labour camp. As his mother had joined the resistance, Passer was brought up by his grandfather. He was in his teens when Czechoslovakia became a communist state. He was expelled from high school three months before graduation for being an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d. After spending a year travelling around Czechoslovakia, he was accepted at Famu, the celebrated national film and TV school in Prague, on the basis of a couple of scripts he had written on his travels. Forman and Passer, fellow students, got together to discuss how \u201cin this godforsaken country\u201d they could make good movies. \u201cWe took a piece of paper and we wrote down several points like \u2018it should be a comedy\u2019, because the Communist party and the censorship were more tolerant with comedies,\u201d Passer recalled. Rather than shooting in a studio, they would film in the streets, \u201cbecause they would not look over our shoulder that much\u201d. They decided to use non-actors and natural light. Passer\u2019s first film, using these precepts, was a 20-minute short, A Boring Afternoon (1964), \u201cabout all the things that happen when, ostensibly, nothing is happening\u201d. This wry observation of human characteristics was further explored in Intimate Lighting, about a professional cellist who comes to a provincial town with his fiancee (played by Vera Kresadlov\u00e1, Forman\u2019s wife) to visit old friends. They eat, drink, play music and reminisce. It seems inconceivable that this tender, well-observed, almost plotless comedy should have been banned for 20 years. Passer believed that the party was worried when it saw ordinary people, with all their weaknesses and strengths, depicted on screen, and also that it preferred to be attacked directly than to be ignored completely. After a couple of years trying to survive in New York, Passer was able to bring his gentle humour to bear on the world of the city\u2019s junkies in his US debut Born to Win, though its blend of European and American sensibilities disoriented many critics at the time. The film followed JJ (played by George Segal), an ex-hairdresser needing $100 a day for his heroin habit, his buddy Billy (Jay Fletcher), who helps him get his supply, a kooky hanger-on (Karen Black) and a detective played by an emergent Robert De Niro. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about drugs, so I learned a lot of new things,\u201d Passer said. \u201cIt interested me because here in the country of freedom \u2013 for me who came from a country of restricted freedom \u2013 there are these people who voluntarily give their freedom away, and are enslaved by drugs. That fascinated me.\u201d Law and Disorder (1974), his second US film, was an insightful and amusing satire on the decline of neighbourhood life in which Carroll O\u2019Connor and Ernest Borgnine set about organising a vigilante force to combat the rising tide of crime. However, the film suffered from the sudden shift of tone towards the end. \u201cThe audience was laughing all the time, suddenly this guy was killed and the audience was stunned,\u201d Passer said. \u201cI learned that you should never do that.\u201d Passer found it hard to get personal ventures off the ground, and had to do his best with mediocre material such as the slight comedy Crime and Passion (1976), in which a shady investment banker (Omar Sharif) convinces his lover/secretary (Black) to marry a tycoon to whom he is heavily in debt. Silver Bears (1978), about a scam involving an Iranian silver mine, remained unconvincing despite its elegant cast \u2013 Michael Caine, Martin Balsam, Louis Jourdan, St\u00e9phane Audran and Cybill Shepherd. His most cohesive movie, Cutter\u2019s Way, a subversive, paranoid thriller that questions American values and myths, tells of an injured Vietnam vet, Alex Cutter (John Heard), seeking revenge on a local California bigwig, whom he suspects of having murdered a teenage girl. Heard, Lisa Eichhorn as his alcoholic wife, and Jeff Bridges as his friend Bone, give fervid performances. According to Passer, Cutter\u2019s Way was \u201ca damaging account of a nation that has lost its final illusions in the Vietnam war and of a society eaten away by corruption.\u201d It took some years for Cutter\u2019s Way to be appreciated. In the meantime, Passer continued to turn out quirky movies such as Creator (1985), a jumbled comedy-drama starring Peter O\u2019Toole, and Haunted Summer (1988), a portrayal of the meeting between Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Godwin and John Polidori in Italy in 1816. There was a return to form in another biographical drama, Stalin (1992) starring, Robert Duvall as the Soviet dictator. In 2004 Passer started to direct Nomad: The Warrior, an epic set in 18th-century Kazakhstan. Due to financial and weather problems on location, the film shut down halfway through. It was then bought by the producer brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who replaced Passer with Sergei Bodrov, and released it the following year. Passer is survived by his second wife, Anne, and by a son, Ivan, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. \u2022 Ivan Passer, film director, born 10 July 1933; died 9 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "While the world has been spinning Edinson Cavani has been quietly getting old in Paris. The once-galloping Uruguayan striker will be 33 in February! How did that happen? Cavani has been struggling with injury this season. Not that Manchester United seem to care. They would love to increase the average age of their squad by bringing the PSG forward to Old Trafford, particularly now that Ashley Young has downed tools to force a move to Inter. But there\u2019s a snag. The brass-necked Parisians value Cavani \u2013 whose contract expires in the summer \u2013 at \u00a330m! That\u2019s a lot of a lolly. Spurs are interested too now that Harry Kane looks set for an extended spell in the treatment room. One player who could pop up at Old Trafford this January is Bruno Fernandes, who seems to have been linked with a move to Manchester United from Sporting since the pre-internet days. It says here that he\u2019ll be in the stands at Anfield on Sunday to watch his potential new team take on Liverpool. They might want to force him to put pen to paper on his \u00a350m move before that one kicks off. Brendan Rodgers is keeping tabs on Southampton\u2019s Ryan Bertrand. Why, you ask? Because they fully expect Ben Chilwell to walk the well worn path between the Leicester and Chelsea in the summer. Another full-back who could be on the move is Jo\u00e3o Cancelo. The right-back has struggled to elbow Kyle Walker out of the Manchester City team since joining from Juventus for \u00a360m last summer and the word in Spain is that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has \u201cpersonally\u201d spoken to the Portugal defender about a potential \u00a351m switch to Tottenham. Chelsea are leading the race to sign Rumour Mill stalwart Timo Werner from Leipzig after the striker, who has 23 goals in 25 games, said he believes the Premier League was the \u201cmost interesting\u201d in Europe. Clearly Werner has not been watching Poland\u2019s Ekstraklasa, where a four-way race for the title is shaping up. Serie A shambles Milan are dispatching scouts to new and interesting places as they try to bag a bargain. The confused-looking Italian chap walking up Wallgate in Wigan is looking for the Latics\u2019 left-back Antonee Robinson while he\u2019ll also have to find his way up to Edinburgh to see if he thinks Hearts\u2019 17-year-old left-back Aaron Hickey is the second coming of Paolo Maldini. And Hull have told Aston Villa to stump up 20 million big ones if they want to make off with their goal-guzzling forward Jarrod Bowen this January.",

It\u2019s that specificity that powers Manic, too. Where pop has historically painted with broad brushstrokes in songs that could pertain to anyone, Halsey uses a finely sharpened nib. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I never ever had a baby with you / cause you can\u2019t love nothing unless there\u2019s something in it for you\u201d; \u201cNobody loves you, they just try to fuck you / and put you on a feature on the B-side\u201d \u2013 no one is actually named, but these lines make you sympathetically wince nonetheless. The latter is from the gorgeous closer 929, which also finds Halsey longing \u201cfor my father to finally call me\u201d \u2013 by this point it feels like you\u2019re crying after stealing a look at her diary when she went out for more wine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/68enXe5XcJdciSDAZr0Alr\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/68enXe5XcJdciSDAZr0Alr\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Her lyrical confidence is matched by the characterful production, which straddles R&amp;B, country, trashy pop-rock, Kacey Musgraves-ish cosmic Americana and more; I Hate Everybody is like a gothic showtune. The interludes with star guests \u2013 Alanis Morrisette, BTS\u2019s Suga \u2013 are frustrating, nearly done sketches, but otherwise this is that rare thing: a major label pop album with real drama and humanity.<br></p>",

Her third album features Without Me, which reached No 1 in the US and spent an entire year in the charts, partly thanks to its catchiness and voguish opiated trap production, partly thanks to the bracing specificity of its lyrics, which castigated her famous rapper ex G-Eazy. It\u2019s that specificity that powers Manic, too. Where pop has historically painted with broad brushstrokes in songs that could pertain to anyone, Halsey uses a finely sharpened nib. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I never ever had a baby with you / cause you can\u2019t love nothing unless there\u2019s something in it for you\u201d; \u201cNobody loves you, they just try to fuck you / and put you on a feature on the B-side\u201d \u2013 no one is actually named, but these lines make you sympathetically wince nonetheless. The latter is from the gorgeous closer 929, which also finds Halsey longing \u201cfor my father to finally call me\u201d \u2013 by this point it feels like you\u2019re crying after stealing a look at her diary when she went out for more wine. Her lyrical confidence is matched by the characterful production, which straddles R&amp;B, country, trashy pop-rock, Kacey Musgraves-ish cosmic Americana and more; I Hate Everybody is like a gothic showtune. The interludes with star guests \u2013 Alanis Morrisette, BTS\u2019s Suga \u2013 are frustrating, nearly done sketches, but otherwise this is that rare thing: a major label pop album with real drama and humanity.",

In the custody of the Dutch, he assumes he\u2019s close to asylum, freedom and life. In fact, years of indignities lie ahead, starting with rubber gloves and an order to fish the pieces of his passport out of the toilet.</p> <p>Like many refugees, in his first interview Samir says too much, trusts too much, submits too much. He doesn\u2019t claim his rights (to refuse an interview if he\u2019s sick, to speak to a pro bono lawyer first, to remain silent in the presence of an incompetent translator), and yet he\u2019s forced to sign a paper confirming that he understands them. Under pressure, he damns himself. Then, whenever he tries to report cruelty by an officer, or a mistake by a translator, he is called a liar. In an almost satirical exchange, his interviewer says she cannot accept the official birthday he was given in Iraq, so it\u2019s better that he should have none at all. And yet, the biggest indignity is the waiting \u2013 the fact that the government sees no value in his wasted years. In the dreary asylum centre he is considered housed and safe. But for its sleepless residents, the centre is more brutal on the soul than their war-torn homelands. In Iraq, Samir knew no one who even considered suicide. In his time at the asylum centre, eight escaped by it.</p> <p>He is issued two blankets, three sheets, a towel, a pillow and a pillowcase, and forced to keep track of them (a detail the author never allows us to forget). Each day Samir queues to sign in at the centre\u2019s reception, to prove he hasn\u2019t escaped, while the administrators chat, ignoring the growing line of refugees and drawing out their humiliation. Those who speak out of turn are forced to stand in a corner until told to move. \u201cNow, all these years later,\u201d writes Samir, \u201cI still stand waiting in the hallway.\u201d</p> <p>For Samir, the Dutch instinct for meagerness, blind logic and pitiless accountability isn\u2019t about dinner party potatoes \u2013 after all, like my Iranian friends, he is \u201cnever once invited to a Dutch person\u2019s home\u201d. Dutch logic implies that its own systems and people function flawlessly while destitute foreigners are born liars; money buys some of them credibility via a lawyer, but the rest are con artists. Before long, Samir loses hope. \u201cCivil servants are empowered to vent their aggression in a variety of ways. Power of the keyboard, power of the mouth, power of the hands. When a Dutch civil servant loses his patience, he can turn a person\u2019s life into a living hell.\u201d The stories in <em>Two Blankets, Three Sheets</em> are heartbreaking, exhausting and infuriating. We learn about Samir\u2019s earlier travels through Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, where he is conscripted as a smuggler and a movie extra (in another charming bit of satire, he\u2019s repeatedly shot, strung-up and tortured on a Vietnam war set, while the screenwriter pumps him for details from Iraq). In the asylum centre, he shares a roof with a murderous Saddam Hussein general, a Russian beauty, a kind seamstress whose sewing machine is confiscated, a forgotten man driven to madness by 16 years awaiting an asylum letter that never comes, and a baby who becomes a growing embodiment of Samir\u2019s wasted years.</p> <p>Throughout all this, Samir keeps his humour. \u201cWhere\u2019s the third sheet?\u201d a stockroom worker asks. \u201cI ate it,\u201d he says. This book is full of strange details, the trifles that accumulate in the memory. The man with a bin bag full of documents; the refugees eating all the waterfowl from the local pond. It infuses tedious sufferings with drama, humour and life: the agony of waiting, the cruelty and pettiness of bureaucracy.

But for anyone open to it, it is non-fiction.\u201d Here, and throughout, he is trying to make the settled reader understand the precarious nature of truth for the refugee storyteller. Credibility is awarded to the whitest, the richest, the ones with the best English. Single men who have made mistakes at the border are doomed to languish, unbelieved, for years. I am also a refugee and I know that often fiction is a better conduit of truth than non-fiction \u2013 one can craft details, disguise and combine characters, make a decade seem suspenseful, weed out irrelevancies.

      "bodyText": "When I lived in the Netherlands, long-settled Iranians joked about the native Dutch: \u201cIf they invite five people for dinner, they\u2019ll make exactly five potatoes.\u201d Newer arrivals would gasp at this, since in the Middle East hospitality is a matter of pride and any decent person cooks a feast no matter how many are expected. \u201cWhat if someone wants a second potato?\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cOh God, what if guests leave \u2026 still hungry?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d the settled Iranians would reply. \u201cThey\u2019ll never invite you over.\u201d It was a sad kind of joke, an understanding about the nature of welcome in the Netherlands. Rodaan Al Galidi\u2019s Two Blankets, Three Sheets is a funny, maddening, sometimes absurd reckoning with the pettiness of the Dutch immigration system as seen by Samir, an Iraqi refugee who is stuck in an asylum centre for nine years. The novel, already a bestseller in the Netherlands, is openly autobiographical and, to be fair, the Dutch are just a stand-in for all entitled westerners and bureaucrats.

The film follows two couriers as they try to reach a unit threatened by a German counter-attack; with Roger Deakins in charge of the cameras, this has emerged as a visual tour de force.</p> <h2>Waves (15)</h2> <p><em>(Trey Edward Shults, 2019, US) 136 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5z3cr8AB5g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5z3cr8AB5g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>An intense drama from the director of It Comes at Night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/14/how-waves-unpicks-the-pressures-of-black-excellence-trey-edward-shult\">Waves</a> focuses on the African-American middle class and the pressure to succeed. Its central character is a high-school wrestler, whose father is pushing him to make the grade; at the same time, his relationship with his girlfriend becomes fraught.

He\u2019s on these shores playing behind Country Squire \u2013 an album brimming with political poetics and sweetly gritty tunes.<br><em><a href=\"https://tylerchildersmusic.com/tour/\">Manchester Academy 2, Saturday 18; St Luke\u2019s, Glasgow, Sunday 19; O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, W12, Tuesday 21 January</a></em></p> <h2>Krept and Konan</h2> <p>Aspects of this London rap duo sit slightly uncomfortably \u2013 they run their own dessert restaurant, Crepes &amp; Cones (cute!), but also deliver lines such as \u201cI\u2019ma kill that pussy, cause a felony tonight\u201d (less so).

The first re-creation of the marathon programme comes as a joint project from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, conducted by Jaime Mart\u00edn, and the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera under Carlo Rizzi, with Steven Osborne and Ll\u0177r Williams as piano soloists.<br><em><a href=\"beethoven:%20The%201808%20Concert\">St David\u2019s Hall, Cardiff, Sunday 19th January</a></em></p> <h2>The Book of Elements</h2> <p>Contemporary music rarely gets much of a look-in in the Southbank Centre\u2019s international piano series, but Noriko Kawai\u2019s recital is devoted to a complete performance of one of the most important keyboard works of our time. The 27 pieces that make up James Dillon\u2019s 80-minute Book of Elements deal with the basic ingredients of music \u2013 change and continuity \u2013 but do so in an utterly personal and profoundly pianistic way, and Kawai is the definitive interpreter of this thrilling work.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/132616-james-dillons-book-elements-2020\">Purcell Room, SE1, Sunday 19th January</a></em></p> <h2>Street Scene</h2> <p>Occupying the middle ground between opera and musical, Street Scene has become the most frequently performed of the stage works that Kurt Weill composed after he settled in the US. Opera North\u2019s new production, directed by Matthew Eberhardt and conducted by James Holmes, has Giselle Allen and Robert Hayward as Anna and Frank Maurrant; Gillene Butterfield is their daughter Rose.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/street-scene/#book\">Grand Theatre, Leeds, Saturday 18th January to 28 February; touring to 20 March</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4aba1b1aeef98869e4b364202097b21ec674109a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aba1b1aeef98869e4b364202097b21ec674109a/460_608_6327_3797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire As a Soldier (1987) by Grayson Perry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire As a Soldier (1987) by Grayson Perry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grayson Perry/Victoria Miro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Grayson Perry</h2> <p>Years before he won the Turner prize and was trampolined into fame, Perry was making ceramics in which he developed his satirical style. These \u201clost pots\u201d have been lovingly recovered for an exhibition that looks at Grayson Perry, pre-Grayson Perry. It\u2019s a chance to explore another facet of an artist who is part of the fabric of modern Britain.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.holburne.org/grayson-perry/\">The Holburne Museum, Bath, Friday 24 January to 25 May</a></em></p> <h2>Ian Davenport</h2> <p>Art world fashion currently embraces figurative painting \u2013 back in from the cold because it can show diversity \u2013 but so much of the best modern painting is abstract. Ian Davenport keeps the faith with a sublime and serious poetry of colour rooted in abstract expressionism. Here he shows etchings and monoprints that put his big vision on paper.<br><em><a href=\"https://cristearoberts.com/artists/59-ian-davenport/\">Cristea Roberts Gallery, SW1, to 8 February</a></em></p> <h2>Tullio Crali</h2> <p>This Italian painter was born in 1910, a year after FT Marinetti published the Manifesto of Futurism. He must have imbibed its rhetoric as a baby, for he remained loyal to futurism throughout his career. But he created his dynamic images of aircraft and flight at the height of the fascist age. Futurism is an art of war, and in a minor talent such as Crali you see how its aesthetic of machines served Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.estorickcollection.com/exhibitions/tullio-crali-a-futurist-life\">Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art, N1, to 11 April</a></em></p> <h2>Illuminating the Self</h2> <p>It\u2019s a 19th-century voyeur\u2019s delight as the Hatton unveils an installation of Victorian underwear. But wait \u2013 each is embroidered with texts by people with epilepsy, and the entire display moves to a programme based on brain activity.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films 1917 (15) (Sam Mendes, 2019, UK/US) 119 mins Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama has turned into a substantial commercial success, as well as an awards-season powerhouse: its immersive long-take style saw it end up at No 1 at the US box office last week. The film follows two couriers as they try to reach a unit threatened by a German counter-attack; with Roger Deakins in charge of the cameras, this has emerged as a visual tour de force. Waves (15) (Trey Edward Shults, 2019, US) 136 mins An intense drama from the director of It Comes at Night, Waves focuses on the African-American middle class and the pressure to succeed. Its central character is a high-school wrestler, whose father is pushing him to make the grade; at the same time, his relationship with his girlfriend becomes fraught. A sensitively observed, tragic film. Uncut Gems (15) (Josh and Benny Safdie, 2019, US) 135 mins Adam Sandler gives one of his rare classy-movie performances: one to file alongside Punch-Drunk Love, Funny People and The Meyerowitz Stories. He is twitchy, relentless jewel dealer Howard Ratner, cruising for a bruising on the mean streets of New York as he tries to offload a rare opal and stay ahead of debt collectors. A Hidden Life (12A) (Terrence Malick, 2019, US/Ger) 174 mins Late-period Terence Malick is a mixed bag: The Tree of Life counts as some sort of berserk masterpiece, but his subsequent films \u2013 To the Wonder, Knight of Cups, Song to Song \u2013 emerged as mannered, self-indulgent bombast. A Hidden Life claws back some of the lost ground: it\u2019s no less high-flown and rhapsodic, but its subject matter \u2013 the travails of second world war conscientious objector Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter \u2013 gives it real substance. Bombshell (15) (Jay Roach, 2019, US/Can) 109 mins In Bombshell, Hollywood takes aim at the abusive culture inside Fox News as represented by the late Roger Ailes, and uses the media-friendly figures of channel anchors Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson to do so. Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman play Kelly and Carlson, with Margot Robbie as a composite figure; John Lithgow is their bete noire. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Beat Horizon In three short weeks 2020 has proven itself not for the faint of heart, but these hip-hop, beats and bass-heavy all-nighters are here to perk up your weary soul. Rabble-rousing edification comes courtesy of Zambian rapper Sampa the Great, golden-voiced MC Yasiin Bey AKA Mos Def (not Bristol) plus drum\u2019n\u2019bass titans Roni Size and Goldie. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Saturday 18; Motion, Bristol, Friday 24; O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, 25 January Tyler Childers His country cred runs deep: raised on bluegrass and Nirvana, Kentucky songman Tyler Childers has been honing his talent on tour with country royalty Willie Nelson and John Prine, and his producer is Sturgill Simpson. He\u2019s on these shores playing behind Country Squire \u2013 an album brimming with political poetics and sweetly gritty tunes. Manchester Academy 2, Saturday 18; St Luke\u2019s, Glasgow, Sunday 19; O2 Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, W12, Tuesday 21 January Krept and Konan Aspects of this London rap duo sit slightly uncomfortably \u2013 they run their own dessert restaurant, Crepes &amp; Cones (cute!), but also deliver lines such as \u201cI\u2019ma kill that pussy, cause a felony tonight\u201d (less so). But their onstage chemistry is undeniable, and new album Revenge Is Sweet boldly addresses issues of depression and anxiety via tracks that deftly move from smooth and reflective to absolutely pummelling. Stylus, Leeds, Tuesday 21; Albert Hall, Manchester, Thursday 23; Rock City, Nottingham, Friday 24; touring to 30 January Beak&gt; The Bristolian trio co-helmed by Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow are back to deliver their oblique, slightly jittery post-punk and deliciously psychedelic, krautrock-inspired sounds, audible on third album &gt;&gt;&gt; (the follow-up to second album &gt;&gt;, and debut BEAK&gt;, of course), and 2019\u2019s groovesome Life Goes On EP. Gig-nodders will be out in force. Electric Ballroom, NW1, Friday 24 January; touring to 8 February SH Ian Shaw and Friends Ian Shaw, the genre-vaulting jazz singer, annually celebrates the arts of song and the diversity of his musical friendships in this week-long Soho season. Trumpeter Guy Barker (21st), saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis (22nd), Loose Tubes legend Iain Ballamy (23rd) and singer-songwriters Georgia Mancio and Bumi Thomas (24th) drop in. Pizza Express Jazz Club, Soho, W1; Sunday 19 to 26 January JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Beethoven: The 1808 Concert The historic concert in Vienna on 22 December 1808 that included the premieres of three of Beethoven\u2019s greatest orchestral works \u2013 the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto \u2013 is likely to be revisited several times this year as part of the 250th-anniversary celebrations. The first re-creation of the marathon programme comes as a joint project from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, conducted by Jaime Mart\u00edn, and the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera under Carlo Rizzi, with Steven Osborne and Ll\u0177r Williams as piano soloists. St David\u2019s Hall, Cardiff, Sunday 19th January The Book of Elements Contemporary music rarely gets much of a look-in in the Southbank Centre\u2019s international piano series, but Noriko Kawai\u2019s recital is devoted to a complete performance of one of the most important keyboard works of our time. The 27 pieces that make up James Dillon\u2019s 80-minute Book of Elements deal with the basic ingredients of music \u2013 change and continuity \u2013 but do so in an utterly personal and profoundly pianistic way, and Kawai is the definitive interpreter of this thrilling work. Purcell Room, SE1, Sunday 19th January Street Scene Occupying the middle ground between opera and musical, Street Scene has become the most frequently performed of the stage works that Kurt Weill composed after he settled in the US. Opera North\u2019s new production, directed by Matthew Eberhardt and conducted by James Holmes, has Giselle Allen and Robert Hayward as Anna and Frank Maurrant; Gillene Butterfield is their daughter Rose. Grand Theatre, Leeds, Saturday 18th January to 28 February; touring to 20 March AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Grayson Perry Years before he won the Turner prize and was trampolined into fame, Perry was making ceramics in which he developed his satirical style. These \u201clost pots\u201d have been lovingly recovered for an exhibition that looks at Grayson Perry, pre-Grayson Perry. It\u2019s a chance to explore another facet of an artist who is part of the fabric of modern Britain. The Holburne Museum, Bath, Friday 24 January to 25 May Ian Davenport Art world fashion currently embraces figurative painting \u2013 back in from the cold because it can show diversity \u2013 but so much of the best modern painting is abstract. Ian Davenport keeps the faith with a sublime and serious poetry of colour rooted in abstract expressionism. Here he shows etchings and monoprints that put his big vision on paper. Cristea Roberts Gallery, SW1, to 8 February Tullio Crali This Italian painter was born in 1910, a year after FT Marinetti published the Manifesto of Futurism. He must have imbibed its rhetoric as a baby, for he remained loyal to futurism throughout his career. But he created his dynamic images of aircraft and flight at the height of the fascist age. Futurism is an art of war, and in a minor talent such as Crali you see how its aesthetic of machines served Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship. Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art, N1, to 11 April Illuminating the Self It\u2019s a 19th-century voyeur\u2019s delight as the Hatton unveils an installation of Victorian underwear. But wait \u2013 each is embroidered with texts by people with epilepsy, and the entire display moves to a programme based on brain activity. Artists Susan Aldworth and Andrew Carnie have worked with scientists who are researching the use of light to massage brain cells on a show that explores the mystery and frailty of the human mind. Hatton Gallery, Saturday 18 January to 9 May; Vane, to 29 February, Newcastle upon Tyne The Four Ages of Woman London\u2019s Bethlem Hospital has artistic associations going back to William Hogarth, who painted its patients, and Richard Dadd, who was incarcerated there. But this exhibition explores another heritage: that of women, art and the varieties of mental experience. It includes writer, painter and patient Anna Kavan and contemporary potter Bibi Herrera.

      "bodyText": "The completion of two new hospitals whose construction was brought to a halt by the collapse of the government contractor Carillion has been delayed by two more years and will run hundreds of millions of pounds over budget, according to Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog. The 646-bed Royal Liverpool, originally scheduled to open in 2017, is now forecast to be completed in the autumn of 2022 and cost more than \u00a31bn to build and run compared with an original estimate of \u00a3746m, according to the National Audit Office. A report released on Friday also found that the 669-bed Midland Metropolitan in Sandwell, which was due to open in October 2018, is now expected to open in July 2022 and will cost at least \u00a3988m \u2013 more than \u00a3300m over budget. The delays and extra costs to the taxpayer have been seized upon by Labour and unions as the fault of Conservative ministers who were \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d when the outsourcing giant went into liquidation in January 2018. The hospitals were intended to be up-to-date medical facilities. They were funded by PFI, the controversial model where private firms are contracted to complete public projects and take debt off the government\u2019s balance sheet. Auditors said there were significant construction problems and delays before Carillion went into liquidation in January 2018 but the contractor\u2019s collapse created more delay. Work on both sites stopped while the hospital trusts, government and private investors attempted to rescue the projects. The full extent of construction problems at Royal Liverpool began to emerge after Carillion collapsed and over the course of 2018, the report said. The interior of the building was almost completed when Laing O\u2019Rourke, the new construction contractor, had to strip out three floors of the building and start major work to reinforce the structure with steelwork and additional reinforced concrete. Cracks in concrete beams had rendered the structure unsafe, while the original designs were found to have major flaws, the report said. It also emerged in September 2018 that the building was fitted with external cladding considered unsafe following the Grenfell Tower fire in west London, costing an extra \u00a350m. The Department of Health &amp; Social Care paid \u00a342m compensation to Royal Liverpool\u2019s investors to terminate the PFI contract after government officials decided to reach a quick settlement to avoid delays and other unseen extra costs. \u201cBut going for a quick settlement meant the department had to rely on the available estimate of the cost to complete, provided by the PFI company, its lenders and their advisers,\u201d the report said. The private sector has borne most of the cost increase, with shareholders, investors, insurers and Carillion losing at least \u00a3603m on the construction of both projects, auditors said. The demise of Carillion was the UK\u2019s biggest corporate failure in decades, affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. More than 3,000 jobs were lost at the company, and the collapse affected 75,000 people working in its supply chain. It failed with debts of \u00a37bn, more than its annual sales of \u00a35.2bn. The circumstances of Carillion\u2019s collapse and its consequences are also being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council and the Official Receiver. Two years on from the collapse, MPs are still waiting for their reports. Jon Trickett MP, the shadow cabinet office minister, said the delays in construction were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cThe Conservatives must take responsibility for being asleep at the wheel,\u201d he said. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA, said: \u201cThe cases of the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan highlight how these deals can collapse causing disruption and delays to the delivery of services and much-needed new facilities. This then inevitably impacts upon both patients and staff in local health services. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it is unacceptable that taxpayers should be expected to foot even a small fraction of the increased construction costs.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cAs this report shows, the private sector has borne the brunt of Carillion\u2019s catastrophic failure to complete these two projects. \u201cTo support staff and local communities in Sandwell and Liverpool, we\u2019re giving both Trusts the funding they need to minimise the delays caused by the collapse of Carillion and get these two new hospitals open.\u201d",

At a 2007 charity golf club event, Trump said it was \u201cmy really terrific privilege to introduce a man that I think is one of the great mayors and will go down as one of the great mayors, if not the greatest, in New York City\u201d. In 2013, Trump was asked if he thought Bloomberg is a good mayor. He responded: \u201cYes!\u201d At a ribbon-cutting ceremony that same year Trump said Bloomberg had \u201cbeen a great mayor\u201d, adding: \u201cI mean, this guy is fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has even praised Bloomberg\u2019s past positions on gun control on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends.</p> <p>Bloomberg has also thrown Trump some kind words. At the same ribbon-cutting ceremony Bloomberg said: \u201cIf there is anybody who has changed this city, it is Donald Trump.\u201d In 2004, Bloomberg appeared on an episode of The Apprentice. Trump at the time said he invited Bloomberg on to the show because he had \u201cgreat respect for him\u201d.</p> <p>Yet even back then the identities they each fostered as famous billionaires were radically different. They ran in different social circles. Where Trump would go to a dinner party hosted by Jeffrey Epstein, Bloomberg would go to editor Tina Brown\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Bloomberg has no gold toilets at his house,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of money with less to prove.\u201d</p> <p>Congressman Peter King, a New York Republican, recalls Bloomberg once telling him that the only time he really interacted with Trump was at a charity golf tournament.</p> <p>\u201cThey were in many ways from different worlds,\u201d King said. He added that before Trump ascended to national office he had only met him a few times while he knew Bloomberg \u201cvery well\u201d. Bloomberg and people in his orbit rarely mentioned Trump\u2019s name, King said.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like they were hugging or talking about \u2018Hey, remember the great times we had\u2019 \u2013 it was like two guys who knew each other but didn\u2019t seem overly close, they didn\u2019t seem overly hostile,\u201d King recalled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a693c7ba5a4a554f3770e2c3c02923b9f9249d28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a693c7ba5a4a554f3770e2c3c02923b9f9249d28/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, Mike Bloomberg and Jared Kushner in New York, New York, on 14 March 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, Mike Bloomberg and Jared Kushner in New York, New York, on 14 March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But those days are long gone, leaving the hostility thoroughly overt and the antagonism is only likely to escalate as the two pour more money and time into the 2020 presidential race. Some think their previous social proximity might even make their rivalry more intense.</p> <p>King, who Bloomberg has raised money for and who backs Trump, predicted that a head-to-head matchup between the two candidates would involve \u201ca huge amount of money, a huge amount of ego on both sides\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEach guy would think he\u2019s smarter than the other,\u201d King said, adding that each billionaire would be acting like he\u2019s accomplished more than the other.</p> <p>The relationship is also extra testy because of Bloomberg\u2019s unique position within the field of over a dozen Democratic candidates vying to face Trump.</p> <p>Bloomberg has seen his national poll numbers rise within the Democratic primary as he\u2019s poured money into advertising for his campaign. Bloomberg is the only one who hails from the same state as Trump (although Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was born in Brooklyn) and whose background as an outsider billionaire who is still a household name within political circles is similar to Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>Recently, Trump has reportedly started to wonder how much money Bloomberg could spend to defeat him. And Bloomberg is airing ads promising not to copy Trump\u2019s tweeting habits if elected president.</p> <p>Bloomberg has toyed with running for president multiple times but Trump\u2019s performance in the White House seems to be the breaking point that has finally tipped him into the race.</p> <p>Aides to the former New York mayor like to point to recent statements Bloomberg has made lambasting the Republican president. As he\u2019s opened campaign offices across the US Bloomberg has sprinkled his public remarks with apocalyptic warnings of Trump winning re-election.</p> <p>At his newly opened campaign office in Tennessee, Bloomberg said: \u201cDonald Trump is trying to pull this country apart, and if you want a future we just have to pull it together.\u201d That same day in Philadelphia Bloomberg said pointedly: \u201cDonald Trump does not know how to manage. He\u2019s never been a businessperson. He\u2019s a real estate developer, promoter.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has criticized Bloomberg as well. In early December, Trump mockingly tweeted that \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization\u201d to investigate \u201cPresident Trump, only\u201d.</p> <p>The antagonism goes back through 2016.

      "bodyText": "These days Donald Trump and Mike Bloomberg can best be described as mortal enemies. The former New York mayor\u2019s campaign against the president is leveraging Bloomberg\u2019s deep pockets to oust his fellow Manhattan billionaire. Bloomberg has hired hundreds of staffers and organizers across 30 states. Bloomberg\u2019s ads are ubiquitous on TV and his campaign has reserved a 60-second spot during the Super Bowl with an estimated price tag of $10m. The Trump campaign, in an illustration of the arms race a general election matchup between Bloomberg and Trump would be, announced its own $10m Super Bowl ad reservation after Bloomberg. On Monday, Bloomberg and Trump squabbled on Twitter, with Trump dinging the former New York mayor on healthcare, calling him \u201cMini Mike\u201d. In response Bloomberg corrected Trump\u2019s false claim that his administration protected the pre-existing conditions provision of Obamacare. And recently, the financial news website Marketplace published a scathing op-ed by Bloomberg with the headline \u201cTrump has been great for people like me \u2013 but I\u2019ll be great for you\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t wasn\u2019t always like this. Bloomberg and Trump, both billionaires from New York, for years kept a cordial and even friendly relationship as they repeatedly ran into each other at charity events, parties and even one of former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s weddings. Along the way they swapped praise. At a 2007 charity golf club event, Trump said it was \u201cmy really terrific privilege to introduce a man that I think is one of the great mayors and will go down as one of the great mayors, if not the greatest, in New York City\u201d. In 2013, Trump was asked if he thought Bloomberg is a good mayor. He responded: \u201cYes!\u201d At a ribbon-cutting ceremony that same year Trump said Bloomberg had \u201cbeen a great mayor\u201d, adding: \u201cI mean, this guy is fantastic.\u201d Trump has even praised Bloomberg\u2019s past positions on gun control on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends. Bloomberg has also thrown Trump some kind words. At the same ribbon-cutting ceremony Bloomberg said: \u201cIf there is anybody who has changed this city, it is Donald Trump.\u201d In 2004, Bloomberg appeared on an episode of The Apprentice. Trump at the time said he invited Bloomberg on to the show because he had \u201cgreat respect for him\u201d. Yet even back then the identities they each fostered as famous billionaires were radically different. They ran in different social circles. Where Trump would go to a dinner party hosted by Jeffrey Epstein, Bloomberg would go to editor Tina Brown\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m sure Bloomberg has no gold toilets at his house,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of money with less to prove.\u201d Congressman Peter King, a New York Republican, recalls Bloomberg once telling him that the only time he really interacted with Trump was at a charity golf tournament. \u201cThey were in many ways from different worlds,\u201d King said. He added that before Trump ascended to national office he had only met him a few times while he knew Bloomberg \u201cvery well\u201d. Bloomberg and people in his orbit rarely mentioned Trump\u2019s name, King said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like they were hugging or talking about \u2018Hey, remember the great times we had\u2019 \u2013 it was like two guys who knew each other but didn\u2019t seem overly close, they didn\u2019t seem overly hostile,\u201d King recalled. But those days are long gone, leaving the hostility thoroughly overt and the antagonism is only likely to escalate as the two pour more money and time into the 2020 presidential race. Some think their previous social proximity might even make their rivalry more intense. King, who Bloomberg has raised money for and who backs Trump, predicted that a head-to-head matchup between the two candidates would involve \u201ca huge amount of money, a huge amount of ego on both sides\u201d. \u201cEach guy would think he\u2019s smarter than the other,\u201d King said, adding that each billionaire would be acting like he\u2019s accomplished more than the other. The relationship is also extra testy because of Bloomberg\u2019s unique position within the field of over a dozen Democratic candidates vying to face Trump. Bloomberg has seen his national poll numbers rise within the Democratic primary as he\u2019s poured money into advertising for his campaign. Bloomberg is the only one who hails from the same state as Trump (although Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was born in Brooklyn) and whose background as an outsider billionaire who is still a household name within political circles is similar to Trump\u2019s. Recently, Trump has reportedly started to wonder how much money Bloomberg could spend to defeat him. And Bloomberg is airing ads promising not to copy Trump\u2019s tweeting habits if elected president. Bloomberg has toyed with running for president multiple times but Trump\u2019s performance in the White House seems to be the breaking point that has finally tipped him into the race. Aides to the former New York mayor like to point to recent statements Bloomberg has made lambasting the Republican president. As he\u2019s opened campaign offices across the US Bloomberg has sprinkled his public remarks with apocalyptic warnings of Trump winning re-election. At his newly opened campaign office in Tennessee, Bloomberg said: \u201cDonald Trump is trying to pull this country apart, and if you want a future we just have to pull it together.\u201d That same day in Philadelphia Bloomberg said pointedly: \u201cDonald Trump does not know how to manage. He\u2019s never been a businessperson. He\u2019s a real estate developer, promoter.\u201d Trump has criticized Bloomberg as well. In early December, Trump mockingly tweeted that \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization\u201d to investigate \u201cPresident Trump, only\u201d. The antagonism goes back through 2016. Bloomberg delivered a speech at the Democratic national convention that summer saying he wasn\u2019t there as \u201ca member of any party\u201d but to urge voters to help elect Hillary Clinton and defeat \u201ca dangerous demagogue\u201d. Trump around that time tweeted: \u201cLittle Michael Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!\u201d At the beginning of 2019, the Washington Post chronicled the evolution of Trump and Bloomberg\u2019s interactions. At the time Trump told the newspaper that he and Bloomberg used to like each other but the relationship \u201cwent strangely haywire once I ran for office\u201d. Bloomberg, Trump said, didn\u2019t care about his political positions before he ran for the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m for guns, he\u2019s against guns,\u201d Trump said. Though Trump, in the past, had praised Bloomberg\u2019s positions on guns. For the same article, Bloomberg told the paper that his \u201cobjection to Donald Trump is the way he\u2019s filling his current role, in terms of representing the country, in terms of representing the public. There\u2019s an attitude, and a style, and a lack of civility that I think is bad for the country and I find offensive.\u201d",

Melody often wins out in their cocktail of prickly sounds, so while a track such as Dispossession might have lyrics about America in flames, it comes with a killer chorus and a louche swing. \u201cThere\u2019s a larger theme of sound that\u2019s revisited throughout the record,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cSound as something that is redemptive and threatening and soothing and everything in between.\u201d Their conversation is punctuated with dry humour, and although they are eloquent when it comes to discussing the bizarre and frequently terrifying state of the world in 2020, they are level-headed with it. \u201cIf you\u2019re hopeful without pessimism it\u2019s quite naive,\u201d says Mahan, \u201cand if you\u2019re just pessimistic, it\u2019s fucking cynical.\u201d There Is No Year is released 17 January on Matador",

The point of finance, according to basic economic theory, is to deploy capital where it is most useful. Sometimes people have more money than they need, and they save it; and sometimes people have less than they need, so they borrow it. Finance connects those two groups together, making its living from the commissions it earns for doing so. That might be important, but it\u2019s definitely not glamorous.

There are dozens of financial institutions, all offering pretty much precisely the same services. Competition should drive down their fees to a level barely above break-even, which means bankers should be bracketed together with conveyancing solicitors, quantity surveyors and other unglamorous professions, just like they used to be.</p> <p>But that is not how things are. Banks are prestigious and profitable, able to pay their employees far more than companies in the productive economy that they supposedly serve. These employees come up with ever more elaborate innovations for moving money, earning their employers profit margins far in excess of companies that actually make something. Economic theory says one thing; reality is different, so what is going on?

His work was highly empirical, rather than theoretical, and thus avoided the politics-in-scientific-clothing \u201cmathiness\u201d which has rather blighted economics in the last half-century.</p> <p>By inquiring into how those in business and deal-makers actually behave, rather than how a rational economic actor should behave, Veblen found innumerable examples of cheating. There was so much cheating going on, in fact, that he gave it a whole term: sabotage. Businesses used their superior knowledge to sabotage their clients, their competitors and their regulators, all in pursuit of bigger profits. It wasn\u2019t that these businessmen didn\u2019t believe in free, well-regulated, unrigged markets \u2013 they loved them. They just didn\u2019t want to obey the rules themselves.</p> <p>Nesvetailova and Palan comb through the behaviour of banks and other financial institutions in the years up to the financial crisis and identify similar patterns of behaviour to those found by Veblen. This, they conclude, explains the paradox of how banks can make such huge profits in such a competitive market: they sabotage everyone else. We all depend on finance; it is all but impossible to live as a citizen in a modern economy without access to the financial system. That gives employees of financial institutions priceless insights into how we behave, and what we will tolerate.</p> <p>The examples quoted are enraging, such as the allegations of how the employees of RBS deliberately drove family businesses into bankruptcy in order to make money for themselves; or an internal memo that suggested staff should let clients \u201chang themselves\u201d. RBS subsequently admitted that it had made some mistakes.</p> <p>The ultimate aim of any finance house is to become too big to fail. Once a company has the implicit guarantee of the state behind it, it can borrow more cheaply, act more recklessly and behave worse, knowing that taxpayers will bail it out if its bets go wrong. \u201cSabotaging rules and regulations is big business. So big in fact that it has become probably the biggest source of profits for some of the largest banking houses in the world,\u201d the authors conclude.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The world economy is a huge pyramid scheme; governments let it continue rather than deal with the fallout of its collapse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why do regulators let them get away with it? Here Nesvetailova and Palan get a little speculative for my taste. They argue that we are essentially dependent on financial institutions\u2019 willingness to lend for our continued prosperity, so governments connive in rule-breaking in order to ensure banks continue to earn profits. The world economy is a huge pyramid scheme; governments know it, but would rather let it continue than have to deal with the fallout of its collapse. It makes logical sense, but nothing in the recent behaviour of governments in Britain or elsewhere suggests to me that they would be capable of maintaining such a giant conspiracy for such an extended period of time without it failing through simple incompetence.</p> <p>The authors\u2019 proposed solutions, however, are rock solid. Their core idea is that regulators need to ditch their focus on ensuring financial stability, and instead recognise that financial institutions\u2019 core business model is to game the system, and always will be unless regulators stop them. This idea involves abandoning the traditional divide between right and left in politics, as if free markets and regulation are opposite poles, and recognising that truly free markets, ones which are not sabotaged by their most powerful participants, require robust regulation.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a progressive, in Britain or elsewhere, and if you think the movement needs fresh ideas, read this book, it\u2019s full of them.

Their core idea is that regulators need to ditch their focus on ensuring financial stability, and instead recognise that financial institutions\u2019 core business model is to game the system, and always will be unless regulators stop them. This idea involves abandoning the traditional divide between right and left in politics, as if free markets and regulation are opposite poles, and recognising that truly free markets, ones which are not sabotaged by their most powerful participants, require robust regulation. If you\u2019re a progressive, in Britain or elsewhere, and if you think the movement needs fresh ideas, read this book, it\u2019s full of them. Then get to work. \u2022 Sabotage is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.",

When you call 999, you are acting as a sensor. The fire brigade comes roaring to the rescue in a fire engine \u2013 that is, a giant, high-speed, actuating robot.

In the \u201cinternet of things,\u201d we\u2019re promised technology that will allow us to project our will on to our surroundings, changing our lighting or unlocking our doors or adjusting our thermostats from anywhere in the world.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSmart city\u201d is one of those science fiction phrases seemingly designed to make you uneasy, like \u201cneuromarketing\u201d or \u201cpre-crime\u201d. It\u2019s impossible to be alive in this decade and not find something unsettling in the idea of our cities becoming \u201csmart\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see why: \u201csmart\u201d has become code for \u201cterrible\u201d. A \u201csmart speaker\u201d is a speaker that eavesdrops on you and leaks all your conversations to distant subcontractors for giant tech companies. \u201cSmart watches\u201d spy on your movements and sell them to data-brokers for ad-targeting. \u201cSmart TVs\u201d watch you as you watch them and sell your viewing habits to brokers. Smart cities are studded with sensors that monitor what\u2019s going on with people, vehicles, and infrastructure; and use actuators to change things based on the resultant data. Put that way, it\u2019s hard to imagine a city that\u2019s not \u201csmart\u201d. When you call 999, you are acting as a sensor. The fire brigade comes roaring to the rescue in a fire engine \u2013 that is, a giant, high-speed, actuating robot. Transit systems are all sensors (\u201cIs there a train ahead of me still at the platform?\u201d) and actuators (\u201cHit the brakes!\u201d), and they\u2019ve been steadily exposing more and more of the data they generate to potential riders, so you can text a number or use an app or check a lighted signboard to find the wait time until the next vehicle. All this raises an interesting question: why isn\u2019t it creepy for you to know when the next bus is due, but it is creepy for the bus company to know that you\u2019re waiting for a bus? It all comes down to whether you are a sensor \u2013 or a thing to be sensed. In the \u201cinternet of things,\u201d we\u2019re promised technology that will allow us to project our will on to our surroundings, changing our lighting or unlocking our doors or adjusting our thermostats from anywhere in the world. But anyone who\u2019s used these technologies for more than a few minutes quickly starts to suspect that they are also a thing, just another thing to be sensed and acted upon from a distance, generally by unaccountable algorithms seeking to corral us into altering our conduct to maximise returns to their manufacturers\u2019 shareholders. As with cities, homes were sensing and actuating long before the \u201cinternet of things\u201d emerged. Thermostats, light switches, humidifiers, combi boilers ... our homes are stuffed full of automated tools that no one thinks to call \u201csmart,\u201d largely because they aren\u2019t terrible enough to earn the appellation. Instead, these were oriented around serving us, rather than observing or controlling us (with rare exceptions, such as electricity and gas meters, which were designed on the assumption that they were going into hostile territory and that we couldn\u2019t be trusted not to tamper with them). In your home, you are not a thing, you are a person, and the things around you exist for your comfort and benefit, not the other way around. Shouldn\u2019t it be that way in our cities? There\u2019s nothing wrong \u2013 or new \u2013 in the idea that we should sense what\u2019s happening in our built environments and alter how our systems perform to respond to those sensors\u2019 observations.

It\u2019s a safe bet that the people who make those videos imagine themselves as one of the controllers watching the monitors \u2013 not as one of the plebs whose movements are being fed to the cameras that feed the monitors. It\u2019s a safe bet that most of us would like that kind of god\u2019s-eye view into our cities, and with a little tweaking, we could have it.

Imagine a human-centred smart city that knows everything it can about things. It knows how many seats are free on every bus, it knows how busy every road is, it knows where there are short-hire bikes available and where there are potholes. It knows how much footfall every metre of pavement receives, and which public loos are busiest. What it doesn\u2019t know is anything about individuals in the city. It knows about things, not people. All of that data is tremendously useful to the city\u2019s planners and administrators, of course, as a way of planning and optimising services, infrastructure and future building.

Apollo Kazungu, commissioner for refugees, and three of his senior staff \u2013 Walter Omondi, John Baptist Sentamu and Francis Nkwasibwe \u2013 were suspended in February 2018, pending investigations into alleged collusion with staff at the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, and the World Food Programme to exaggerate refugee figures. Kazungu and Sentamu are suing the government for failure to reinstate them after more than a year since they were forcefully indicted. According to government standing orders, if no charges have been brought after six months officials should be allowed to resume work. The four officials are yet to be arraigned and charged in court, while the UNHCR has not announced any action it plans to take against its employees.",

      "bodyText": "Above a hill on the north shore of Lesbos, volunteers watch the sea and the twinkling lights of Turkey day and night with binoculars. The coastguard hurry to respond when they see a boat approaching, trying to arrive in time to stop children falling in the icy cold water as they clamber onto rocks and beaches. On the morning of 11 January, a group of migrants from Afghanistan make it ashore without being spotted and walk to an olive grove where they light a fire and call for help. While they wait for the bus that will take them to the Moria refugee camp, the families hold the young children near the fire to warm them. The toddlers are tearful and sleep deprived, rubbing their tired eyes. After arriving on a dinghy in the early hours of the morning, migrants from Afghanistan warm themselves by a fire There are several unaccompanied minors in the group, including Jalila, who is laughing as she talks, despite the cold and her hunger. \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten for two days, we hope there will be food at the camp.\u201d She feels lucky to be here, to have left behind the Taliban and the violence in her country. \u201cThe Taliban tell me to stop going to school: they say I can read and I know the Koran, that is enough. That is why I left my province to go to Kabul.\u201d But in Kabul she found only violence. \u201cHave you seen the news about Afghanistan? About three times a bomb blasted in front of me. I was in class one time, the school shook. The next time, it was a truck bomb that shook the whole area. My father is an open-minded person, he wants me to leave. He stops the men who want me to be married at a young age. He says, \u2018Inshallah, you will have a bright future.\u2019 The main thing is that he knows Europe is a safe place for girls.\u201d Soon, a bus arrives to take them to Moria camp. Jalila asks: \u201cWill I be able to start school there immediately?\u201d Sadly, there is no school for her in the camp. In fact, as she will discover, there is not even basic shelter from the cold winter nights. While the numbers of migrants on the island are nowhere near those of the height of the crisis in 2015, the closing of European borders since 2016 means that there is no way for people to move off the island \u2013 which is causing a growing humanitarian catastrophe here. The Moria refugee camp was originally intended to hold 3,000 people. As recently as last June there were 5,000 people there, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the only major international NGO that has a presence there. In the last six months it has grown to be a shanty town of 19,000, 40% of whom are under 18. Around 13,000 of those are living in a filthy unofficial camp of tarpaulin tents and makeshift huts made of pallets, in an olive grove surrounding the main site. There is no electricity, not enough water and rivers of mud and rubbish run through the tents. Jalila, 18, from Kabul Jalila is shocked by the conditions she finds on her arrival. The charity who greeted her gave her a coat because there were no tents. \u201cYesterday we arrived here and they gave me a coat and a blanket. They didn\u2019t give me any shelter and all night I slept on the ground. I tell them I don\u2019t have anybody to support me, I\u2019m on my own. The charity who [met] me say there is no solution.\u201d She is irrepressibly optimistic. \u201cI slept under the beautiful stars, so it is OK. I feel safer here than on the journey in Turkey; I could relax a little because I have met many nice people here. I am happy to be here, but I need somewhere warm to sleep.\u201d While nearly half of the migrants here are under 18, a large proportion are under 12. Conditions are disastrously unhygienic. Children play in rivers of mud and piles of rubbish. MSF runs a field clinic just outside the camp, but there is no large scale medical help and they have to prioritise emergencies. The charity is struggling to support thousands of children, some with chronic medical conditions. Children, particularly those under 12, make up nearly half the population of the camp MSF say there is an urgent need for thousands of children to be transferred to the mainland or to other European countries immediately. Even the most vulnerable, including pregnant women and those with newborn babies, have no specialist help. Before Christmas a nine-month old baby died of dehydration, despite the parents seeking help. Saber, 39 Saber is eight months pregnant and has travelled to escape severe fighting in Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, with her husband and six children. She was feeling pains in her stomach when she arrived on Lesbos after travelling for two days but hasn\u2019t been seen by a doctor. The family were given a tiny two-man tent to take into the slum-like conditions of the olive grove. With her bump and pains in her back, Saber couldn\u2019t even bend down far enough to get in. They borrowed \u20ac150 from friends in the camp, bought pallets and nails and are busily building themselves a shack. Only those with money can do this. Feruze, 34, with husband Jarwad and family Feruze is very worried about where her children will sleep tonight. The family had to ask to take shelter in a shack belonging to other Afghans, as they were only given a one-man tent when they arrived. Two of the children are ill but there is no doctor for them to see. The nearby MSF clinic will be open on Monday, two days away, but has to prioritise emergencies. \u201cThe children were so cold last night, we had no blankets. My son is sick, he has been shivering and shaking.\u201d Ahmed, 17 Ahmed has had a horrendous journey to reach Moria camp. \u201cWhen we were crossing the Turkish border, my friend was shot dead in front of me. His uncle managed to get his body back to the village to his mother. I had no idea I would end up in this camp, I thought that I would keep going through the forests like I did in Turkey, just keep moving until I\u2019m safe.\u201d There is no space for him and all he has to keep the rain and sun out is a sheet of tarpaulin which he shares with two friends, also teenagers on their own. \u201cWe huddle together, there are three of us; when it rains it washes everything away. We don\u2019t have pallets: they are only for families.\u201d Migrants build a shelter at the makeshift camp. Only those with money can access building materials \u201cI worry all the time about my family back in Syria, anything could happen, Isis, Turkey could come and take over the village. Our home has already been bombed. And they worry about me, nobody wants their son in this situation. It took a year to decide to leave, but as the situation got worse I had to go.\u201d Amed has a case open for family reunion with his brother and cousin in the north of England. Many of the people living in the camp have fled ongoing bombing, despite the dangers of crossing the Syrian border. Even though there are thousands of children here there is no formal education provided by the Greek authorities, despite pressure from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Of approximately 6,300 children of school age in Lesbos, only around 150 are enrolled in formal schools Inside the official camp there are some informal classes but there is nothing for those in the olive grove. Ali, 33, from Idlib and his family Ali is an English teacher from Idlib, Syria. With his home town destroyed by bombing, he and his family fled, first to the Turkish border, then on to Greece. \u201cWe have been here four months; tomorrow we leave for a camp on the mainland.

As the Senate opened an impeachment trial, the Government Accountability Office released a finding on Thursday morning that suspending military aid for Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/us-senate-impeachment-trial-donald-trump\">broke laws about disbursement of congressionally appropriated funds</a>.</p> \n<p>The Senate has begun the trial preliminaries: the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, was sworn in to preside. He then swore in the 100 senators \u2013 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents \u2013 as jurors. Each senator signed an \u201coath book\u201d signifying a pledge of impartiality. Little else of substance took place and the Senate is due to start the trial proper at 1pm on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Depending whether the trial is allowed to hear from witnesses, key testimony may come from Lev Parnas \u2013 who has given damning accounts of how Trump personally directed an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018President was aware\u2019, says Ukraine fixer Hello, Warren Murray with a mix of Friday\u2019s news picked for you. Donald Trump has been hit with new allegations of wrongdoing by an agency within his own administration over the Ukraine affair. As the Senate opened an impeachment trial, the Government Accountability Office released a finding on Thursday morning that suspending military aid for Ukraine broke laws about disbursement of congressionally appropriated funds. The Senate has begun the trial preliminaries: the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, was sworn in to preside. He then swore in the 100 senators \u2013 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents \u2013 as jurors. Each senator signed an \u201coath book\u201d signifying a pledge of impartiality. Little else of substance took place and the Senate is due to start the trial proper at 1pm on Tuesday. Depending whether the trial is allowed to hear from witnesses, key testimony may come from Lev Parnas \u2013 who has given damning accounts of how Trump personally directed an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Soviet-born Parnas acted as an intermediary. \u201cHe [Trump] was aware of all my movements,\u201d Parnas told MSNBC. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president.\u201d * * * Guardian exposes Grenfell conflict \u2013 Boris Johnson has told Grenfell survivors he will investigate the role of Benita Mehra in the public inquiry into the fire, after the Guardian revealed she had links through a charity to Arconic, the company that made the tower\u2019s cladding. The prime minister met representatives of the Grenfell community at a pre-arranged visit to Downing Street on Thursday night shortly after it emerged that Mehra was previously president of a charity that received a \u00a371,000 donation from the philanthropic arm of Arconic. * * * \u2018Fracking by stealth\u2019 \u2013 Campaigners have warned the fracking moratorium announced by the UK government does not apply to a process where acid is injected into the earth to dissolve or fracture rock. No permits have yet been granted for acid stimulation in England, but companies commonly use acid wash to clean wells, and activists fear lack of monitoring could lead to \u201cfracking by stealth\u201d. More than 500 academics, politicians and campaigners have signed an open letter calling on the government to ban the practice over fears companies may use it to get around the moratorium. * * * Carillion\u2019s toll on hospitals \u2013 Two new hospitals whose construction was halted by the collapse of Carillion have been delayed by two more years and will run hundreds of millions of pounds over budget, the National Audit Office has reported. The Royal Liverpool, originally scheduled to open in 2017, is now forecast to be completed in the autumn of 2022. The 669-bed Midland Metropolitan in Sandwell, due to open in October 2018, is now expected to open in July 2022. Jon Trickett MP, the shadow cabinet office minister, said the delays were \u201ccompletely unacceptable \u2026 The Conservatives must take responsibility for being asleep at the wheel.\u201d * * * \u2018Self-regulation not working\u2019 \u2013 Social media firms should have to hand over data about who their users are and why they use the sites to reduce suicide among children and young people, psychiatrists have said. \u201cWe will never understand the risks and benefits of social media use unless the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram share their data with researchers,\u201d said Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The government plans to set up a new online safety regulator and the college says it should be given the power to compel firms to hand over data. \u201cSelf-regulation is not working,\u201d said Dubicka. * * * Get well soon \u2013 Soul Circus or Keswick Mountain Festival?

      "body": "<p>\u2018Oh, I\u2019m a bumper!\u201d says Kathy Bates as I reach out to shake her hand. A small fist comes towards me with a large, round, pink-rose ring on the middle finger. We bump and laugh and one of the truly unique American acting powerhouses of the past half-century beams back at me. She has a splendid smile, full of mischief and wisdom: a small and compact woman buoyed by that straight-up, unfeigned southern warmth that abides no matter where you encounter it. She fusses over me kindly, offering drinks \u2013 a world away from the nervous, shy, deeply rattled and easily hurt woman I have just watched in Clint Eastwood\u2019s new movie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/13/richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs-olivia-wilde-irresponsible\" title=\"\">Richard Jewell</a>.</p> <p>Bates plays Bobi, the mother of the eponymous character, a security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Centennial Park, Atlanta, who discovered a backpack full of pipe-bombs, laid by white-supremacist terrorist Eric Rudolph, minutes before it exploded. Although one person died and 111 were injured, Jewell saved countless lives by clearing the area before the bombs exploded. But within days he found himself under a nationwide spotlight as the FBI focused on him as their chief suspect.</p> <p>For 88 days, he and his mother endured a press siege outside their shared apartment \u2013 and a vicious feeding-frenzy in the national media \u2013 until the FBI halfheartedly admitted he hadn\u2019t planted the bomb. Almost a decade later, Rudolph confessed in a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty. Jewell enjoyed only a brief vindication though, dying of heart failure aged 44 in 2007. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21ec85f82b3ae00a1f17a9693fc61e38d4cfd3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21ec85f82b3ae00a1f17a9693fc61e38d4cfd3c0/0_94_4493_2695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bates with Sam Rockwell and Paul Walter Hauser in Richard Jewell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bates with Sam Rockwell and Paul Walter Hauser in Richard Jewell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Folger/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eastwood\u2019s movie is about enormous pressure being brought to bear on people unable to handle it, and Bates and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3236159/\" title=\"\">Paul Walter Hauser</a> do sterling work to delineate the suffering the pair underwent. Hauser is a good-natured fool, a fantasist deluded about his security-guard role, claiming he is \u201claw-enforcement\u201d even as the FBI laugh in his face. Bates\u2019 Bobi is all nerves and near-hysteria, absorbing every blow like a woman on the verge of collapse. But her final speech, the true emotional climax of the movie, burns with a righteous fury, even as the tears fill her eyes. Eastwood needed an actor of commanding stature to deliver weakness, then rage, then fragile strength, and Bates has deservedly earned the lion\u2019s share of the movie\u2019s acclaim.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/oscar-nominations-full-list-for-2020\" title=\"\">it earned her a fourth Oscar nomination</a>; today she is pleased, and nostalgic for her first one, for Misery, back in 1991, which translated into a win. \u201cI arrived home two days before the ceremony. Literally only had enough time to put on the dress. Thank God it fit. The night was a dream come true. My fiance was worried I would lose, but when Daniel Day-Lewis had the envelope in his hands, in my mind I saw my name in it. Heard him say it. Sailed up the steps and forgot to thank my fiance and my mother, who deserved all my thanks sitting at home.</p> <p>\u201cThis time is different,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause Richard Jewell is based on a true story. All we wanted was for Bobi Jewell to feel the film vindicated her son. I wanted her to like my portrayal of her. She\u2019s waited 23 years for justice. I\u2019ve never felt quite like this before. Whatever happens now, I\u2019m just grateful the film will get more eyeballs.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nByAshpybOo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nByAshpybOo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Bates\u2019 voice breaks and her breathing shortens when she speaks about the woman she plays, and with whom she made contact long before shooting started. \u201cIt was my birthday the day we met. She baked me a pound cake. She had the Vanity Fair article the movie is based on, and the script, which she\u2019d annotated with things like: \u2018I\u2019d never do this, I\u2019d never call him that.\u2019 She was very meticulous. It was obvious she\u2019s still absolutely raw from this, even 25 years later. It <em>still</em> affects her, and it\u2019s never going to change.\u201d</p> <p>Everybody loves Bates, but the movie \u2013 with its Trumpish overtones \u2013 has not escaped criticism. The enemies are the media and the \u201cdeep state\u201d. The guy who gets off scot-free is Rudolph \u2013 I tell Bates that particularly disappointed me \u2013 and she seems to partly agree: \u201cRudolph was just evil, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>She also appears sympathetic to disquiet over Olivia Wilde\u2019s character, Kathy Scruggs, the journalist who put Jewell in the headlines in the most negative way \u2013 and is the most venomous portrayal of a woman in an Eastwood movie for many years. Scruggs died of a drug overdose aged 42, which means she can\u2019t defend herself against the film\u2019s claim that she slept with an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) for the scoop.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my day, if you went up to a guy\u2019s room, you knew why you were going and it was consensual</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI <em>was</em> a little uncomfortable with her character,\u201d says Bates, \u201cthough I think Bobi sort of balances that out in the movie.\u201d She and Wilde didn\u2019t share any scenes, \u201cwhich was frustrating, because she\u2019s Irish and I\u2019m Irish, and I think Irish people make the best actors.\u201d Bates looks for the positive. \u201cI loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/booksmart-review-olivia-wilde-beanie-feldstein\" title=\"\">Booksmart</a> [Wilde\u2019s directorial debut].

He\u2019s in this business, but not <em>of</em> it, if you get my drift.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Bates\u2019 admiration for Eastwood beats all. \u201cI remember telling him on the set: \u2018I\u2019ve been in this business half a century but working with you, I feel like I\u2019ve hit the big time!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b3bc3f840b19e58c9d45aa552d5d42146b17768a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3bc3f840b19e58c9d45aa552d5d42146b17768a/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bates in Misery, 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bates in Misery, 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/COLUMBIA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, she hit that some time back. Bates made her movie debut in 1971, in Milos Forman\u2019s Taking Off, as a singer in a crowd scene, for which she was paid $50. Her next screen role wasn\u2019t for another seven years, but she established herself as an exciting new presence in landmark stage productions which, when they were adapted for cinema, routinely traded her for other actors: Michelle Pfeiffer, Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton.</p> <p>She also received a barrage of sexist and appearance-based criticism from male critics, particularly the late Playbill critic <a href=\"http://uncensoredsimon.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">John Simon</a>, whose most benevolent remarks included that she was \u201cenormously overweight\u201d and \u201cunattractive\u201d. She remembers a particularly brutal British press conference for \u201ca bad movie I was in\u201d \u2013 probably 1991\u2019s At Play in the Fields of the Lord.</p> <p>\u201cOne guy was so nasty that I went up to my room and I cried like a kid out of kindergarten. Our producer came in and said: \u2018Kid, you\u2019ve gotta get tough.\u2019 And in the middle of everything I got on a plane and I went home. It was so cruel, so unnecessarily cruel.\u201d</p> <p>Bates is circumspect in hindsight. \u201cThe thing is, you remember those moments for ever,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t remember the exact words, it\u2019s a dart through the heart. But as Harold Clurman said \u2013 something it took me a long time to accept \u2013 \u2018You\u2019ve gotta have the manure, you\u2019ve got to take all the shit to really grow.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I remind her that when she was 41 and promoting Misery, she said: \u201cA woman, a character actress, in her 40s \u2013 I\u2019ll be very interested to see how Hollywood treats us over the next 10 or 15 years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says, 29 years later, \u201cI said that? Holy crap. I didn\u2019t know I was such a smart cookie back then! It was my first big movie and I was <em>stunned</em> by the press. The very first question I got asked at a round table was: \u2018You\u2019re not Michelle Pfeiffer.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not!\u2019\u201d Her face collapses into incredulity. \u201cI was still very serious about things back then.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cd26e89653642e5224d34a1983325ec976ea2da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cd26e89653642e5224d34a1983325ec976ea2da/0_64_1783_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bates in Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bates in Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bates\u2019 position as a female actor who has long dealt with many of the issues in play, post #MeToo, gives her an unusual \u2013 and sometimes difficult \u2013 insight into how the industry has, and has not, evolved.</p> <p>\u201cAbout people like Weinstein and the casting couch and all of that,\u201d she says, \u201cI have a confession. In my day, if you went up to a guy\u2019s hotel room, you knew exactly why you were going and in those days it was consensual. Times were different, but I really support the women who are coming forward now and I\u2019m not happy about the men who are being accused falsely \u2013 but the ones who deserve all they\u2019re getting, my feeling is hey, go for it.\u201d</p> <p>That she wasn\u2019t a classic starlet didn\u2019t insulate her from misogyny\u2019s pigeonholing \u2013 right? \u201cI hate to complain about it, but never being considered the romantic lead \u2013 which is fine, I\u2019m over that, been there, done that \u2013 means they look at me in a different way. But then I look at my friends who are beautiful girls but not working after 40 \u2013 very few of them. Well, Nicole Kidman is \u2026</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so grateful that television is providing all these great roles for us, with people like Ryan Murphy around [the producer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/when-good-tv-goes-bad-american-horror-story\" title=\"\">American Horror Story</a>, which has cast Bates several seasons running] we\u2019ve been given a second life. I give Ryan a lot of credit. That show\u2019s like being in a repertory company. Oh yes, horror has been veeeery good to me!\u201d She chuckles like a fiend.</p> <p>Her movie career took off after Misery, in which she imbued her Nurse Ratched-meets-Medea character with a surprising degree of sweetness and vulnerability. So memorable \u2013 and lauded \u2013 was her performance, people have tended to conflate her with her character Annie Wilkes, even as she was busy building a gallery of richly detailed, multifarious and moving other performances, including the warm-hearted \u201cnew money\u201d Molly Brown in 1997\u2019s Titanic. She puts the film\u2019s enduring appeal down to the wealth inequality at its centre: \u201cThe murder of the third-class passengers being locked below decks revealed the brutality of class struggles around the globe.\u201d That, too, is perhaps why <a href=\"https://gawker.com/5942976/james-cameron-debunks-room-for-two-on-titanic-raft-meme-its-a-question-of-buoyancy\" title=\"\">raft-gate</a> persists as a debate: \u201cWe all wanted Jack to survive, and there did seem to be enough room for him to squeeze on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"429aa950a6f663f363e4a82d57987c0540dbefb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/429aa950a6f663f363e4a82d57987c0540dbefb8/0_26_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kathy Bates in About Schmidt.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kathy Bates in About Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudette Barius/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years later, another indelible turn: opposite Jack Nicholson in Alexander Payne\u2019s About Schmidt. A nude hot-tub scene went a long way to shake off the memory of Misery. \u201cI think a lot of women in that audience were thrilled to see a real woman up there on the screen in all her glory,\u201d she said at the time. Stripped of its nudity context, I suggest, that almost sounds like a proud rallying cry for the kinds of characters she takes on.</p> <p>\u201cIt does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she nods. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m proud of anything, it\u2019s leaving behind me such a wide range of interesting, <em>real</em> women.\u201d</p> <p>Not that she would rule out supernatural women, she adds. \u201cI would love to play a character with magical abilities.

She came through ovarian cancer in 2003, but in 2012 had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. After, she suffered lymphedema \u2013 a condition that makes the arms rock-solid as lymphatic fluid drains out under the fingernails, and which, she discovered, was barely understood by medical professionals.</p> <p>\u201cI dated a guy who had melanoma in his armpit and they took everything out and as a result his arm was like wood. I pleaded with my surgeon not to take any lymph nodes out.\u201d He ignored her. Since then she has been raising awareness of lymphatic edema: \u201cmore people have it than MS, muscular dystrophy, ALS and Aids combined \u2013 and nobody knows about it.\u201d</p> <p>She is the spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://lymphaticnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Lymphatic Education &amp; Research Network</a>. \u201cI spoke before the American Society of Breast Surgeons and it\u2019s so hard to convince them \u2013 Nobel laureates! I gave them these statistics and there were <em>gasps</em> in that room.\u201d Though she likes Twitter, she mostly uses it for getting the word out about the condition. \u201cI joined in 2011 and initially used it to engage with fans and then it got to be so time-consuming that I had to cut back. Then after a couple of unpleasant experiences with fans I rarely use it and I don\u2019t get sucked into provocative tweets.\u201d</p> <p>She worries about a general \u201cclimate of hate\u201d that\u2019s \u201cgetting stronger in my opinion\u201d, particularly when it comes to LGBT rights; in 2016 she was involved in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq6xRZlCSoM\" title=\"\">video</a> telling the stories of victims in the Orlando shooting. \u201cViciousness is bred in the bone and will take generations to reverse. I worry about my gay and transgender friends.\u201d</p> <p>But Bates remains a bumper to the end. Next month is going to be mostly about awards ceremonies, and one Oscar victory and two losses have left her a perennial optimist. \u201cI learned you always think you\u2019re going to win, the moment they announce your name.\u201d</p> <p><em>Richard Jewell is released in the UK on 31 January</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2020 because an earlier version misspelled Harold Clurman\u2019s last name as Klurman.

We bump and laugh and one of the truly unique American acting powerhouses of the past half-century beams back at me. She has a splendid smile, full of mischief and wisdom: a small and compact woman buoyed by that straight-up, unfeigned southern warmth that abides no matter where you encounter it. She fusses over me kindly, offering drinks \u2013 a world away from the nervous, shy, deeply rattled and easily hurt woman I have just watched in Clint Eastwood\u2019s new movie, Richard Jewell. Bates plays Bobi, the mother of the eponymous character, a security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Centennial Park, Atlanta, who discovered a backpack full of pipe-bombs, laid by white-supremacist terrorist Eric Rudolph, minutes before it exploded. Although one person died and 111 were injured, Jewell saved countless lives by clearing the area before the bombs exploded. But within days he found himself under a nationwide spotlight as the FBI focused on him as their chief suspect. For 88 days, he and his mother endured a press siege outside their shared apartment \u2013 and a vicious feeding-frenzy in the national media \u2013 until the FBI halfheartedly admitted he hadn\u2019t planted the bomb. Almost a decade later, Rudolph confessed in a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty. Jewell enjoyed only a brief vindication though, dying of heart failure aged 44 in 2007. Eastwood\u2019s movie is about enormous pressure being brought to bear on people unable to handle it, and Bates and Paul Walter Hauser do sterling work to delineate the suffering the pair underwent. Hauser is a good-natured fool, a fantasist deluded about his security-guard role, claiming he is \u201claw-enforcement\u201d even as the FBI laugh in his face. Bates\u2019 Bobi is all nerves and near-hysteria, absorbing every blow like a woman on the verge of collapse. But her final speech, the true emotional climax of the movie, burns with a righteous fury, even as the tears fill her eyes. Eastwood needed an actor of commanding stature to deliver weakness, then rage, then fragile strength, and Bates has deservedly earned the lion\u2019s share of the movie\u2019s acclaim. On Monday, it earned her a fourth Oscar nomination; today she is pleased, and nostalgic for her first one, for Misery, back in 1991, which translated into a win. \u201cI arrived home two days before the ceremony. Literally only had enough time to put on the dress. Thank God it fit. The night was a dream come true. My fiance was worried I would lose, but when Daniel Day-Lewis had the envelope in his hands, in my mind I saw my name in it. Heard him say it. Sailed up the steps and forgot to thank my fiance and my mother, who deserved all my thanks sitting at home. \u201cThis time is different,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause Richard Jewell is based on a true story. All we wanted was for Bobi Jewell to feel the film vindicated her son. I wanted her to like my portrayal of her. She\u2019s waited 23 years for justice. I\u2019ve never felt quite like this before. Whatever happens now, I\u2019m just grateful the film will get more eyeballs.\u201d Bates\u2019 voice breaks and her breathing shortens when she speaks about the woman she plays, and with whom she made contact long before shooting started. \u201cIt was my birthday the day we met. She baked me a pound cake. She had the Vanity Fair article the movie is based on, and the script, which she\u2019d annotated with things like: \u2018I\u2019d never do this, I\u2019d never call him that.\u2019 She was very meticulous. It was obvious she\u2019s still absolutely raw from this, even 25 years later. It still affects her, and it\u2019s never going to change.\u201d Everybody loves Bates, but the movie \u2013 with its Trumpish overtones \u2013 has not escaped criticism. The enemies are the media and the \u201cdeep state\u201d. The guy who gets off scot-free is Rudolph \u2013 I tell Bates that particularly disappointed me \u2013 and she seems to partly agree: \u201cRudolph was just evil, obviously.\u201d She also appears sympathetic to disquiet over Olivia Wilde\u2019s character, Kathy Scruggs, the journalist who put Jewell in the headlines in the most negative way \u2013 and is the most venomous portrayal of a woman in an Eastwood movie for many years. Scruggs died of a drug overdose aged 42, which means she can\u2019t defend herself against the film\u2019s claim that she slept with an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) for the scoop. \u201cI was a little uncomfortable with her character,\u201d says Bates, \u201cthough I think Bobi sort of balances that out in the movie.\u201d She and Wilde didn\u2019t share any scenes, \u201cwhich was frustrating, because she\u2019s Irish and I\u2019m Irish, and I think Irish people make the best actors.\u201d Bates looks for the positive. \u201cI loved Booksmart [Wilde\u2019s directorial debut]. She\u2019s a brilliant director \u2013 and that counts for a lot.\u201d This season, Bates has also admired Joker, Jojo Rabbit (\u201cunique, heart-rending and so relevant \u2013 as is Parasite\u201d) and Little Women. \u201cIt was absolutely delightful in every way. I adored it. I\u2019m sick Greta Gerwig didn\u2019t get a directing nomination. Her adaptation was incredible, but her vision as a director is on that screen in every word and moment of those performances.\u201d She has also been trading larky congratulations \u2013 and commiserations \u2013 with Uncut Gems star Adam Sandler, who played her son in The Waterboy. \u201cYou was robbed!! But Mama loves you!!! \u2026 You da GOAT!!\u201d she told him on Twitter. She expands, a touch more soberly: \u201cAdam is a kind and gentle man. Friends and family are very important to him. He\u2019s in this business, but not of it, if you get my drift.\u201d Still, Bates\u2019 admiration for Eastwood beats all. \u201cI remember telling him on the set: \u2018I\u2019ve been in this business half a century but working with you, I feel like I\u2019ve hit the big time!\u2019\u201d In truth, she hit that some time back. Bates made her movie debut in 1971, in Milos Forman\u2019s Taking Off, as a singer in a crowd scene, for which she was paid $50. Her next screen role wasn\u2019t for another seven years, but she established herself as an exciting new presence in landmark stage productions which, when they were adapted for cinema, routinely traded her for other actors: Michelle Pfeiffer, Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton. She also received a barrage of sexist and appearance-based criticism from male critics, particularly the late Playbill critic John Simon, whose most benevolent remarks included that she was \u201cenormously overweight\u201d and \u201cunattractive\u201d. She remembers a particularly brutal British press conference for \u201ca bad movie I was in\u201d \u2013 probably 1991\u2019s At Play in the Fields of the Lord. \u201cOne guy was so nasty that I went up to my room and I cried like a kid out of kindergarten. Our producer came in and said: \u2018Kid, you\u2019ve gotta get tough.\u2019 And in the middle of everything I got on a plane and I went home. It was so cruel, so unnecessarily cruel.\u201d Bates is circumspect in hindsight. \u201cThe thing is, you remember those moments for ever,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t remember the exact words, it\u2019s a dart through the heart. But as Harold Clurman said \u2013 something it took me a long time to accept \u2013 \u2018You\u2019ve gotta have the manure, you\u2019ve got to take all the shit to really grow.\u2019\u201d I remind her that when she was 41 and promoting Misery, she said: \u201cA woman, a character actress, in her 40s \u2013 I\u2019ll be very interested to see how Hollywood treats us over the next 10 or 15 years.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d she says, 29 years later, \u201cI said that? Holy crap. I didn\u2019t know I was such a smart cookie back then! It was my first big movie and I was stunned by the press. The very first question I got asked at a round table was: \u2018You\u2019re not Michelle Pfeiffer.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not!\u2019\u201d Her face collapses into incredulity. \u201cI was still very serious about things back then.\u201d Bates\u2019 position as a female actor who has long dealt with many of the issues in play, post #MeToo, gives her an unusual \u2013 and sometimes difficult \u2013 insight into how the industry has, and has not, evolved. \u201cAbout people like Weinstein and the casting couch and all of that,\u201d she says, \u201cI have a confession. In my day, if you went up to a guy\u2019s hotel room, you knew exactly why you were going and in those days it was consensual. Times were different, but I really support the women who are coming forward now and I\u2019m not happy about the men who are being accused falsely \u2013 but the ones who deserve all they\u2019re getting, my feeling is hey, go for it.\u201d That she wasn\u2019t a classic starlet didn\u2019t insulate her from misogyny\u2019s pigeonholing \u2013 right? \u201cI hate to complain about it, but never being considered the romantic lead \u2013 which is fine, I\u2019m over that, been there, done that \u2013 means they look at me in a different way. But then I look at my friends who are beautiful girls but not working after 40 \u2013 very few of them. Well, Nicole Kidman is \u2026 \u201cBut I\u2019m so grateful that television is providing all these great roles for us, with people like Ryan Murphy around [the producer of American Horror Story, which has cast Bates several seasons running] we\u2019ve been given a second life. I give Ryan a lot of credit. That show\u2019s like being in a repertory company. Oh yes, horror has been veeeery good to me!\u201d She chuckles like a fiend. Her movie career took off after Misery, in which she imbued her Nurse Ratched-meets-Medea character with a surprising degree of sweetness and vulnerability. So memorable \u2013 and lauded \u2013 was her performance, people have tended to conflate her with her character Annie Wilkes, even as she was busy building a gallery of richly detailed, multifarious and moving other performances, including the warm-hearted \u201cnew money\u201d Molly Brown in 1997\u2019s Titanic. She puts the film\u2019s enduring appeal down to the wealth inequality at its centre: \u201cThe murder of the third-class passengers being locked below decks revealed the brutality of class struggles around the globe.\u201d That, too, is perhaps why raft-gate persists as a debate: \u201cWe all wanted Jack to survive, and there did seem to be enough room for him to squeeze on.\u201d Five years later, another indelible turn: opposite Jack Nicholson in Alexander Payne\u2019s About Schmidt. A nude hot-tub scene went a long way to shake off the memory of Misery. \u201cI think a lot of women in that audience were thrilled to see a real woman up there on the screen in all her glory,\u201d she said at the time. Stripped of its nudity context, I suggest, that almost sounds like a proud rallying cry for the kinds of characters she takes on. \u201cIt does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she nods. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m proud of anything, it\u2019s leaving behind me such a wide range of interesting, real women.\u201d Not that she would rule out supernatural women, she adds. \u201cI would love to play a character with magical abilities. I enjoy superhero movies as long as the story is well written and the characters have wit and heart, like Iron Man and Star Wars. Otherwise soulless characters in a plastic universe don\u2019t appeal.\u201d Today, at 71, Bates looks chipper and fit. She came through ovarian cancer in 2003, but in 2012 had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. After, she suffered lymphedema \u2013 a condition that makes the arms rock-solid as lymphatic fluid drains out under the fingernails, and which, she discovered, was barely understood by medical professionals. \u201cI dated a guy who had melanoma in his armpit and they took everything out and as a result his arm was like wood. I pleaded with my surgeon not to take any lymph nodes out.\u201d He ignored her. Since then she has been raising awareness of lymphatic edema: \u201cmore people have it than MS, muscular dystrophy, ALS and Aids combined \u2013 and nobody knows about it.\u201d She is the spokesperson for the Lymphatic Education &amp; Research Network. \u201cI spoke before the American Society of Breast Surgeons and it\u2019s so hard to convince them \u2013 Nobel laureates! I gave them these statistics and there were gasps in that room.\u201d Though she likes Twitter, she mostly uses it for getting the word out about the condition. \u201cI joined in 2011 and initially used it to engage with fans and then it got to be so time-consuming that I had to cut back. Then after a couple of unpleasant experiences with fans I rarely use it and I don\u2019t get sucked into provocative tweets.\u201d She worries about a general \u201cclimate of hate\u201d that\u2019s \u201cgetting stronger in my opinion\u201d, particularly when it comes to LGBT rights; in 2016 she was involved in a video telling the stories of victims in the Orlando shooting. \u201cViciousness is bred in the bone and will take generations to reverse. I worry about my gay and transgender friends.\u201d But Bates remains a bumper to the end. Next month is going to be mostly about awards ceremonies, and one Oscar victory and two losses have left her a perennial optimist. \u201cI learned you always think you\u2019re going to win, the moment they announce your name.\u201d Richard Jewell is released in the UK on 31 January \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2020 because an earlier version misspelled Harold Clurman\u2019s last name as Klurman. This has been corrected.",

It said that government promises to boost funding in the physical infrastructure of northern and Midland towns must be accompanied by investment in their voluntary sector and local authorities to help renew communities after years of austerity-driven cuts. \u201cThese areas do need shiny new train lines and decent roads, but you do not make a successful community without a rich tapestry of vibrant community organisations,\u201d said Dan Corry, chief executive of NPC. The report locates charities using their charity commission registered address, together with their stated geographical area of operations.

Cuts to council budgets not only resulted in reductions in direct grants to local charities, but saw the closure of services such as Sure Start, community centres and youth clubs which could be instrumental in attracting volunteers and maintaining an area\u2019s social fabric, especially in poorer areas. Local voluntary groups in deprived areas \u2013 especially those dealing with poverty, mental health and social care \u2013 have reported that reductions in their grant funding meant they struggle to keep pace with spiralling demand from residents caused directly by cuts to benefits and local health and care services.

      "bodyText": "The Fijian government has called for strong action on the climate crisis as the country is hit by its second cyclone in three weeks. Fiji opened evacuation centres, closed schools and urged businesses to close early as cyclone Tino barrelled towards Fiji\u2019s second-largest island, Vanua Levu, on Friday. The Fiji meteorological service warned of wind gusts of up to 130km/h (80 mph), heavy rain, coastal flooding and flash flooding in low-lying areas, while police said two people \u2013 a man and his young daughter \u2013 were missing after trying to swim across a flooded river. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, linked the arrival of Tino to the climate crisis, writing on Twitter: \u201cFiji is counting mode to its 2nd cyclone in 2020 today. It and other ocean states look to the UN in its superyear for nature to finally shift the needle on warming oceans.\u201d The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who has been an outspoken leader on the climate crisis and was the president of COP23, the UN\u2019s premier climate change body, retweeted Prasad\u2019s tweet. He wrote for the Guardian earlier this month about the need for urgent action to combat the climate crisis as the impacts are felt across the region, including through cyclones in Fiji and bushfires in Australia. On the outer islands of Fiji, locals prepared to go to emergency shelters while many tourists fled beach resorts and made their way to the capital, Suva, before regional flights and inter-island ferry services were suspended. Tino is the second cyclone to hit Fiji in less than a month. Tropical cyclone Sarai left two people dead and more than 2,500 needing emergency shelter after making landfall just after Christmas, damaging houses, crops and trees and cutting electricity supplies. \u201cI\u2019m preparing to go to an evacuation centre soon with my family and wait for the cyclone to pass,\u201d said Nischal Prasad, who lost his home in northern Vanua Legu when Sarai struck. \u201cSarai destroyed my house and almost left my family homeless. My daughters had to hide under their bed from the strong winds. It was a scary experience.\u201d A Russian tourist, Inna Kostromina, 35, said she sought safety in Suva after being told her island resort was in the path of the cyclone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get stuck in there and with the authorities warning of coastal flooding, anything can happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we decided to move to Suva for now. I think we will be much safer here.\u201d Police said a man and his daughter, believed to be aged nine or 10, were trying to swim across a flooded river when they were caught in the strong currents. The incident happened on Thursday before the storm developed into a tropical cyclone, but a police spokesman linked the tragedy to \u201cheavy rain brought about by the current weather system [which] raised the river level\u201d. Although the Pacific islands are popular tourist destinations in summer it is also the cyclone season. The cyclone also caused damage in Tuvalu, a small low-lying island about three hours north of Fiji. On its present track Tino would hit Tongatapu, the main island of neighbouring Tonga, at the weekend. Two years ago Tongatapu was hit by cyclone Gina, with two people killed and nearly 200 houses destroyed.",

Scientists say just one person is enough to spread soil that could infect an entire forest.</p> <p>While there could be other culprits, such as pigs, birds or rats, Kelleher said: \u201cA pig in the Waitakere ranges doesn\u2019t go and get in its car at the end of the weekend and drive to a complete new forest.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of the challenge, particularly in the Waitakere ranges west of Auckland, was enormous. She said New Zealand could be unique in facing a tree pest control problem in such a large area that was also so accessible to the public.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that there has been any situation where we\u2019ve thought to close an area of that kind of geographic size, with that kind of visitor use profile of over a million visitors a year,\u201d she said, referring to the Waitakere ranges area.</p> <p>There, 16,000ha of regional park are dotted with more than 90 formal entrance points and 200km of walking tracks. Compliance officers rely on cameras and spot checks to catch people using closed tracks.</p> <h2>\u2018Twenty people could wipe out 20 forests\u2019</h2> <p>In some spots this summer fences barring hikers from accessing certain areas had been vandalised or removed.</p> <p>However, officials say awareness of the disease has increased and most people had stayed off the closed tracks. But it had been disappointing to find so many people breaking the rules, said Steve Pearce, the council\u2019s regulatory compliance manager.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty people, any one of them could have easily wiped out a forest or two or 20,\u201d he said, adding that two years ago he could not have imagined issuing trespass notices for the New Zealand bush over a tree pest.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really depressing when you go out and see these big, white dead [kauri],\u201d he said.</p> <p>When kauri die they take on a ghostly white appearance.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so shocking to see the significant change in the forest since this disease has been known,\u201d Pearce said.</p> <p>Agencies and local authorities around New Zealand are sharing information about the disease\u2019s spread.

The culprits were mostly locals who knew they were breaching orders to stay off the tracks. \u201cThe types of things we\u2019ve heard is that they understand the issue but believe that they are able to manage themselves appropriately,\u201d said Rachel Kelleher, the regional park manager for Auckland council. \u201cBecause they feel they can manage themselves appropriately, they believe they\u2019ve got a different entitlement to others.\u201d However, there were not only fears about the spread of the fungus in and out of each park, with the risk of another area being infected if a hiker\u2019s shoes were worn elsewhere, but also the spread of the disease within each park, where some areas are pristine but others are badly infected. Scientists say just one person is enough to spread soil that could infect an entire forest. While there could be other culprits, such as pigs, birds or rats, Kelleher said: \u201cA pig in the Waitakere ranges doesn\u2019t go and get in its car at the end of the weekend and drive to a complete new forest.\u201d The scale of the challenge, particularly in the Waitakere ranges west of Auckland, was enormous. She said New Zealand could be unique in facing a tree pest control problem in such a large area that was also so accessible to the public. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there has been any situation where we\u2019ve thought to close an area of that kind of geographic size, with that kind of visitor use profile of over a million visitors a year,\u201d she said, referring to the Waitakere ranges area. There, 16,000ha of regional park are dotted with more than 90 formal entrance points and 200km of walking tracks. Compliance officers rely on cameras and spot checks to catch people using closed tracks. \u2018Twenty people could wipe out 20 forests\u2019 In some spots this summer fences barring hikers from accessing certain areas had been vandalised or removed. However, officials say awareness of the disease has increased and most people had stayed off the closed tracks. But it had been disappointing to find so many people breaking the rules, said Steve Pearce, the council\u2019s regulatory compliance manager. \u201cTwenty people, any one of them could have easily wiped out a forest or two or 20,\u201d he said, adding that two years ago he could not have imagined issuing trespass notices for the New Zealand bush over a tree pest. \u201cIt\u2019s really depressing when you go out and see these big, white dead [kauri],\u201d he said. When kauri die they take on a ghostly white appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s so shocking to see the significant change in the forest since this disease has been known,\u201d Pearce said. Agencies and local authorities around New Zealand are sharing information about the disease\u2019s spread. But it was frustrating that a national plan for kauri dieback, which was first suggested by New Zealand\u2019s government in 2017 and would create a consistent national approach, had failed to materialise. \u201cIf central government would step up and provide more funding and provide more rigour to it, that\u2019d be great,\u201d said Pearce. Jenny Salesa, a Labour party MP, said the national plan to combat kauri dieback was \u201cprogressing\u201d. \u201cIn budget 2019, our government announced a new investment of $20.75m over the next four years into kauri dieback research,\u201d she said. While Auckland council said it would continue its enforcement efforts and work to upgrade infrastructure of the tracks \u2013 with some trails reopened as rangers assessed the spread of the fungus could be managed \u2013 it will be years before scientists know whether keeping people off the paths was enough to save the kauri. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantees,\u201d said Lisa Tolich, Auckland council\u2019s biosecurity team manager. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of gaps in the science.\u201d Those gaps included whether other native species were hosting the fungus, and its long latency period. The length of time from when a forest is infected to the time when symptoms materialise can be 15 years. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019ve had to draw a line in the sand and say, managing risk and doing what we can in the absence of the knowledge, what is the least risk we can take?\u201d Tolich said.",

Triggered by a sudden hike in fuel costs, people in 29 of the country\u2019s 31 provinces rose up against the government in unprecedented numbers. They met a response that was brutal even by the Islamic Republic\u2019s standards: at least 304 people were killed, according to one credible count, with other estimates putting the death toll as high as 1,500.</p> <p>Yet despite this mass unrest, and outbreaks of dissent in Tehran and other cities this week, few analysts believe the Iranian regime is on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s economy is likely to stabilise in 2020, albeit in a miserable place, according to IMF forecasts from October. If the Trump administration had been hoping that strangling Iran\u2019s economy would force its leaders to negotiate a new, wider reaching nuclear deal with Washington in 2020, that strategy appeared to be failing, said Batmanghelidj.</p> <p>\u201cIran\u2019s economy is holding up better than people think,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt it is failing to achieve the kind of growth that is politically or socially necessary, but the US is failing to bring Iran\u2019s economy to its knees.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, the downturn might consolidate power in the hands of hardliners. Renewed tensions with the US have hastened a decline in support for the president, Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatic conservative in an alliance with reformists, who came to power in 2013 on promises of re-engaging with the outside world and reaping the economic benefits.</p> <p>He defeated hardliners who argued the US and Europe could never be trusted. In the eyes of many, the isolationists have been proven correct.

      "bodyText": "Scrap metal dumped in piles around Tehran has traditionally been good business for Jaafar. For nearly three decades, the Afghan migrant has sold what he finds to small factories, sending most of what he earns to his family back home. Lately, that hasn\u2019t been much. \u201cI can only afford enough bread for myself,\u201d he says. The waste picker, 50, is one of millions of people in Iran caught in the jaws of Donald Trump\u2019s policy of enforcing \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on the country by suffocating its economy with sanctions. He could return home, he says, but there he would collide with another overseas American project. \u201cWe are in limbo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t go home because of the war, but we can\u2019t stay here either because of the sanctions.\u201d Iran has been convulsed with grief and rage in the past fortnight, and fear of a war with the US that at some points felt imminent. But even before a chain of events unleashed when the US responded to attacks on its embassy in Baghdad by assassinating a top Iranian general, Qassem Suleimani, people in Iran were bracing for a year of danger and misery. Following Iran\u2019s admission that it shot down a Ukrainian airliner, protests in Tehran and other cities this week were quickly dispersed, but conditions are ripe for more unrest. Sanctions, piled on top of an already sluggish economy, are biting hard. The cost of health and medical services jumped by a fifth in 2019, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran. So did housing costs. Meat became 57% more expensive, putting it out of reach of many poorer families. More than 1.6 million Iranians have fallen into poverty since the American sanctions were re-imposed, according to Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of the media service Bourse &amp; Bazaar, which fosters business links between Iran and Europe. \u201cThe maximum pressure sanctions are advertised as measures against the Iranian state, but are functioning most effectively as measures against the Iranian people,\u201d Batmanghelidj says. The pain is being felt not just among the poor and migrant workers such as Jaafar. \u201cI am middle class and had an easy life before,\u201d said Mehdi, 49, an IT worker from the south-central city of Shiraz. \u201c[Before] I could travel to either Turkey or Delhi once a year. I can\u2019t any more \u2026 I see my family and I getting poorer day by day.\u201d \u201cInflation is the biggest problem and it\u2019s affecting everyone,\u201d said Amir, 38, who works for a development company in Tehran. \u201cMy income has decreased by around 15 to 20% in a year but the price of meat and groceries has doubled. My wife and I both work and we used to save millions of Iranian rials. This year we barely saved anything. We are living in the hardest phase in Iran since the [1979] revolution.\u201d The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the elite, ideologically hardline branch of the Iranian military that advocates limiting engagement with the west, is thought to be suffering less than most: they control the borders, and therefore access to the smuggling routes that become increasingly lucrative as legal trade is blocked. But with Iran\u2019s economy shrinking by 9.5% last year, the most since the height of the country\u2019s war with Iraq, their sprawling business interests have also taken a hit, says Ali Alfoneh, the author of a book on the IRGC. \u201cIn the past, the IRGC benefited from sanctions as its contracting arm replaced foreign companies engaged in major infrastructure development projects, in particular in the oil and gas sector,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, now that foreign presence in Iran\u2019s economy is minimal and the IRGC already has taken over those [existing] projects, the Iranian economy in its entirety is contracting, and the IRGC is also suffering.\u201d In November, Iranians did what policymakers in Washington might have been hoping for. Triggered by a sudden hike in fuel costs, people in 29 of the country\u2019s 31 provinces rose up against the government in unprecedented numbers. They met a response that was brutal even by the Islamic Republic\u2019s standards: at least 304 people were killed, according to one credible count, with other estimates putting the death toll as high as 1,500. Yet despite this mass unrest, and outbreaks of dissent in Tehran and other cities this week, few analysts believe the Iranian regime is on the brink of collapse. Iran\u2019s economy is likely to stabilise in 2020, albeit in a miserable place, according to IMF forecasts from October. If the Trump administration had been hoping that strangling Iran\u2019s economy would force its leaders to negotiate a new, wider reaching nuclear deal with Washington in 2020, that strategy appeared to be failing, said Batmanghelidj. \u201cIran\u2019s economy is holding up better than people think,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no doubt it is failing to achieve the kind of growth that is politically or socially necessary, but the US is failing to bring Iran\u2019s economy to its knees.\u201d Instead, the downturn might consolidate power in the hands of hardliners. Renewed tensions with the US have hastened a decline in support for the president, Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatic conservative in an alliance with reformists, who came to power in 2013 on promises of re-engaging with the outside world and reaping the economic benefits. He defeated hardliners who argued the US and Europe could never be trusted. In the eyes of many, the isolationists have been proven correct. Just how unpopular Rouhani\u2019s forces have become will be clearer in February, when Iranians vote in parliamentary elections \u2013 in which many reform-minded candidates, including 90 incumbents, have already been disqualified by Iran\u2019s clerical rulers. \u201cMost analysts would say that Trump has undercut the reformists so much that there is no way they will make headway,\u201d said Rouzbeh Parsi, a historian of Iran at Sweden\u2019s Lund University. \u201cEven if they aren\u2019t erased, the elections will radically weaken them.\u201d Factions are always rising and falling in influence in Iran\u2019s government, but the diminishing of Rouhani\u2019s reformers comes at a sensitive time: presidential elections are due in 2021 and Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, turns 81 this year. His death will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the Islamic Republic from its highest post \u2013 and might come at a low ebb for forces in favour of engaging with the outside world. Caught in between these domestic and international power struggles are the Iranian people. This week, a group of students who protested at Tehran\u2019s Amir Kabir University against the government\u2019s mistaken shooting down of the passenger jet, voiced their despair. \u201cThese days, Iran is drowning in sorrow and grief,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhile economic policies and political repression suffocate the people, the shadow of war looms over our heads.

The projects that received funding were all eligible to receive it, and the <a href=\"https://www.finance.gov.au/government/commonwealth-grants/commonwealth-grants-rules-guidelines\">usual rules around Commonwealth grants</a> don\u2019t apply in this case.</p> <p>But as Melbourne University integrity expert George Rennie observed this week:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s been said before, but worth repeating: the rules are broken.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s test this proposition. The rules \u2013 if none were broken, as McKenzie says \u2013 allow a minister to divert taxpayers\u2019 money for political gain, in the process overriding their department\u2019s considered recommendations on where the money would be best spent.</p> <p>No pub in the country would give that a pass mark.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another, more fundamental problem. There are serious questions over whether there was any legal basis whatsoever for McKenzie\u2019s office to decide where the money should go.</p> <p>To appreciate this, you\u2019ll need a rudimentary understanding of how the program in question \u2013 the community sport infrastructure grant program \u2013 works.</p> <p>The scheme first came into existence in 2018.

      "bodyText": "In 1994, at the height of an eerily familiar sports rorts scandal, John Howard stood up in parliament and fired a question at besieged Labor sports minister Ros Kelly. Does the minister agree that, whatever debate there may be concerning the principle of ministerial responsibility, the practice has almost invariably been that a minister resigns when his or her continued presence is causing damage and embarrassment to that government? The scandal Kelly faced was a near carbon copy of the one now embroiling Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie. In both cases, audits found damning failures in the administration of sports grant programs. In both cases, ministers were found to have been influenced by political bias in deciding where money went. But, for now at least, there\u2019s a critical difference. Kelly resigned within weeks of Howard\u2019s question. McKenzie looks as though she\u2019s going nowhere. She\u2019s dug in, branding suggestions she resign as \u201cridiculous\u201d. So how is McKenzie defending herself from the damning findings of the auditor-general? And does her defence stack up? 1. \u2018No rules were broken\u2019 The chief defence of the former sports minister, now agriculture minister, is simply that no rules were broken. This may well be true. The projects that received funding were all eligible to receive it, and the usual rules around Commonwealth grants don\u2019t apply in this case. But as Melbourne University integrity expert George Rennie observed this week: It\u2019s been said before, but worth repeating: the rules are broken. Let\u2019s test this proposition. The rules \u2013 if none were broken, as McKenzie says \u2013 allow a minister to divert taxpayers\u2019 money for political gain, in the process overriding their department\u2019s considered recommendations on where the money would be best spent. No pub in the country would give that a pass mark. But there\u2019s another, more fundamental problem. There are serious questions over whether there was any legal basis whatsoever for McKenzie\u2019s office to decide where the money should go. To appreciate this, you\u2019ll need a rudimentary understanding of how the program in question \u2013 the community sport infrastructure grant program \u2013 works. The scheme first came into existence in 2018. It was designed to dole out $100m across three rounds to fund worthy projects proposed by sports clubs, councils and sporting associations nationwide. The aim was to improve sport infrastructure \u2013 oval upgrades, lighting improvements, new changing rooms, for example \u2013 and boost community sports and physical activity in the process. So far, so good. It was wildly popular. When it first opened, Sport Australia, the government body that administered the program, received 2,056 applications for projects worth $397m. Clearly, not all of them could be winners. So, to work out how to best spend the money, Sport Australia assessed each project against a set of criteria, giving each proposal an overall aggregate score. The scores are important for two reasons. They ensured the most needy and worthwhile projects got the money, and also prevented taxpayer funds from being wasted on risky endeavours. To be successful, a project would generally need a score of 74 out of 100. Yet a staggering 417 projects, or 61% of the total approved projects, received money despite being assessed below this score. One of the projects that got the money received a score of 39. Scores that low were considered by Sport Australia to be \u201ctoo low to fund without significant risk to the completion period and/or safe passage of the project\u201d. For its part, Sport Australia did nothing wrong when examining the merits of the projects. It made its guidelines for assessing projects public and largely stuck to them. So, how on earth could this happen? Well, it all comes down to ministerial discretion. The projects were sent up to McKenzie\u2019s office for a final sign-off. McKenzie\u2019s office ran its own parallel assessment process, and doled out the money as it saw fit. The minister\u2019s assessments took into account extraneous factors, outside of Sport Australia\u2019s guidelines. The approvals, the auditor found, were plagued by distributional bias and tended to go to electorates that were marginal, or that the Coalition was targeting in the upcoming election. So, according to the auditor, it was at this ministerial level that an otherwise sound process was warped. The auditor-general Grant Hehir said it was not clear what legal basis McKenzie had for taking on an \u201capproval role\u201d in the program. \u201cIt is not evident to the [Australian National Audit Office] what the legal authority was,\u201d his report said. Sport Australia had recognised in mid-2018 that the relevant law \u2013 the Australian Sports Commission Act \u2013 required it to authorise the grants, not the minister. The health department raised a similar issue and said that if the minister wanted to be the final decision-maker, her office would need to seek legal advice. No such legal advice was sought. So is McKenzie right that no rules were broken, when there is a cloud over the entire legal foundation she used to exercise power as a decision-maker? If so, then surely, as Rennie argues, the rules are in serious need of reform. 2. \u2018My intervention helped Labor\u2019 McKenzie coined an interesting term in her defence this week: \u201creverse pork-barrelling\u201d. She used the term to claim her intervention had, in fact, led to a greater level of support for projects in Labor seats. McKenzie said 26% of the recommended projects were in Labor electorates. Her interventions raised the final proportion of approved projects in Labor seats to 34%. Ministerial discretion was actually written into the guidelines for a purpose. And what that actually meant was that there were more projects supported and funded in Labor seats than if that ministerial discretion had not been deployed. This is a flawed argument on a number of levels. But, most importantly, it conflicts with the clear findings of the audit report. The report states unequivocally that the minister\u2019s approach in deciding where to distribute the money was influenced by the Coalition\u2019s pursuit of marginal and targeted seats at last year\u2019s election. It\u2019s all there in the minister\u2019s own records. Documents show that in November 2018 the minister had identified 705 projects in marginal or targeted seats, including 481 projects in 30 Coalition-held electorates, 126 projects in 13 Labor-held electorates, and 98 projects in four electorates held by independents. \u201cThe award of funding reflected the approach documented by the Minister\u2019s Office of focusing on \u2018marginal\u2019 electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be \u2018targeted\u2019 by the Coalition at the 2019 Election,\u201d the auditor found. The office also took into account \u201crepresentations\u201d from senators and MPs about where the money should go, and spoke directly to other parliamentarians about their key priorities \u201cwith a priority on marginal and target seats\u201d. The proportion of Labor-held seats that received funding is a red herring. The intent was clear: direct money to marginal and targeted seats to help the Coalition win the election. 3. The projects we funded are benefitting the local community In defending the program\u2019s administration, current sports minister, Richard Colbeck, said the projects funded were having \u201cpositive impacts\u201d on their communities. McKenzie herself said the program was \u201chugely successful\u201d and cited the fact it had been \u201coversubscribed\u201d. Quite clearly, this is not the point. There\u2019s no dispute that the vast, vast majority of projects proposed by local sporting clubs were worthy. But they can\u2019t all be funded. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical that the government let Sport Australia use an objective, transparent process to assess each project on its merits, without political considerations muddying the waters. In so doing, the money goes where it is most needed and the maximum \u201cpositive impact\u201d is derived from a limited pool of funds. Instead, the process was warped in a way that allowed money to go to projects which Sport Australia deemed as a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of not being completed.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions may be running high on the Korean peninsula, but Harry Harris\u2019s facial hair is vying with denuclearisation as the defining theme of his tenure as US ambassador to South Korea. Harris, a former navy admiral who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American navy officer, has been accused of insulting his hosts by growing a moustache that reminds many South Koreans of the days of Japanese colonial rule. Japan\u2019s 1910-45 rule over the Korean peninsula is a continuing source of resentment in South Korea, whose relations with its neighbour plummeted last year amid disputes connected to their bitter wartime history. Social media users in South Korea launched their criticism of Harris\u2019s appearance soon after he was appointed in July 2018, with some noting that during colonial rule all eight Japanese governors-general had sported moustaches. The 63-year-old Harris told reporters in Seoul last week that he was being singled out because of his background. \u201cMy moustache, for some reason, has become a point of some fascination here,\u201d he said, according to reports. \u201cI have been criticised in the media here, especially in social media, because of my ethnic background, because I am a Japanese-American.\u201d Harris said he had been largely clean-shaven during his 40-year naval career but had decided to grow a moustache to mark the start of his diplomatic career. \u201cI wanted to make a break between my life as a military officer and my new life as a diplomat,\u201d he said last month, according to the Korea Times. \u201cI tried to get taller, but I couldn\u2019t grow any taller, and so I tried to get younger, but I couldn\u2019t get younger.

Harris often has been ridiculed for not being an ambassador, but a governor general\u201d. Harris has angered some South Koreans with his support for Donald Trump\u2019s demands for the country to pay $5bn towards the cost of hosting 28,500 US troops in the country \u2013 more than five times the amount Seoul paid last year. Last October, 19 students were arrested after they attempted to scale the walls around Harris\u2019s official residence to protest his support for Seoul to shoulder a heavier financial burden. He has also added to pressure on South Korea to do more to repair ties with Japan, at a time of uncertainty over North Korean denuclearisation talks and a more assertive China. Harris pointed out that no one had made similar criticisms of moustachioed Korean independence leaders, adding that while he understood the historical background to present-day tensions between Japan and South Korea, he was not going to play down his ethnicity in response to racist comments on social media. \u201cI am who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can say is that every decision I make is based on the fact that I\u2019m the American ambassador to Korea, not the Japanese American ambassador to Korea.\u201d And the moustache, it seems, is here to stay.

Porter admitted the government had missed its self-imposed deadline, as it faces a fight winning over members of its own backbench who remain concerned the two-tier proposal won\u2019t hold ministers and MPs to account. \u201cWork to deliver the commonwealth integrity commission draft consultation bill is now all but complete,\u201d Porter told the Guardian. \u201cBut rather than starting the consultation process during the holiday period, which is not an ideal time to start a process of public scrutiny, I have decided to release the full 300-plus pages of the draft early in the new year. \u201cThe consultation process will be extensive and will take as long as necessary to ensure the model we deliver has the powers and resources it needs to be effective, while also avoiding the pitfalls that have been seen with similar state-based bodies.\u201d The scathing auditor general report into former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s handling of Sports Australia grants has reignited debate over the need for a federal integrity body, capable of investigating MPs. \u201cWe are seeing numerous examples of ministers and their staff acting unscrupulously with no clear consequences \u2013 not only with the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie overriding Sport Australia\u2019s grant recommendations, but also with minister Angus Taylor whose office has allegedly fraudulently amended a City of Sydney document to discredit an elected official,\u201d Steggall said. \u201cPoliticians are elected to represent Australians and should do so with honesty and integrity.

Up to 100mm of rain has fallen in parts of NSW over Thursday and Friday, in what was, for some areas, the most significant rainfall in months. While in Victoria a bushfire at Mount Buffalo in the state\u2019s northeast prompted both an evacuation alert and an emergency warning on Friday evening as spotfires, fanned by erratic southerly winds, threatened homes near the locality of Nug Nug. In Buladelah and Boonanghi on the mid-north coast, 112mm and 126mm of rain fell in the 24 hours from 9am Thursday to 9am Friday. Bilpin in the Blue Mountains \u2013 which has been hit by the more than 500,000 hectare Gospers Mountain megafire \u2013 saw 30mm of rain in the same period. Nowra, just north of the multiple fires burning down the south coast, received 12mm. In the upper Hunter at Scone, six-month-old calves jumped through paddocks at the first experience of rain in their life, in the middle of a record-breaking drought. In nearby Muswellbrook, the humans couldn\u2019t hide their excitement either. Near Broken Hill in the state\u2019s west, farmer Nick Andrews had made a promise not to shave his beard until he saw an inch of rain fall. After nearly two years, on Thursday, it came off. Bundarra in the northern tablelands received 105mm, its best rainfall in more than nine years. The NSW Rural Fire Service confirmed that some rain had fallen over \u201cmost firegrounds\u201d but it was not enough to put out fires \u2013 though it would help containment. As of Friday, 30 fires were still uncontained in NSW, and 82 were burning. In Victoria, the Country Fire Authority said the rain has had \u201cminimal impact in suppressing fire activity\u201d across east and northeast. As of Friday morning, 17 fires were still burning. Residents near Mount Buffalo were warned to evacuate on Friday afternoon ahead of forecast erratic southerly winds, which was predicted to cause a significant increase in fire activity.

And more is scheduled to come, with up to 15mm forecast for parts of the NSW south coast, 5mm for the Snowy Valley and the same for East Gippsland in Victoria on Friday. On Friday, Sydney is expected to receive up to 25mm, while other parts of the state could see 50mm. Even more is expected over the weekend, including up to 50mm in Victoria. Across both states, people rejoiced to see the downpour after months of dry, devastating weather.",

      "bodyText": "Labor leader Anthony Albanese, independent MP Zali Steggall and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson have all called for Bridget McKenzie to resign over her role directing $100m of sports grants to help the Coalition win marginal seats. The deputy Nationals leader and former sports minister is under growing pressure, with the Greens, Hanson and Centre Alliance offering to support a Senate inquiry into the community sport infrastructure grant program, subject of a scathing audit office report. McKenzie has defended her conduct, refusing to apologise or resign, claiming all grants were within the rules and Labor seats benefited from her intervention which she suggested amounted to \u201creverse pork-barrelling\u201d. On Friday Guardian Australia revealed concerns about politicisation of the grants, including Labor MP Graham Perrett who was excluded from the announcement of a $135,000 grant to the Sunnybank Saints in favour of his Liberal opponent, despite Perrett helping local club win the funding. The Australian Financial Review reported that the Mosman Rowing Club in Tony Abbott\u2019s seat of Warringah \u2013 under threat from Steggall \u2013 received $500,000, the maximum allowable under the program. Albanese said it was \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented\u201d that Liberal candidates, such as Georgina Downer in independent-held Mayo and Angela Owen in Perrett\u2019s seat of Moreton, were given oversized cheques to present as if they were responsible for the grant while local MPs were cut out of announcements. \u201cThis is just a disgrace,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney. \u201cWhat we have seen is a government that is arrogant, in the lead-up to the federal election, used taxpayers\u2019 money as if it was Liberal and National Party funding.\u201d \u201cThe truth is that [McKenzie\u2019s] position is untenable as a minister.\u201d Sports Australia\u2019s recommendations were \u201cignored in favour of political decisions as if they were election commitments\u201d, Albanese said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t even that \u2013 they were funding from decisions by a minister with no basis that ignored the advice that was given to her.\u201d Earlier, Hanson told ABC News the audit office report had proven the Coalition had used the program \u201cfor pork-barrelling as a slush fund\u201d. \u201cI call for [McKenzie\u2019s] resignation \u2013 that she should step down in any portfolio as minister. \u201cI don\u2019t think she is up to doing the job. I stand by that. This is case in point \u2026 Australian people are sick and tired of pork barrelling by politicians and looking after their own nest egg.\u201d The Greens have already suggested they will support a Senate inquiry into the sports grant program, and Labor has vowed to force the government to reveal unsuccessful applicants and the list of recommended projects overturned by McKenzie. Senator Rex Patrick said Centre Alliance\u2019s preference would be for a federal independent commission against corruption to investigate but \u201cin the absence of such a body we will support an inquiry with appropriate terms of reference\u201d. Asked if she would support a Senate inquiry, Hanson said \u201cyes \u2026 if it\u2019s going to prove they\u2019ve used that money, taxpayers\u2019 dollars, to feather their own nest and further themselves\u201d. Steggall told Radio National \u201cthe whole thing is quite disgusting\u201d and McKenzie should resign. \u201cShe\u2019s completely lost if she doesn\u2019t think she needs to acknowledge there\u2019s something wrong with treating kids and community sports clubs [unfairly] \u2026 in favour of prioritising projects for her own personal gain or the gain of the Coalition.\u201d The program awarded a total of $100m to 684 projects across three rounds in the months before the election, out of a total of 2,056 proposals seeking more than $396.6m. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, found the successful applications were \u201cnot those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines\u201d. He found that McKenzie\u2019s office had run a \u201cparallel\u201d assessment process in deciding how to hand out the funds, with a focus on marginal electorates. In the first round, 91 of the projects (41%) approved were not endorsed by the Sport Australia board. In the second round, 162 (70%) of the approved projects were not recommended, and in the final round 167 (73%) of the approved projects were not recommended.",

      "bodyText": "Live politics coverage continues on Friday\u2019s blog: The Senate opened the impeachment trial of Donald Trump today. The supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, was sworn in to preside over the trial. Senators also swore an oath to \u201cdo impartial justice according to the constitution and laws\u201d. The trial is now adjourned until 1pm ET on Tuesday. Trump and Mike Pence denied knowing Lev Parnas, who said he carried out a campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden on behalf of the president. Parnas alleged that Pence and other White House officials including attorney general William Barr and former national security advisor John Bolton. Ukraine is investigating possible surveillance of former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch following the release of texts between Parnas and an associate. Today, the Senate opened the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, nearly four months after Nancy Pelosi first announced an impeachment inquiry. Here\u2019s a timeline of key events leading up to this moment: Susan Collins, a moderate Republican senator from Maine, said she\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d to vote to call additional witnesses. Collins, who could be a swing vote in the impeachment trial, has criticized both Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Elizabeth Warren for prejudging impeachment evidence, suggested that lawmakers should follow the model of the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial. In a statement, she said she had not decided on \u201cany particular witnesses\u201d she\u2019d like to call and would like to hear \u201cboth sides\u201d before deciding. \u201cPrior to hearing the statement of the case and the Senators asking questions, I will not support any attempts by either side to subpoena documents or witnesses,\u201d she said. Even the oath is controversial \u201cDo you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws: so help you God? Chief Justice John Roberts swore he would. The senators swore they would. But in the lead-up to today, both Democrats and Republicans have been accusing each other of lacking impartiality. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports: Though today\u2019s impeachment events were mostly ceremonial, reporters covering Congress are already having to contend with harsh new media restrictions. Congressional reporters, who are normally free to approach senators as they walk through the hallways, won\u2019t be allowed to do so during the impeachment trial. Senators were also given cards with tips on how to avoid reporters, with phrases like, \u201cPlease get out of my way\u201d and \u201cYou are preventing me from doing my job.\u201d According to the AP, at least 10 uniformed Capitol Police officers manned the corridor outside the Senate chamber to enforce the new rules, which journalists, free speech advocates, and Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized as unnecessarily restrictive. Report: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether former FBI director Comey leaked information to reporters. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating a years-old leak of classified information about a Russian intelligence document, the New York Times reports, focusing on whether former FBI director James Comey was involved: The case is the second time the Justice Department has investigated leaks potentially involving Mr. Comey, a frequent target of President Trump, who has repeatedly called him a \u201cleaker.\u201d Mr. Trump recently suggested without evidence that Mr. Comey should be prosecuted for \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d and spend years in prison. The timing of the investigation could raise questions about whether it was motivated at least in part by politics. Prosecutors and F.B.I. agents typically investigate leaks of classified information around the time they appear in the news media, not years later. And the inquiry is the latest politically sensitive matter undertaken by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington, which is also conducting an investigation of Mr. Comey\u2019s former deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, that has been plagued by problems. The Guardian has not independently verified the Times\u2019 reporting. Mike Pence: Parnas\u2019 allegation is \u2018completely false\u2019 The vice-president reportedly said Lev Parnas\u2019 charge that he knew that the White House\u2019 pressure on Ukraine was \u201cabout the Bidens\u201d is false. Pence spoke with the LA Times\u2019 Eli Stokols at a campaign event in Florida. Pence also denied knowing Parnas. The impeachment trial has adjourned until 1pm ET on Tuesday, when the US Senate will delve into claims Donald Trump abused the powers of his office. The trial adjourned after the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, was sworn in to preside over the trial. He then swore in the senators, who also signed an oath book. Donald Trump denied knowing Lev Parnas, the businessman who claims the president was aware of his efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, the president\u2019s rival in the 2020 election. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s a fine man, perhaps not,\u201d Trump said. The Ukrainian government has opened an investigation into the possible illegal surveillance of Marie Yovanovitch when she was the US ambassador to Kyiv, following the publication of messages about her between two associates of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. More from Donald Trump\u2019s religious freedom event at the White House this afternoon, where he addressed the Lev Parnas allegations and impeachment trial: Now that the impeachment trial procedures are out of the way, Tuesday marks the day action will begin in earnest. That includes a seemingly outdated tradition where at the beginning of each day, sergeant-at-arms Michael Stenger will declare, \u201cHere ye! Here ye! Here ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment.\u201d Details on the odd warning were reported by Roll Call, which dug into the history of the ceremony around threat of Senate jail. In the past, the Senate has preferred to expel the senator from office, rather than send him or her to jail, so as not to deprive a state of its full representation. Such confrontations have occurred so infrequently in the Senate\u2019s history that ambiguity is more readily available than specifics. No senator has ever been imprisoned by Senate officials, but in the past, the threat of arrest and jail has silenced even the most agitated senators. The president weighs in: Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump said he doesn\u2019t know Lev Parnas, the businessman who in the past 24 hours has repeatedly stated the president knew about his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. Trump acknowledged the two have a photo together, but said: \u201cI meet thousands of people.\u201d Trump also said he is \u201cprobably\u201d going to the Davos economic forum this week, though there has been speculation he could cancel the trip because of the trial. The Ukrainian government has opened an investigation into the possible illegal surveillance of Marie Yovanovitch when she was the US ambassador to Kyiv, following the publication of messages about her between two associates of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. The state department has yet to make any statement on the possibility that Yovanovitch had been put under surveillance, after WhatsApp messages were released on Tuesday by the House intelligence committee between Trump donor Robert Hyde and Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born Florida businessmen. Both men had ties to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney and adviser, who the president had assigned to take the lead in persuading the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into his political rival former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. And just like that, the Senate trial is adjourned until Tuesday at 1pm ET, following the the Monday Martin Luther King Jr federal holiday. Before wrapping up the day\u2019s mostly ceremonial events, senators signed an oath book. They all used the same pen (for the Clinton impeachment, senators used individual souvenir pens that were printed with typos). Kentucky senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, also ticked through the procedures. Quorum called. Roberts sworn in. Senators sworn in. Senators are now signing an oath book. Chief justice John Roberts has landed in the Capitol and the Senate quorum call is taking place. After justice Roberts is sworn-in, he will swear-in the senators. The next set of impeachment trial procedures is due to begin at 2pm ET \u2013 about 15 minutes from now. That\u2019s when the chief justice of the supreme court, John Roberts, will walk from the courtroom to the Capitol building across the street. Once in the building, he\u2019ll be flanked by four Senators who will escort him to the chamber. Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, will then take an oath before swearing-in the 99* gathered senators. This is what it looked like for Bill Clinton\u2019s trial: *Senator Jim Inhofe is with a family member with a medical issue and plans to be sworn-in on Tuesday, with no delay for the trial, according to his office. The third impeachment trial in history formally opened moments ago. There is a brief break before key procedures in the trial continue. Here\u2019s where we\u2019re at now: California representative Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, entered the Senate and read impeachment resolution 755: Impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. Independent government investigators said Donald Trump\u2019s direction to suspend Ukraine aid violated the law. Republicans struggled to respond to the findings. A key figure in the impeachment inquiry, businessman Lev Parnas, provided fresh evidence in interviews with US media outlets where he claimed Donald Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, were aware of efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival. The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said the Trump administration was \u201cnot too concerned\u201d about Parnas\u2019s allegations and questioned his motives. Details from inside the Senate chamber from Guardian senior political reporter, Lauren Gambino: Green has pursued the impeachment of Donald Trump since May 2017, five months after the president took office. He said then that the president should be impeached because of his hateful rhetoric and said he incites violence. In the first of three impeachment resolutions Green introduced, the representative from Texas said Trump \u201cwith his statements done more than insult individuals and groups of Americans, he has harmed the society of the United States, brought shame and dishonor to the office of President of the United States, sowing discord among the people of the United States by associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism, or neo-Nazism.\u201d Schiff has just concluded reading the final paragraph of the resolution: Wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. The impeachment managers have left the Senate and the proceedings will resume in about an hour and a half (2pm ET), when the chief justice is sworn-in. California representative Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, is reading out from impeachment resolution 755: Impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors. The House voted to send the resolution to the Senate yesterday. The seven House impeachment managers have completed their (second) ceremonial walk to the Senate to deliver articles of impeachment. Yesterday, they were told to come back today to present the documents. They have been escorted to the Senate floor and a proclamation was made by the seargant-at-arms. We have a live feed of the trial at the top of the blog. Lead impeachment manager, Adam Schiff, has taken the podium. Mixed reactions from Senate Republicans to the nonpartisan GAO report which found the White House broke the law by withholding military aid: Matt Wolking, a deputy director of communications for the Trump 2020 campaign, responded by highlighting how many times the GAO found Barack Obama\u2019s administration violated the law: four. (one, two, three, four) A complicating factor for Wolking\u2019s argument is that these charged Obama\u2019s agencies with breaking the law, not the White House directly, as today\u2019s GAO report does. And incident two violated the law because the president was not involved. More from Pelosi on impeachment. She said the trial \u201cis not without risk\u201d and said the revelations in the Lev Parnas documents, and what he has been saying in interviews, would normally warrant a special prosecutor. But not in this White House. \u201cDoes anybody think the rogue attorney general is going to appoint a special prosecutor?\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cNo, because he\u2019s implicated in all of this.\u201d When asked again about US attorney general, William Barr, Pelosi said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who is the puppet \u2013 Trump or the Attorney General.\u201d Asked about the credibility of Lev Parnas, Pelosi said the documents were important. \u201cHe would be a credible witness if what he is testifying to is about the issue at hand, the president\u2019s behavior.\u201d This morning, Pelosi\u2019s office said she raised a record-breaking $87m for Democratic candidates in 2019. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is speaking to reporters and said the impeachment trial is needed because \u201cevery day new, incriminating information comes forward.\u201d She responded to the independent government watchdog report released this morning which found the White House violated the law by withholding military aid to Ukraine, a central part of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis reinforces, again, the need for documents and eyewitnesses in the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi then spoke about a poster in her grade school classroom which said: \u201cWhat a tangle web we weave when we first practice to deceive,\u201d and said with this White House, you see that happen \u201cmore and more.\u201d She also spoke about the House\u2019s other matters, specifically the need for disaster aid in Puerto Rico. The White House has delayed distributing aid to the island allocated by Congress after Hurricane Maria in Sep 2017 and it is under increased pressure to make those funds available after a string of earthquakes hit the island in the past month. An eight-page report by the independent government watchdog GAO said the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u201cwithheld funds for a policy reasons\u201d in the Ukraine affair, which violated the law. The GAO\u2019s central argument is the White House can\u2019t unilaterally decide to withhold foreign aid that has been appropriated by Congress. An OMB spokesperson said the office disagreed with the watchdog\u2019s findings. \u201cThe president not only undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain \u2013 he also broke the law,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted in response to the findings. \u201cHe must be held accountable or he will continue breaking the law and putting the country at risk.\u201d Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said on the Senate floor that the GAO\u2019s findings should get a \u201cfull hearing\u201d in the impeachment trial. An independent government watchdog, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), said the White House budget office violated the law when it froze US military aid to Ukraine. \u201cFaithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,\u201d the report said. The GAO said the White House violated the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which says funds appropriated by Congress cannot be withheld by the White House. A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Rachel Semmel, told the New York Times: \u201cWe disagree with GAO\u2019s opinion. OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President\u2019s priorities and with the law.\u201d Yesterday, the House voted to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, setting in motion the third impeachment Senate trial in US history. Here\u2019s how that looks today: 12pm ET (5pm GMT): Prosecutors from the House of Representatives, known as \u201cmanagers\u201d, are expected to arrive to the Senate to formally exhibit the articles of impeachment. 2pm (7pm): US supreme court chief justice John Roberts is scheduled to join the proceedings and be sworn in for his presiding role at the trial. Then: Roberts will swear in 100 senators \u2013 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents \u2013 as jurors. (and click here to learn how we got here) The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, just spoke with Fox &amp; Friends about Lev Parnas and said the Trump administration was \u201cnot too concerned\u201d about his allegations. She also questioned Parnas\u2019s trustworthiness and his motives. Lev Parnas said while he did not speak directly with Donald Trump about efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the former vice-president Joe Biden, a political rival, he had met with the president several times. Parnas also said Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, told Parnas he was updating Trump in an interview with the New York Times. Parnas is facing criminal charges in federal court, so he is not the most reliable witness, but a trove of his documents released to House investigators provided fresh evidence of the close relationship between Parnas and Giuliani ahead of the Senate trial. Trump has denied misconduct. \u201cMy biggest regret is trusting so much,\u201d Parnas said. \u201cI thought I was being a patriot and helping the president,\u201d he said, adding that he \u201cthought by listening to the president and his attorney that I couldn\u2019t possibly get in trouble or do anything wrong\u201d. Parnas\u2019s statements to the Times echo a similar interview he gave to MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Wednesday and Anderson Cooper on CNN. Giuliani and Trump\u2019s efforts were \u201call about 2020\u201d, Parnas told CNN. \u201cThat was the most important thing,\u201d Parnas said, \u201cfor him to stay on for four years and keep the fight going. I mean, there was no other reason for doing it.\u201d Hello and good morning A key player at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Lev Parnas, has told reporters Donald Trump was fully aware of his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals, just as the Senate prepares to be sworn-in for the trial. Parnas, a businessman and GOP donor, told MSNBC Trump \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d. He told the New York Times: \u201cI am betting my whole life that Trump knew exactly everything that was going on that Rudy Giuliani was doing in Ukraine.\u201d Trump has denied misconduct, and it\u2019s unclear how much this new material will be absorbed into the Senate impeachment trial. House prosecutors are expected to arrive at the Senate midday to complete a set of procedural rituals that will formally open the third impeachment trial in the Senate in US history. Trump, meanwhile, has a quiet schedule for the day besides an announcement about prayer in schools in the afternoon. We\u2019ll have live updates from the Capitol as well as from the presidential campaign trail.",

      "body": "<h2>1) A tough debut for Fernandes at Watford?</h2> <p>Gedson Fernandes started only three league games in 2019 \u2013 and was substituted at half-time in one of those \u2013 and though he is richly talented there is no guarantee he will enjoy more success at Spurs than his largely underwhelming compatriots Ricardo Rocha, Pedro Mendes (he of the disallowed goal from the halfway line at Old Trafford), Helder Postiga and Jos\u00e9 Dominguez, the entertaining if only occasionally effective winger who was a light in the darkness of the Gerry Francis-Christian Gross era.

The former Tottenham midfielder \u00c9tienne Capoue is providing many of the qualities Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could use from the base of midfield. In their next four league games, Spurs play three of the current bottom four in Watford, Norwich and Aston Villa, an excellent opportunity to address the rocky form that has meant they won one and lost three of their last five league matches.

      "bodyText": "The comedian Josh Thomas\u2019 beloved Australian series Please Like Me was visually and narratively engaging from its opening moment: a shot taken from the perspective of a decadent sundae, as it is moved through a bar towards Thomas \u2013 who played a version of himself \u2013 and his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend. While the ice cream is en route, we hear the star talking in his characteristically bouncy, rapid-fire way, with the determined friendliness of a chatty seatmate. Thomas\u2019s dialogue is often flirty, sassy and self-deprecating (a little like Lena Dunham\u2019s), but also skittish and flummoxed (a little like Larry David\u2019s), with a youthful zest and je ne sais quoi all his own. The show began strong and got better as it progressed. Thomas\u2019s follow-up series, Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay, on the other hand, which he created (like Please Like Me) as well as stars in and wrote, begins gracelessly and awkwardly \u2013 like one of the bad dates the comedian sometimes references. It begins in fact with a date, as did Please Like Me \u2013 and ,though the date itself goes swimmingly, it\u2019s the staging of it that disappoints. Twentysomething Nicholas (Thomas) and Alex (Adam Faison) are in a bar kissing, drinking, exchanging anecdotes and discussing when to meet again. The director, Rebecca Thomas, chops up the scene in an odd, nonlinear way, regularly jumping out of their conversation as though she is bored by it. This fractures the flow of what would have been a sweet, meaningful moment showing two lovers connecting, and detracts from the announcement of details central to the show\u2019s premise. \u201cMy dad abandoned my mother and I because he got a woman in America pregnant and then it turns out that daughter has autism,\u201d says Thomas in his breathless style, slowing down only a tad to add some emotional context. \u201cMaybe he is a nice guy,\u201d Nicholas reflects on his father, but \u201cit\u2019s not like I got the chance to really get to know him.\u201d Nor will he ever get the chance to really know him, because Darren (Christopher May) is dying of cancer.

      "bodyText": "The Treasury will need to find almost \u00a32bn a year to fill the hole left when EU funding for some of Britain\u2019s poorest communities ends after Brexit, ministers have been told. A body that represents local authorities in the industrial areas of England, Scotland and Wales said the government needed to match the money currently coming from Brussels and allow for extra EU cash that would have arrived over the next few years. The Industrial Communities Alliance said the new shared prosperity fund \u2013 designed to replace EU funding to the regions \u2013 needed to be at least as generous as the schemes it was replacing. It urged ministers to take advantage of the freedom provided by Brexit to broaden the scope of the fund so that it could tackle a wider range of problems than allowed under EU rules. Russell Imrie, acting national chair of the ICA, said: \u201cMany voters in older industrial Britain backed Boris Johnson. Now is the time for him to ensure that our communities do not lose out from Brexit and to support our efforts to rebuild the economies of our areas. \u201cThanks to European funding over the years, we\u2019ve been able to make progress in replacing the thousands upon thousands of jobs lost from industries such as coal, steel, engineering and textiles, but we still have a long way to go to match the prosperity in other parts of the country. \u201cWe want to see the prime minister\u2019s electoral promise translated into hard cash and real action on the ground to help deliver the jobs and growth that our communities still so clearly need.\u201d The UK currently receives \u00a31.4bn a year from the European regional development fund and the European social fund and a number of smaller payments. However, the ICA said that after adjusting for inflation and the fact that more UK communities would be eligible for EU funding were it not for Brexit, the budget for the shared prosperity fund needed to be \u00a31.8bn a year. It added that the range of activities on which EU funds could be spent had become too restrictive and the creation of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund allowed a fresh start. \u201cThere is a strong case for greater flexibility in spending in order to tackle a wider range of regeneration issues than those presently addressed by EU funding.\u201d",

The three separate aid budget initiatives are Britain\u2019s response to the massive Chinese investment drive in Africa, which the government says has already left a large footprint on the continent. The cash will be spent on improving the financial systems and regulations of 45 African states; a new investment fund to identify and develop projects; and a joint initiative with the World Bank to nurture local currency bonds. Sharma said the aim was to help money from private investors such as pension funds flow into Africa by making it easier, quicker and more secure to invest. \u201cAfrica\u2019s substantial investment potential is clear, with many African countries outstripping global economic growth in recent decades. The UK is already the top financial exchange for Africa\u2019s businesses and we want investors to seize the exciting opportunities that Africa offers. \u201cThese new initiatives, announced ahead of the UK-Africa investment summit, will make it easier, greener and more secure to invest in Africa, mobilising billions of pounds of sustainable investment to help end poverty.\u201d David Malpass, the World Bankpresident, said: \u201cBy 2050, one in four global consumers will be African. But Africa currently attracts less than 4% of global foreign direct investment. Strong actions from countries to improve rule of law and take on vested interests could create the right incentives to spur investment by strengthening financial systems, building confidence in financial markets, and enabling more productive private-sector activity.\u201d",

It is the most widely consumed vegetable&nbsp;oil&nbsp;in the planet, representing a third of all vegetable&nbsp;oil. It is used in many foods, from margarine, chocolate and cookies to bread and instant noodles.</p>\n    <p>About a quarter of all&nbsp;palm&nbsp;oil&nbsp;is used for other things, such as shampoo, soap and lipstick. It is also burned as biofuel in vehicles, though the EU is phasing this out.</p>\n    <p>Palm&nbsp;oil&nbsp;drives the destruction of tropical forests, especially in south-east Asia. Orangutans, the world's largest tree-dwelling mammals, are particularly under threat as their habitat is cleared for plantations, as well as species of elephant and rhino. About 20% of&nbsp;palm&nbsp;oil&nbsp;is now certified as \"sustainable\", though critics say the environmental benefit is marginal.</p>\n    <p>To avoid palm oil, the most important thing consumers can do is read the label. A small but increasing number of products are now labelled as palm-oil-free. They may cost more, as palm oil is so widely used because it proved a cheap substitute to traditional fats such as cocoa butter in chocolate. However, some alternatives have their own problems: cocoa butter, for instance, has been linked to slavery and child labour.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WWF survey awarded companies points out of 22 based on answers to a questionnaire on their practices in sourcing palm oil.

That commitment, which began in 2010, involved a resolution by companies to reduce deforestation through their palm oil supply chain to net zero by 2020. Net zero means that some deforestation could be made up for by restoring or growing forests elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Separately, the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) assessed eight global brands \u2013 Kellogg\u2019s, General Mills, Mondelez, Hershey\u2019s, Mars, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever \u2013 involved in a key area of south-east Asia known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2017/sep/28/leuser-ecosystem-biodiverse-elephants-tigers-rhinos-orangutans-under-threat-pictures\">Leuser </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2017/sep/28/leuser-ecosystem-biodiverse-elephants-tigers-rhinos-orangutans-under-threat-pictures\">ecosystem</a>.

None of the companies have adequate systems in place to identify and cut or reform non-compliant suppliers in their supply chains.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robin Averbeck, of RAN, said: \u201cNone of these companies has a plan to verify credibly that they are not causing deforestation from palm oil. They only respond when NGOs publicly shame them. [Their claims] are greenwash.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ignacio Gavilan, environmental sustainability director at the Consumer Goods Forum, said new approaches were needed for companies to meet the pledge made in 2010 to end deforestation associated with palm oil use by 2020. \u201cIn 2010, our strategy was rooted in remediating individual company supply chains, often through certification. While we have seen progress, we have found that certification is a tool, but not the comprehensive solution the world needs,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>One problem is that there is still a market for palm oil products from deforested areas, so broader initiatives than certifying some areas as sustainable production are needed, otherwise unsustainable producers can simply move to clear new areas of forest and still find a market for their goods. Solving that conundrum is likely to require more involvement from governments and international moves to close down markets for the products of deforested areas.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe singular focus on certifications incentivised us to think small,\u201d said Gavilan. \u201cWe want, and need, a more transformative approach that will get us to a more forest-positive future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many companies rely on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-palm-oil-successful-rspo-certification\">Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil</a> as an assurance to consumers that they are taking the product from sources that are not leading to deforestation. However, Averbeck said there were problems with the certification and it was \u201cinadequate\u201d as a guarantee that the palm oil in use was not leading to deforestation. \u201cRSPO is not working, fundamentally. Companies know that there are issues with RSPO.\u201d</p> \n<p>RSPO said: \u201cWe acknowledge the need for continuous improvement of RSPO strategies and interventions, which is why our membership continues to improve our standard. The situation on the ground requires companies, government and civil society to work together to achieve the mission of the RSPO. </p> \n<p>\u201cRSPO is more than just a certification system \u2013 it is a convening organisation that brings together stakeholders to discuss the issues. It has helped spur the development of sector-specific national initiatives to promote sustainability. Our goal is to transform the entire industry \u2013 a difficult mission \u2013 and we are proud of the progress achieved, while also firmly acknowledging there is a lot more work to be done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many of the companies investigated by RAN and WWF told the Guardian they were working to improve their performance on palm oil, with some citing the Consumer Goods Forum 2020 target as a key aim.</p> \n<p>Mars said: \u201cRAN\u2019s conclusion is that, despite industry initiatives, a number of environmental and social threats to the landscape remain. This is precisely why we are working to radically transform the way we source palm oil at Mars with our Palm Positive Plan that aims to deliver 100% deforestation-free palm oil by the end of 2020 and to advance respect for human rights across our suppliers\u2019 extended supply chains.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mondelez said it had blocked 10 palm oil growers based on recent cases, in addition to two longstanding exclusions, as evidence of its commitment to rooting out abuses in its supply chain. \u201cThis highlights the urgent need for sector-wide monitoring to provide one source of verified data on deforestation by palm oil plantations, based on the principles of transparency, group definitions, multi-stakeholder governance and independence. We are actively working with others to establish this.\u201d</p> \n<p>General Mills told the Guardian: \u201cWhile we have elevated standards and protocols in place, our approach is continually evolving and, in line with our commitment to protect forests and peatlands, we increasingly see a need to support on-the-ground activities that address the drivers of deforestation. This demands action beyond the supply chain, but a lasting solution will require concerted action from all actors, including government and smallholder farmers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unilever, which scored 34th in the WWF table and came out best of the eight companies in the RAN report, said: \u201cOnly by all parties coming together, using cutting-edge technology to carefully monitor our forests and engaging with the communities and stakeholders around them, will we create a sustainable future. We remain committed to working in partnership with suppliers, governments, NGOs and the wider industry to end deforestation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whole Foods Market, which scored only 8.25 out of a possible 22 in the WWF table, said: \u201cWe made a public pledge over 10 years ago to use only 100% RSPO palm oil in [own] brand food products.
