Her contract at the charitable organisation, which is based in Washington and London, was not renewed in March after a dispute over publicising her views on social media.</p> <p>She was accused of using \u201coffensive and exclusionary\u201d language in tweets opposing government proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act to allow people to self-identify as the opposite sex.</p> <p>The Central London employment tribunal convened a preliminary hearing over the issue of whether her tweets, such as \u201cmen cannot change into women\u201d, should be protected under the 2010 Equality Act. She funded her legal challenge through the CrowdJustice website.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/19/jk-rowling-trans-row-court-ruling-twitter-maya-forstater\">JK Rowling wades into row over court ruling on transphobic language</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forstater has been supported by <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2019/05/tax-expert-maya-forstater-fired-for-saying-trans-women-arent-women-the-times-5-may-2019/\">Index on Censorship</a>. Its chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg, has said previously: \u201cFrom what I have read of [Forstater\u2019s] writing, I cannot see that Maya has done anything wrong other than express an opinion that many feminists share \u2013 that there should be a public and open debate about the distinction between sex and gender.\u201d</p> <p>But in a 26-page judgment released late on Wednesday, Tayler dismissed her claim. \u201cI conclude from \u2026 the totality of the evidence, that [Forstater] is absolutist in her view of sex and it is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the ruling, Forstater said: \u201cI struggle to express the shock and disbelief I feel at reading this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12P9zf82TicPs2cCxlTnm0TrNFDD8Gaz5/view?usp=sharing\">judgment</a>, which I think will be shared by the vast majority of people who are familiar with my case.</p> <p>\u201cMy belief \u2026 is that sex is a biological fact, and is immutable. There are two sexes, male and female. Men and boys are male. Women and girls are female. It is impossible to change sex. These were until very recently understood as basic facts of life by almost everyone.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 This judgment removes women\u2019s rights and the right to freedom of belief and speech. It gives judicial licence for women and men who speak up for objective truth and clear debate to be subject to aggression, bullying, no-platforming and economic punishment.</p> <p>\u201cI will consider the judgment closely with my legal team to determine what can be done to challenge it.\u201d </p> <p>Louise Rea, a solicitor at the law firm Bates Wells which advised the CGD in the case, said: \u201cJudge Tayler held that \u2018the claimant\u2019s view, in its absolutist nature, is incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others\u2019. He observed that the claimant was not entitled to ignore the legal rights of a person who has transitioned from male to female or vice versa and the \u2018enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering a person\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cA number of commentators have viewed this case as being about the claimant\u2019s freedom of speech. Employment Judge Tayler acknowledged that there is nothing to stop the claimant campaigning against the proposed revisions to the Gender Recognition Act or, expressing her opinion that there should be some spaces that are restricted to women assigned female at birth. However, she can do so without insisting on calling transwomen men. It is the fact that her belief necessarily involves violating the dignity of others which means it is not protected under the Equality Act 2010.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Daly, of Slater and Gordon, representing Forstater, said: \u201cThe significance of this judgment should not be downplayed.</p> <p>\u201cHad our client been successful, she would have established in law protection for people \u2013 on any side of this debate \u2013 to express their beliefs without fear of being discriminated against.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was updated on 19 December 2019 to describe the job of Maya Forstater more accurately.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A researcher who lost her job at a thinktank after tweeting that transgender women cannot change their biological sex has lost a test case because her opinions were deemed to be \u201cabsolutist\u201d. In a keenly anticipated judgment that will stir up fresh debate over transgender issues, Judge James Tayler, an employment judge, ruled that Maya Forstater\u2019s views did \u201cnot have the protected characteristic of philosophical belief\u201d. Forstater, 45, a tax expert, was a visiting fellow at the Centre for Global Development (CGD), an international thinktank that campaigns against poverty and inequality. Her contract at the charitable organisation, which is based in Washington and London, was not renewed in March after a dispute over publicising her views on social media. She was accused of using \u201coffensive and exclusionary\u201d language in tweets opposing government proposals to reform the Gender Recognition Act to allow people to self-identify as the opposite sex. The Central London employment tribunal convened a preliminary hearing over the issue of whether her tweets, such as \u201cmen cannot change into women\u201d, should be protected under the 2010 Equality Act. She funded her legal challenge through the CrowdJustice website. Forstater has been supported by Index on Censorship. Its chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg, has said previously: \u201cFrom what I have read of [Forstater\u2019s] writing, I cannot see that Maya has done anything wrong other than express an opinion that many feminists share \u2013 that there should be a public and open debate about the distinction between sex and gender.\u201d But in a 26-page judgment released late on Wednesday, Tayler dismissed her claim. \u201cI conclude from \u2026 the totality of the evidence, that [Forstater] is absolutist in her view of sex and it is a core component of her belief that she will refer to a person by the sex she considered appropriate even if it violates their dignity and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. The approach is not worthy of respect in a democratic society.\u201d In response to the ruling, Forstater said: \u201cI struggle to express the shock and disbelief I feel at reading this judgment, which I think will be shared by the vast majority of people who are familiar with my case. \u201cMy belief \u2026 is that sex is a biological fact, and is immutable. There are two sexes, male and female. Men and boys are male. Women and girls are female. It is impossible to change sex. These were until very recently understood as basic facts of life by almost everyone. \u201c\u2026 This judgment removes women\u2019s rights and the right to freedom of belief and speech. It gives judicial licence for women and men who speak up for objective truth and clear debate to be subject to aggression, bullying, no-platforming and economic punishment. \u201cI will consider the judgment closely with my legal team to determine what can be done to challenge it.\u201d Louise Rea, a solicitor at the law firm Bates Wells which advised the CGD in the case, said: \u201cJudge Tayler held that \u2018the claimant\u2019s view, in its absolutist nature, is incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others\u2019. He observed that the claimant was not entitled to ignore the legal rights of a person who has transitioned from male to female or vice versa and the \u2018enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering a person\u2019. \u201cA number of commentators have viewed this case as being about the claimant\u2019s freedom of speech. Employment Judge Tayler acknowledged that there is nothing to stop the claimant campaigning against the proposed revisions to the Gender Recognition Act or, expressing her opinion that there should be some spaces that are restricted to women assigned female at birth. However, she can do so without insisting on calling transwomen men. It is the fact that her belief necessarily involves violating the dignity of others which means it is not protected under the Equality Act 2010.\u201d Peter Daly, of Slater and Gordon, representing Forstater, said: \u201cThe significance of this judgment should not be downplayed. \u201cHad our client been successful, she would have established in law protection for people \u2013 on any side of this debate \u2013 to express their beliefs without fear of being discriminated against.\u201d \u2022 The headline on this article was updated on 19 December 2019 to describe the job of Maya Forstater more accurately.",

The bulk of the speech will be familiar to those who sat through its equivalent on 14 October, when Boris Johnson\u2019s government outlined its legislative plans despite no majority and a seemingly imminent election, which came to pass last week. The Queen\u2019s speech is the centrepiece of the new state opening of a new session of parliament, usually an annual event. Given the short time-lapse, Thursday\u2019s opening will be a pared-back version, with the Queen arriving by car rather than golden carriage. Unveiling 26 bills in October, the government sought to highlight election-ready plans for tougher jail sentences, among seven bills devoted to law and order. The chosen highlight for Thursday will be a new, largely symbolic bill to put into statute the government\u2019s commitment to spend an extra \u00a333bn-plus a year on the NHS by 2023-24. With Johnson now safely returned to No 10 with an 80-seat majority, one helped by success in many northern English towns that have traditionally voted Labour, the Downing Street focus is now more firmly fixed on the NHS and other austerity-combating spending boosts. The government plans to make the NHS Funding bill the first legislation passed, following scrutiny of the Withdrawal Agreement bill (Wab), which lays down the legal framework for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.

Another NHS-based bill will change the current system of hospital car parking charges, abolishing them for groups such as disabled people, those with children who are inpatients, and staff working night shifts. Other elements of the legislative programme remain to be seen. For example, it appears likely that any commitments to maintain EU rights on employment after Brexit will not now be contained in the Wab, but will be laid out in separate legislation. The Wab, expected to be published on Friday, will be amended to include another symbolic legislative element \u2013 barring the government from extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. While Brexit remains a primary focus, in an echo of the simple, repetitive Conservative messages of the election campaign, Johnson and his ministers are seeking to hammer home their policies on supporting the NHS. On Wednesday, Johnson hosted NHS frontline staff for a reception at Downing Street, telling them they were \u201cdoing an incredible job\u201d. Citing election-familiar and much-disputed promises to build 40 new hospitals and have 50,000 more NHS nurses, Johnson told the staff: \u201cWe are now putting the biggest investment in the NHS in living memory. We have to keep that investment going.

Answering questions after the speech in London, Hancock denied that the government was being forced to clear up its own mistakes, after the Conservatives abolished student nurse bursaries in 2016. The announcement of the grants of up to \u00a38,000 a year follows repeated warnings about falls in the number of would-be nurses since the Conservatives abolished the bursaries, also making student nurses pay tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. Bye! The semi-final draw has been done, and it looks like this (with the team named first at home in the first leg): Manchester United v Manchester City Leicester City v Aston Villa The semi-final draw is slightly more imminent than it was previously. While you wait, here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s report on Leicester\u2019s shootout-based victory over Everton: The semi-final draw is imminent. While you wait, here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s report on Manchester United\u2019s win over Colchester: Karl Robinson has a chat: I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this. Yeah, frustrated. Never in a month of Sundays would I expect to come out and say that. i thought we were disciplined, we took them on in a game that they\u2019re best at, we showed tremendous bravery for a team so young. I\u2019m very pleased with the players but I\u2019m sure my last thought when I close my eyes tonight will be what could have been. What was lacking? Good finishing, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t think their goalkeeper made a good save. I thought everything went straight at him. I don\u2019t think we quite believed they were going to drop for us. I said before the game, I hope all our fans can wake up in the morning, go to work or school and say I was happy with Oxford last night. What did Guardiola say at the final whistle? I think Pep was relatively surprised by our style. It\u2019ll be something that I\u2019ll never forget. Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s match report: Manchester City will continue to fight on four fronts after victory over Oxford earned Pep Guardiola\u2019s side passage to the Carabao Cup semi-finals for the third successive season. City had to battle for the win and are digging their heels in over Mikel Arteta, the assistant coach who is expected to be appointed Arsenal\u2019s next manager. Arteta travelled to Oxford and was on the bench here but City are furious with Arsenal\u2019s conduct, insisting the club have made no formal approach for the Spaniard. City, who have won this competition for the past two years, dominated for large spells but Oxford made them sweat in the second half as Guardiola\u2019s experimental side held on. Raheem Sterling, who operated as a striker here as Guardiola rested several players, displayed a poacher\u2019s instinct, twice applying the finishing touches inside the six-yard box after Oxford cancelled out Jo\u00e3o Cancelo\u2019s opener immediately after the restart through their striker Matty Taylor. Oxford almost made things interesting late on but City, who have not lost in this competition since defeat to Manchester United in October 2016, held on for victory. Much more here: Pep Guardiola has a chat. He doesn\u2019t get excited by Sterling\u2019s goals \u2013 \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter who scored\u201d \u2013 and says he doesn\u2019t know anything about Mikel Arteta\u2019s intentions. It was a tight game. We struggled with the wind, and we played against a good side. Congratulations for the team, for the young players and for the victory. It\u2019s tough. The competition itself now, with four good semi-final teams. Delighted to be again in the semi-finals of the competition. We suffered a lot in the second half for a period of 20 minutes after the 2-1, because they played a lot of long-balls with throw-ins, corners and we struggled. It\u2019s OK. We knew it before we came here. Sky get Taylor Harwood-Bellis to give Raheem Sterling his man of the match award. Sterling hands it straight back, insisting the 17-year-old played better than he did. Leicester are in the semi-finals! They went 2-0 up, were pegged back with a last-gasp wonderstrike from Leighton Baines, but made easy work of the penalty shoot-out, winning 4-2. At Goodison Park, Kasper Schmeichel has saved the first two penalties he\u2019s faced, and Leicester lead 2-1 after three apiece. Oxford had 18 shots, and five on target with six corners. City had 18 shots, six on target and six corners. No team has had more shots against City since Pep Guardiola took over. Incredible statistics. Mackie and Cancelo, who instigated a bit of a late rumpus, seek each other out at the final whistle, have a chat, and hug it out. That\u2019s the spirit. 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! City win, but Oxford were really very good. 90+2 mins: Just seen that Baines goal. An absolute rocket, which flew unstoppably into the top corner! 90+1 mins: Meanwhile at Goodison Park, Everton have equalised in stoppage time! It\u2019s Leighton Baines, from long range. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be about three minutes. Sykes gets down the right, but his low centre is cut out. 88 mins: Another save from Bravo! This time a long ball from the right finds Fosu on the left, who does well to control it, better to beat his man and get into the area, and then tries a shot from a really very unpromising angle, which is duly stopped. 87 mins: Oxford make their final change, replacing Shandon Baptiste with John Mousinho. 85 mins: And another! A left-wing cross finds Sykes, but he\u2019s too cautious with his volley and it too goes straight to Bravo! This is tremendous from Oxford, but they can\u2019t find a finish! 84 mins: And another! Gorrin flicks on to Mackie, who spins and lashes a volley over the bar! 82 mins: Another chance for Oxford! They win a corner, and this one comes down in the middle of the penalty area where Dickie wins the header, but with the goal gaping he sends the ball straight to Bravo! 81 mins: Handbags! Cancelo pushes his left leg out into Mackie\u2019s path, Mackie kicks it out of his way, and everyone gets quite annoyed about it. 80 mins: Now they get a chance! Brannagan lays off to Fosu, just to the left of goal, but his shot is blocked. 77 mins: Oxford have not done much attacking since they went 2-1 down, and none at all since they conceded a third. Meanwhile in Manchester, United go 3-0 up against Colchester, Martial tapping in with Rashford again involved, this time as creator. 76 mins: And in further substitutional news, Adrian Bernabe comes on for City, replacing Sterling. 75 mins: A change in attack for Oxford, with Jamie Mackie coming on for Taylor. 74 mins: Another goal at Old Trafford, where Ryan Jackson has turned the ball into his own net rather than let it run to Rashford. It\u2019s Manchester United 2-0 Colchester now. 73 mins: Nearly a fourth for City, as Cancelo thunders in a rising drive from an acute angle that slaps the post and rebounds out of play. 72 mins: There\u2019s been another goal at Goodison Park, Tom Davies giving Everton a foothold in the game at 1-2. 71 mins: Bernardo Silva dinks the ball into the path of Jesus, who runs down the left and then squares for Sterling, who helps himself to another tap-in. Oxford press, City break and that\u2019s surely the game! 67 mins: Manchester United have finally found a way through Colchester, Rashford scoring in the 51st minute. 66 mins: Mahrez is played in by Gundogan, and lifts the ball past Archer and in, but he was a couple of yards offside. 65 mins: Brannagan overhits another set piece, this time a corner. Fosu controls it at the far edge of the penalty area, and shoots over the bar. 63 mins: Brannagan\u2019s right-footed cross from the left bounces out of play, but it was really quite close both to being converted by Taylor and to curling in at the back stick. 62 mins: The corner is headed to the edge of the area, from where it\u2019s volleyed wide. City make a second change, with Gabriel Jesus coming on for Angelino. 61 mins: Oxford are peppering the City box with crosses, and the occasional long throw. City have dealt with them all, but not with any great comfort. Now Fosu has a shot! It\u2019s from the left side of the area, and Bravo tips it over the bar! 59 mins: City make their first change, bringing Gundogan on for Rodri. 58 mins: For the second time in this half, a long, high ball into City\u2019s area provokes a bit of panic. Again, the ball ends up in the hands of Bravo. 57 mins: The night\u2019s first substitution sees Mark Sykes replace Dan Agyei. 54 mins: The game seems much more open in this half (hence the sudden goal flurry). Zinchenko\u2019s 25-yarder whistles across goal and a yard or so wide of the far post. A gorgeous cross from Angelino on the left, and Sterling runs between the two centre-halves and taps it in! 50 mins: A cross from the left, and instead of catching it Archer flaps it miserably into the thick of the penalty area and straight to a City player, whose volley is blocked! 49 mins: When Baptiste set up the equaliser with a quick free-kick, the ball was moving \u2013 so the goal could/should have been disallowed. 48 mins: Mahrez blasts a low cross from the right across the goalline, but there\u2019s nobody there to turn it in! 47 mins: Oxford win a free-kick just inside City\u2019s half and take it quickly, sliding in Taylor on the right. He cuts inside, knocking the ball through Harwood-Bellis\u2019s legs, and then from 12 yards thumps a left-footed shot past Bravo! Oxford equalise within 25 seconds of the restart! 46 mins: The players are back out, and Oxford get the second half started! It has been slightly disappointing so far: one deflected goal, no team consistently threatening, a lot of turnovers in midfield. But Oxford remain in the match, and for as long as that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s hope that this might yet turn into a stonker. Elsewhere, it\u2019s Everton 0-2 Leicester at the break, and the first half between Manchester United and Colchester United is nearly over, and goalless. Colchester, who have already eliminated Crystal Palace and Tottenham on penalties, will be delighted with that. 45+2 mins: Angelino ends the half by driving in something that might be a terrible cross or an even worse shot, from wide on the left. It\u2019s half-time, City have created little and they hold a slightly fortunate lead. 45 mins: They go for a cross, and again Brannagan overhits a set piece. Dickie just about keeps it in, but is offside. 45 mins: Ruffels does cross this time, and it\u2019s a pretty good one. City half-clear, but then Mahrez fouls Taylor and Oxford will have a chance to shoot or cross. 42 mins: Oxford break in numbers. City have defenders on hand to track the runners, and after carrying the ball to within 30 yards of goal Taylor decides a long-range shot would be a better bet than a pass through to, say, Fosu, and spears an effort well over the bar. 39 mins: Shot! Mahrez picks up the ball on the right, cuts into the area, cuts back onto his right foot and then sends a shot towards the near post. Archer pretty clearly fingertipped it onto the outside of the post, but it\u2019ll be a goal kick. 35 mins: Ruffels gets the ball in a decent position on the left wing for Oxford, but instead of driving into the box, or crossing with his left foot, he checks back onto his right, passes the ball back 40 yards, the ball goes back again to a centre-back, and the attack is over. 32 mins: Chance for City! Bernardo Silva plays Sterling in, and he lifts the ball over the advancing Archer, but it goes well wide. 31 mins: So far at Old Trafford, Colchester have had 22% of possession and no shots (United have had five) or corners (three). 30 mins: Leicester have scored a second, Jonny Evans heading in a corner. Manchester United v Colchester remains goalless. 29 mins: In one of the night\u2019s two other Carabao Cup tie, James Maddison has given Leicester a 1-0 lead at Everton. 25 mins: That is all a bit harsh. Oxford had played pretty well, threatened occasionally and defended excellently, and to go behind to a deflected shot will hurt. But they did give Cancelo an outlandish amount of space on City\u2019s right flank. Mahrez moves infield, leaving a ludicrous amount of space on the right wing for Cancelo to burst into. Burst into it he does, and he keeps bursting until he reaches the Oxford penalty area. He does in the end run out of space and ideas, and so lashes in a shot from an unpromising angle, which takes a convenient deflection off Moore, floats past Archer and in! 21 mins: Oxford send the goal kick back with interest, and Fosu wins a corner. Brannagan very nearly sends this one over everybody and out for a goal-kick as well, and though it\u2019s eventually kept in they can\u2019t make anything of it. 20 mins: A bit of pressure from Oxford, who after a decent start had fallen onto the back foot. Fosu wins a free-kick out on the left wing, and Brannagan lifts it over everybody and out for a goal-kick. 18 mins: Ooof! Sterling gets the ball on the edge of the area, but there\u2019s no shot on so he lifts it to Mahrez to his right. He volleys the ball across goal and Sterling would have had a tap-in but for Dickie\u2019s alertness and his excellent clearance, when he could well have sent it into his own net. 16 mins: Sterling has the ball in the net, but the offside flag is up, the whistle has blown and everybody else has stopped playing. A replay suggests it was a very tight call. 14 mins: A nice move from City ends with Angelino on the left, but his run is tracked and his cross deflected out for a corner, which is eventually cleared. 12 mins: City are yet to make their superiority tell, or even to make it particularly evident. Foden surges down the left, but is forced to turn back, and the ball is eventually turned over. 9 mins: A pass over the defence sends Sterling sprinting, but the only way past Dickie is by pulling his shirt, and Oxford get a free-kick. 8 mins: Angelino takes on Sam Long on the left. The ball ends up deflecting out off Long\u2019s fist, but the referee gives a goal kick. 6 mins: Sterling lifts his shot over the wall, over the goal and into the fans, who cheer uproariously. 6 mins: Sterling is fouled by Gorrin, 30 yards or so from goal. Shot incoming. 4 mins: Oxford now break forward, and win the first corner of the game. It\u2019s headed clear. 2 mins: Angelino\u2019s cross from the left is a little overstrong, and Mahrez can\u2019t bring it under his spell. Oxford clear. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Manchester City get the game started. Not silence, applause. Oxford\u2019s fans stand and clap, and then the referee blows his whistle and they give a final roar. Kick-off time! There will be a minute\u2019s silence before kick-off for Jim Smith, the former Oxford manager. And out they come! It\u2019s windy and rainy, but Oxford might need more levellers than that. Action imminent. The players are in the tunnel! It looks a bit cramped in there, so they\u2019ll be keen to get going. Karl Robinson has a chat about Oxford\u2019s prospects this evening. In brief: not great. You always have a puncher\u2019s chance. Not a strong one. Listen, you can stand here and say you have a great chance or a rubbish chance. The gulf between the teams is glaringly obvious but we enjoy the challenge and embrace the opportunity to play against one of the best teams in the land. This is going to be as difficult as it gets. The way we try to play, we have a big pitch, a nice pitch, a flat pitch, and for once this season it probably isn\u2019t going to work in our favour. I love [Pep\u2019s] style. It\u2019s something I do gravitate towards. Only our players maybe aren\u2019t as good, and the manager\u2019s nowhere near as good. You\u2019d be lying if you said he wasn\u2019t somebody who\u2019s at the top of the tree when it comes to our industry. Mikel Arteta, as confirmed by Pep Guardiola yesterday, is in Oxford this evening. If the pictures are anything to go by, he seems to have a lot on his mind. Here are the teams again, this time in purely textual form. Oxford United: Archer, Long, Moore, Dickie, Ruffels, Baptiste, Gorrin, Brannagan, Agyei, Taylor, Fosu. Subs: Cadden, Hall, Jack Stevens, Mousinho, Henry, Sykes, Mackie. Man City: Bravo, Joao Cancelo, Garcia, Harwood-Bellis, Jose Angelino, Zinchenko, Rodri, Foden, Bernardo Silva, Sterling, Mahrez. Subs: Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus, Mendy, Otamendi, Carson, Bernabe, Dionkou. Referee: Andrew Madley. The team sheets are in! City have an inexperienced central defence, composed as it is of 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis and 18-year-old Eric Garc\u00eda (both have birthdays next month). The rest of the team, though, is pretty familiar. As rumoured, the returning Oleksandr Zinchenko and Angelino both play. Hello world! Manchester City\u2019s two previous line-ups in this competition have been, from Oxford\u2019s perspective at least, distressingly strong. Claudio Bravo has started in goal each time, though a 36-year-old with three league winners\u2019 medals and a Champions League to his name can hardly be considered gauche, while 18-year-old Eric Garc\u00eda played both games at centre-back \u2013 one alongside Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who is only 17 \u2013 and the similarly youthful midfielder Tommy Doyle got a start in the 3-1 home win against Southampton in the fourth round.

In the meantime here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s preview: When Oxford United and Manchester City collide on Wednesday, entertainment is unlikely to be in short supply. In the manager\u2019s office at the League One club\u2019s Kassam Stadium, the E-word is the buzzword as Karl Robinson explains how he is looking forward to a reunion with Pep Guardiola, this time in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals.

City had to battle for the win and are digging their heels in over Mikel Arteta, whose presence here dominated the discourse before and after this entertaining contest. Arsenal expect to appoint Arteta as their next manager but Guardiola was prickly when asked about his assistant\u2019s future, with City furious at the club\u2019s conduct, insisting they have not made a formal approach for the Spaniard. City, who have won this competition the past two years, dominated the first half but Oxford made an experimental visiting side sweat in the second half. Oxford had 18 shots \u2013 the most City have faced under Guardiola \u2013 but could not wrestle their way back into the game after a second-half Raheem Sterling double earned the visitors some breathing space. Sterling, who wore the captain\u2019s armband and operated as a striker here as Guardiola rested eight players, displayed a poacher\u2019s instinct, twice applying the finishing touches inside the six-yard box after Matty Taylor cancelled out Jo\u00e3o Cancelo\u2019s opener immediately after the restart. Oxford asked questions but City, who have not lost in this competition since defeat to Manchester United in October 2016, held on to maintain their hopes of defending the trophy. The cover of the match-day programme was dedicated to Jim Smith, the former Oxford manager, who last week died at the age of 79.

Poets have often played with writing intentionally bad poetry. John Donne wrote intentionally bad poetry as a reaction against Elizabethan poetry, many of his poems satirising earlier forms. Geoffrey Chaucer also wrote intentionally bad poetry, using the technique to represent his narrator\u2019s different levels of education in the middle ages.</p> <p>Varjack says many contemporary performers embody characters in anti-slams as well, using bad poetry not to comment on their socioeconomic status but to mock and ridicule them.</p> <p>It\u2019s this use of comedy that sets the anti-slam apart from its serious and often highly politicised counterpart, with many performances mocking the cliches of slam poetry. David Graham, host of Word Hurl Anti-Slam in Newcastle, New South Wales, says the anti-slam is also a reaction to the pressure put on the arts to justify its existence and influence public opinion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/11/hanna-cormick-the-performance-artist-whos-allergic-to-the-world\">Hanna Cormick: the performance artist who's allergic to the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of people say they aren\u2019t creative,\u201d Graham says, \u201cbut then they\u2019ve got these notebooks full of poems. They just haven\u2019t found the forum to express themselves in a way that they\u2019re comfortable with. That\u2019s one of the experiences I\u2019ve tried to create with the anti-slams.\u201d</p> <p>For Varjack, the anti-slam is really about people coming together. \u201cI know I keep using this word \u2018community\u2019 but I think it\u2019s because that is so much at the core of it. Community, even for one night. Community created around a celebration of creative risk. I also think there is great power in bringing people together through humour.\u201d</p> <p>This is a sentiment Boyd and Nash agree with. \u201cTo get up and purposely perform something unquestionably awful takes a lot of trust in the audience,\u201d Nash says. \u201cIt\u2019s vulnerability of a different sort to a traditional slam, and it\u2019s really rewarding in such a socially performative age to give people the chance to let go, to invite ridicule, and to play with that in a safe environment.\u201d</p>",

Varjack says many contemporary performers embody characters in anti-slams as well, using bad poetry not to comment on their socioeconomic status but to mock and ridicule them. It\u2019s this use of comedy that sets the anti-slam apart from its serious and often highly politicised counterpart, with many performances mocking the cliches of slam poetry. David Graham, host of Word Hurl Anti-Slam in Newcastle, New South Wales, says the anti-slam is also a reaction to the pressure put on the arts to justify its existence and influence public opinion. \u201cA lot of people say they aren\u2019t creative,\u201d Graham says, \u201cbut then they\u2019ve got these notebooks full of poems. They just haven\u2019t found the forum to express themselves in a way that they\u2019re comfortable with. That\u2019s one of the experiences I\u2019ve tried to create with the anti-slams.\u201d For Varjack, the anti-slam is really about people coming together. \u201cI know I keep using this word \u2018community\u2019 but I think it\u2019s because that is so much at the core of it. Community, even for one night. Community created around a celebration of creative risk. I also think there is great power in bringing people together through humour.\u201d This is a sentiment Boyd and Nash agree with. \u201cTo get up and purposely perform something unquestionably awful takes a lot of trust in the audience,\u201d Nash says. \u201cIt\u2019s vulnerability of a different sort to a traditional slam, and it\u2019s really rewarding in such a socially performative age to give people the chance to let go, to invite ridicule, and to play with that in a safe environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sid Lowe\u2019s match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company and emails - goodnight! Sergio Ramos speaks \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win a game you feel disappointed. I felt Real Madrid deserved more. It\u2019s a very complicated game \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to come here, but we took the game to them and caused them problems. We didn\u2019t make the kind of mistakes that have cost us so much in previous clasicos. We controlled the game quite well, especially the transitions. It\u2019s not easy to do that in the Camp Nou. \u201cWe had a strategy to put pressure on them high up and make it difficult to play the ball out from the back, and we did that. I think we\u2019re having a really positive spell. We should have had two penalties [for fouls from corners], but that\u2019s football. We\u2019re leaving here with a smile on our faces.\u201d Barcelona stay top of the table on goal difference. The match wasn\u2019t a stinker, but nor was it one of the great 0-0s. Real Madrid were much better in the first hour, though Barcelona were more dangerous after bringing on Arturo Vidal and rejigging their midfield. Peep peep! For the first time since 23 November 2002, el clasico ends goalless. 90+3 min Both teams would like to win, but what they really, really want is to not lose. It shows. 90+2 min Carvajal is booked for a hack at Ansu Fati, and then has the effrontery to signal that he got the ball. 90+2 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Luke Loteng, \u201cdoes MBM mean motivated by money? Just wondering.\u201d Lord, I wish it did. 90+1 min Five minutes of added time. 90 min Carvajal runs into the area, onto a return pass from Modric. He overruns the ball but still manages to hit a shot that is blocked by Jordi Alba. 87 min Ansu Fati wins a corner for Barcelona. He takes it himself, driving it beyond the far post, where the under-pressure Suarez heads well wide. The last goalless draw between these sides, since you asked, was 6734 days ago. 84 min Bale is fine. Lenglet looks a bit groggier but is going to continue. 83 min There\u2019s a break in play after a clash of heads between Lenglet and Bale. While they are being treated, the 17-year-old Ansu Fati replaces Antoine Griezmann. 80 min A double change for Real Madrid: Rodrygo and Luka Modric replace Isco and Fede Valverde. Both were excellent but have looked tired in the last 10-15 minutes. 78 min Sergio Ramos gets his mandatory clasico booking, either for dissent or a foul on Messi. 77 min \u201cI can happily confirm that people in countries other than England read the Guardian MBM and are interested in el clasico,\u201d says Clare Lawrence. \u201cEspecially since this MBM is on the front page of Guardian Australia.\u201d 76 min Isco is booked for a lunge at Griezmann. Just as Barcelona\u2019s three yellow cards told the story of the first half, so Real\u2019s three tell the story of the last 10 minutes. 76 min Real Madrid were so dominant for so long, but it is starting to feel like they are hanging on for a point. Barcelona have been so much better since the introduction of Arturo Vidal. 74 min After a frantic counter-attack from Barcelona, Suarez whacks a curler high and wide from the left side of the area. NO GOAL! Yes, the offside decision stands. They are checking the offside but I am pretty sure Mendy was offside. 73 min: BALE HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED FOR OFFSIDE! It\u2019s the right decision, just about. Mendy was a fraction offside when he ran onto a crossfield pass and cushioned a volley across goal for Bale to score from close range. 72 min A neat lay-off from Suarez finds de Jong, who surges forward and hits a low drive from 20 yards that is comfortably saved by Courtois. 71 min \u201cThanks for throwing the rule book in my face, Rob,\u201d says Colin Chamberlain. \u201cYou do invite musings to be emailed to you, remember?\u201d Musings, aye. 70 min Bale is booked for a late tackle on Griezmann. 68 min: Good chance for Bale! Valverde slalomed infield from the right, all the way to the edge of the box. After his first attempted pass was blocked, Valverde poked the loose ball through to Bale in space on the left side of the area. He allowed the ball to run across his body and lashed a rising drive that rippled the side netting at the near post. He should have done better. 67 min \u201cYou HAD to link to that a Ronaldo header, didn\u2019t you?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m still scarred by a similarly towering header he put away a few summers ago. Still, on a vaguely related note, very happy to see Bale playing for Madrid. Should he score the winner, I\u2019m sure many things will be forgiven.\u201d Based on your emails during the MBM, I\u2019m surprised you can remember anything about that night. 66 min Casemiro is booked for a foul on Suarez. Barcelona are having their best attacking spell of the game. 65 min A very deep cross from the right is headed off the outside of the near post by Benzema. It\u2019s not as dramatic as it sounds: ter Stegen had it covered and watched it all the way. 64 min Griezmann has a snapshot blocked and Madrid break dangerously, only for Benzema to play a poor ball to Valverde. 61 min A couple of points on that double chance. Had Messi scored, it might have been disallowed for an accidental handball by Griezmann in the build-up; and I think Suarez had miskicked before Ramos challenged him, though it\u2019s hard to be sure. It was in the same attack as the Messi miss, so presumably the Griezmann handball would still have been a factor. I\u2019ll level with you: I haven\u2019t a clue about the laws these days. 60 min: Lionel Messi turns into a pub player! What a miss that was. He was found by Griezmann\u2019s low cross, eight yards from goal, but he miskicked the ball completely. A few seconds later, Sergio Ramos made a desperate last-ditch tackle to deny Luis Suarez. At first look I thought it was a penalty; the referee did not. 57 min \u201cSo if it\u2019s on tele why do people follow it on the computer?\u201d sniffs Colin Chamberlain. \u201cA barca is a boat in Spanish. FC Barcelona\u2019s nickname is Bar\u00e7a in Catalan.\u201d Okay. 1. As you\u2019ll doubtless know if you\u2019ve read the Guardian football website at any point in the past 20 years, we don\u2019t do MBMs of games unless they are on TV. 2. As you\u2019ll doubtless know if you\u2019ve read the Guardian football website at any point in the last 20 years, the Guardian style guide says we should not use diacritical markings in MBMs. 55 min Arturo Vidal replaces Nelson Semedo for Barcelona, which means Sergi Roberto will move to right-back. 54 min Valverde has far too much time to tee up another sweet long-range strike that deflects wide off poor old Pique. Barcelona are being battered 0-0. 53 min \u201cI\u2019m interested in this game, if that helps,\u201d says Mac Millings, although quite why The Guardian thinks people are interested in Colin Chamberlain\u2019s opinion is beyond me. I\u2019m calling that personal attack a \u2018tactical foul\u2019 by the way, but only to annoy Stephen Carr.\u201d 52 min Another long spell of possession from Real. It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve dominated like this at the Camp Nou. 50 min Messi skedaddles thrillingly from centre to left before driving a low cross that is cleared a split-second before reaching Griezmann. 49 min Bale is flattened by Lenglet, a clear foul that the referee can\u2019t be bothered to give. That was a bit odd. Apparently Arturo Vidal is warming up for Barcelona, which is no surprise given the way Real dominated the midfield in the first half. 47 min The impressive Isco wins an early corner for Madrid. It\u2019s headed away by Pique, who has been Barcelona\u2019s rock so far. 46 min Peep peep! Barcelona begin the second half. \u201cThe amount of space that Barca\u2019s pressing leaves is a cause for concern,\u201d says Hrishabh Narayan. \u201cRoberto playing RM but finding it hard to cast off the right-back in him. Needs to be forward more and a little more centre. For he has always made a difference with those diagonal through runs.\u201d \u201cWhy do The Guardian think people are interested in this,\u201d says Colin Chamberlain. \u201cEverton are playing Leicester City in the League Cup 1/4 final. By the way, in Spain they are known as Madrid, not Real.\u201d Well, the Everton game isn\u2019t on TV, so there\u2019s that. There\u2019s also a developing - if controversial - school of thought that people in all countries are interested in the most glamorous fixture in world football. \u201cI\u2019m petitioning Uefa to introduce mandatory yellow cards for use of the term \u2018tactical foul\u2019,\u201d says Stephen Carr. This one will run and run. Until somebody stops it with a tactical foul. \u201cI\u2019m late to the play,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cJust settling into my seat for the end of Act I of the Panto, and it seems that Sergio Ramos is still on the pitch. Theatre just isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d He\u2019s setting a new record for clasico appearances tonight. I suppose we all hoped he would behave accordingly, but he hasn\u2019t tried to maim anyone yet. Half-time reading Peep peep! Both teams had attempts cleared off the line in a relatively subdued first half. Madrid have been the better team and should probably be ahead, with Barcelona struggling to get control of the midfield. For once, the story of the half can be told in the number of bookings: Barcelona 3-0 Madrid. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Lenglet is booked for a cynical foul on the breaking Isco. Just before that, Suarez\u2019s cushioned volley across the six-yard box took a vital deflection off Mendy, with Messi waiting behind him to score. 44 min Another sweetly struck long-range volley from Valverde is well saved by ter Stegen, falling to his right. 43 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says Neil McGwyre. \u201cJust watching that video of Ronaldo nutting that header home made me think that he might have a future in Aussie rules when he decides there are no more worlds to conquer on the association football scene. The ability to get up like that and take a mark is a much-revered talent and would have him on many an end-of-season highlights reel. If he\u2019d like to a grow a mullet and get many more tattoos then he can only increase his chances. I\u2019m quite sure he\u2019d also be fond of the very short shorts and the sleeveless tops to show off his guns.\u201d 41 min: Jordi Alba misses a great chance! Messi played an exquisite chip over the defence, right into the path of Alba\u2019s run, but his sidefooted volley from eight yards bobbled just wide of the far post. 40 min Suarez reminds everyone he\u2019s on the field by giving the assistant referee an unmerited bollocking and then, seconds later, getting himself booked for a foul on Casemiro. 37 min Kroos, given far too much space 25 yards from goal, shoots well wide. Barcelona look really vulnerable in midfield; Sergio Busquets is having a marvellous game. 35 min Barcelona are having plenty of possession now, but Real still look the more dangerous side. 33 min That header from Ronaldo is utterly ludicrous. 31 min This is warming up nicely. Pique heads a cross away to Valverde, who swishes a beautiful volley from 25 yards that beats ter Stegen and flashes this far wide of the far post. His technique was immaculate. 31 min Jordi Alba\u2019s cross is punched away by the flying Courtois. The ball runs to Messi, whose snapshot is superbly cleared off the line by Sergio Ramos! 29 min This game could do with a bit of Ronaldo. 27 min The resulting corner is headed behind by the backpedalling Varane. 26 min Another nice move from Madrid. Valverde frees Benzema on the right side of the area, and his low cross towards Isco is kicked away by ter Stegen. The ball reaches Casemiro 30 yards out, and his curling shot is palmed behind for a corner by the diving ter Stegen. 24 min Isco has been terrific. He combines with Bale to find Benzema, whose cross is booted away by the beleaguered looking Pique. 22 min I\u2019m dedicating this entry to Antoine Griezmann because I don\u2019t want him to feel left out. 21 min Rakitic is booked for a tactical foul on Isco. Real are much the better team at the moment. 20 min This is a superb spell for Madrid, with Barcelona struggling to get out after a series of Real corners. Eventually they get a slightly generous free-kick for a foul by Varane on Jordi Alba. 19 min After another Real corner causes problems, Casemiro has a low shot kicked away by Lenglet, just in front of ter Stegen in the six-yard box. 18 min That was a vital piece of defending from Pique. He wasn\u2019t on the post, but smelt danger as the cross came in and ran back towards the goal-line to head it clear. 17 min Casemiro\u2019s long-range shot deflects behind for a corner. It\u2019s taken short to Carvajal, whose cross is headed towards goal by Casemiro and cleared off the line by Pique! 16 min Isco wriggles away from Semedo on the left, but his cross is headed clear by Pique. 14 min The last few minutes have been scruffy and frantic. Calm down lads, it\u2019s only a game, eh? Eh? 11 min Barcelona appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Jordi Alba\u2019s low cross hits the sliding Carvajal. Just one problem: it didn\u2019t touch his hand, and even if it had it wouldn\u2019t have been a penalty because the ball deflected off his body. 10 min Real have their first good spell of possession. Isco is eased over by Pique on the edge of the box but the ball runs square to Benzema, whose snapshot is straight at ter Stegen. Good strike, though. 9 min Messi looks in the mood. He ignores challenges from Kroos and then Casemiro before playing a fine pass through the lines to de Jong. Nothing comes of it but it was an imperious bit of play from Messi. 8 min Barcelona have started with a relaxed confidence in possession. Real have done a lot of chasing in the first few minutes. 5 min Messi sprays a gorgeous crossfield ball to release Jordi Alba, who half-volleys a first-time cross towards the unmarked Suarez in the area. He can\u2019t control it and the ball runs away to safety. With a surer touch he would have been in, though it wasn\u2019t the easiest ball to take. 4 min Lots of Barcelona possession in the early minutes, though nothing remotely troublesome for Madrid. Bale is playing as a right-winger when Barcelona have the ball. 2 min The early signs are that Real are playing a midfield diamond, with Isco scheming behind a front two of Benzema and Bale. 1 min Peep peep! Real Madrid kick off from right to left as we watch. The players are out on the field. The captions, Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos, embrace warmly. That\u2019s the pleasantries out of the way. Thanks to David Warren for alterting us to the news that Ivan Rakitic has replaced Sergio Busquets in the Barcelona XI. It\u2019s not exactly Ronaldo and the World Cup final, but it\u2019s still a bit mysterious. Barcelona say it was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and \u201ca technical decision\u201d; other reports suggest Busquets has a fever. One thing\u2019s for sure: when the full story emerges, we\u2019ll be the 12th to break it. These are the revised teams. Barcelona (4-3-3) Ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Jordi Alba; Sergi Roberto, Rakitic, de Jong; Messi, Suarez, Griezmann. Substitutes: Neto, Busquets, Alena, Vidal, Umtiti, Carles Perez, Ansu Fati. Real Madrid (4-D-2) Courtois; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Mendy; Casemiro; Valverde, Kroos; Isco; Bale, Benzema. Substitutes: Areola, Modric, Eder Militao, Nacho, Jovic, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo. Alternative MBM action, while u wait Pre-match reading Gareth Bale starts for Madrid; Luka Modric does not. Barcelona have picked Sergi Roberto in midfield ahead of Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal. Barcelona (4-3-3) Ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Jordi Alba; Sergi Roberto, Busquets, de Jong; Messi, Suarez, Griezmann. Substitutes: Neto, Rakitic, Alena, Vidal, Umtiti, Carles Perez, Ansu Fati. Real Madrid (4-D-2) Courtois; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Mendy; Casemiro; Valverde, Kroos; Isco; Bale, Benzema. Substitutes: Areola, Modric, Eder Militao, Nacho, Jovic, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo. Hello. Nine and a half months is a long time between cl\u00e1sicos; the longest gap, in fact, since 1996. When Barcelona and Real Madrid met at the start of March, the world was a different place. Real were European champions, Barcelona were European champions-elect. And football was the main topic of conversation. Tonight, sport and politics have no choice but to mix. This match has already been postponed once because of the Catalan crisis, and there is a major security operation in place at the Camp Nou. Both teams have arrived at the ground without any problems. It\u2019s the first cl\u00e1sico since April 2014 that does not involve the champions of Europe. That\u2019s an apt reflection of a match that is not quite as showstopping as it has been for most of the decade. But it still involves the current and - spoiler alert! - future champions of Spain. Barcelona and Real Madrid top the La Liga table with 35 points from 16 games. In the absence of any head-to-head results, Barcelona are in first place because of a superior goal difference. Roll up, roll up, it\u2019s time for the Christmas cl\u00e1sico! Kick off is at 7pm local time, 8pm in Barcelona.",

Police in Brazil have raided the house of a longstanding friend of Jair Bolsonaro in connection with a major corruption investigation centred around the president\u2019s son, Flavio. Recommended reads Deep, fortifying, true friendship is for the young. So the 80s classic film Stand By Me tells us, writes Josephine Tovey. Getting older, especially crossing into your 30s and beyond, means forgoing all that intimacy and connection, at least with people outside your family or your marriage. Data supports this but even if your close friendships get fewer they also get more resilient: \u201cThere is a lot of elasticity in these relationships. They can stretch, occasionally go slack, sadly, but often they snap back better than you might think.\u201d It\u2019s a buzz term that was used across the 2010s but what will the \u201cnew normal\u201d be for Australia\u2019s economy in the 2020s? Despite emerging from the GFC in a more robust state than most other nations, Australia has been hugely outperformed by OECD rivals in terms of household incomes, writes Greg Jericho. Which could spell high underemployment next decade, as well as ongoing stagnant real wages. Listen It is literally the burning topic across Australia \u2013 but have the nation\u2019s leaders done enough to anticipate the future threat of climate change?

Sport Mikel Arteta appears set to be the new Arsenal manager, with the club holding final talks to secure Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City assistant. The news comes less than 24 hours after Carlo Ancelotti was revealed to be taking over at Everton. With a Twenty20 World Cup on home soil less than a year away, it\u2019s intriguing that Australia\u2019s men\u2019s team will head into 2020 with a 50-over team that looks much closer to the Test line-up than a 20-over outfit, writes Geoff Lemon. Media roundup A massive expansion of coal-fired power in China is pushing the world\u2019s climate change targets out of reach, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Victorian police will be armed with semi-automatic rifles next year as part of a hardline response to armed offenders and suspected terrorists, writes the Age. And high winds could cause the 400,000 hectare monster inferno north of Sydney to combine with a second blaze south of the city, warns the Daily Telegraph. Coming up Chris Dawson, who was the subject of the Teacher\u2019s Pet podcast, returns to court on a murder charge.

      "bodyText": "A decorated Metropolitan police superintendent convicted of possessing a child abuse video has formally asked the court of appeal to strike down her conviction. Lawyers for Robyn Williams, 54, this week lodged the appeal against the guilty verdict reached by a jury after a controversial investigation and prosecution, that now sees her treated like a child sex offender. Williams was convicted in November after her sister sent her unsolicited video of a child being abused in February 2018, wanting the paedophile behind it hunted down and caught. The Met police want to dismiss Williams from the force under a fast-track procedure that could see her within months sacked from policing after a 36-year career. Williams\u2019 lawyers have asked for the case to be expedited and are arguing that the conviction under anti-paedophile laws is unsafe. The first stage is a court of appeal judge deciding whether the case should be heard. The Old Bailey jury convicted Williams of having the video on her phone. Under the law, she had to show she had a lawful reason to have it in her possession. Williams insisted she never realised the video was there and that it was not clear, from a still from the video shown in her WhatsApp account, what it was about. She insisted that, despite spending a long time with her sister after the video was sent to her, the video and its contents were never discussed, as the two sisters enjoyed a spa day. The jury convicted Williams of the charge by majority verdict. But the jury unanimously acquitted her of failing for corrupt reasons to report the video, with the prosecution claiming she failed to do so because she feared her sister would get in trouble. Seemingly, they accepted that she was unaware of the video. Some of Williams\u2019 supporters saw these verdicts as perverse, and some others as worrying. The appeal by Williams will say the conviction is unsafe because the jury appears to have dismissed key evidence. This includes two people who also received the video who said they could not tell, from the still in WhatsApp, what its content was. They also appear, lawyers will argue, to have dismissed an expert who said there was no evidence that Williams ever played the video. The appeal also claims that a recording of a phone call between Williams and her sister, after the sister was arrested, supports the senior police officer\u2019s claim her sister never mentioned the video to her when they spent time together. Williams was sentenced to community service and placed on the sex offender register despite the prosecution accepting she had no sexual interest in children. She has already started her community service working in a charity shop. Williams, one of the most senior female African-Caribbean officers in Britain, was praised for her work after the Grenfell fire disaster. She was a founder member of the National Black Police Association, helped to set up a gay police association, campaigned for more women in policing, and had received the Queen\u2019s Police Medal. Her sister, Jennifer Hodge, 56, was convicted of distributing an indecent image of a child. She sent it via WhatsApp to 17 people, including Williams, who was the only one charged.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Be sure to read the inestimable Andy Hunter\u2019s full match report from the ground at Doha\u2019s Khalifa International Stadium. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back Saturday for minute-by-minute coverage of Liverpool v Flamengo. There\u2019s the whistle and Liverpool are through to the Club World Cup final for the first time since 2005 thanks to a late winner by the super sub Firmino! The European Champions advance to Saturday\u2019s final against Flamengo, who rallied to defeat Saudi side Al-Hilal in yesterday\u2019s first semi-final. Salah beats two defenders down the right side, fends them off long enough to pick off the runner Alexander-Arnold, who finds Firmino practically on the goal line for the nifty finish. That should be the winner! 90 min: The fourth official signals for three minutes of added time. 89 min: Jonathan Gonzalez comes on for Pizarro, Monterrey\u2019s third sub. 87 min: Monterrey win their third corner. It\u2019s played toward the near post and flicked toward the far before it\u2019s cleared. Liverpool attempt to counter, but Sanchez tracks back and keeps it on the rails. 85 min: We\u2019re back up and running and Klopp will make his final substitution, inserting Firmino for Origi. 84 min: Play has been stopped for over a minute as a Monterrey player is down at the halfway line for ... a cramp? Liverpool players do not appear happy with the referee. 82 min: A second change for Monterrey as Maximiliano Meza enters in place of Pabon, who\u2019s been a thorn in Liverpool\u2019s side all night. 80 min: Mane\u2019s effort from distance is saved. We\u2019re deadlocked with 10 minutes to go and the potential of extra time and penalties looming. 79 min: Moments after Gallardo is shown yellow for a tardy challenge, Miguel Layun enters for Montes, who was excellent today in the center back role. Looks as if Layun is playing right back while Medina shifts to the middle. 77 min: Monterrey manager Antonio Mohamed has been shown a yellow card after his shall we say overzealous appeal to the referee to get Joe Gomez sent off. And it looks like Klopp has been booked as well. Weird. 75 min: A good chance for Liverpool as Milner plays it in from the right side to Origi, but he\u2019s swarmed by defenders can\u2019t direct it squarely on target. The ball actually deflects off Mane in the end, but either way it\u2019s out for a goal kick. Now Alexander-Arnold enters for Milner, Liverpool\u2019s second change. 72 min: Gallardo gets it on his left foot and cracks a shot on goal from inside the area but Allison punches it away. Monterrey have been on the front foot since half-time and appear to have the edge with 20 minutes to go. Alexander-Arnold has been called over and it appears will come on imminently. 68 min: Another heart-stopping chance for Monterrey is turned away and finally Mane cames on for Shaqiri ahead of a corner for the Mexican side. 66 min: Monterrey carve the Liverpool back line to pieces (again) and very nearly take the lead, but chances by Funes Mori and Pabon are both turned away. 63 min: A wide-open contest with chances on both ends as we drift past the hour mark. Feels like Mane or Firmino could be due any moment. Meanwhile a Mexican wave has broken out in the crowd, lending to the big-game atmosphere of the occasion. 61 min: Liverpool win a corner. Very poor marking by Monterrey as it\u2019s played to Lallana before falling to Origi, who pounds it into the back of the goal. Alas, the flag is up as the Belgian was about five yards offside. 58 min: Moments after Keita\u2019s effort, Gomez is shown yellow for a late challenge on Funes Mori, who appeals to the referee that he was free on goal. 57 min: It\u2019s another self-created chance for Keita, who\u2019s been so close twice in addition to his early opener, but Barovero is there to make the save at point-blank range. 55 min: Another nifty backheel by Salah on the edge of the area to find Milner in stride, but it\u2019s well-covered by the Monterrey defense and kicked out for a Liverpool corner, which quickly fizzles out to nothing. 52 min: Another shot by the industrious Pabon, another save by the in-form Allison. Monterrey rapping away on the door early in the second half, giving the European champions a headache at the back. 50 min: Monterrey win a free kick and Pabon\u2019s thunderbolt from range demands yet another highlight-reel save by Allison, who\u2019s been excellent today. Liverpool are quick on the counterattack, but imprecise in the final third before returning possession to Monterrey. 48 min: Origi darts down the left flank and finds Salah in the area, but the Liverpool star can\u2019t get a shot off. The ball falls to Robertson, but his shot is blasted over the crossbar. 47 min: Vangioni is first into the book, shown yellow after catching Shaqiri late. He\u2019d escaped punishment for an even harsher challenge on Salah in the opening minutes. 46 min: And we\u2019re off in the second half with Liverpool kicking off attacking from left to right. No changes for either side, it appears, though Salah has shifted into the middle with Origi on the left and Shaqiri on the right. A quick spot of half-time reading, with a nod to Liverpool\u2019s visit to Qatar. An entertaining opening 45 minutes with brisk two-way action and plenty of chances on both ends. Liverpool are winning the possession battle while Monterrey have generated the better opportunities, showing they can take a punch with their rapid response to Keita\u2019s early opening. Plenty more to come from Khalifa International Stadium! 45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of added time. 43 min: Keita nearly makes it two on the day after he\u2019s released by Oxlade-Chamberlain but Barovero is off his line in time for the easy save. 40 min: The European champions have dominated possession but Monterrey have created the better chances through high pressure and timely counterattacking against a somewhat patched-together Liverpool backline. 37 min: Monterrey nearly take the lead (again) after a quick counterattack through the middle aided by a false step by Jordan Henderson into the midfield. Pabon surges down the right flank and plays it to the far post, but Allison darts off his line and makes a fingertip save with his outstretched right hand. Monterrey have been so very dangerous in transition today. 33 min: An awful giveaway by Sanchez, whose pocket is picked by Salah in Monterrey\u2019s own half. But the Argentine center back recovers nicely and prevents a scoring chance with a clean last-ditch tackle. 30 min: Monterrey win a free kick after an overzealous challenge by Joe Gomez and they\u2019ll look to build up from the back. Which they do, expeditiously. But Gallardo\u2019s effort from a step outside the area soars over the crossbar. 27 min: Monterrey have been positive and inspired in attack tonight even if they don\u2019t have the quantity of chances to show for it. Here Gallardo takes a touch too many before he\u2019s dispossessed in the midfield. But moments later Keita gives it away carelessly and Pabon sends a cracking shot to the far post that\u2019s diverted only by a fully extended Allison. A great save. 23 min: Salah with another sublime backheel on the right flank to free Milner in the area but a well-positioned Barovero is there to make the save. 20 min: Harsh assessment from the gallery. 18 min: Milner is down after a fairly violent collision with Gallardo, who arrived late. But he\u2019s up, walking around and it appears he will stay on. Play resumes with Monterrey still in their high press. And Monterrey have equalized! Alisson makes a hair-trigger save of a Gallardo shot after poor clearance of a free kick, but Funes Mori is perfectly positioned to tap in the rebound. Game on! 12 min: The Liga MX standard-bearers are undeterred with Pabon nearly scoring mere seconds after the restart. Milner plays to Salah\u2019s feet and the Liverpool star divides the defense with a gorgeous reverse pass behind Sanchez and Montes. An excellent finish by Keita makes it 1-0. 9 min: The free kick is played short to Shaqiri but the possession fizzles out and Monterrey look to counter quickly with a ball over the top \u2013 not the first time the Mexican side have tried the direct route behind the Liverpool back line. Allison is there to clear it. 8 min: A very strong challenge from behind on Mo Salah by Leonel Vangioni and Liverpool will have a free kick from inside the Monterrey half. 4 min: Crisp two-way pace to start off. Henderson is playing the left center back position for Liverpool with Gomez on the right. Liverpool have the first decent chance of the night as Shaqiri cuts back just outside the area but sends a shot wide of the target. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! Liverpool attacking from right to left in all-red kits, Monterrey from left to right in white-and-blue striped shirts with blue shorts. Last night\u2019s first semi-final between Flamengo and Al-Hilal drew an announced attendance of 21,588. A bit of a fuller crowd for tonight\u2019s match but far from a sellout of the 48,000-seat Khalifa International Stadium, it appears. About 10 minutes from kickoff. A big ovation for crowd favorite Mo Salah when he emerged from the tunnel for warm-ups. A quick look at the inbox as the Khalifa International Stadium slowly fills. Here\u2019s a question from Peter Oh. Hi Bryan, Is Monterrey\u2019s Funes Mori the same Funes Mori formerly of Everton? (I\u2019m trying to find any dash of spice to liven up my appetite for this match.) Monterrey\u2019s Rogelio Funes Mori is the twin brother of the departed Everton defender Ramiro, who did quite a number on Liverpool\u2019s Divock Origi a few years back. Unless of course we\u2019re getting Parent Trap\u2019d. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has made five changes from the side that beat Watford on Saturday to maintain their 10-point lead atop the Premier League table. The big change comes in the heart of the defense where skipper Jordan Henderson will pair with Joe Gomez. Adam Lallana, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will come into the midfield while James Milner takes over at right back with Robertson moving over to the left side. Monterrey XI: Barovero, Sanchez, Vangioni, Medina, Montes, Pabon, Ortiz, Pizarro, Gallardo, Carlos Rodriguez, Funes Mori Subs: Cardenas, Resendez, Basanta, Layun, Gutierrez, Vasquez, Arturo Gonzalez, Meza, Jonathan Gonzalez, MejIa, Jonathan Urretaviscaya, Zaldivar Liverpool XI: Alisson, Milner, Henderson, Robertson, Gomez, Lallana, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Keita, Salah, Shaqiri, Origi Subs: Lonergan, Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Williams, Jones, Firmino, Mane Hello and welcome to Qatar for today\u2019s second Club World Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Monterrey. The European champions are back in action for the second time in as many days after enlisting a youth team for yesterday\u2019s 5-0 defeat to Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup, which dashed their quintuple hopes.

More to come directly, including the just-in team sheets, with kickoff roughly 45 minutes away. Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s thoughts on his team\u2019s campaign: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Fifa\u2019s scheduling of the Club World Cup undermines respect for the competition but Liverpool did not \u201cfly 3,000 miles not to show up\u201d in Qatar.

He said proposals for an expanded 24-team Club World Cup from the summer of 2021 \u2013 days after the Champions League final and potentially clashing with the Nations League, Africa Cup of Nations and the Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 would not help the competition\u2019s prestige. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about respect in England but we are here now and completely focused,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIf, however, you asked me if there should be a Club World Cup in the middle of our season, I would say no.

Klopp\u2019s team were also left in no doubt they must raise their game considerably against the Copa Libertadores champions to make the journey to Qatar, with all its complications and ramifications back home, worthwhile.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/18/liverpool-monterrey-club-world-cup-semi-final-live\">Liverpool 2-1 Monterrey: Club World Cup semi-final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt will be more difficult for sure,\u201d Klopp said of the final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who exactly will be ready for the next game. I saw the Monterrey bench and it looked like it had 10 to 15 players on it. Flamengo\u2019s season is over and they are here with a full squad. We just have to recover as quickly as possible.\u201d Winning whatever the circumstances certainly helps.</p> \n<p>This was an awkward assignment for the Liverpool manager from the outset. His concerns over a pitch that had staged two other games in the previous 24 hours were unfounded - 18 ground-staff were on hand to tidy an immaculate surface following the warm-up and at half-time - but selecting a defence to play on it proved problematic. Virgil van Dijk was confined to his hotel room by illness and, with Dejan Lovren, Jo\u00ebl Matip and Fabinho already sidelined through injury, Joe Gomez was the only central defender available. It fell to Jordan Henderson to partner Gomez in the heart of an all-British back line in which James Milner also replaced the rested Alexander-Arnold. Teething troubles were inevitable, and Monterrey were alert to their opponents\u2019 vulnerability in the air, but Liverpool\u2019s control of possession \u2013 and Alisson\u2019s assured performance \u2013 helped alleviate the pressure on their defence.</p> \n<p>The semi-final played out amid a strange atmosphere. One small pocket of Mexican supporters made an incessant noise while the rest of the stadium was subdued until the ball arrived in the vicinity of Mohamed Salah. The Egypt captain was determined to ensure his personal fanbase would be richly entertained.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe attention Mo gets in this part of the world is massive and I thought he dealt with that sensationally and played really well,\u201d his manager said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"525a64c7a3a1a222596956404f5d7ca6d0822309\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/525a64c7a3a1a222596956404f5d7ca6d0822309/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monterrey\u2019s forward Rogelio Funes Mori celebrates after levelling the score at 1-1 in the first half.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monterrey\u2019s forward Rogelio Funes Mori celebrates after levelling the score at 1-1 in the first half.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Salah crafted the breakthrough when he took possession from Milner with his back to goal and his man marker for the night, Leonel Vangioni, in close attendance. He not only held off the Monterrey defender but had the awareness to spot Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s darting run behind Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez and thread a superb reverse pass into the path of the midfielder. Ke\u00efta provided the touch that Salah\u2019s work deserved and beat the goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero with an emphatic finish.</p> \n<p>Ke\u00efta\u2019s runs from deep troubled Monterrey throughout but Liverpool had no time to settle on their early lead. The Mexican side were level within two minutes as the Premier League leaders struggled to deal with a free\u2011kick conceded by Milner\u2019s foul on Rodolfo Pizarro.

      "bodyText": "Different continent, different competition, same old Liverpool. The Club World Cup semi-final proved a complication for the European champions but Roberto Firmino found a familiar solution with a stoppage\u2011time winner against Monterrey. \u201cStaying on track is part of our game,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The track leads to a final with Flamengo on Saturday, and the chance to be crowned best in the world for the first time. The importance of the competition was writ large on the devastated faces of the Monterrey players after Firmino tapped home an intelligent cross from his fellow substitute Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold to seal a slender and difficult victory. Liverpool were disrupted by illness and injury and grateful for Alisson\u2019s commanding presence on the big occasion once again. Klopp\u2019s team were also left in no doubt they must raise their game considerably against the Copa Libertadores champions to make the journey to Qatar, with all its complications and ramifications back home, worthwhile. \u201cIt will be more difficult for sure,\u201d Klopp said of the final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who exactly will be ready for the next game. I saw the Monterrey bench and it looked like it had 10 to 15 players on it. Flamengo\u2019s season is over and they are here with a full squad. We just have to recover as quickly as possible.\u201d Winning whatever the circumstances certainly helps. This was an awkward assignment for the Liverpool manager from the outset. His concerns over a pitch that had staged two other games in the previous 24 hours were unfounded - 18 ground-staff were on hand to tidy an immaculate surface following the warm-up and at half-time - but selecting a defence to play on it proved problematic. Virgil van Dijk was confined to his hotel room by illness and, with Dejan Lovren, Jo\u00ebl Matip and Fabinho already sidelined through injury, Joe Gomez was the only central defender available. It fell to Jordan Henderson to partner Gomez in the heart of an all-British back line in which James Milner also replaced the rested Alexander-Arnold. Teething troubles were inevitable, and Monterrey were alert to their opponents\u2019 vulnerability in the air, but Liverpool\u2019s control of possession \u2013 and Alisson\u2019s assured performance \u2013 helped alleviate the pressure on their defence. The semi-final played out amid a strange atmosphere. One small pocket of Mexican supporters made an incessant noise while the rest of the stadium was subdued until the ball arrived in the vicinity of Mohamed Salah. The Egypt captain was determined to ensure his personal fanbase would be richly entertained. \u201cThe attention Mo gets in this part of the world is massive and I thought he dealt with that sensationally and played really well,\u201d his manager said. Salah crafted the breakthrough when he took possession from Milner with his back to goal and his man marker for the night, Leonel Vangioni, in close attendance. He not only held off the Monterrey defender but had the awareness to spot Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s darting run behind Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez and thread a superb reverse pass into the path of the midfielder. Ke\u00efta provided the touch that Salah\u2019s work deserved and beat the goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero with an emphatic finish. Ke\u00efta\u2019s runs from deep troubled Monterrey throughout but Liverpool had no time to settle on their early lead. The Mexican side were level within two minutes as the Premier League leaders struggled to deal with a free\u2011kick conceded by Milner\u2019s foul on Rodolfo Pizarro. The set-piece was delivered to the corner of the Liverpool box where Stefan Medina towered above Ke\u00efta to head into the danger area. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain cleared only as far as S\u00e1nchez, whose overhead kick caught a teammate flush in the face but teed up Jes\u00fas Gallardo for a left-foot volley that Alisson pushed away. But straight to Rogelio Funes Mori, and the former Everton defender\u2019s twin made no mistake from close range. Alisson prevented Funes Mori scoring again when getting a vital touch on a cross from Dorlan Pab\u00f3n that was destined for the unmarked striker at the back post without his intervention. The Liverpool keeper also saved at full stretch from Pab\u00f3n as Monterrey prospered in the space that Van Dijk would normally protect. His absence was felt. Klopp switched to 4-2-3-1 after the interval but Liverpool remained vulnerable to Monterrey\u2019s pace and the strength of Funes Mori. Alisson saved twice from Pab\u00f3n and again when Funes Mori tried to catch him out with a snap-shot from 30 yards. Monterrey demanded a red card for Gomez when the defender, already booked for hauling down Funes Mori as the last man, was penalised for handball. Antonio Mohamed\u2019s protestations provoked a furious reaction from Klopp who left his technical area to berate the Monterrey coach for appealing for a dismissal.

It paid dividends when Alexander-Arnold swept an intelligent cross to the near post after good work by Salah and Firmino tucked the winner beyond Barovero.",

A new name is yet to be announced.</p> <p>John Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, who controlled Fiat, will become the group\u2019s chairman. The Agnelli family\u2019s investment vehicle will have representation on the board, along with the Peugeot family and Bpifrance, the French state\u2019s investment arm.</p> <p>The 50-50 merger will create a new Franco-Italian-American powerhouse, domiciled in the Netherlands \u2013 a neutral location \u2013 but listed in Paris, Milan and New York.

The companies noted the group would be more balanced geographically \u2013 Peugeot has a big presence in Europe while Fiat Chrysler has a stronger North American offering.</p> <p>Dongfeng Motor Group, the Chinese automaker that owns 12% of PSA, will sell part of its stake in a move seen as addressing US concerns over Chinese interest in a major American asset.</p> <p>Tavares said: \u201cOur merger is a huge opportunity to take a stronger position in the auto industry as we seek to master the transition to a world of clean, safe and sustainable mobility and to provide our customers with world-class products, technology and services.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The merger is expected to be completed in about a year\u2019s time.

Fiat Chrysler said the French government\u2019s opposition had prevented the Renault tie-up but it remained convinced of the need for consolidation, a strategy pushed by the late Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.</p> <p>Marchionne saw a need for car companies to band together as they approached the fundamental shift away from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/labour-pledges-to-ban-sale-of-petrol-diesel-cars\">internal combustion engine</a> towards electric vehicles.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s largest trade union is seeking assurances over about 2,600 manufacturing jobs at Vauxhall after the carmaker\u2019s parent company, PSA, announced a \u00a338bn (\u20ac45bn) merger with Fiat Chrysler that will create the world\u2019s fourth-biggest carmaker. Vauxhall\u2019s workforce includes 1,100 staff at its Ellesmere Port plant in Wirral and around 1,500 people making the Vivaro van in Luton. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, and Fiat Chrysler confirmed there would be no plant closures as part of \u20ac3.7bn in cost savings targeted from the deal, but the Unite union immediately raised concerns. \u201cUnite will \u2026 be seeking guarantees about new investment to ensure that the company\u2019s UK factories are able to continue to build high-quality cars and vans to meet the challenges of the transition to electric vehicles,\u201d said Unite\u2019s national officer Des Quinn. David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham University, said question marks would remain given Fiat has Italian plants running at less than capacity. \u201cBoth the French and Italian governments will be keen to maintain capacity in their respective countries, and that could leave UK plants vulnerable to the axe being swung down the line,\u201d he said. PSA had previously threatened to close the Cheshire plant if its operations were disrupted by Brexit. PSA\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, who had overseen the group\u2019s successful integration and turnaround of the Vauxhall and Opel brands, will stay on as CEO of the new group, which will have combined annual sales of about 8.7m vehicles. On the basis of 2018 sales, the companies would have revenues of almost \u20ac170bn and operating profits of \u20ac11bn. A new name is yet to be announced. John Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, who controlled Fiat, will become the group\u2019s chairman. The Agnelli family\u2019s investment vehicle will have representation on the board, along with the Peugeot family and Bpifrance, the French state\u2019s investment arm. The 50-50 merger will create a new Franco-Italian-American powerhouse, domiciled in the Netherlands \u2013 a neutral location \u2013 but listed in Paris, Milan and New York. It will aim to give the combined group the financial firepower to invest in electric and autonomous vehicle technology to adjust to fundamental shifts in the car industry. Cars sold by the new group will range from mass-market brands such as Peugeot\u2019s Citro\u00ebn, Opel and Vauxhall, through to premium and luxury marques such as Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Maserati. The companies noted the group would be more balanced geographically \u2013 Peugeot has a big presence in Europe while Fiat Chrysler has a stronger North American offering. Dongfeng Motor Group, the Chinese automaker that owns 12% of PSA, will sell part of its stake in a move seen as addressing US concerns over Chinese interest in a major American asset. Tavares said: \u201cOur merger is a huge opportunity to take a stronger position in the auto industry as we seek to master the transition to a world of clean, safe and sustainable mobility and to provide our customers with world-class products, technology and services.\u201d The merger is expected to be completed in about a year\u2019s time. A proposed deal between Fiat Chrysler and PSA\u2019s French rival Renault fell through in June. Fiat Chrysler said the French government\u2019s opposition had prevented the Renault tie-up but it remained convinced of the need for consolidation, a strategy pushed by the late Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne. Marchionne saw a need for car companies to band together as they approached the fundamental shift away from the internal combustion engine towards electric vehicles. At the same time, diesel sales have fallen dramatically since emissions-cheating scandals and concerns over air pollution emerged. The new group will have to meet limits that will force it to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the cars it sells from 1 January onwards, by selling a combination of battery electric cars and lower-emission petrol and diesels, as well as hybrids of the two.",

      "bodyText": "Honest reflection is rarely born from trauma: but a grief-stricken left must conduct a frank postmortem into the calamity of 12 December. While the 2017 election definitively proved the popularity of the left\u2019s ideas, 2019 offers a brutal lesson from a campaign lacking a coherent message in the midst of a culture war. Voters didn\u2019t defect from Labour because they felt the top 5% were paying enough tax, or because they thought our privately run railway system was a shining success, or because of their affection for sky-high tuition fees. It was not radical policies that caused this landslide \u2013 and there is still no sign that voters have a burning appetite for centrism in any form, whether Liberal Democrat or Change UK. Those pointing at Brexit as a key factor in Labour\u2019s election defeat are mocked for deflecting from the real reason: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity. But the collapse in the Labour\u2019s leader\u2019s ratings between the 2017 election and last week\u2019s rout are inextricably linked. In January, YouGov asked why voters with previously favourable opinions of Corbyn had changed their mind. About three-quarters of the responses were linked to Brexit, which dominated all political discourse after 2017 and smothered discussion of Labour\u2019s popular domestic policies. Labour was tortured about how to keep its 2017 coalition of remain and leave supporters together, and was paralysed as a result. But what, then, was Labour supposed to have done? Some of us passionately argued against a new referendum, and even for striking a compromise deal with Theresa May, fearing that Labour would be wiped out in the north and Midlands.

      "bodyText": "Parents in a last-minute panic about Christmas gifts for their children\u2019s teachers don\u2019t need to worry: most teachers say the present they\u2019d prefer is a homemade card \u2013 although primary school teachers would be just as happy with booze. With most schools in England closing for the Christmas holidays on Friday, an anonymous survey of more than 5,000 UK teachers conducted by the Teacher Tapp app revealed teachers would rather receive homemade cards from their pupils than the traditional offerings of wine or chocolate or other gifts. The exception, though, are teachers in primary schools, who were as likely to say they\u2019d prefer wine as a painstakingly-drawn felt-tip and glitter Santa from Year 1. The popularity of a student\u2019s own work over the sinful attractions of free alcohol and confectionary shows that teachers really are soft-hearted, even at secondary school, according to Becky Allen, Teacher Tapp\u2019s co-founder and chief analyst. \u201cPrimary school teachers probably get blas\u00e9 about getting homemade cards, whereas by secondary school it doesn\u2019t happen as much, so it\u2019s a real bonus to have the kids saying something meaningful about you,\u201d said Allen. For those intent on giving chocolates \u2013 favoured by just one in six teachers - Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange topped the national popularity stakes, while Roses and Quality Street were the least popular. The relative popularity of Christmas gifts is one of the more unusual results uncovered by Teacher Tapp, an app dedicated to finding out what teachers think and how they do their job on a daily basis. The results have been eye-opening, according to Allen, an honorary research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s department of education, in revealing the long and often unproductive hours teachers work, and how lonely the job can often be. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that teachers spread their working day over really long hours. Many of them take a break after leaving school, either because they have got caring duties or they are exhausted, frankly,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey go home and then they start working again in the evening. We found that four in 10 teachers in any weekday evening are sitting in front of the TV doing their marking. \u201cPsychologically, it can feel quite a burden to do a job where you feel like you are working from first thing in the morning, until the last thing you do before you go to bed is work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this infinite job, you don\u2019t work as part of a team so you have to make your own decisions how to manage your workload, and that\u2019s really hard for anyone to do.\u201d Ironically, teachers themselves agree that marking books is often a waste of time \u2013 the educational researcher Prof Dylan Wiliam\u2019s calls marking \u201cone of the most expensive PR exercises in history\u201d. Another survey found more than 70% of teachers agreed that doing away with written comments on pupils\u2019 work would make no impact on what they learned. And nearly two-thirds of classroom teachers said activity such as marking was mainly driven by the need to impress outsiders, whether parents or Ofsted inspectors. \u201cIf you ever say to a headteacher, you could just drop the marking policy, they would be absolutely horrified. But there\u2019s no rule that says you have to have one. But things get culturally embedded and then it\u2019s hard to turn back,\u201d Allen said. Allen and Laura McInerney, another former teacher and Guardian education columnist, came up with the idea of Teacher Tapp in 2017, attracting seed funding to create the app that now has a dedicated user base of 6,000 teachers around the country answering the three or four brief questions sent each afternoon. In doing so Teacher Tapp has created a community of teachers who share the same profession but often have little contact with those outside their immediate area, even within their own schools. One of the saddest results uncovered by Teacher Tapp has been the substantial number of teachers who preferred to eat their lunch \u2013 often as short as 30 or 45 minutes a day \u2013 in their classrooms or offices, away from their colleagues. Allen says such responses have led her to think about the loneliness of teaching, \u201chow isolating it is, how little teachers actually know about each other and the job they do. \u201cTeachers don\u2019t all hang out in the staffroom together as much as they used to, and fewer collegial conversations are taking place. It does mean that quite a lot of the dysfunction in schools comes from relative isolation and lack of understanding.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Two of England\u2019s most prestigious Premier League football clubs, both owned by US investors, have been confronted by international human rights abuses in recent days, and responded with starkly contrasting positions. Liverpool, who as European champions are competing in Qatar in Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup, produced a carefully diplomatic statement which nevertheless managed to be forthright in supporting improved conditions for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/liverpool-back-investigations-qatar-deaths-club-world-cup\" title=\"\">migrant workers labouring in the Gulf</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/15/qatars-workers-are-at-risk-of-heat-stress-for-half-the-day-during-summer-finds-un\" title=\"\">Campaigners </a>had asked the club to consider using its reputational power to highlight the deaths of many young men working on construction projects in baking heat. Its chief executive, Peter Moore, challenged Qatar to seriously address the risks of heat stress for workers, reaching into Liverpool\u2019s own heritage to say that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve. That call for accountability was woven into a more predictable corporate clarification: \u201cWe remain a sporting organisation and it is important that we are not drawn into global issues on the basis of where our involvement in various competitions dictates that our fixtures take place.\u201d</p> <p>When the Arsenal midfield star Mesut \u00d6zil, a German Muslim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/arsenal-distance-themselves-from-mesut-ozil-comments-china-uighur-people\" title=\"\">spoke out</a> on Instagram against Beijing\u2019s oppression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, Arsenal\u2019s response was all disclaimer and no support. The club released a statement via Chinese social media disowning \u00d6zil\u2019s concern for his fellow Muslims, who are suffering persecution and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-leak-no-escapes-reality-china-uighur-prison-camp\" title=\"\">mass incarceration in detention camps</a>. Facing the fiercely defensive official and popular reaction in China, and doubtless conscious of its popularity and commercial interests there, it described the post as his personal opinion, adding that \u201cAs a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d</p> <p>Determined neutrality is a tenable position for a major sporting organisation, but only up to a point. Britain\u2019s clubs all have strong anti-discrimination policies now and zero-tolerance approaches to racism by supporters, which once blighted the national game and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/09/burnley-supporter-13-alleged-racist-gesture-spurs\" title=\"\">threatening an upsurge</a> in the currently divisive political atmosphere. Modern footballers are not prepared to tolerate it, as their predecessors felt forced to; Raheem Sterling notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/09/raheem-sterling-newspapers-fuelling-racism-alleged-abuse-chelsea\" title=\"\">spoke out about media discrimination</a>, and the whole England team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/six-minutes-added-time-racism-england-bulgaria-euro-2020\" title=\"\">came close to walking off</a> due to racial abuse during their match against Bulgaria in October.</p> <p>This movement of athletes towards using their own positions and personal brands to promote progressive causes follows the landmark \u201ctake the knee\u201d protests by NFL players in America, although their leader, Colin Kaepernick, effectively suffered a boycott by teams who suddenly declined to hire him.</p> <p>Liverpool considered the dreadful issue of young men dying in Qatar, particularly in the context of the bereaved Hillsborough families\u2019 30-year campaign for justice over the deaths of their loved ones at a Liverpool match, and decided they had to speak out. By contrast Arsenal\u2019s exposure of their own player to vilification in China, and the club\u2019s studied lack of interest in the horrors of Xinjiang, falls far short.</p> <p>At home, Premier League clubs have for years supported substantial community programmes, effectively as part of a settlement with successive governments which have declined calls to regulate the game\u2019s commercial excesses. Nobody is calling on football clubs to devote themselves to politics \u2013 but when they have the opportunity to employ their power in a just cause, they should not miss the target.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two of England\u2019s most prestigious Premier League football clubs, both owned by US investors, have been confronted by international human rights abuses in recent days, and responded with starkly contrasting positions. Liverpool, who as European champions are competing in Qatar in Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup, produced a carefully diplomatic statement which nevertheless managed to be forthright in supporting improved conditions for migrant workers labouring in the Gulf. Campaigners had asked the club to consider using its reputational power to highlight the deaths of many young men working on construction projects in baking heat. Its chief executive, Peter Moore, challenged Qatar to seriously address the risks of heat stress for workers, reaching into Liverpool\u2019s own heritage to say that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve. That call for accountability was woven into a more predictable corporate clarification: \u201cWe remain a sporting organisation and it is important that we are not drawn into global issues on the basis of where our involvement in various competitions dictates that our fixtures take place.\u201d When the Arsenal midfield star Mesut \u00d6zil, a German Muslim, spoke out on Instagram against Beijing\u2019s oppression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, Arsenal\u2019s response was all disclaimer and no support. The club released a statement via Chinese social media disowning \u00d6zil\u2019s concern for his fellow Muslims, who are suffering persecution and mass incarceration in detention camps. Facing the fiercely defensive official and popular reaction in China, and doubtless conscious of its popularity and commercial interests there, it described the post as his personal opinion, adding that \u201cAs a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d Determined neutrality is a tenable position for a major sporting organisation, but only up to a point. Britain\u2019s clubs all have strong anti-discrimination policies now and zero-tolerance approaches to racism by supporters, which once blighted the national game and is threatening an upsurge in the currently divisive political atmosphere. Modern footballers are not prepared to tolerate it, as their predecessors felt forced to; Raheem Sterling notably spoke out about media discrimination, and the whole England team came close to walking off due to racial abuse during their match against Bulgaria in October. This movement of athletes towards using their own positions and personal brands to promote progressive causes follows the landmark \u201ctake the knee\u201d protests by NFL players in America, although their leader, Colin Kaepernick, effectively suffered a boycott by teams who suddenly declined to hire him. Liverpool considered the dreadful issue of young men dying in Qatar, particularly in the context of the bereaved Hillsborough families\u2019 30-year campaign for justice over the deaths of their loved ones at a Liverpool match, and decided they had to speak out. By contrast Arsenal\u2019s exposure of their own player to vilification in China, and the club\u2019s studied lack of interest in the horrors of Xinjiang, falls far short. At home, Premier League clubs have for years supported substantial community programmes, effectively as part of a settlement with successive governments which have declined calls to regulate the game\u2019s commercial excesses. Nobody is calling on football clubs to devote themselves to politics \u2013 but when they have the opportunity to employ their power in a just cause, they should not miss the target.",

      "bodyText": "The UK competition watchdog has said there is a strong argument for introducing regulations to tackle the dominance of Google and Facebook, including potentially opening up search engine data to rivals and bringing in rules to give consumers greater control over their data. The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s 283-page interim report into the UK digital market shows the scale of the dominance of its two biggest players. It found that for the past decade, Google has controlled more than 90% of the UK\u2019s \u00a36bn search advertising market, while Facebook accounts for almost half of the \u00a35bn internet display advertising market. \u201cWe are concerned that they are both now so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms,\u201d the CMA said. \u201cThe profitability of both Google and Facebook has been well above any reasonable estimate of what we would expect in a competitive market for many years. \u201cWeak competition in digital advertising can increase the prices of goods and services across the economy and undermine the ability of newspapers and others to produce valuable content, to the detriment of broader society.\u201d The report also cites examples of the actions Google takes to maintain its market dominance, such as paying $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in the UK last year to make sure it was the default search engine on mobile devices. The \u201cvast majority\u201d was paid to Apple. The CMA, which has said it is not minded to launch a full market investigation, has raised a number of proposals it feels are worth considering to address Google\u2019s dominance, such as forcing it to share search data with rivals. The watchdog also found issues with how large technology companies harvest personal data to drive advertising revenues. It said platforms such as Facebook did not give consumers the option to opt out of personalised advertising, and privacy settings were made very difficult to access and navigate. \u201cPeople are presented with a take-it-or-leave it offer, forcing them to share considerable amounts of personal data as a condition for using the service,\u201d the report says. The CMA said a consumer may need to read 10,000 words to understand how their data would be used, but the average visit to the Google privacy page lasted 47 seconds. The CMA wants rules introduced to give people greater control over data and improve transparency. The CMA said it believed there was a \u201cstrong argument for the development of a new regulatory regime\u201d. Andrea Coscelli, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt the end of the study, we will present our findings to the new government as they decide whether and how to regulate what is an increasingly central sector in all our lives.\u201d",

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend managed it, as did Glee, for the most part, but Soundtrack is doing something different. It is a musical, but instead of performing their own songs, or even their own versions of popular songs, the characters simply lip-sync to a familiar hit whenever something huge happens in their lives.

If there\u2019s a song at a party, say, the party-goers join in as backing dancers. Occasionally, everyone drifts off into a dreamlike sequence. There is a character floating away on the clouds here, a graphic novel rendered lifesize there. Most episodes end with a mashup of two tunes, announced with the word \u201cmash-up\u201d streaked across the screen. It is the first time I have really thought about mashups since 2004. Cooked up by the showrunner, Joshua Safran, who oversaw Quantico and the second and last season of Broadway hothouse Smash, Soundtrack is deliberately and winningly bonkers.</p> <p>Safran has described this as Paul Thomas Anderson meets This Is Us, and cites Pennies from Heaven as a key influence.

Nellie is an aspiring artist, wealthy, a little snobby, and unlucky when it comes to men. (Her first number is Sia\u2019s Elastic Heart, belted out during an early dumping.) Sam is an aspiring musician and songwriter, who is poor and comes from a different world entirely. Naturally, they butt heads, over class, privilege and entitlement. Naturally, they fall madly, deeply in love, all the while singing out their feelings, or at least miming them.</p> <p>This is a fantasy through and through. Nellie\u2019s mother \u2013 another standout uppity\u2019n\u2019rich role for Madeleine Stowe, who honed that act in Revenge \u2013 is a movie star. Joanna, whose role in this nonlinear story (it spans several years and darts back and forth between eras) is initially unclear, is a dancer stuck in endless auditions that never go anywhere. She also loves reading, much to her judgmental co-worker\u2019s surprise, which leads to exchanges as delightfully daft as: \u201cWhat was the book you were reading last week?\u201d \u201cThe Sociology of Human Aggression.\u201d Everyone conducts their business with the straightest of faces. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is a knockout as Annette, Sam\u2019s aunt, who rips through Etta James, Basement Jaxx and Whitney Houston and looks as if she was born to do it.</p> <p>It helps that the actual soundtrack is great. This is not a selection of castoffs that appear because it was easy to get the rights. There\u2019s Chet Baker, Lauryn Hill, Dolly Parton and St Vincent. It must have cost a fortune. Even the mashups become more clever as the series progresses; my favourite was Joni Mitchell\u2019s Both Sides Now, which moved from the 1969 version to the husky, smoky 2000 one, although I Will Always Love You was done with a clever touch, too, that would be a shame to spoil.</p> <p>Soundtrack is not subtle or quiet or low-key. It is bold, big and unabashedly soapy. It wears its emotional excesses with pride. There are twists and turns so manipulative it is almost cruel. When everything starts to fit together, when the connections start to make sense, joyfully and tragically, it is satisfying, in the same way that settling in to watch a favourite film that you\u2019ve seen 20 times before is satisfying.

Last week a member of the CDU\u2019s executive committee in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Robert M\u00f6ritz, confirmed that he was a member of Uniter, a private support network for active and former soldiers and security personnel. In the wake of the assassination of the pro-refugee politician Walter L\u00fcbcke and a white supremacist\u2019s planned terror attack on a synagogue in Halle, security circles have raised alarm about rightwing extremist attempts to infiltrate the military and police. While Uniter remains a legally registered association and is currently not on any of the intelligence agencies\u2019 official watchlists, its founder Andr\u00e9 Schmitt is on trial for offences against Germany\u2019s weapons and explosives act. Uniter\u2019s founder also set up and administered a complex command chain of Telegram chat networks, in whose subgroups so-called preppers discussed plans to build up parallel infrastructures in preparation for the anticipated collapse of the prevailing social order. Some of the chats, which were divided into regional districts, covered the threat of Islamist terrorist attacks and how to respond to them by hoarding weapons, munitions and food supplies. Other prepper groups have been accused of compiling \u201cdeath lists\u201d of leftwing and pro-refugee targets, as well as ordering body bags and quicklime to dispose of their victims after a \u201cDay X\u201d doomsday scenario.

In the women\u2019s qualifiers, Sherrock averaged 99.1 points in her opening match and then 109 in the first four legs of her semi-final against Lisa Ashton. In Sherrock\u2019s view it is simple: if women are allowed to compete with men more frequently, they will be able to win more frequently.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see myself at a physical disadvantage,\u201d she said on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday. \u201cWe just do not get the recognition or the opportunity to play against these men, so obviously you don\u2019t see it that often. Us women, we can beat these men. We just need more opportunities to prove ourselves. There\u2019s more women that can play like me, if not better.

      "bodyText": "What I have done tonight, I hope it just proves that women, we can beat the men. We can play well against the men,\u201d said Fallon Sherrock moments after ousting Ted Evetts on Tuesday when she became the first woman to defeat a male darts player at the PDC world championship. As she spoke, tears welled in her eyes because it was a moment Sherrock had been chasing for a long time. She grew up surrounded by darts. Her parents both played darts and so did her twin sister, Felicia, but it was not until she was 17 that she took it up after starting her adult life as a professional hairdresser. Over the past few years, Sherrock has risen from a well-regarded contender to a player of high calibre. In the women\u2019s qualifiers, Sherrock averaged 99.1 points in her opening match and then 109 in the first four legs of her semi-final against Lisa Ashton. In Sherrock\u2019s view it is simple: if women are allowed to compete with men more frequently, they will be able to win more frequently. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself at a physical disadvantage,\u201d she said on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday. \u201cWe just do not get the recognition or the opportunity to play against these men, so obviously you don\u2019t see it that often. Us women, we can beat these men. We just need more opportunities to prove ourselves. There\u2019s more women that can play like me, if not better. We just need more recognition.\u201d Although Sherrock became the first woman to record a win, she is quick to point out the success of the other women\u2019s qualifier Mikuru Suzuki, who came desperately close to defeating James Richardson in her first-round match on Sunday. \u201cI was watching at home, I was screaming at the TV, I was egging her on and I was so gutted when she didn\u2019t get over that final line. But she inspired me so much, she got me so determined to win. The women\u2019s game has come on leaps and bounds. It\u2019s about time that it happened.\u201d Sherrock gave birth to her son, Rory, in 2014 and in the wake of her pregnancy suffered a kidney condition. She can no longer drink and has to ensure she is always sufficiently hydrated. A side-effect of the condition is that her face used to swell up significantly. When she competed with a swollen face, she would receive merciless attacks on social media. She has used it as fuel to blast her on. \u201cI got a lot of criticism online and a lot of harsh comments.

There\u2019s something about his relentless enthusiasm in the face of abject futility, coupled with his desperate neediness, that\u2019s rather endearing. He\u2019s a beacon of hopeful naivety to all those of us who wake up every morning certain that we\u2019ve failed at the day before it\u2019s even started. A man oblivious to his shortcomings, who still truly believes he can make a difference despite all the evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>The downside is that gullibility and mindless optimism aren\u2019t necessarily the qualities you are looking for in a health secretary. Hancock is literally the only person in the entire country who took Boris Johnson at his word when he promised to solve all the problems in the NHS and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/boris-johnson-40-new-hospitals-pledge-costed\">build 40 brand new hospitals by 2030</a>.

It\u2019s that kind of can-do spirit that has made him the government\u2019s useful idiot.</p> <p>While most of the rest of the cabinet have been using the time since the election to get their Christmas shopping done, Hancock has been working flat out. Taking videos of himself getting in the way of A&amp;E doctors as they try to resuscitate an RTA victim and ruining the last few hours of dying patients\u2019 lives by turning up at their bedside and forcing them to fill out a questionnaire to rate their death experience.

      "bodyText": "Maybe I\u2019m just going a bit soft, but I can\u2019t help warming to Matt Hancock. There\u2019s something about his relentless enthusiasm in the face of abject futility, coupled with his desperate neediness, that\u2019s rather endearing. He\u2019s a beacon of hopeful naivety to all those of us who wake up every morning certain that we\u2019ve failed at the day before it\u2019s even started. A man oblivious to his shortcomings, who still truly believes he can make a difference despite all the evidence to the contrary. The downside is that gullibility and mindless optimism aren\u2019t necessarily the qualities you are looking for in a health secretary. Hancock is literally the only person in the entire country who took Boris Johnson at his word when he promised to solve all the problems in the NHS and build 40 brand new hospitals by 2030. Everyone else just took it for the usual election bullshit, but Matt is a true believer. In fact 40 is only a starting point for him. Give him a few more hours to finish off the management consultancy \u201cThe Art of Paranoia\u201d pamphlet that Dominic Cummings has ordered the entire cabinet to study (\u201cLiterally the most life-changing book I have ever read\u201d \u2013 M Hancock) \u2013 and Matt reckons he might be able to squeeze out a couple more hospitals from his imaginary budget. It\u2019s that kind of can-do spirit that has made him the government\u2019s useful idiot. While most of the rest of the cabinet have been using the time since the election to get their Christmas shopping done, Hancock has been working flat out. Taking videos of himself getting in the way of A&amp;E doctors as they try to resuscitate an RTA victim and ruining the last few hours of dying patients\u2019 lives by turning up at their bedside and forcing them to fill out a questionnaire to rate their death experience. You name it, he\u2019s been doing it. Because no one loves the NHS more than Matt. So it was only fair that Tigger was the first cabinet minister to be allowed out to make a keynote speech. \u201cPeople living longer is a great thing,\u201d he declared to a slightly startled audience of health service professionals, gathered in a claustrophobic office of the Policy Exchange thinktank in Westminster. Because up till then it had never occurred to anyone that it might not be. Matt kept the surprises coming by insisting the stars were in perfect alignment for the NHS now the Tories had been re-elected and that patients and staff were experiencing record levels of satisfaction. Sleeping on waiting-room floors had never been so much fun. In fact, the reason that waiting lists for operations and GP appointments were now at record levels was a sure sign of success. Going to see the doctor had become a luxury, recreational experience. And nurses in Northern Ireland were on strike for the first time ever. The revelations came thick and fast.

      "body": "<p>Herbert Chappell, who has died aged 85 after suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, had a flair for music that made him a gifted jobbing composer. The ideal outlet for his talents came as a television director and producer with the BBC at a time when classical music was prominent in its programming, and in producing commercial video recordings, notably of the Three Tenors in Rome.</p> <p>He made an early mark with a BBC Two Workshop programme (1967) that introduced British viewers to the vivid personality of the conductor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/17/leonard-bernstein-memories\" title=\"\">Leonard Bernstein</a> in an explosive studio rehearsal of Shostakovich\u2019s Fifth Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra.

His twin sister died shortly after birth, and his father had died of an ear infection three days before they were delivered. Bert won a scholarship to Bristol Cathedral choir school, where he was encouraged to compose by the cathedral\u2019s organist and master of the choristers, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-clifford-harker-1125269.html\" title=\"\">Clifford Harker</a>. Aged 12, Bert had two choral compositions performed at the cathedral.</p> <p>A state scholarship enabled him to continue his musical studies at Oriel College, Oxford, for seven years from 1952. After gaining first-class honours for his first degree and a BMus, he embarked on a DPhil thesis on orchestration in British music, which he did not complete. He was reluctant to attend lectures, but shared tutorials with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media\" title=\"\">Dudley Moore</a>.</p> <p>Also among his contemporaries were Ken Loach and Richard Ingrams and most of his time was given to incidental music for college play productions, and musicals and revues for the Oxford Playhouse and the Edinburgh Fringe festival. The arrival of independent television in 1955 brought the opportunity of freelance work for Granada and composing music for TV commercials.</p> <p>This activity continued while he was a music teacher at Cumnor House, a prep school in West Sussex (1959-61). The dedication of his most frequently performed composition, The Daniel Jazz (1963), is to the school\u2019s headteacher, Hal Milner-Gulland, who was determined to provide music that would capture the imagination of his pupils.</p> <p>In 1962 Chappell was appointed music producer and programme assistant for BBC schools broadcasting, and was soon giving Adventures in Music talks for the BBC Home Service, introducing young listeners to popular orchestral music. He also obtained an interview with Huw Wheldon, then the BBC\u2019s overall director of television programmes, who was on the lookout for potential directors to work for the new BBC Two channel.</p> <p>Wheldon recommended Chappell as a researcher for the BBC Two Workshop programme I was preparing on Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly, Carl Orff and musical education. I warmed to Chappell\u2019s enthusiasm and brought him into the production team for a salute to Benjamin Britten on his 50th birthday, in 1963. Three years later he became a producer in music and arts.</p> <p>There he established his berth with Omnibus. As well as his collaborations with Previn, there was a television version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Tell Me on a Sunday (1979), starring Marti Webb, and a portrait of the American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, Call Me Flicka (1980). The starting point was the Decca recording session for Von Stade\u2019s beautiful singing of Joseph Canteloube\u2019s Chants d\u2019Auvergne. Chappell travelled to that region of France with an Omnibus camera crew, and Von Stade\u2019s voice warmed the soundtrack winningly. </p> <p>For African Sanctus (1975), Chappell flew with the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/18/david-fanshawe-composer-obituary-african-sanctus\" title=\"\">David Fanshawe</a> to Cairo and filmed him recording local people at wedding ceremonies in and around the Pyramids and in equatorial western Sudan. The camera work of Peter Bartlett was outstanding and Fanshawe\u2019s soundtrack, mixing his specially composed choral music with his African chant recordings, was truly powerful. Julian Bream, A Life in the Country (1976) won Chappell a Prix Italia award for his portrait of the great guitarist.</p> <p>His own output ranged from music for a popular BBC TV drama series, The Pallisers (1974), and a new signature theme for Songs of Praise in 1980, to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY1J5iwB9gs\" title=\"\">Caribbean Concerto for guitar</a>. From 1984 came two popular works for narrator and orchestra: James and the Giant Peach, setting the story by Roald Dahl, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7SzgWeoezw\" title=\"\">Paddington Bear\u2019s First Concert</a>, with a text by Paddington\u2019s creator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/28/michael-bond-obituary\" title=\"\">Michael Bond</a> (originally narrated by Stephen Fry).</p> <p>In 1976 he married Julia Cleare.

As well as his collaborations with Previn, there was a television version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Tell Me on a Sunday (1979), starring Marti Webb, and a portrait of the American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, Call Me Flicka (1980). The starting point was the Decca recording session for Von Stade\u2019s beautiful singing of Joseph Canteloube\u2019s Chants d\u2019Auvergne. Chappell travelled to that region of France with an Omnibus camera crew, and Von Stade\u2019s voice warmed the soundtrack winningly. For African Sanctus (1975), Chappell flew with the composer David Fanshawe to Cairo and filmed him recording local people at wedding ceremonies in and around the Pyramids and in equatorial western Sudan. The camera work of Peter Bartlett was outstanding and Fanshawe\u2019s soundtrack, mixing his specially composed choral music with his African chant recordings, was truly powerful. Julian Bream, A Life in the Country (1976) won Chappell a Prix Italia award for his portrait of the great guitarist. His own output ranged from music for a popular BBC TV drama series, The Pallisers (1974), and a new signature theme for Songs of Praise in 1980, to a Caribbean Concerto for guitar. From 1984 came two popular works for narrator and orchestra: James and the Giant Peach, setting the story by Roald Dahl, and Paddington Bear\u2019s First Concert, with a text by Paddington\u2019s creator, Michael Bond (originally narrated by Stephen Fry). In 1976 he married Julia Cleare. She survives him, along with their children, Simon, Katy and Olivia; two children, Ben and Alison, from his earlier marriage to Claire Snow, which ended in divorce; and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Herbert Reginald Chappell, composer, conductor and producer, born 18 March 1934; died 20 October 2019",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month the 2019 Nobel laureate in literature, Peter Handke, gave his inaugural lecture in front of the Swedish Academy. The best-known work from the Austrian author\u2019s vast oeuvre is arguably the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/19/my-favourite-city-film-is-wings-of-desire\" title=\"\">Wings of Desire</a>, for which he co-wrote the script.</p> <p>However, his award has been accompanied less by discussion of his literary works than by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/06/nobel-swedish-academy-peter-handke-ceremony-peter-englund-literature\" title=\"\">controversy</a> over his politics. Handke is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/12/a-nobel-prize-that-dishonours-the-victims-of-genocide-peter-handke\" title=\"\">seen by his critics</a> as a genocide denier and supporter of Serb ultranationalism.</p> <p>Handke\u2019s response to these criticisms in a recent interview is typical of his attitude towards the allegations: \u201cNot one word I have written about Yugoslavia can be denounced, not a single one. It\u2019s literature.\u201d He did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/07/nobel-winner-handke-avoids-genocide-controversy-in-speech\" title=\"\">directly address</a> the criticism in his speech, and instead quoted at length from his dramatic poem Walk About the Villages and elaborated on the \u201cSlovenian-Slavic religious litanies\u201d that fascinated him as a child.</p> <p>The day before his lecture the Swedish Academy held a press conference where he was asked whether he accepted the fact \u2013 established by international courts \u2013 that genocide occurred in Srebrenica. Handke responded with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/06/peter-handke-questions-nobel-prize-literature-milosevic\" title=\"\">provocative stunt</a>: he described an anonymous letter he had received, that included toilet paper with a \u201ccalligraphy of shit\u201d. He said he preferred this letter to \u201cempty and ignorant questions\u201d about the Bosnian genocide.</p> <p>Both the speech and his behaviour at the press conference are consistent with Handke\u2019s general attitude towards the Balkans. In A Journey to the Rivers: Justice For Serbia, Handke suggests that \u201cthe detour of recording certain trivialities\u201d is more important for peace and reconciliation than \u201cthe evil facts\u201d. He has been distracting from the well-established truths about what happened in the Yugoslav wars, both in his public statements and his literary work, for more than two decades. Denialism is intrinsic to the genocidal process, and thus a central component of Serb ultranationalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/10/protests-grow-ahead-of-nobel-prize-ceremony-for-peter-handke\">Protests grow as Peter Handke receives Nobel medal in Sweden</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.mangalmedia.net/english//wings-of-denial\" title=\"\">Handke\u2019s politics</a>, in this regard, are unambiguous. He delivered a eulogy at Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s funeral and in a recent, <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2019/48/peter-handke-literaturnobelpreis-kritik-serbien-interview\" title=\"\">post-Nobel interview</a>, absolves \u201cthe butcher of the Balkans\u201d from responsibility for the breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent wars. In the 2008 presidential election in Serbia, Handke openly supported the far-right Serbian Radical party, founded by the paramilitary leader Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj. The party\u2019s newspaper, Velika Srbija (Greater Serbia), used <a href=\"https://www.srpskaradikalnastranka.org.rs/files/izdavastvo/velika_srbija/VS3004.pdf\" title=\"\">Handke\u2019s endorsement</a> as part of its candidate Tomislav Nikoli\u0107\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Handke responded to charges of genocide denial and revisionism in a <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/peter-handke-am-ende-ist-fast-nichts-mehr-zu-verstehen-1.879352-0#seite-2\" title=\"\">statement</a>.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this month the 2019 Nobel laureate in literature, Peter Handke, gave his inaugural lecture in front of the Swedish Academy. The best-known work from the Austrian author\u2019s vast oeuvre is arguably the film Wings of Desire, for which he co-wrote the script. However, his award has been accompanied less by discussion of his literary works than by controversy over his politics. Handke is seen by his critics as a genocide denier and supporter of Serb ultranationalism. Handke\u2019s response to these criticisms in a recent interview is typical of his attitude towards the allegations: \u201cNot one word I have written about Yugoslavia can be denounced, not a single one. It\u2019s literature.\u201d He did not directly address the criticism in his speech, and instead quoted at length from his dramatic poem Walk About the Villages and elaborated on the \u201cSlovenian-Slavic religious litanies\u201d that fascinated him as a child. The day before his lecture the Swedish Academy held a press conference where he was asked whether he accepted the fact \u2013 established by international courts \u2013 that genocide occurred in Srebrenica. Handke responded with a provocative stunt: he described an anonymous letter he had received, that included toilet paper with a \u201ccalligraphy of shit\u201d. He said he preferred this letter to \u201cempty and ignorant questions\u201d about the Bosnian genocide. Both the speech and his behaviour at the press conference are consistent with Handke\u2019s general attitude towards the Balkans. In A Journey to the Rivers: Justice For Serbia, Handke suggests that \u201cthe detour of recording certain trivialities\u201d is more important for peace and reconciliation than \u201cthe evil facts\u201d. He has been distracting from the well-established truths about what happened in the Yugoslav wars, both in his public statements and his literary work, for more than two decades. Denialism is intrinsic to the genocidal process, and thus a central component of Serb ultranationalism. Handke\u2019s politics, in this regard, are unambiguous. He delivered a eulogy at Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s funeral and in a recent, post-Nobel interview, absolves \u201cthe butcher of the Balkans\u201d from responsibility for the breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent wars. In the 2008 presidential election in Serbia, Handke openly supported the far-right Serbian Radical party, founded by the paramilitary leader Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj. The party\u2019s newspaper, Velika Srbija (Greater Serbia), used Handke\u2019s endorsement as part of its candidate Tomislav Nikoli\u0107\u2019s campaign. Handke responded to charges of genocide denial and revisionism in a statement. His defenders like to cite the passage where he describes Srebrenica as \u201cthe worst crime against humanity committed in Europe after the war\u201d. What they overlook is that he \u2013 despite the ruling of international courts \u2013 chose not to use \u201cgenocide\u201d and instead opted for a different legal term, \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d. Furthermore, in the following paragraphs Handke questions the genocidal character of the crime of Srebrenica and paints it as an \u201cabominable\u201d act of revenge. In an interview he says: \u201cBut today \u2018relativise\u2019 has become a bad word. I relativise. I say \u2018Srebrenica\u2019 was blind and evil revenge for the murder of over a thousand Serbs around Srebrenica in the three years before.\u201d This form of victim-blaming fails to recognise the genocidal intent of the perpetrators, omits the broader genocidal context in eastern Bosnia since 1992, and acts as a dog-whistle that depicts Bosniaks as the embodiment of the Ottoman domination over the Serbs. Ratko Mladi\u0107 announced the Srebrenica genocide with the words: \u201cThe time has come to take revenge on the Turks in this region.\u201d In Die Tablas von Daimiel, Handke even goes so far as to describe the victims of Srebrenica as \u201cMuslim soldiers\u201d. In spite of this, all of Handke\u2019s Balkan-related works were included in the Nobel prize bibliography \u2013 a tacit endorsement of genocide denial, revisionism and ultranationalism. In the Balkans, where the memory of the Bosnian genocide continues to be erased, this only helps to embolden nationalists and revisionists.

The victim told how she was forced to perform sex acts in a churchyard, raped above a shop on a filthy mattress and violently abused when she tried to refuse their advances in a series of incidents that took place over 15 years ago. She said she was assaulted by other as-yet unidentified males, with the abuse continuing until she was in her mid-teens. The prosecution told the jury at Birmingham crown court that the girl was passed around \u201clike a piece of meat\u201d. She testified that she repeatedly thought about taking her own life and claimed teachers did not intervene when rumours about her went around her school. Jurors were told that the victim was sold for sex, first by a man named Tanveer Ahmed, who \u201cbefriended her\u201d during a low point in her life. Ahmed, who did takeaway deliveries at Perfect Pizza in Telford, Shropshire, was not on trial alongside the other defendants, having been deported to Pakistan. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years in 2012 after admitting a charge of controlling a child prostitute. Ahmed was one of a number of men imprisoned after an investigation into a child sex abuse ring in Telford as part of West Mercia police\u2019s Operation Chalice inquiry. Later, the victim came into contact with the first defendant, Mohammed Ali Sultan, 33, formerly of Telford, whom she said also sold her for sex, raped and abused her. Ali Sultan was also among the men originally convicted following the Chalice investigation. The victim told police that, years after the abuse ended, she recognised photos of Ali Sultan and Ahmed from press reports on the Telford sex ring.

      "bodyText": "UK banks and insurers will be forced to reveal how exposed they are to the climate crisis and how they would respond to the effects of a temperature rise of up to 4C under the Bank of England\u2019s first climate stress tests. The Bank has put forward proposals to test the performance and health of the UK financial system for a range of climate-linked financial risks, including the failure of governments and consumers to take action. The tests are expected to uncover the extent of the financial sector\u2019s exposure to climate risks, and gauge company responses that could cause spillover effects for the global economy. However, the Bank will not identify individual businesses through the tests and will release only aggregate results for the banking and insurance sectors. Threadneedle Street has, however, not ruled out releasing individual results in the future, and plans to use the initial reports to inform how it supervises each company. The tests, to be released for the first time in 2021, will cover the same UK banks subject to financial stress testing, including HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander UK, Lloyds and Nationwide. By 2021, CYBG \u2013 rebranded as Virgin Money \u2013 will also be included. About 39 insurers are expected be tested on their climate resilience. The testing will cover three scenarios, including \u201cearly policy action\u201d, where the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is clear and decisive, resulting in the global temperature rise staying below 2C, in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. In a second \u201clate policy action scenario\u201d, global climate targets will also be met, but the transition will have been delayed by 10 years, leading to more drastic and immediate action that could cause an economic shock. In the final scenario, governments fail to introduce policies to address the climate emergency, and companies and consumers do not change their behaviour. Global temperatures increase \u201csubstantially\u201d \u2013 by about 4C \u2013 by 2080, resulting in rising sea levels and more frequent, extreme weather events such as flash floods. Drastic environmental changes around the world would damage property, infrastructure and farmland, disrupt business supply chains, and lead to mass migration and deaths, the Bank said. \u201cThis reduces asset values, results in lower profitability for companies, damages public finances and increases the cost of settling underwriting losses for insurers,\u201d it said. Spillover effects such as lower output and productivity would compound those problems. The environmental risks of climate change are already affecting financial companies in the UK, with about 10% of domestic mortgages exposed to properties in flood-risk zones. Some British banks are also exposed to regions extremely vulnerable to climate change, such as south-east Asia. Countries along the equator are expected to be uninhabitable for much of the year due to high humidity under a 4C-rise scenario. If temperatures increase to that level, rising ocean acidity would wipe out coral reefs, shellfish and plankton, starving the oceans of oxygen and leading to a decline in sea life, environmental experts have warned. Saharan deserts are expected to expand into southern and central Europe, while the vast majority of the global population would have to migrate to northern regions, where farming would be viable. According to a study by Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel of University of California, Berkeley, and Marshall Burke of Stanford University, unmitigated global warming would lead to a 23% loss in per capita earning globally by the end of the century. The Bank\u2019s proposals will go out for consultation until March and it is requesting feedback from financial companies, climate scientists, economists and other industry experts. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said the tests were a \u201cpioneering exercise, which builds on the considerable progress in addressing climate-related risks that has already been made by firms, central banks and regulators. Climate change will affect the value of virtually every financial asset.\u201d He added that the tests would \u201chelp ensure the core of our financial system is resilient to those changes\u201d. Carney is taking on the role of UN special envoy for climate action and finance after he steps down from the Bank next month. His main focus will be on mobilising private finance to invest in schemes that will help achieve the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C.",

Some EU officials had previously insisted the UK would have to leave the EU before European parliamentary elections in May 2019, only for the UK to secure a delay and elect British MEPs.</p> \n  <p>EU diplomats believe Boris Johnson when he says he doesn\u2019t want to extend the transition period. \u201cIt is probably one of the areas where Johnson isn\u2019t lying,\u201d quipped one person in Tuesday\u2019s meeting, a joke appreciated by others.</p> \n  <p>The European commission, which will handle day-to-day negotiations with the UK, has promised to draft a comprehensive mandate for the talks in early February, soon after the UK leaves.</p> \n  <p>That will be a document setting out the EU red lines on the future relationship covering trade, security, foreign policy, education and research and other areas.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe will organise these negotiations to make the most out of the short period.

(Or at least that she wants to be a candidate; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1207279667222319105\">she will need to get enough nominations</a>, but this is unlikely to be a problem.) She is the first person to announce her candidature, but within the last 24 hours at least three other possible candidates have given interviews, and Tony Blair \u2013 the last person to do the job and actually win an election \u2013 has given <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://institute.global/news/labours-historic-challenge\">a detailed speech</a> on what the party needs to do next. Here is a summary of the latest developments.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Tony Blair, the former prime minister, has said that no one deserves to win the Labour leadership unless they are prepared to face up to the scale of the challenge facing the party. </strong>In a Q&amp;A after his speech he accepted it would be counter-productive for him to endorse any of the potential candidates. He also said he accepted that candidates would not be able to be as blunt about the problems facing the party as he had been. But he said the new leader had to be someone who recognised that the \u201cwhole ideology\u201d of Corbynism needed to be replaced. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will say this. This is a fundamental moment in the history of the Labour party and the public is going to judge whoever steps forward for leadership. The public will switch on and look at what these people are saying. And if there\u2019s any sense that they don\u2019t get that a whole ideology, not just an individual, was rejected, if there is any sense that people say, \u2018The policies were all great, we did the right things, it\u2019s just that for some reason it didn\u2019t quite work,\u2019 if there is any sense that we are ignoring the message they have given us, it doesn\u2019t matter who leads the Labour party. We just won\u2019t win again ...</p> \n   <p>The minimum threshold of credibility for any person who wants to lead and win is an acknowledgement that we have been in the wrong political place and we let the country down. If you are not prepared to go that far, even if you win the leadership, you are not going to win an election.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Blair also said he did not accept arguments that the next leader had to be a woman, or someone from outside London. It had to be the best person for the job, he said. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5df9f1fa8f087e8308e602a5#block-5df9f1fa8f087e8308e602a5\">9.36am.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair said the election result \u201cbrought shame\u201d on the Labour party because failing to offer people the chance to vote for a credible opposition was \u201cunforgivable\u201d.</strong> In his speech he argued that the problem facing the party was not just Corbyn personally, but the far left politics that now dominated the party. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Corbyn] personified an idea, a brand of quasi-revolutionary socialism, mixing far left economic policy with deep hostility to western foreign policy, which never has appealed to traditional Labour voters, never will appeal and represented for them a combination of misguided ideology and terminal ineptitude that they found insulting.</p> \n   <p>No sentient political party goes into an election with a leader who has a net approval rating of -40%.</p> \n   <p>The takeover of the Labour party by the far left turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government.</p> \n   <p>The result has brought shame on us. We let our country down. To go into an election at any time with such a divergence between people and party is unacceptable. To do it at a time of national crisis when a credible opposition was so essential to our national interest, is unforgivable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a later interview, Blair said Labour would be \u201cfinished\u201d if the far left stayed in charge. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5dfa2d938f085eda5c109ed5#block-5dfa2d938f085eda5c109ed5\"> 1.49am.)</a></p> \n  <p>No leadership candidate has come anywhere close to criticising Corbyn and his leadership in these terms. But ...</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/emily-thornberry-throws-her-hat-into-ring-for-labour-leadership\"><strong>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has launched her leadership campaign with an article in the Guardian featuring a blistering attack on Corbyn for agreeing to an early election.</strong> </a>Until now, other candidates have been notably cautious about criticising Corbyn (reflecting an assumption that he is still held in high esteem by a large number of party members). But Thornberry said that Corbyn went ahead and ordered Labour to vote for an early election despite her sending him a note saying this would be \u201can act of catastrophic folly\u201d. (Blair also warned publicly that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49551843/tony-blair-election-before-brexit-is-an-elephant-trap\">agreeing to an early election ahead of a second referendum would be a serious mistake.)</a> As well as going negative against Corbyn, Thornberry\u2019s article includes an implicit swipe at Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and the Corbynite candidate for the leadership. Someone has briefed the Evening Standard that Long-Bailey was one of those in shadow cabinet backing Corbyn\u2019s call for an early election. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5dfa1b268f085eda5c109df6#block-5dfa1b268f085eda5c109df6\">12.38pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Thornberry has depicted herself as someone with the ability to outperform Boris Johnson. </strong>In her article she says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-his-path-to-resigning-as-foreign-secretary\">foreign </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-his-path-to-resigning-as-foreign-secretary\">secretary</a>, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour\u2019s policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border; the war in Yemen; Donald Trump; human rights; and climate change.</p> \n   <p>I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man \u2013 a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Thornberry is entitled to say she was effective when it came to challenging Johnson when he was foreign secretary, at least in the Commons. What is also clever about this is that it incorporates an argument for Labour having a woman as leader (which obviously benefits Thornberry) based on the idea that Johnson reacts badly to being challenged by women (which is true), and not just based on pro-diversity sentiment.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has argued that he should have been allowed to challenge Johnson\u2019s Brexit arguments in the election campaign.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5df9f55c8f087e8308e602b6#block-5df9f55c8f087e8308e602b6\">10.15am.)</a> This is about as far as Starmer has gone so far in criticising Corbyn\u2019s handling of the election, although Starmer has not yet formally announced his campaign. Starmer and Thornberry are both lawyers who perform well in the Commons and in debate, and it is understandable that they should want to talk up these qualities. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer and Yvette Cooper have both given interviews in which they have sought to distance themselves not just from Corbynism, but from Blairism.</strong> Starmer told the Today programme:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed to my head, some past leader, in order to identify and make decisions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Cooper told the same programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair are seen as internationalist, not patriots, and we should be able to be both patriotic and outward-looking because that\u2019s what we were in 1945. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Yvette Cooper and Lisa Nandy have both stressed the importance of the next Labour leader being able to win votes in towns and not just in cities.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5dfa09ec8f087e8308e60379#block-5dfa09ec8f087e8308e60379\">11.38am</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/18/labour-leadership-election-tony-blair-starmer-urges-labour-to-ditch-not-just-corbyn-by-corbynism-in-speech-on-partys-defeat-live-news?page=with:block-5dfa25d48f085eda5c109e8c#block-5dfa25d48f085eda5c109e8c\">1.25pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey has lost her position as the bookmakers\u2019 favourite in the contest. </strong>At least two bookmakers have sent out press notices today saying Starmer is now the favourite, ahead of Long-Bailey, with Nandy, Jess Phillips and Cooper coming behind. Long-Bailey was installed as the favourite on the basis that she is the candidate preferred by the current Labour leadership, and particularly by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Karie Murphy, the party\u2019s elections chief. She has not declared her candidature yet, and has said nothing of substance in public since the general election on what Labour needs to do next. Bookmakers made her favourite on the assumption that, if the Labour leadership wants her as leader, the members will too. But there is no strong evidence for this.

In his speech Blair said he did not accept this. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[New Labour] was not \u2013 for all the caricature since we left office \u2013 a project of the metropolitan liberal elite. It assembled a new coalition of traditional working-class voters, aspirational voters who had previously turned to Margaret Thatcher, and it fused together the progressive vote that had been split in the previous century.</p> \n   <p>The extraordinary thing is the Labour party\u2019s desire to rewrite its only period of majority government in half a century in negative terms.</p> \n   <p>We did not \u2018neglect\u2019 those traditional Labour heartlands in some appeasement of the middle class. We made the largest ever investment in schools and hospitals in those communities; redistributed wealth through tax changes and tax credits; cut pensioner and child poverty; took the homeless of the streets; and, through Sure Start, the minimum wage and a host of other programmes, helped those who needed help most.</p> \n   <p>And we kept their support. In 2005, in Sedgefield, my majority was almost 20,000. In Bolsover, it was 18,000. In Scotland we had 41 of the 56 seats, including two with increased majorities over 2001. The support we lost was mainly amongst the middle class, especially over tuition fees and Iraq. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair has claimed that the party could have pursued a Brexit policy since 2016 that would have been electorally successful</strong>. In his speech he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What we should have done, following June 2016, is accepted the result, said it was for the government to negotiate an agreement but reserved our right to critique that agreement and should it fail to be a good deal for the country, advocate the final decision should rest with the people. Ultimately, we might have lost the most ardent Brexit support, but I believe, with different leadership, we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas, whilst benefiting from the fact that even in those areas, the majority of those voting Labour, were remain.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e61326ab1987cc9f8c5af5a9a9788731dc6b01\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e61326ab1987cc9f8c5af5a9a9788731dc6b01/0_197_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair speaking at the Hallam Conference Centre in London this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair speaking at the Hallam Conference Centre in London this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-18T15:35:51.954Z\">at 3.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfa2d938f085eda5c109ed5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-18T13:49:28.544Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour is 'finished' if far left remain in charge, says Blair</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Tony Blair,</strong> the former Labour prime minister, has now given an interview to Newsnight reinforcing the argument he made in his speech this morning - that Labour needs to ditch Corbynism if it wants to survive.

The \u2018Ops\u2019 team basically manage your life. They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory \u2014 to show that we could get it \u2018wrapped up\u2019 by Christmas (more or less).

He acknowledged that Brexit was an issue in the election, but he said Labour\u2019s problem was that it did not challenge Boris Johnson\u2019s claim he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Brexit did, of course, come up on the doorstep. What really came up was this slogan \u2018get Brexit done\u2019. And we didn\u2019t knock it back, we didn\u2019t knock it down and neutralise it hard enough, because it clearly wasn\u2019t going to happen ...</p> \n   <p>What resonated on the doors was this phrase \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 and we did not knock that flat. And we should have done, and I would have liked the chance to have knocked it flat, because that was what was cutting through. People thought, \u2018Well, if I vote Conservative, I\u2019m getting it done.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked why he did not get the chance, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, the strategists decided that it would be far better if, as it were, leave voices were out there. That\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t complain then and I\u2019m not complaining now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He repeated and expanded on the point he made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government\">in his Guardian interview</a> about thinking it would be a mistake for Labour to \u201coversteer\u201d in response to its defeat. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to reflect, but what we shouldn\u2019t do is now oversteer.</p> \n   <p>And I\u2019ve seen organisations and political parties do this so many times.</p> \n   <p>In 2010, we oversteered on austerity, and began to think that it might be all right to have some cuts.</p> \n   <p>In 2015, we oversteered on welfare. What we mustn\u2019t do now is for a third time oversteer, make this simplistic and go back to some foregone era.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that Labour needed to \u201cbuild on\u201d the radicalism introduced into the party by Jeremy Corbyn.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What Jeremy Corbyn brought to the Labour party in 2015 was a change in emphasis that was really important, a radicalism that matters, and the rejection of anti-austerity. And we need to build on that, rather than simply say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s now oversteer and go back to some bygone age.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But when it was put to Starmer that he seemed to be proposing \u201cCorbynism without Corbyn\u201d, he rejected that suggestion. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I\u2019m saying is that the desperate needs of millions of people for change \u2013 people in poverty, people who are homeless \u2013 the moral case for change is still there, just as it was last Thursday.</p> \n   <p>And it\u2019s only going to be met by a radical Labour government. The case for a radical government has never been stronger.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested he did not want to be associated with any previous leader.</strong> When it was put to him that he was sounding more leftwing than usual to appeal to party members, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Everybody who\u2019s listened to me in the last three or four years knows exactly what I think.</p> \n   <p>And I\u2019ve said this before, I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed to my head, some past leader, in order to identify and make decisions.</p> \n   <p>I can make them for myself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded like a declaration that he did not want to be seen either as a Corbynite or a Blairite (or a Brownite or a Milibandite, I suppose, although it is the first two who tend to frame the debate in the party at the moment).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said there was \u201ctoo much\u201d in the manifesto.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We put too much in the manifesto, you couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees. It was really good stuff in there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Corbyn led the party into the election carrying too much \u201cbaggage\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And we carried, I think, too much baggage into the election, and antisemitism is an example of that because it was about values and about competence.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his Guardian interview, and again on Today, Starmer sounded reluctant to criticise Corbyn personally. This was one of the few moments where he came close, although \u201cbaggage\u201d did sound euphemistic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there was no point in Labour just blaming the media for its election defeat.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we need to reflect. There are people who say, \u2018well it\u2019s the media\u2019. The media was hostile but it\u2019s been hostile in the past and it\u2019ll probably be hostile in the future, so we can\u2019t rest there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He stressed that he came from a working-class background.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As for the sort of middle-class thrust, as you know, my dad worked in a factory, he was a toolmaker, and my mum was a nurse, and she contracted a very rare disease early in her life that meant she was constantly in need of NHS care.</p> \n   <p>So, actually, my background isn\u2019t what people think it is. I know what it\u2019s like. I actually never had been in any workplace other than a factory until I left home for university. I\u2019d never been in an office.</p> \n   <p>So the idea that somehow I personally don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for people across the country in all sorts of different circumstances is just not borne out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that a lot of people wanted him to stand for the leadership, and that he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d standing, but that he would talk to colleagues before he announced his decision.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90d3278ac3c565b91d77fd8ffc4b0150827343f8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90d3278ac3c565b91d77fd8ffc4b0150827343f8/398_262_5168_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-18T12:35:31.642Z\">at 12.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df9f1fa8f087e8308e602a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-18T09:36:14.768Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Many people in Labour are saying the new leader must be a woman, and someone from outside London.

But then advisers told him to take it out, because it was boring. He would say policy matter.

The Lib Dems were partly to blame. But the remain camp has lost. We now have to make Brexit work, he says.</p> \n  <p>He says the issue for the party is whether it will be willing to return to the mainstream of social democratic thinking.</p> \n  <p>He says in 1983 it was also the case that individual manifesto policies were popular.</p> \n  <p>You might assume that, of policies poll well individually, they will succeed collectively.</p> \n  <p>But Blair says if you had tried to implement the whole manifesto, there would have been chaos. People understood that. So it is wrong to say the manifesto was popular. If it were popular, people would have voted for it, he says.</p> \n  <p>He says \u201cthe Labour party\u2019s ability to delude itself about where people really are\u201d has been a constant factor in the party\u2019s election defeat.</p> \n  <p>Blair says he accepts that young people are enthused by the idea of radical change. But Labour\u2019s share of the vote amongst young people dropped in 2019.</p> \n  <p>They are less enthused by this idea now.</p> \n  <p>If you put forward a radical manifesto for change which is practical, young people will be enthused.

Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has effectively set out his opening pitch for the Labour leadership in an interview with the Guardian. He has not yet confirmed that he will stand, but it is impossible to imagine that he won\u2019t after reading what he says, which he fleshed out a few minutes ago in an interview on the Today programme. His Guardian interview is here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government\">Keir Starmer sets out case for 'radical Labour government'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>I will post more from his Today interview shortly. And Yvette Cooper, the former Labour minister and chair of the home affairs committee in the last parliament, has also been on the same programme this morning, confirming that she is considering standing for the leadership too.</p> \n  <p>And on the same theme, <strong>Tony Blair</strong>, the former Labour leader and the last person to win a general election for the party since 1974, has just given a speech on the election this morning. There is nothing more satisfying in life than being able to say \u2018I told you so\u2019, and so it is not surprising that he wants to have his say. His thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has also published an 18-page report on why Labour lost.</p> \n  <p>The report is <a href=\"https://institute.global/news/northern-discomfort-why-labour-lost-general-election\">here</a>, the speech is <a href=\"https://institute.global/news/labours-historic-challenge\">here,</a> and there is a live feed of the event<a href=\"https://institute.global/live\"> here.</a> I will cover the argument of the speech, and the report, in detail, but the key message is that this defeat was \u201cseminal\u201d and Labour must now ditch Corbynism. Here is an extract from the report.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our research shows that the breach need not be permanent, but simply changing the leader will not be enough. The problems go far deeper; and so must the solutions. Labour needs not just a different driver, but a different bus. The first task is to discard the sectarian ultra-left politics that has taken the party over and condemned it to the wilderness of opposition. Only then can Labour begin the journey back to government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is an extract from the speech.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Labour party is presently marooned on fantasy island. I understand would be Leaders will want to go there and speak the native language in the hope of persuading enough eventually to migrate to the mainland of reality.</p> \n   <p>But there is a risk that the only people speaking the language of reality to the party are those who don\u2019t aspire to lead it. </p> \n   <p>Unfortunately, 2019 is much worse than 1983.</p> \n   <p>Then was our second defeat; now is our fourth.

      "bodyText": "Emily Thornberry has declared she is entering the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, revealing she warned the Labour leadership that backing a Brexit election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. For a full round-up of today\u2019s developments in the Labour leadership contest, see the summary and analysis at 3.06pm. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has denied the government is being forced to clear up its own mistakes by announcing a partial reintroduction of bursary grants for student nurses, which the Conservatives abolished in 2016. Downing Street has confirmed a plan to allow lower courts to roll back EU legal rulings following Brexit, a plan that prompted concerns that it will become easier to challenge European standards in areas such as workers\u2019 rights and the environment. Boris Johnson has received a warm reception from Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. One MP described the atmosphere at this afternoon\u2019s meeting as \u201ceuphoric\u201d. The former minister Robert Halfon told the Press Association: [Johnson] said we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. The voters, they\u2019ve lent us their vote and we need to prove to the people that we can keep our pledges and promises. It\u2019s in getting Brexit sorted in the next few weeks, but that we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do - there\u2019s not a moment to lose. The newly appointed chair of the Conservative party\u2019s inquiry into its handling of complaints about discrimination, including Islamophobia, has been plunged into a row over comments he made about the disputed Kashmir region. More than 15,000 nurses in Northern Ireland are striking for better pay and increased staffing in a healthcare service mired in crisis. A former Labour whip who lost his seat in the general election has had his clothes and private documents mistakenly incinerated by parliamentary staff. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is Richard Burgon explaining why he is considering standing for the deputy leadership of the Labour party. Burgon is stressing the fact that he nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 because this differentiates him from Angela Rayner, who is currently the favourite amongst those likely to run for the deputy leadership. Rayner supported Corbyn in the summer of 2016, when most Labour MPs backed a motion of no confidence in him and dozens of MPs refused to serve on his front bench, but she was not one of the 35 MPs who nominated him for the leadership when he first stood the year before. In the Commons more MPs have been swearing in today. Here is the Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch swearing in yesterday with her baby. This is from Gareth Snell, who lost his seat as Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central last week, on Keir Starmer\u2019s Guardian interview. Snell was one of the Labour MPs in the last parliament strongly arguing that the party had to accept the result of the 2016 referendum. Here is Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on Tony Blair\u2019s speech this morning. EU diplomats have been told it will be impossible to extend the Brexit transition after 1 July 2020, if Boris Johnson decides in the second half of next year he wants extra time to negotiate the future relationship. At a private meeting on Tuesday, diplomats from the 27 member states were told by senior EU lawyers that 1 July 2020 was a hard deadline that could not be changed, if no extension was agreed in the first half of the year. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January and then falls into an 11-month transition period, where it will remain in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights. Under the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, the British government has the option to request a one-off extension of the transition of one or two years, before 1 July 2020. The prime minister has promised to legislate against any extension to the transition, but that has not killed speculation that the UK may seek a last-minute delay in late 2020 if a no-deal exit is looming. Lawyers at the EU council\u2019s legal service moved to quash that option on Tuesday, by delivering an uncompromising message that the transition would cease to exist after 1 July 2020, because the withdrawal agreement leaves no provision for later agreement. The message was conveyed in stark terms by EU lawyers, who want this point transmitted to all EU27 national capitals. However, the EU has a track record in declaring immovable deadlines, only to find a workaround when a no-deal deadline loomed. Some EU officials had previously insisted the UK would have to leave the EU before European parliamentary elections in May 2019, only for the UK to secure a delay and elect British MEPs. EU diplomats believe Boris Johnson when he says he doesn\u2019t want to extend the transition period. \u201cIt is probably one of the areas where Johnson isn\u2019t lying,\u201d quipped one person in Tuesday\u2019s meeting, a joke appreciated by others. The European commission, which will handle day-to-day negotiations with the UK, has promised to draft a comprehensive mandate for the talks in early February, soon after the UK leaves. That will be a document setting out the EU red lines on the future relationship covering trade, security, foreign policy, education and research and other areas. \u201cWe will organise these negotiations to make the most out of the short period. On 1 February we will be ready to propose a mandate for the negotiations,\u201d the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told MEPs this morning. But the commission is already warning member states not everything can be done in 11 months. Von der Leyen has said the commission will have to prioritise key topics, expected to be free trade in goods in exchange for British guarantees of fair competition, as well as fisheries. EU officials continue to stress the UK parliament must ratify the withdrawal agreement. The Guardian understands that the European parliament has pencilled in 29 January for ratification of the Brexit deal, assuming the process goes smoothly at Westminster. In her Guardian article Emily Thornberry confirms that she will be a candidate in the Labour leadership contest. (Or at least that she wants to be a candidate; she will need to get enough nominations, but this is unlikely to be a problem.) She is the first person to announce her candidature, but within the last 24 hours at least three other possible candidates have given interviews, and Tony Blair \u2013 the last person to do the job and actually win an election \u2013 has given a detailed speech on what the party needs to do next. Here is a summary of the latest developments. Tony Blair, the former prime minister, has said that no one deserves to win the Labour leadership unless they are prepared to face up to the scale of the challenge facing the party. In a Q&amp;A after his speech he accepted it would be counter-productive for him to endorse any of the potential candidates. He also said he accepted that candidates would not be able to be as blunt about the problems facing the party as he had been. But he said the new leader had to be someone who recognised that the \u201cwhole ideology\u201d of Corbynism needed to be replaced. He said: I will say this. This is a fundamental moment in the history of the Labour party and the public is going to judge whoever steps forward for leadership. The public will switch on and look at what these people are saying. And if there\u2019s any sense that they don\u2019t get that a whole ideology, not just an individual, was rejected, if there is any sense that people say, \u2018The policies were all great, we did the right things, it\u2019s just that for some reason it didn\u2019t quite work,\u2019 if there is any sense that we are ignoring the message they have given us, it doesn\u2019t matter who leads the Labour party. We just won\u2019t win again ... The minimum threshold of credibility for any person who wants to lead and win is an acknowledgement that we have been in the wrong political place and we let the country down. If you are not prepared to go that far, even if you win the leadership, you are not going to win an election. Blair also said he did not accept arguments that the next leader had to be a woman, or someone from outside London. It had to be the best person for the job, he said. (See 9.36am.) Blair said the election result \u201cbrought shame\u201d on the Labour party because failing to offer people the chance to vote for a credible opposition was \u201cunforgivable\u201d. In his speech he argued that the problem facing the party was not just Corbyn personally, but the far left politics that now dominated the party. He said: [Corbyn] personified an idea, a brand of quasi-revolutionary socialism, mixing far left economic policy with deep hostility to western foreign policy, which never has appealed to traditional Labour voters, never will appeal and represented for them a combination of misguided ideology and terminal ineptitude that they found insulting. No sentient political party goes into an election with a leader who has a net approval rating of -40%. The takeover of the Labour party by the far left turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government. The result has brought shame on us. We let our country down. To go into an election at any time with such a divergence between people and party is unacceptable. To do it at a time of national crisis when a credible opposition was so essential to our national interest, is unforgivable. In a later interview, Blair said Labour would be \u201cfinished\u201d if the far left stayed in charge. (See 1.49am.) No leadership candidate has come anywhere close to criticising Corbyn and his leadership in these terms. But ... Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has launched her leadership campaign with an article in the Guardian featuring a blistering attack on Corbyn for agreeing to an early election. Until now, other candidates have been notably cautious about criticising Corbyn (reflecting an assumption that he is still held in high esteem by a large number of party members). But Thornberry said that Corbyn went ahead and ordered Labour to vote for an early election despite her sending him a note saying this would be \u201can act of catastrophic folly\u201d. (Blair also warned publicly that agreeing to an early election ahead of a second referendum would be a serious mistake.) As well as going negative against Corbyn, Thornberry\u2019s article includes an implicit swipe at Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and the Corbynite candidate for the leadership. Someone has briefed the Evening Standard that Long-Bailey was one of those in shadow cabinet backing Corbyn\u2019s call for an early election. (See 12.38pm.) Thornberry has depicted herself as someone with the ability to outperform Boris Johnson. In her article she says: When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was foreign secretary, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour\u2019s policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border; the war in Yemen; Donald Trump; human rights; and climate change. I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man \u2013 a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman. Thornberry is entitled to say she was effective when it came to challenging Johnson when he was foreign secretary, at least in the Commons. What is also clever about this is that it incorporates an argument for Labour having a woman as leader (which obviously benefits Thornberry) based on the idea that Johnson reacts badly to being challenged by women (which is true), and not just based on pro-diversity sentiment. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has argued that he should have been allowed to challenge Johnson\u2019s Brexit arguments in the election campaign. (See 10.15am.) This is about as far as Starmer has gone so far in criticising Corbyn\u2019s handling of the election, although Starmer has not yet formally announced his campaign. Starmer and Thornberry are both lawyers who perform well in the Commons and in debate, and it is understandable that they should want to talk up these qualities. Starmer and Yvette Cooper have both given interviews in which they have sought to distance themselves not just from Corbynism, but from Blairism. Starmer told the Today programme: I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed to my head, some past leader, in order to identify and make decisions. And Cooper told the same programme: Both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair are seen as internationalist, not patriots, and we should be able to be both patriotic and outward-looking because that\u2019s what we were in 1945. Yvette Cooper and Lisa Nandy have both stressed the importance of the next Labour leader being able to win votes in towns and not just in cities. (See 11.38am and 1.25pm.) Rebecca Long-Bailey has lost her position as the bookmakers\u2019 favourite in the contest. At least two bookmakers have sent out press notices today saying Starmer is now the favourite, ahead of Long-Bailey, with Nandy, Jess Phillips and Cooper coming behind. Long-Bailey was installed as the favourite on the basis that she is the candidate preferred by the current Labour leadership, and particularly by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Karie Murphy, the party\u2019s elections chief. She has not declared her candidature yet, and has said nothing of substance in public since the general election on what Labour needs to do next. Bookmakers made her favourite on the assumption that, if the Labour leadership wants her as leader, the members will too. But there is no strong evidence for this. When YouGov polled Labour members in July, they found she was not their first choice. Blair has rejected claims that the Labour government he led neglected the interests of working-class voters in northern seats. This is an argument being made by many people since last Thursday who are saying Labour\u2019s problems in its heartlands go back decades, particularly Cooper and Nandy (see above). In his speech Blair said he did not accept this. He said: [New Labour] was not \u2013 for all the caricature since we left office \u2013 a project of the metropolitan liberal elite. It assembled a new coalition of traditional working-class voters, aspirational voters who had previously turned to Margaret Thatcher, and it fused together the progressive vote that had been split in the previous century. The extraordinary thing is the Labour party\u2019s desire to rewrite its only period of majority government in half a century in negative terms. We did not \u2018neglect\u2019 those traditional Labour heartlands in some appeasement of the middle class. We made the largest ever investment in schools and hospitals in those communities; redistributed wealth through tax changes and tax credits; cut pensioner and child poverty; took the homeless of the streets; and, through Sure Start, the minimum wage and a host of other programmes, helped those who needed help most. And we kept their support. In 2005, in Sedgefield, my majority was almost 20,000. In Bolsover, it was 18,000. In Scotland we had 41 of the 56 seats, including two with increased majorities over 2001. The support we lost was mainly amongst the middle class, especially over tuition fees and Iraq. Blair has claimed that the party could have pursued a Brexit policy since 2016 that would have been electorally successful. In his speech he said: What we should have done, following June 2016, is accepted the result, said it was for the government to negotiate an agreement but reserved our right to critique that agreement and should it fail to be a good deal for the country, advocate the final decision should rest with the people. Ultimately, we might have lost the most ardent Brexit support, but I believe, with different leadership, we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas, whilst benefiting from the fact that even in those areas, the majority of those voting Labour, were remain. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has now given an interview to Newsnight reinforcing the argument he made in his speech this morning - that Labour needs to ditch Corbynism if it wants to survive. (See 9.05am.) In an interview with Kirsty Wark he said: I\u2019ve come to the conclusion in politics, that anger is a redundant emotion. I\u2019m more motivated than I\u2019ve ever been since leaving power, because I really do believe that we\u2019ve just made a disastrous mistake for the country about its future, which is Brexit \u2013 and believe me, it will be seen to be a terrible mistake. We are going to have to make it work now, but it\u2019s a terrible mistake. And the Labour party, by its self-indulgence \u2013 and that\u2019s what it was in the end \u2013 was the effective handmaiden of Brexit. It\u2019s not our fault, because the fault is with those who advocated it. But our combination of misguided ideology and utter incompetence allowed it to happen ... The far left that has taken over the Labour party, if they remain in a position of authority \u2013 if they\u2019re in charge of the Labour party going forward then I think the Labour party is finished. From the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard Since I have been focusing mostly on the Labour leadership today, here are three clips from Lisa Nandy on Newsnight last night. In the first one she says that, although she wants time to reflect on the general election result first, if she concludes that she can find a root to regaining the trust of lifelong Labour voters, she will stand as a candidate for the leadership. In the second one she says Labour needs to come up with policies to address the needs of towns that have never recovered from the loss of heavy industry. She says in these places young people have to leave to find good jobs, leaving the towns full of people growing old without their children or grandchildren living nearby. Investing in cities and hoping that the wealth will trickle down to these towns has failed, she says. And in this clip she says she thinks there is an opportunity for Labour because Boris Johnson is learning the wrong lessons from his election victory in northern seats. Boris Johnson has written the diary for the Christmas edition of the Spectator, the pro-Conservative magazine he used to edit. In it he does not say anything very new about what his government will do, but he has a colourful description of his campaign. Here\u2019s an extract. You will read elsewhere of the heroics of the campaign director, the strategists, thinkers and others. Perhaps I should mention especially the media team, who had to explain such mysteries as why I chose to shut myself in a giant fridge and what exactly I was thinking when I confiscated a TV reporter\u2019s mobile live on air; and the \u2018Ops\u2019 team. The \u2018Ops\u2019 team basically manage your life. They tell you when to get up, what to wear, where to stand, and they organise brilliantly vivid metaphors for the political points you are trying to make. In the space of 24 hours they had me driving a JCB through a Styrofoam wall to symbolise breaking the parliamentary deadlock; delivering milk on the doorstep, to denote delivery of our domestic agenda; baking an oven-ready pie to show that we have a ready-made withdrawal agreement with the EU; and working in a wonderful Welsh wrapping-paper factory \u2014 to show that we could get it \u2018wrapped up\u2019 by Christmas (more or less). Some said these metaphors were clunking, but in a general election campaign, clunking is what you need. In her Guardian article, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says she wrote to Jeremy Corbyn saying it would be \u201can act of catastrophic political folly\u201d to vote for an early election. Today Joe Murphy in the Evening Standard has a story quoting from what it describes as the memo Thornberry sent to Corbyn making this case. Murphy writes: In her memo to Mr Corbyn, Ms Thornberry wrote: \u201cWe need to ask the question, \u2018What would we prefer? Boris Johnson in power for a few more months until a referendum, or Boris Johnson with a parliamentary majority for five years, and a mandate to do whatever else is on his anti-public services agenda?\u201d Her detailed memo said Mr Johnson had aimed from the start to force a \u201cBrexit election\u201d and, unlike Theresa May in 2017, would succeed. \u201cMuch as we might wish it, we must all realise that pattern will not be repeated this time around,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf we are honest, we know they will likely succeed in turning the general election into a simple choice on Brexit where Theresa May failed, not least because of the imminence of the decision, and the fact that it can genuinely be presented as a \u2018crisis election\u2019.\u201d In her Guardian article, Thornberry also says that, when she argued against an early election at shadow cabinet, \u201cpro-leave colleagues\u201d insisted Labour should back an early election. The Evening Standard says it has \u201clearnt\u201d (one wonders from whom?) that Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary who has been favourite to be the next Labour leader, was one of those arguing against Thornberry at that meeting. Emily Thornberry has declared she is entering the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, revealing she warned the Labour leadership that backing a Brexit election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. The shadow foreign secretary set out her pitch to be the next Labour leader in an article for the Guardian, arguing she has already \u201cpummelled\u201d Boris Johnson across the dispatch box and knows how to exploit his failings. Rowena\u2019s story is here. And Thornberry\u2019s Guardian article is here. Emma Dent Coad, who was the Labour MP for Kensington before losing her seat to the Conservatives last week by just 150 votes, has told the BBC that she was diagnosed with breast cancer a month before polling day. She said that she underwent surgery three days before the election and that now she is OK. The newly appointed chair of the Conservative party\u2019s inquiry into its handling of complaints about discrimination, including Islamophobia, has been plunged into a row over comments he made about the disputed Kashmir region, my colleague Simon Murphy reports. His story goes on: The Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi questioned the views of Prof Swaran Singh, who was announced on Tuesday as the chair of the review, after he wrote a piece for an online publication whose editor has dismissed Islamophobia as a term designed to shut down criticism of Islam. Warsi highlighted sections of the article in which Singh, who is a former equality and human rights commissioner, argued that the Kashmir conflict had been portrayed as a tragedy only for Muslims and that, for many, Sikhs and Hindus \u201cdo not meet the criteria of victimhood\u201d. And here is Simon\u2019s story in full. Turning away from Labour for a moment, this is what Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, posted on Twitter last night. He had 37 MPs turning up to the ERG\u2019s first meeting of the new parliament. That suggests that they will continue to be an influential force in the Conservative party. Sally Gimson, who was selected and then deselected as Labour\u2019s candidate for Bassetlaw in the election, has strongly rejected John Mann\u2019s claim that Sir Keir Starmer did not support her. (See 11.10am.) She is backing Starmer for leader. And here are the main points from Yvette Cooper\u2019s interview on the Today programme this morning. Cooper, a former cabinet minister and chair of the home affairs committee in the last parliament, was a candidate for the leadership in 2015, when she came third behind Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Burnham. Cooper said the Labour party had to change in the light of the election defeat. She said: I think we clearly do have to change because it hasn\u2019t worked, and we\u2019ve got the fewest Labour MPs since 1935 and a big drop in working-class support with low-income voters choosing the Conservatives even though they didn\u2019t want to, and people felt let down by the choice that we give them, so we have to show some humility, because we got things wrong. She said Labour could not just be a party for those living in cities. She said: We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities with our support increasingly concentrated in diverse young fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we aren\u2019t listening to them. This is a point that is also made in the Fabian Society\u2019s post-election analysis (pdf) of what Labour needs to do to win in the 2020s. In the report, Andrew Harrop writes: Across the country, over half of Labour\u2019s existing MPs represent cities with over 250,000 inhabitants \u2013 49 are from London and 55 from 16 cities outside the capital. By contrast, among the 123 target seats [that Labour needs to win to gain a majority at the next election] only 19 are in cities with a population of over 250,000 while 104 represent towns and smaller communities. This could pose a significant challenge to the party in rebuilding in the areas it needs to target, as existing MPs will naturally channel the perspectives of their urban constituents. Cooper sought to distance herself from both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair by saying that Labour needed to be seen as patriotic. Speaking about the need to appeal to voters in towns, she said: And that is not a left/right issue, and this is where both the Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair challenge comes in, because both the left and the right of our party are seen as internationalist, not patriotic, at the moment. And that might not be fair, but it is how they are seen. Both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair are seen as internationalist, not patriots, and we should be able to be both patriotic and outward-looking because that\u2019s what we were in 1945. (Blair would not accept that Labour was not seen as patriotic when he was party leader. But it was seen as very globalist, which is what Cooper seemed to be referring to. Being globalist and being unpatriotic are not necessarily the same thing.) She confirmed that she was thinking of standing, but said she would not take a decision until after Christmas. Asked whether she would be a candidate, she said: The contest doesn\u2019t start until January, and I\u2019ll decide over Christmas what I\u2019m going to do, because we\u2019ve just obviously had a hard local campaign. As you know, I\u2019ve stood before, but obviously the party membership has changed a lot. There\u2019s a lot of things to reflect on ... I\u2019m going to reflect over Christmas. She said Labour had to be both radical and credible. She said: There are some great things in our manifesto, like the green new deal, the national education service. Wonderful radical things that we have to fight for. But we\u2019ve also got to be credible in delivering them and be focused and get a grip. She said Labour needed to eliminate antisemitism in the party, and make its culture kinder and more inclusive. She said: We have to sort out the problems in our party, that includes kicking out the vile antisemitism in our party, but it\u2019s also about a broader thing, about restoring kindness to politics, being more inclusive and challenging some of the abuse in politics that we have seen from all sides and we certainly should not have in the Labour party. John Mann, the former Labour MP who now sits in the Lords and serves as an independent adviser to the government on antisemitism, is not impressed by Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership bid. Mann is referring to the way Sally Gimson, an ally of Starmer\u2019s, was removed as Labour candidate for Bassetlaw by the party leadership on a dubious pretext because she was not favoured by the left. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about what has effectively been the soft launch of his leadership campaign, with his Guardian interview yesterday and his Today interview this morning. He is certainly not winning universal approval. From my colleague Rafael Behr: From the New Statesman\u2019s Jason Cowley: Cowley is editor of the New Statesman, but his staff are quite happy to take a different view. From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton: From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush: From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie: From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar: From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: From the i\u2019s Jane Merrick: From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges: I will post more from the Blair speech, Q&amp;A and report soon, but first here is a summary of the main points Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and a Labour leadership candidate, was making in his interview on the Today programme. Starmer implicitly criticised the Labour leadership for sidelining him during the election campaign. He acknowledged that Brexit was an issue in the election, but he said Labour\u2019s problem was that it did not challenge Boris Johnson\u2019s claim he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Starmer said: Brexit did, of course, come up on the doorstep. What really came up was this slogan \u2018get Brexit done\u2019. And we didn\u2019t knock it back, we didn\u2019t knock it down and neutralise it hard enough, because it clearly wasn\u2019t going to happen ... What resonated on the doors was this phrase \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 and we did not knock that flat. And we should have done, and I would have liked the chance to have knocked it flat, because that was what was cutting through. People thought, \u2018Well, if I vote Conservative, I\u2019m getting it done.\u2019 Asked why he did not get the chance, he replied: Well, the strategists decided that it would be far better if, as it were, leave voices were out there. That\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t complain then and I\u2019m not complaining now. He repeated and expanded on the point he made in his Guardian interview about thinking it would be a mistake for Labour to \u201coversteer\u201d in response to its defeat. He said: We need to reflect, but what we shouldn\u2019t do is now oversteer. And I\u2019ve seen organisations and political parties do this so many times. In 2010, we oversteered on austerity, and began to think that it might be all right to have some cuts. In 2015, we oversteered on welfare. What we mustn\u2019t do now is for a third time oversteer, make this simplistic and go back to some foregone era. He said that Labour needed to \u201cbuild on\u201d the radicalism introduced into the party by Jeremy Corbyn. He said: What Jeremy Corbyn brought to the Labour party in 2015 was a change in emphasis that was really important, a radicalism that matters, and the rejection of anti-austerity. And we need to build on that, rather than simply say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s now oversteer and go back to some bygone age.\u2019 But when it was put to Starmer that he seemed to be proposing \u201cCorbynism without Corbyn\u201d, he rejected that suggestion. He said: What I\u2019m saying is that the desperate needs of millions of people for change \u2013 people in poverty, people who are homeless \u2013 the moral case for change is still there, just as it was last Thursday. And it\u2019s only going to be met by a radical Labour government. The case for a radical government has never been stronger. He suggested he did not want to be associated with any previous leader. When it was put to him that he was sounding more leftwing than usual to appeal to party members, he replied: Everybody who\u2019s listened to me in the last three or four years knows exactly what I think. And I\u2019ve said this before, I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed to my head, some past leader, in order to identify and make decisions. I can make them for myself. That sounded like a declaration that he did not want to be seen either as a Corbynite or a Blairite (or a Brownite or a Milibandite, I suppose, although it is the first two who tend to frame the debate in the party at the moment). Starmer said there was \u201ctoo much\u201d in the manifesto. He said: We put too much in the manifesto, you couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees. It was really good stuff in there. He said Corbyn led the party into the election carrying too much \u201cbaggage\u201d. He said: And we carried, I think, too much baggage into the election, and antisemitism is an example of that because it was about values and about competence. In his Guardian interview, and again on Today, Starmer sounded reluctant to criticise Corbyn personally. This was one of the few moments where he came close, although \u201cbaggage\u201d did sound euphemistic. He said there was no point in Labour just blaming the media for its election defeat. He said: I think we need to reflect. There are people who say, \u2018well it\u2019s the media\u2019. The media was hostile but it\u2019s been hostile in the past and it\u2019ll probably be hostile in the future, so we can\u2019t rest there. He stressed that he came from a working-class background. He said: As for the sort of middle-class thrust, as you know, my dad worked in a factory, he was a toolmaker, and my mum was a nurse, and she contracted a very rare disease early in her life that meant she was constantly in need of NHS care. So, actually, my background isn\u2019t what people think it is. I know what it\u2019s like. I actually never had been in any workplace other than a factory until I left home for university. I\u2019d never been in an office. So the idea that somehow I personally don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for people across the country in all sorts of different circumstances is just not borne out. He said that a lot of people wanted him to stand for the leadership, and that he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d standing, but that he would talk to colleagues before he announced his decision. Q: Many people in Labour are saying the new leader must be a woman, and someone from outside London. Do you agree? Or should it be the best person for the job? Blair says it should be the best person for the job. He says it would be great to have a woman as leader. But it should be the best person for the job. There is no point having a woman, or someone from outside London, if they are in the wrong space politically. He says it does not matter if someone is from London or not if their politics is right. \u201cBelieve me, the country is not going to care?\u201d People says the public does not want someone who went to public school. But who is prime minister now? Blair also says the Labour party should never be anti-intellectual. It has had great intellectuals in the past. Good intellectuals give you good ideas, he says. He recalls giving conference speeches as leader. The first draft of the speech would always contain lots of policy. But then advisers told him to take it out, because it was boring. He would say policy matter. His advisers said they agreed; but they told him just not to put it in the speech. Blair says he has not persuaded people yet about the importance of the technology revolution. The mission of modern social democracy is to spread its benefits fairly. It does not really matter whether someone is London or not London, he says. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: What is your message to leadership candidates? Are you saying it is better to say the right thing, and lose? Blair says he is cautious about this. In the Tony Blair Institute, they take a view that they must give practical advise when they are advising leaders around the world. There is no point giving advice that will be rejected. He says he accepts the leadership candidates won\u2019t be able to be as blunt as he is being now. But what they say must pass the \u201cminimum bar of credibility\u201d, otherwise members of the public will not listen to them afterwards. He says the election defeat should provide a moment of clarity. People must not forget this, he says. Q: Are you hoping a mass influx of people will sign up as registered supporters to vote in the leadership contest? And doesn\u2019t the experience of the Independent Group for Change show that replacing Labour is very difficult? Blair says he hopes people do join Labour. But the Labour membership has changed. In 2010 David Miliband won a majority of party members. That has changed. He says his job is just to speak about reality. On the prospect of Labour being replaced, Blair says after 1983, if Neil Kinnock had not started changing the party, he thinks it would have been replaced. He says some people who did vote Labour this time were voting for the part despite what they felt about it, not because of what they felt about it. He says Labour was unable to build a coalition on Brexit this year because its leadership was seen as sectarian. Q: Do you think leadership candidates should accept the Brexit outcome? And do you accept there is a danger that, if you abandon Corbynism, the young people attracted to the party will walk away? Blair says it was a mistake holding a Brexit election. The Lib Dems were partly to blame. But the remain camp has lost. We now have to make Brexit work, he says. He says the issue for the party is whether it will be willing to return to the mainstream of social democratic thinking. He says in 1983 it was also the case that individual manifesto policies were popular. You might assume that, of policies poll well individually, they will succeed collectively. But Blair says if you had tried to implement the whole manifesto, there would have been chaos. People understood that. So it is wrong to say the manifesto was popular. If it were popular, people would have voted for it, he says. He says \u201cthe Labour party\u2019s ability to delude itself about where people really are\u201d has been a constant factor in the party\u2019s election defeat. Blair says he accepts that young people are enthused by the idea of radical change. But Labour\u2019s share of the vote amongst young people dropped in 2019. They are less enthused by this idea now. If you put forward a radical manifesto for change which is practical, young people will be enthused. They were enthused in 1997, he says. Blair is now taking questions from journalists. (The previous questions were from Hazarika). Q: What sort of person do you want to see leading the Labour party? Blair says it must be someone who recognises the scale of the defeat. He says this is unlike any election defeat Labour has ever has. The party has never been taken over by the far left before, he says. Now it has to \u201cre-engineer social democratic politics\u201d. If Labour cannot do that, then people will look to another party, he suggests. Q: Who would you like to see as next Labour leader? Blair says it would be sensible not to answer that question. Q: Are there any candidates up to the challenge? Blair says that is another way of asking the same thing. But he says the public will be looking at what happens. And the party has to show it is changing. If there is any sense that \u201cwe are ignoring the message [the public] has given us, it doesn\u2019t matter who leads the Labour party - we just won\u2019t win again.\u201d He says the \u201cminimal threshold for credibility\u201d is an acknowledgement that Labour has been in the wrong place, and needs to change. He says there is no point any candidate winning the leadership without accepting this, because they won\u2019t win an election if they haven\u2019t absorbed this lesson. Tony Blair is now taking questions after his speech. He is being interviewed by Ayesha Hazarika, a former Labour aide who is now a journalist and comedian, before taking questions from journalists. Blair says the problems facing Britain in the 21st century require an activist state. That should be an advantage for Labour, he says, because the party believes in an activist state. He says he came into the Commons after the 1983 defeat. There were some similarities then with now; it was clear that the leader, a decent man, needed to go. But 1983 was also different. In 1983 Michael Foot was trying to get rid of Militant. Now the far left has taken over the party, he says. He says \u201cthis far left grouping\u201d is not interested in compromise. They want to take over the party, he says. He says in the months ahead of the election they were trying to deselect sensible candidates, and replace them with far left candidates. Here is another extract from the Tony Blair\u2019s speech. What we should have done, following June 2016, is accepted the result, said it was for the government to negotiate an agreement but reserved our right to critique that agreement and should it fail to be a good deal for the country, advocate the final decision should rest with the people. Ultimately, we might have lost the most ardent Brexit support, but I believe, with different leadership, we would have kept much of our vote in traditional Labour areas, whilst benefiting from the fact that even in those areas, the majority of those voting Labour, were Remain. Instead we pursued a path of almost comic indecision, alienated both sides of the debate, leaving our voters without guidance or leadership. The absence of leadership on what was obviously the biggest question facing the country, then reinforced all the other doubts about Jeremy Corbyn. What is important is to understand why his leadership was so decisively rejected. This is not about Jeremy Corbyn as a person. I have no doubt he is someone of deeply held and sincere beliefs, who stayed true to them under harsh attack. But politically, people saw him as fundamentally opposing what Britain and Western societies stand for. He personified an idea, a brand of quasi revolutionary socialism, mixing far left economic policy with deep hostility to Western foreign policy, which never has appealed to traditional Labour voters, never will appeal and represented for them a combination of misguided ideology and terminal ineptitude that they found insulting. No sentient political party goes into an election with a leader who has a net approval rating of \u2013 40%. The takeover of the Labour party by the far left turned it into a glorified protest movement, with cult trimmings, utterly incapable of being a credible government. Good morning. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has effectively set out his opening pitch for the Labour leadership in an interview with the Guardian. He has not yet confirmed that he will stand, but it is impossible to imagine that he won\u2019t after reading what he says, which he fleshed out a few minutes ago in an interview on the Today programme. His Guardian interview is here. I will post more from his Today interview shortly. And Yvette Cooper, the former Labour minister and chair of the home affairs committee in the last parliament, has also been on the same programme this morning, confirming that she is considering standing for the leadership too. And on the same theme, Tony Blair, the former Labour leader and the last person to win a general election for the party since 1974, has just given a speech on the election this morning. There is nothing more satisfying in life than being able to say \u2018I told you so\u2019, and so it is not surprising that he wants to have his say. His thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has also published an 18-page report on why Labour lost. The report is here, the speech is here, and there is a live feed of the event here. I will cover the argument of the speech, and the report, in detail, but the key message is that this defeat was \u201cseminal\u201d and Labour must now ditch Corbynism. Here is an extract from the report. Our research shows that the breach need not be permanent, but simply changing the leader will not be enough. The problems go far deeper; and so must the solutions. Labour needs not just a different driver, but a different bus. The first task is to discard the sectarian ultra-left politics that has taken the party over and condemned it to the wilderness of opposition. Only then can Labour begin the journey back to government. And here is an extract from the speech. The Labour party is presently marooned on fantasy island. I understand would be Leaders will want to go there and speak the native language in the hope of persuading enough eventually to migrate to the mainland of reality. But there is a risk that the only people speaking the language of reality to the party are those who don\u2019t aspire to lead it. Unfortunately, 2019 is much worse than 1983. Then was our second defeat; now is our fourth. The country is different. Politics is different. The country is less fixed in political affiliation. Politics moves at speed accelerated by social media. We don\u2019t have the luxury of the slow march back. We can correct our historical and contemporary weaknesses; or be consumed by them. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Tony Blair gives a speech on Labour\u2019s election defeat. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

He played Currie Cup and Super Rugby for the Sharks, based in Durban, and also turned out for the Barbarians. The move to Washington was managed by Kyros Sports, a sports marketing company Mtawarira co-owns. \u201cI\u2019ve been a loyal player to the Sharks and the Springboks,\u201d Mtawarira said, \u201cand I have had an amazing career. I\u2019ve been blessed to have that longevity and eventually come out of it as a World Cup winner. I was always looking for a great opportunity overseas after that. \u201cComing to America excited me the most. The league is still young and for me to be part of something that is still brand new and to be a mentor to young rugby players, that really excited me. I want to give back a lot more because I was given a hell of a lot from the game. It changed my life, literally.\u201d Mtawarira was linked to Gloucester in the English Premiership but he said \u201cthe US excited me very much, above going to France [or England]. Yes, the money\u2019s big in France and big in Europe but I wanted to be part of something that might contribute to my legacy. \u201cAmerica really excites me: they say it\u2019s the land of opportunity.\u201d Mtawarira\u2019s trip to the US to sign for DC also brought the opportunity to watch LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers but he remains focused on rugby.

But Mtawarira, now 34, follows other former internationals into the competition. Rugby United New York, rivals in the Eastern Conference, employ the England full-back Ben Foden and France centre Matthieu Bastareaud. The San Diego Legion have signed the double World Cup-winning All Black centre Ma\u2019a Nonu while New Zealand wing Rene Ranger and Australia back Digby Ioane are with the Colorado Raptors.

Killebrew said Los Angeles and Dallas would launch expansion teams in 2021. Former Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has been linked with a team in Miami. Sheehy predicted Old Glory would be \u201cbeyond competitive\u201d in their first season, and said the signing of Mtawarira would \u201cput a stake in the ground\u201d. Joking about telling his players to deliberately knock the ball on, in order to use their new prop\u2019s scrummaging abilities to the max, he said fans should \u201creally be excited about the product we\u2019re going to put on the field\u201d.",

Using the Kyoto-era accounting means Australia can meet the Paris target nominally while delaying a significant amount of practical emissions reduction.</p> <p>\u201cIf you use the carryovers, then at the end of 2030 the gap you\u2019ve got to close, as you go into whatever comes next, is that much bigger,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Parkinson retired from his position in August. Before heading the prime minister\u2019s department, Parkinson was the secretary of the Treasury department and the climate change department. Under John Howard, he ran the Shergold review, which cleared the path for the Liberals to adopt the policy of emissions trading, and he remained at the centre of policymaking in the Rudd and Gillard eras, before being sacked from Treasury by Tony Abbott. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/24/martin-parkinson-returns-to-head-malcolm-turnbulls-department\">He was brought back to run the prime minister\u2019s department </a>when Malcolm Turnbull took the Liberal leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/australias-use-of-accounting-loophole-to-meet-paris-deal-found-to-have-no-legal-basis\">Australia's use of accounting loophole to meet Paris deal found to have no legal basis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked whether the climate policy failure was the worst experience of his professional life, Parkinson said: \u201cYes, it was. It was awful on a number of fronts. We were so close [with the CPRS].\u201d</p> <p>Coupled with all this, Parkinson said he inherited responsibility for managing the fallout from the home insulation scheme. \u201cWe\u2019d had four young Australians tragically die, and it was awful\u201d. He said he and his colleagues had \u201cmany, many sleepless nights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat whole period was absolutely terrible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Parkinson said the broader cause of reform in Australia had faltered because there was no longer a consensus, either in the political class or the economic profession, about what needed to be done. He said some participants in public life wanted to \u201cpretend that really complex problems are really simple\u201d when the reality was there were a number of problems that government couldn\u2019t fix.</p> <p>While he maintained a positive view of ministers and their advisers, including the current prime minister, Parkinson said ministers often came to their posts significantly unprepared.

He said the outlook was really challenging. \u201cI cannot see governments here or overseas moving fast enough to avoid 2C, let alone 1.5C, just to be really blunt about it. \u201cThe International Energy Agency, which is hardly a bunch of crazy climate [change] believing leftists, says we are on track for 2.7C to 3.5C even if countries do what they are committed to do for Paris \u2013 and they are not doing what they have committed to do.\u201d Parkinson said the Morrison government\u2019s decision to use carryover credits from the Kyoto period to account for about half the abatement required under Australia\u2019s 2030 target was going to create significant problems down the track. Using the Kyoto-era accounting means Australia can meet the Paris target nominally while delaying a significant amount of practical emissions reduction. \u201cIf you use the carryovers, then at the end of 2030 the gap you\u2019ve got to close, as you go into whatever comes next, is that much bigger,\u201d he said. Parkinson retired from his position in August. Before heading the prime minister\u2019s department, Parkinson was the secretary of the Treasury department and the climate change department. Under John Howard, he ran the Shergold review, which cleared the path for the Liberals to adopt the policy of emissions trading, and he remained at the centre of policymaking in the Rudd and Gillard eras, before being sacked from Treasury by Tony Abbott. He was brought back to run the prime minister\u2019s department when Malcolm Turnbull took the Liberal leadership. Asked whether the climate policy failure was the worst experience of his professional life, Parkinson said: \u201cYes, it was. It was awful on a number of fronts. We were so close [with the CPRS].\u201d Coupled with all this, Parkinson said he inherited responsibility for managing the fallout from the home insulation scheme. \u201cWe\u2019d had four young Australians tragically die, and it was awful\u201d. He said he and his colleagues had \u201cmany, many sleepless nights\u201d. \u201cThat whole period was absolutely terrible,\u201d he said. Parkinson said the broader cause of reform in Australia had faltered because there was no longer a consensus, either in the political class or the economic profession, about what needed to be done. He said some participants in public life wanted to \u201cpretend that really complex problems are really simple\u201d when the reality was there were a number of problems that government couldn\u2019t fix. While he maintained a positive view of ministers and their advisers, including the current prime minister, Parkinson said ministers often came to their posts significantly unprepared. Ministers were asked to assume awesome responsibilities without proper training. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He expressed disappointment that the Morrison government has rejected some of the central recommendations of the recently released Thodey review, such as adopting a code of conduct for ministerial advisers. \u201cI think the vast majority of people who go into parliament or ministerial offices are trying to do the right thing, so I don\u2019t see training or a code of conduct for them as any way a negative \u2013 it would be about helping them do their jobs better and positioning them much better,\u201d Parkinson said. He says there was some antipathy in the government about the Thodey review process. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reasonable number of people in the government who took the attitude that this was a Malcolm Turnbull/Martin Parkinson frolic, and were never really committed to it, and definitely didn\u2019t want to do anything that would have impacted on their freedom to operate.\u201d",

The dialysis machines they depend on need cold water, and lots of it. But a run of hot summers mean \u201cpeople are getting worried for their life\u201d, according to Dadu Corey, among the elders sitting at the lunch table outside Purple House dialysis clinic in Alice Springs. Purple House operates clinics in 18 remote communities, so Aboriginal people can be on country, receive treatment and still take part in the cultural life of their communities. People with end-stage renal failure usually need dialysis three times a week. A single treatment uses 600 litres of clean, cold water. \u201cThe last couple of summers we\u2019ve really struggled with the temperature of the water,\u201d says the chief executive, Sarah Brown. \u201cThe water has to be below a certain temperature or you can\u2019t actually use it for dialysis.

      "bodyText": "With a Twenty20 World Cup on home soil less than a year away, it is interesting that the Australian men\u2019s team will sail into 2019 with a 50-over team that looks much closer to the Test line-up than a 20-over outfit. Few of the tyros of the Big Bash are there: instead they will be back home playing in that T20 tournament while the one-day team makes a lightning trip to the subcontinent for three matches at India\u2019s insistence. Steve Smith and David Warner are the pair that would be present in any format. Alongside them in the one-day squad sits the Test pace attack of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, while chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns says that Test spinner Nathan Lyon \u201cremains in the one-day squad selection frame\u201d. Marnus Labuschagne makes the squad after three Test hundreds this summer, without having played much short-form cricket even domestically. This fits with the moderate approach that coach Justin Langer took into the 50-over World Cup earlier this year, shifting 50-over cricket closer to a shortened Test than an elongated T20.

Getting older, especially crossing into your 30s and beyond, means forgoing all that intimacy and connection, at least with people outside your family or your marriage.

      "bodyText": "Australian businesses are calling for a more ambitious national climate policy, backing a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and raising concerns about the lack of a coordinated energy policy and the government\u2019s proposed use of carryover credits. The findings are contained in a Carbon Market Institute survey of more than 200 businesses, to be released on Thursday, which reveals 96% of those surveyed believe Australia should not delay the transition to a decarbonised economy. About a third of businesses surveyed are emissions intensive companies that have obligations under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act, and include the mining, oil and gas and manufacturing industries. Others surveyed include investors, carbon project developers, carbon market experts and professional service providers. The survey finds widespread concern among business and industry groups about the government\u2019s current policy settings, with 94% saying the approach is insufficient to meet Australia\u2019s 2030 Paris commitment to cut emissions to 26%-28% of 2005 levels. This was an increase from the 92% who expressed the same view in 2018 when the survey was last undertaken. A similar number of respondents were concerned that current policies were also inadequate to help business manage the risks and capitalise on the opportunities in the transition to a net-zero emission economy. In October, the Reserve Bank of Australia used its financial stability review to warn that it was becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to actively manage their carbon risk. Corporate regulators, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) have also warned that climate change is a foreseeable risk for corporate Australia. The findings come as Australian officials return from the UN climate change conference in Madrid after defending the country\u2019s plan to use 411 million tonnes of emissions credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris targets. On Wednesday, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, told the Australian Financial Review that Australia could possibly meet its abatement targets without the use of carryover credits, claiming the government was already \u201cover delivering\u201d. But a government report released last month showed the Coalition was relying on the accounting loophole negotiated, with Australia expected to achieve just a 16% cut below 2005 levels by 2030 if they did not use the credit. The carryover credit comes from Australia achieving a better result than it agreed to under the first Kyoto target, which allowed for an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010. The CMI survey finds that about three-quarters of business respondents (76%) do not believe that Australia should be able to use the carryover units to achieve its 2030 emission reduction target, joining critics and other countries who want the practice banned. Also heaping pressure on the government to set more ambitious mid-century targets, which the Coalition has indicated will be outlined next year, the vast majority of businesses (83%) support a national target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Almost all of those surveyed (96%) agreed that the longer Australia delays decarbonisation, the more \u201cabrupt, forceful and disruptive\u201d the policy response will need to be, especially for carbon-intensive industries. When asked what Australia\u2019s long-term policy should look like, the business leaders surveyed nominated a legislated net-zero 2050 target, coupled with a coordinated national climate policy suite to meet the target with a clear trajectory that was regularly reviewed. They also called for \u201csectoral decarbonisation strategies\u201d that identified abatement potential, structural barriers and economic opportunities, a price on carbon, and a plan to ensure orderly closure of old coal plants and their replacement with clean energy. The survey shows support for changes to the safeguard mechanism, which sets emissions caps for high emitting facilities, with 83% of businesses wanting the baselines set under this scheme to be reduced. About three-quarters (74%) want lower-emitting facilities also to be captured under the mechanism. Australia has been left without a cohesive national energy policy after Scott Morrison dumped the national energy guarantee that helped terminate Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership. In a sign that the issue of climate change and carbon emission reduction is becoming more pressing, 84% of survey respondents reported that their organisation recognises the financial and strategic risks of climate change at a board and executive level. Just under half (42%) reported increased shareholder engagement regarding climate change for their organisation in the past 12 months. The chief executive of CMI, John Connor, said there was a gap between business expectations and government policy that was concerning business. \u201cThis survey tells us that many in Australian business \u2013 including Australia\u2019s highest-emitting companies \u2013 are already planning to transition to a net-zero emissions world,\u201d Connor said. \u201cBusiness is looking for more ambitious climate policies to set a defined pathway and assist them in managing this.\u201d Connor said Australian businesses were grappling with the knowledge that science required net-zero emissions by 2050, while also dealing with \u201cpolicy volatility, evolving global carbon markets, investor calls for action and reporting requirements\u201d.",

Here are the results for Cheltenham: Con 48%, LD 46%, Lab 5%, Monster Raving Loony 1%. Perhaps Labour and the Loonies should shut up shop? I suppose Labour can celebrate the fact that they didn\u2019t come last.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick summary UK inflation remained at the lowest level in three years in November. The Consumer Prices Index stuck at 1.5%, despite rising prices for a variety of goods including chocolate, concert tickets and package holidays. UK house prices are also subdued, with prices rising by just 0.7% in the year to October. The Yorkshire market was quite buoyant, but London prices fell again. Sterling has had another poor day, as the UK\u2019s insistence of ending its Brexit transition period at the end of December worries traders. The pound has dropped half a cent to $1.3078, wiping out all its gains since the general election. German business confidence has risen, easing recession worries. Wall Street has hit a fresh record high today, as New York ends the year strongly. The Bank of England is to test the UK\u2019s financial sector\u2019s ability to handle the climate crisis. Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler have agreed terms of a \u00a338bn merger That\u2019s all for tonight! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The UK stock market has closed for the night, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points. With the pound still suffering from Brexit angst, international companies led the risers. Pharmaceutical firm Hikma gained 4%, with global equipment rental firm Ashtead 3% higher. But UK builders had a bad day, with Berkeley and Persimmon down 2% each. From shipping to craning.... and the world\u2019s biggest crane has been in action today, helping to construct the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Big Carl, which stands 250 metres high, successfully moved a 170 tonne (!) piece of the Hinkley reactor\u2019s \u201csteel containment liner\u201d at 4.30am this morning. Here are some impressive photos, which have quite a sci-fi feel.... The Baltic Dry index is one of those esoteric financial benchmarks that may actually give a handy insight into the real economy. It measures the cost of shipping goods around the world, and thus can gauge how much demand there is for supertankers and smaller ships. So it\u2019s worth noting that the Index has dropped close to a six-month low today, with weaker demand for a range of vessel sizes. It\u2019s the 11th daily drop in a row. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders await the historic vote on whether to impeach Donald Trump (liveblog here). Shares are a little higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 39 points or 0.14% to 28,306 - back towards yesterday\u2019s intraday high. The tech-focused Nasdaq has hit a record high, up 17 points or 0.2% at 8,840. A lot of people have been citing December 2020 as the big Brexit deadline. But actually, June could be the real cliff edge date. That the last date for the UK to request an extension, EU insiders insist. The withdrawal agreement stipulates that the transition can be extended by \u201cone or two years\u201d, but that would probably involve the UK committing more money for the EU budget. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports that Brussels believes Johnson is serious about not seeking such an extension: But.. this cliff-edge wouldn\u2019t be as serious as crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement: Back in the markets, sterling is weakening further as traders keep fretting about Brexit. The pound has lost more than half a cent against the US dollar today, to $1.3060 - or more than four cents below its post-election spike. JP Morgan has warned there\u2019s a 25% risk that the UK and EU fail to agree a trade deal by the end of 2020. This is \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d, it says. But the bank also believes there\u2019s a 50% chance that a deal is reached, and only a 20% possibility of the transition period being extended. David Lidington, who was effectively deputy prime minister under Theresa May, has predicted that a \u2018core\u2019 trade deal will be agreed by the end of December 2020. Speaking of the Bank of England... the central bank has outlined new climate emergency stress tests. They will examine whether UK banks and insurance companies are prepared for the impact of climate change. It will consider a range of scenarios, including temperature rises of up to 4 degrees celsius (double the Paris climate agreement). More here: Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues that UK interest rates are likely to be cut next year - whether Brexit goes smoothly or not. He writes: Under the current interest rate of 0.75%, the Bank expects inflation to be 1.42% in late 2020. Under one interest rate cut, inflation will be 1.51% by the end of 2020. All this, based on the assumption that the sterling effective rate settles at the 79 level in 2020. Notice that sterling went up to 82 in the aftermath of the election result. Assuming that Brexit-related negotiations run reasonably smoothly in 2020, sterling will rise further therefore pushing inflation further below the Bank\u2019s forecast and the 2% target. In this case, the Bank will surely react by cutting the policy rate. But what if the trade deal negotiations hit hurdles? Even if Brexit negotiations involve a lot of ups and downs, the BoE will most likely be forced to cut the policy rate. In this case, uncertainty will spiral out of control. Indeed, we got a taste of this following Boris Johnson\u2019s move to legislate against extending the end of 2020 deadline which is, of course, a huge gamble. So whatever Brexit scenario one is willing to contemplate, an interest rate cut looks as the most likely outcome.. As a knowledgable and well-read lot, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have NO TROUBLE at all tackling our Christmas quiz. It\u2019s just been published, covering some of the biggest business news stories of the year: Inflation is rising particularly briskly in the North of England, according to think tank NIESR. NIESR (the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) has calculated that \u2018underlying inflation\u2019 rose by 1% across the UK (this measure excludes \u2018extreme price movements\u2019). But while this underlying inflation rose by 1.5% in the North, it only picked up by 0.7% in the South East, and by 0.9% in Scotland. That\u2019s based on 130,088 \u201clocally collected\u201d prices. NIESR economist Janine Boshoff said: \u201cHeadline CPI inflation remained unchanged at 1.5 per cent in the year to November 2019. Our analysis of approximately 130,000 goods and services included in the basket, indicates that higher inflation related to food and non-alcoholic beverages and recreation and culture was offset by lower inflation in alcoholic beverages and tobacco, clothing and footwear, and restaurants and hotels. Our measure of underlying inflation, which excludes extreme price movements, increased by 0.1 percentage point to 1.0 per cent in November. Underlying inflation increased in most regions of the UK A quick dig into November\u2019s inflation report shows that the price of some types of food have risen sharply. Chocolate, for example, is 4.3% more expensive than a year ago. Ice-creams and \u2018edible ices\u2019 cost a chunky 6.1% more (which is intriguing, as November isn\u2019t really peak season). Yoghurt is up 12.5%, margarine by 15.9%, while pasta and couscous is 17.7% more expensive than November 2018. In the drinks section, cocoa and powdered chocolate was 7.7% more expensive than a year ago, while fruit and vegetable juices were 8.9% pricier. Here\u2019s a sector-by-sector breakdown of the November inflation report: OVERALL CONSUMER PRICES: 1.5% over the last year Food and non-alcoholic beverages: 2.1% Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: 1.9% Clothing and footwear: unchanged Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: 1.2% Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: 1.2% Health: 2.9% Transport: 0.8% Communication: 3.3% Recreation and culture: 1.5% Education: 2.7% Restaurants and hotels: 2.4% Miscellaneous goods and services: 1.9% Economists agree that Britain\u2019s low inflation means there\u2019s no chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates soon. The BoE sets rates tomorrow, at its last meeting of 2019, but Jing Teow, economist at PwC, doesn\u2019t expect fireworks: \u201cThe below-target level of inflation means that the Bank of England will be under little pressure to raise its policy rates soon. However, a recovery next year that follows a further easing of political and economic uncertainties could spur further economic activity and spending, giving rise to inflationary pressures in the medium term. \u201c Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, predicts that inflation will stay low next year - potentially allowing the BoE to cut borrowing costs. Inflation is expected to remain well below the Bank of England\u2019s target in 2020, thanks to price caps set on regulated utilities and a stronger pound, giving the Bank of England some room to act if the economy wobbles a little next year. \u201cThe Bank may wish to secure a pre-emptive cut in rates, either in February or May, if recent economic weakness proves more persistent. Chancellor Sajid Javid has welcomed today\u2019s inflation figures, saying it will help families handle the cost of Christmas. However, prices are still rising -- so households will suffer if their income hasn\u2019t kept pace with inflation. Wages are still rising faster than inflation in the UK, but the gap has narrowed. Yesterday we learned that total pay growth (including bonuses) slowed to 3.2%, from 3.6%, with basic pay growth dipping from 3.6% to 3.5%. Chocolate prices are a classic example of \u2018shrinkflation\u2019, especially at Christmas time. Last week, ITV News showed how some favourite festive confectionary tins, such as Roses and Quality Street, have shrunk by 40% in the last decade. That has allowed them to keep the sticker price low - but obviously consumers are getting less for their money. The Office for National Statistics tries to keep a close eye on this. Earlier this year, it reported that 206 products shrank in size in 2018, while 79 got bigger. So if a chocolate tub gets significantly smaller, but its price doesn\u2019t, that pushes inflation up. UK house price growth has hit its lowest level in seven years, as prices continue to fall in London. Across the country, the average house price increased by 0.7% in the 12 months to October to \u00a3233,000. That\u2019s the lowest growth since September 2012. Prices rose strongly in Yorkshire and the Humber (+3.2%) but fell in the capital (-1.6%) and the North East (-1%). On a regional basis, English house prices lagged behind the rest of the UK. England: +0.5% year-on-year Scotland: 1.4% Wales: 3.3% Northern Ireland: 4.0% ONS Head of Inflation Mike Hardie points out that concert tickets, and package holidays, also became pricier last month: \u201cThe headline rate of inflation remained steady with prices rising across a variety of goods and services such as chocolate, concert tickets and package holidays, offset by falling hotel costs and cigarette prices rising substantially slower than this time last year. Food prices rose in November, particularly for chocolate, according to today\u2019s inflation report. The Office for National Statistics explains: Prices rose between October and November 2019 by more than between the same two months a year ago, especially for sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery (which rose by 1.8% this year, compared with a rise of 0.1% last year). Within this group, boxes and cartons of chocolates, and chocolate covered ice cream bars drove the upward movement. Recreation and culture costs rose at a faster rate last month, but that was balanced by smaller rises in hotel bills and tobacco prices. Women\u2019s clothes price inflation also slower, the ONS says: Prices rose between October and November 2019 but by less than a year ago, especially for women\u2019s garments (which rose by 1.3% this year, compared with 2.1% last year). Within this group, the largest individual contributions came from women\u2019s formal trousers and strappy tops. Britain\u2019s inflation rate remains at its lowest since November 2016, as this chart shows: Just in: UK inflation stuck at a three-year low of 1.5% last month. That\u2019s a little higher than expected, but still comfortably below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. More to follow.... Big news in the auto sector: Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler have agreed to merge, creating the world\u2019s four-biggest carmaker. My colleague Jasper Jolly has the details: The two parent companies, PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, confirmed there will be no plant closures as part of \u20ac3.7bn in cost savings from the merger, a key concern for more than 1,000 workers at PSA\u2019s Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port. PSA\u2019s boss Carlos Tavares, who previously oversaw PSA\u2019s successful integration and turnaround of the Vauxhall and Opel brands, will stay on as the chief executive of the new group, which will have combined annual sales of about 8.7m vehicles. Newsflash: German business confidence has risen, as Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to swerve a recession. The IFO think tank has reported that Germany\u2019s business leaders are more confident about future prospects, and that current economic conditions have brightened a little this month. IFO estimates that the German economy may grow by 0.2% in the current quarter, as firms enter 2020 with \u201cmore confidence\u2019. Here\u2019s the details: Business climate index: UP to 96.3 in December, from 95.1 Current conditions: UP to 98.8, from 98 Business expectations: UP to 93.8 from 92.3 The pound is bobbing nervously this morning, currently below $1.309 at its lowest level since election day. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock says Boris Johnson needs to tread more carefully, and help lower economic uncertainty rather than dolloping more onto the markets. Back in London, the UK-focused FTSE 250 index has dipped in early trading. The mid-cap index has lost 54 points or 0.25% at 21,636. Consumer stocks and financials are among the fallers. Experienced City watchers often say that profit warnings come in threes. Luxury audio equipment and TVs firm Bang &amp; Olufsen has gone one better (or worse) with its FOURTH profits warning of the year. Shares in Bang &amp; Olufsen have fallen by 20% this morning, after it warned that sales were \u201cconsiderably lower than expected\u201d last month. It now expects revenue to be 18% lower than a year ago. Demand for Bang &amp; Olufsen\u2019s expensive equipment has faded as consumer behaviour changes -- rather than investing in a top-end hi-fi, younger people are more likely to be consuming music through their phones or smart speakers. The company has tried to move with the times with some new ranges, such as its Beosound 2 with Google Assistant (a snip at, er, \u00a31,650). But profits and cash flow are both weakening. It\u2019s also the season for profit warnings. UK recruiter Staffline has slashed its profit forecasts for the second time in three, after suffering a slump in demand from customers. It told investors: During November, customer demand was down approximately 16% from the prior year which the Board believes reflects high levels of consumer uncertainty across the UK. Alarmingly, Staffline also says it overstated its profits by \u00a34m last year, due to accounting errors. The firm\u2019s share have slumped by a third this morning. Breaking: Denise Coates, who runs gambling site Bet365, has secured another MASSIVE payday. Coates, who was already the world\u2019s highest-paid woman, was paid a staggering \u00a3276.6m in the last financial year, up from \u00a3220m a year ago. She\u2019s will also have received dividend payments of around \u00a346m, taking her total earnings to a scarcely imaginable \u00a3322m. She picked up the payout after growing Bet365\u2019s turnover to over \u00a33bn last year, from \u00a32.85bn, with profits rising to \u00a3791m from \u00a3660m. More than \u00a364bn of bets were placed by customers. Last year\u2019s pay packet would have formed a tower almost twice as high as the Shard skyscraper in London, if paid in crisp \u00a350 notes. My colleague Rob Davies explained last year how Coates had turned the Stock-based firm into a major player: Bet365 is the personal fiefdom of the Coates family, a business dynasty worth \u00a35.8bn, more than Sir Richard Branson\u2019s empire. The story of how they built their empire from a Portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent is the stuff of industry legend. Coates\u2019s father, Peter, the 80-year-old son of a miner, became a successful local businessman and owned a string of betting shops. But it was Coates, an econometrics graduate who, at around the turn of the millennium, became aware of the jackpot opportunity that lay online. She bought the Bet365.com domain name from eBay for $25,000 and borrowed against the bricks-and-mortar stores to develop sports-betting technology that left slow-moving rivals in the dust. When the likes of Ladbrokes and William Hill were buying the systems they needed from third parties, Bet365 already had them and was deploying them at great speed. Shares in UK-focused companies are coming under fresh pressure this morning. Housebuilders such as Barratt (-2.7%), Persimmon (-1.8%) and Berkeley Group (-1.7%) are among the top fallers. Ocado (-1.4%) and Next (-1%) are also dropping, on fears that Brexit fears will hurt consumer spending. Brexit jitters have pushed the pound down to a two-week low against the euro. Sterling dropped as low as \u20ac1.1737 this morning, just a few days after hitting a three-year high over \u20ac1.20 FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich blames Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201chard line\u201d on trade negotiations with the EU. The markets may have run ahead of the train again, expecting the volatility of the pound to be over. In this case, there are more and more similarities with Trump, whose arrival marked the increased uncertainty for the markets, although it still contributed more to their growth than to their decline for stocks. Today\u2019s UK inflation data (9.30am) may show that households are benefitting from a cap on gas and electricity bills. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: CPI inflation dropped to 1.5% y/y last month from 1.7% y/y previously. Almost all of that fall in CPI inflation was attributable to a cap on domestic energy prices. The effect will continue to drag on inflation again this month. Our economists expect November CPI inflation to drop to what would be a three-year low of 1.4% y/y. Economist and trade expert Dr Rebecca Harding says Downing Street\u2019s Brexit strategy appears to have been taken straight from the White House: \u201cHow should we assess Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s proposed hard deadline for a Brexit deal? This is entirely strategic and straight out of the Trump playbook. Boris said he\u2019d get Brexit done and he will live by that promise. In reality, what we\u2019ll probably see is a small deal so everyone wins, leaving many doors open and allowing things that need a little bit longer to get done at a more leisurely pace. The politics are all for show.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. \u2018Tiz the season for a festive hangover. But rather than a champagne-induced headache, City traders are feeling groggy about the prospect of a new Brexit deadline crisis next year. The pound is languishing below its levels before last week\u2019s election this morning, at just $1.311 against the US dollar, after Boris Jonson vowed to outlaw extending EU trade deal talks beyond December 2020. Should a deal not be reached during 2020, Britain would then risk sliding into World Trade Organisation trading terms -- not a palatable prospect, when the WTO itself is in some turmoil. UK investors are facing up to the likelihood of another year dominated by Brexit, says David Madden of CMC Markets. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, and then the transition period will kick in until the end of the year. It would appear that Mr Johnson doesn\u2019t want the transition period to run on and on, so he intends to pass legislation that will prevent that possibility. Even if a no-deal Brexit does happen, it won\u2019t take place for over a year, so equity traders are not overly worried. On the other hand, the pound sold-off aggressively yesterday on the back of the no-deal fears. All of the gains the pound made against the US dollar and the euro since the exit poll on election night have been reversed .Keep in mind the pound was broadly pushing higher in the months ahead of the election. Also coming up November\u2019s inflation figures, due this morning, are expected to show that prices are rising relatively slowly. The consumer prices index is expected to have risen by just 1.4% compared with a year ago, down from 1.5% in October. That would leave CPI well below the official 2% target, helping households as they face Christmas bills. But with wage growth slowing in the last quarter (we learned yesterday), real earnings may be coming under pressure. The agenda 9am GMT: IFO survey of German business confidence: Expected to rise to 95.5, from 95 9.30am GMT: UK inflation data for November. CPI expected to fall to 1.4% from 1.5%",

The revelations on the site\u2019s historic significance has further angered residents, many of whom trace their ancestry back to enslavement in the region.

But the revelations are likely to intensify the fight in one of the most contentious new developments in the region. Sharon Lavigne, a resident opposed to the development, said the discovery of the cemeteries was \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d and made the proposed site \u201challowed ground\u201d. \u201cI have buried so many family members and friends who have died from cancer.

Formosa is currently navigating the approval process with state authorities and as part of this quietly commissioned archaeological research on the land earmarked for development. Although initial cultural surveys conducted by the company in 2018 had indicated there were not historically significant sites on the land Formosa plans to build on, the company were later alerted to maps from the late 19th century \u2013 submitted to the state\u2019s division of archaeology by an independent researcher \u2013 that indicated two cemeteries tied to old plantations on the land. According to hundreds of pages of emails, reports and surveys released under freedom of information laws to lawyers working for community activists and reviewed by the Guardian before publication, Formosa has found one of these sites, the Buena Vista cemetery, is still intact. Any evidence of the other, listed as the Arcadia cemetery, could not be located by excavators working for a contractor, who believe that either any human remains or other physical signs of grave sites have been destroyed by construction carried out by previous land users or that the cemetery may never have existed.

The operation \u2013 part of an embezzlement and money-laundering inquiry focusing on one of Bolsonaro\u2019s three politician sons, Fl\u00e1vio \u2013 dominated Brazilian front pages on Wednesday and came as a major embarrassment to the rightwing populist who was elected promising to stamp out corruption. Officials from Rio de Janeiro\u2019s public prosecutor reportedly descended on multiple addresses linked to Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz \u2013 a friend of Jair Bolsonaro since the mid-1980s \u2013 and to Bolsonaro\u2019s ex-wife, and his former father-in-law and sister-in-law. Documents and mobile phones were reportedly seized as 24 warrants were executed in the cities of Rio and Resende. The targets included a chocolate shop in Rio partly owned by Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro. The investigation is examining suspicions that the now senator Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro oversaw a corruption racket during his 15 years as a Rio congressman, with the collaboration of Queiroz, his then security chief and aide.

The documentary completely shredded what was left of Jackson\u2019s reputation, but that didn\u2019t stop plenty of people putting up a fight in his defence. True to form, members of the Jackson family went on the attack, casting aspersions on Robson, in particular. Jackson\u2019s most-dedicated fans, not known for their rationality, eagerly went after Reed especially, but really anyone who dared to express a sceptical opinion about St Michael.

      "bodyText": "In February, when the documentary maker Dan Reed and I met in a near-empty bar, it felt very much like the lull before the typhoon. He was calm and expansive as he spoke about his film, Leaving Neverland \u2013 which was about to be broadcast \u2013 about James Safechuck and Wade Robson, who accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them for years. As I looked at him leaning back, relaxed as you like, talking casually about \u201cthe Jackson fans\u201d, I thought: \u201cSonny Jim, you have NO IDEA what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d It was like watching an innocent babe wander into a dark wood, the sounds of snarling animals in shadows all around him. Well, 10 months later, the innocence is truly gone. The documentary completely shredded what was left of Jackson\u2019s reputation, but that didn\u2019t stop plenty of people putting up a fight in his defence. True to form, members of the Jackson family went on the attack, casting aspersions on Robson, in particular. Jackson\u2019s most-dedicated fans, not known for their rationality, eagerly went after Reed especially, but really anyone who dared to express a sceptical opinion about St Michael. On the day my interview with Reed, Safechuck and Robson went online, I had to block more than 100 Twitter accounts. I couldn\u2019t even imagine how Reed used the internet at all any more. But Reed is a man with pride.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s June 2014, and James Howarth is in a waiting room at Orpington hospital. A few weeks earlier, he\u2019d been in to see the doctor about his acid indigestion. Too much beer and curry, he reckoned. But there was something there, a growth, on his pancreas. Now he\u2019s waiting for a Cat scan. He gets talking to another patient, a cockney, Paul, who says to him: \u201cSo what cancer you got, son?\u201d and James says back: \u201cNo, not me, mate \u2013 they\u2019re just eliminating things. It\u2019s a cyst, a growth, a mass.\u201d Paul blinks and looks at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be so fucking naive mate, this is a cancer ward.\u201d And James sits there blank, and his mind fills with fear \u201clike a lock as the gates are opened\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCould be worse mate, you could support West Ham,\u201d Paul tells him, \u201cyou don\u2019t, do you?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/17/england-eddie-jones-contract-rfu-2021\">England in \u2018no rush\u2019 to extend Eddie Jones\u2019s contract, says RFU chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I met James outside Yokohama International Stadium, a couple of hours before Wales\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa.

So I found him, and phoned him.</p> <p>Paul the cockney was right. James has lymphoma. When they first diagnosed it, the consultant told him: \u201cFor the next six months, you have a new job, and that job is to fight cancer and fight for your life.\u201d</p> <p>And James thought about his wife, and he thought about his three children, and he thought about his parents, he thought about all the big things we should be thinking about while we\u2019re worrying about the little things we do think about. He thought about what he\u2019d done, and what he wanted to do, and what he wanted to do was this: watch England win the Rugby World Cup, at home, in 2015. \u201cI guess people deal with things in different ways,\u201d he says, \u201csomeone who\u2019s more sane than I am, more well-adjusted, might have goals to watch their children get married, but my kids are all so young, and I needed something much more short-term, and that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b39f7888045a25f70bdede0475056cb240b94d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b39f7888045a25f70bdede0475056cb240b94d3/0_0_650_891/365.jpg\" alt=\"Hathaway Academy headteacher James Howarth pictured before he left the school in 2017\" width=\"365\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hathaway Academy headteacher James Howarth pictured before he left the school in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Hathaway Academy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once, James had been a rugby player himself, \u201cat a decent standard\u201d.

He made it to the final.</p> <p>And then he started to think about what was next. For four years, James\u2019s life, like those of so many of the other 363,000 people who are diagnosed with cancer in the UK each year, has been measured out in hospital visits.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s June 2014, and James Howarth is in a waiting room at Orpington hospital. A few weeks earlier, he\u2019d been in to see the doctor about his acid indigestion. Too much beer and curry, he reckoned. But there was something there, a growth, on his pancreas. Now he\u2019s waiting for a Cat scan. He gets talking to another patient, a cockney, Paul, who says to him: \u201cSo what cancer you got, son?\u201d and James says back: \u201cNo, not me, mate \u2013 they\u2019re just eliminating things. It\u2019s a cyst, a growth, a mass.\u201d Paul blinks and looks at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be so fucking naive mate, this is a cancer ward.\u201d And James sits there blank, and his mind fills with fear \u201clike a lock as the gates are opened\u201d. \u201cCould be worse mate, you could support West Ham,\u201d Paul tells him, \u201cyou don\u2019t, do you?\u201d I met James outside Yokohama International Stadium, a couple of hours before Wales\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa. I was doing vox pops about England\u2019s win in the other semi, and he and his mate Nigel were wearing white tops. We spoke about how happy they were \u2013 \u201cbest day of our lives\u201d they said, \u201cwe All-Blacked the All Blacks\u201d \u2013 and how they\u2019d consoled the Kiwi couple who\u2019d been sitting next to them: \u201cNow you know how we feel.\u201d And then, as I was breaking away, James told me: \u201cYou know we\u2019re calling this the death\u2019s door tour because I was given six months to live.\u201d I was still thinking about him when I got back home. So I found him, and phoned him. Paul the cockney was right. James has lymphoma. When they first diagnosed it, the consultant told him: \u201cFor the next six months, you have a new job, and that job is to fight cancer and fight for your life.\u201d And James thought about his wife, and he thought about his three children, and he thought about his parents, he thought about all the big things we should be thinking about while we\u2019re worrying about the little things we do think about. He thought about what he\u2019d done, and what he wanted to do, and what he wanted to do was this: watch England win the Rugby World Cup, at home, in 2015. \u201cI guess people deal with things in different ways,\u201d he says, \u201csomeone who\u2019s more sane than I am, more well-adjusted, might have goals to watch their children get married, but my kids are all so young, and I needed something much more short-term, and that\u2019s what it was.\u201d Once, James had been a rugby player himself, \u201cat a decent standard\u201d. Then he\u2019d become a PE teacher, at some hard schools, in Tottenham, in Canning Town, in Peckham, and, in the end, he became the head at the Hathaway Academy in Grays, Essex. \u201cIf I had a talent, it was to be able to relate to the most challenging children through sport,\u201d he says. \u201cMy whole life has been built around sport and education, my friends are PE teachers, my wife is a PE teacher, I hired her when I was head of department, so our lives are totally entwined with sport.\u201d James did better than England in 2015. He made it to the final. And then he started to think about what was next. For four years, James\u2019s life, like those of so many of the other 363,000 people who are diagnosed with cancer in the UK each year, has been measured out in hospital visits. Some of them lasted hours. Some lasted weeks. He\u2019s been in remission, and been rediagnosed, been in remission again, been rediagnosed again. On Facebook, you can watch the video of the last assembly James gave at Hathaway, when he finally quit teaching. He sounds urgent, almost angry. \u201cLook at yourself, take action, do something,\u201d he tells the children, \u201cdon\u2019t end up running on the spot, don\u2019t waste your time doing things that aren\u2019t related to moving forwards.\u201d No one ever told him he was crazy to think he could get to Japan in 2019, crazy to think he might see England win there, though, goodness knows, they must have thought it.

      "body": "<p>On 28 November 2017, I burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop after I learned that my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/18/visa-britons-foreign-spouses-families-split-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">spouse visa</a> had been rejected by the Home Office. My lawyer had warned me that this would be the most likely outcome but it still felt like a punch in the stomach. I was being rejected by the country where I had spent the past seven years, although I was happily married to one of its citizens.</p> <p>I first arrived in the UK in 2010, aged 16 and on a child student visa, hoping to start a new life. My old life in Chechnya had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/23/chechnya-natalia-estemirova\" title=\"\">broken into pieces</a> the day my mother, a human rights activist, was kidnapped outside our house and murdered. With the support of my mum\u2019s friends and colleagues, I moved to the UK, as she had wanted me to. In the following years I finished school, graduated from the London School of Economics and married the love of my life.</p> <p>I was 22, he was 24, Brexit had just happened, my visa was running out, so tying the knot seemed like the most sensible (and romantic) option. But we learned soon enough that love and human rights concerns were not enough for the Home Office to grant a visa. How naive we were.</p> <p>In 2012 the then home secretary, Theresa May, devised a number of policies in a bid to lower net migration. With the dexterity of a drunk barber, she chopped whatever ends she could find, wreaking havoc upon thousands of families. Under the new rules, the minimum income required to sponsor a spouse from outside the European Economic Area was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/09/couples-protest-18600-minimum-income-rule-foreign-spouse-uk\" title=\"\">raised to \u00a318,600</a>, higher if the spouse had a child. The income of a foreign spouse does not count towards this, even if they have a better-paid job. Roughly 40% of the population don\u2019t meet the threshold \u2013 meaning that the ability to marry and live with who you love in the UK has become a privilege, not a right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/17/windrush-victim-rejects-insulting-offer-of-22000-payout-compensation\">Windrush victim rejects 'insulting' offer of \u00a322,000 payout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Visa and citizenship fees <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/how-expensive-are-uk-immigration-applications-and-is-this-a-problem/\" title=\"\">have steadily risen</a> by 20-25% a year, driving many applicants into debt. Those fees include an obligatory \u00a32,000 NHS surcharge on top of the income tax that all employed immigrants must also pay.</p> <p>Our lawyer suggested that we should apply for a spouse visa via the human rights route. My three-kilo stack of visa documents included letters of support from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Front Line Defenders, saying it would be unsafe for me to return to Chechnya. My situation was complicated by the fact that half of my Chechen family disowned me for marrying a foreigner. We also didn\u2019t meet the financial requirements, as my husband was completing his MA at the time, but we tried to find our way around it.</p> <p>There had been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/22/supreme-court-backs-minimum-income-rule-for-non-european-spouses\" title=\"\">supreme court ruling</a> that upheld the minimum income requirement but condemned the Home Office for endangering the welfare of children; it stated that third-party support should be considered when evaluating an applicant\u2019s financial circumstances.</p> <p>My father-in-law was happy to be a third-party sponsor. He drew up a legally binding contract, promising to pay the minimum monthly income requirement. He even had himself audited and his house valued to prove that he could afford to continue the payments.</p> <p>In an attempt to meet the required income, my husband got a part-time job as a salesman for a tech company while doing his studies; I was serving tables at an Italian restaurant (I could only legally work for 20 hours a week).

      "bodyText": "On 28 November 2017, I burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop after I learned that my spouse visa had been rejected by the Home Office. My lawyer had warned me that this would be the most likely outcome but it still felt like a punch in the stomach. I was being rejected by the country where I had spent the past seven years, although I was happily married to one of its citizens. I first arrived in the UK in 2010, aged 16 and on a child student visa, hoping to start a new life. My old life in Chechnya had broken into pieces the day my mother, a human rights activist, was kidnapped outside our house and murdered. With the support of my mum\u2019s friends and colleagues, I moved to the UK, as she had wanted me to. In the following years I finished school, graduated from the London School of Economics and married the love of my life. I was 22, he was 24, Brexit had just happened, my visa was running out, so tying the knot seemed like the most sensible (and romantic) option. But we learned soon enough that love and human rights concerns were not enough for the Home Office to grant a visa. How naive we were. In 2012 the then home secretary, Theresa May, devised a number of policies in a bid to lower net migration. With the dexterity of a drunk barber, she chopped whatever ends she could find, wreaking havoc upon thousands of families. Under the new rules, the minimum income required to sponsor a spouse from outside the European Economic Area was raised to \u00a318,600, higher if the spouse had a child. The income of a foreign spouse does not count towards this, even if they have a better-paid job. Roughly 40% of the population don\u2019t meet the threshold \u2013 meaning that the ability to marry and live with who you love in the UK has become a privilege, not a right. Visa and citizenship fees have steadily risen by 20-25% a year, driving many applicants into debt. Those fees include an obligatory \u00a32,000 NHS surcharge on top of the income tax that all employed immigrants must also pay. Our lawyer suggested that we should apply for a spouse visa via the human rights route. My three-kilo stack of visa documents included letters of support from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Front Line Defenders, saying it would be unsafe for me to return to Chechnya. My situation was complicated by the fact that half of my Chechen family disowned me for marrying a foreigner. We also didn\u2019t meet the financial requirements, as my husband was completing his MA at the time, but we tried to find our way around it. There had been a supreme court ruling that upheld the minimum income requirement but condemned the Home Office for endangering the welfare of children; it stated that third-party support should be considered when evaluating an applicant\u2019s financial circumstances. My father-in-law was happy to be a third-party sponsor. He drew up a legally binding contract, promising to pay the minimum monthly income requirement. He even had himself audited and his house valued to prove that he could afford to continue the payments. In an attempt to meet the required income, my husband got a part-time job as a salesman for a tech company while doing his studies; I was serving tables at an Italian restaurant (I could only legally work for 20 hours a week). For one and a half years, my life was constrained by the fact that my only form of ID, my Russian passport, was at the Home Office \u2013 I couldn\u2019t leave the country, register at a hotel or even buy a pair of scissors. Eventually the Home Office claimed I hadn\u2019t provided sufficient proof that I spoke a good level of English, seemingly forgetting I had finished school and graduated from university. It followed up with a few terse sentences, noting I had failed the financial requirements and that it wouldn\u2019t consider third-party support \u2013 without any explanation of that decision. The Home Office saw no reason why my husband and I couldn\u2019t settle in Russia \u2013 despite human rights organisations arguing that our lives might be at risk. That the Home Office appears to think it\u2019s OK to tell citizens they should live somewhere else if they want to be with the one they love is a scandal in its own right. We appealed, our lawyer explaining that when similar cases go to appeal they are likely be overturned. Yet at \u00a34,000 plus legal fees and no guarantee of success, this filters out many applicants by default.

[Teamwork] is what you\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s a team sport and those two guys are special.</p> <p>\u201cFroome is the greatest Grand Tour rider of his generation, and Bernal \u2026 to win a Tour at 22, he could have 10 or 12 years of being super-competitive. But at least I will always have that Tour win.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas fell short this year in his attempt to win a second Tour in a row and he ended the season without a win, in stark contrast to 2018 when he landed seven victories including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/29/geraint-thomas-seals-tour-de-france-title-paris-team-sky-chris-froome\" title=\"\">the overall standings at the Tour</a> with back-to-back mountain stage wins along the way and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/10/geraint-thomas-criterium-dauphine-adam-yates-cycling-news\" title=\"\">Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith second in the Tour [in 2019] I can be happy and proud, but at the time it was disappointing. From the start, the way the season went, and the off-season. The buildup was nothing like 2018, but I was still confident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a shame about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/26/egan-bernal-yellow-julian-alaphilippe-tour-de-france-stage-19-hailstorm\" title=\"\">the cancelled stage</a> [in the Alps] and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/27/egan-bernal-set-for-tour-de-france-title-stage-20-report-cycling\" title=\"\">the shortened day</a>. It leaves an unknown. You can\u2019t say Egan shouldn\u2019t have won, but there is a bit of an unknown.\u201d</p> <p>If he has one regret about this year\u2019s Tour, Thomas says, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/21/simon-yates-julian-alaphilippe-geraint-thomas-tour-de-france-stage-15\" title=\"\">the Pyrenean stage into Foix</a>, where he felt he did not make a full-on effort. \u201cI could have pushed harder. I sat back a bit. I was feeling good, and I could have gone quicker. But that\u2019s how Grand Tours go \u2013 you have off days when you limit your losses and on the good days you need to make the most of it.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas acknowledges that the question of who will lead Team Ineos at the 2020 Tour de France will be raised constantly until next July, but expects it to be resolved in the same way that the question was settled in 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe will deal with it as we have done [in the past]. When I won and Froome was third, when Egan won and I was second, the reason we both finished on the podium was that we were open and honest with each other. We pulled in the same direction, never chased each other down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554312a1d1f13d9f7d6e60fd5f9733cb48959bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554312a1d1f13d9f7d6e60fd5f9733cb48959bb6/0_0_2227_1336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas feels he \u2018could have pushed harder\u2019 in stage 15 of this year\u2019s Tour de France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geraint Thomas feels he \u2018could have pushed harder\u2019 in stage 15 of this year\u2019s Tour de France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of his personal objective for next year, Thomas has the Tour firmly in his mind, but has yet to fix his programme. \u201cI\u2019m looking at targeting the Tour. We need to confirm it all, to chat it through, but at the moment it\u2019s all about the Tour again.\u201d It was, no doubt, with that in mind that this week he completed a marathon 190-mile lap of Majorca at his training camp, spending eight hours in the saddle at 22mph.</p> <p>There is, he says, no chance in the short term at least that he will line up the Giro d\u2019Italia or Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a as a target simply to ensure that he has an unhindered run at team leadership.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to weigh up your position in the team and it\u2019s about what motivates you. There is no point going to the Giro just to be the leader and only being 95% motivated. You need to be all-in. I\u2019d love to do the Giro [to win] one year, but next year what excites me is the Tour again.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the most straightforward of close seasons for Dave Brailsford\u2019s squad, with Froome still getting over the accident that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/15/chris-froome-thanks-cycling-fans-for-support-after-major-setback\" title=\"\">cost him most of the 2019 season</a> and left him with multiple fractures including to his femur, elbow and ribs.</p> <p>Froome has yet to race again, and asked about his teammate\u2019s chances of returning to the top, Thomas said: \u201cI think [he can] but I don\u2019t know how quickly or how good [he will be]. It was such a horrific crash. How and when is the million dollar question.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas is one of the few to have raced with Brailsford\u2019s Sky and Ineos since its inception in 2010, but he said he has not paid great attention to the current medical tribunal involving Team Sky\u2019s former doctor Richard Freeman, or the allegations around the team\u2019s former coach Shane Sutton. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t followed it too much. All I saw was Shane talking on BBC Breakfast about being able to get it up. It\u2019s crazy, Freeman against Shane, thrashing it out.\u201d</p> <p>Closer to home, however, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/29/team-sky-tour-de-yorkshire-environmental-protesters\" title=\"\">departure of Thomas\u2019s former mentor Rod Ellingworth</a>, the 2018 Tour winner\u2019s coach since his days in the Great Britain academy 15 years ago. Ellingworth now runs Bahrain-McLaren, and will be directly pitted against his former squad. \u201cI definitely miss him, 100%. But it\u2019s a great opportunity for him, I hope he has success there, but hopefully not when I\u2019m around. It\u2019s strange without him.

Speaking to the Guardian in advance of a BBC documentary covering his defence of his 2018 Tour de France title, the 33-year-old Welshman was asked if he found Bernal\u2019s emergence as a Tour winner frustrating after he had already spent several years in the service of the prolific Grand Tour winner Chris Froome. Thomas replied: \u201cYes, to be honest,\u201d but added: \u201cWhen there are better riders [in the team] it\u2019s obvious. [Teamwork] is what you\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s a team sport and those two guys are special. \u201cFroome is the greatest Grand Tour rider of his generation, and Bernal \u2026 to win a Tour at 22, he could have 10 or 12 years of being super-competitive. But at least I will always have that Tour win.\u201d Thomas fell short this year in his attempt to win a second Tour in a row and he ended the season without a win, in stark contrast to 2018 when he landed seven victories including the overall standings at the Tour with back-to-back mountain stage wins along the way and the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. \u201cWith second in the Tour [in 2019] I can be happy and proud, but at the time it was disappointing. From the start, the way the season went, and the off-season. The buildup was nothing like 2018, but I was still confident.\u201d \u201cIt was a shame about the cancelled stage [in the Alps] and the shortened day. It leaves an unknown. You can\u2019t say Egan shouldn\u2019t have won, but there is a bit of an unknown.\u201d If he has one regret about this year\u2019s Tour, Thomas says, it is the Pyrenean stage into Foix, where he felt he did not make a full-on effort. \u201cI could have pushed harder. I sat back a bit. I was feeling good, and I could have gone quicker. But that\u2019s how Grand Tours go \u2013 you have off days when you limit your losses and on the good days you need to make the most of it.\u201d Thomas acknowledges that the question of who will lead Team Ineos at the 2020 Tour de France will be raised constantly until next July, but expects it to be resolved in the same way that the question was settled in 2018 and 2019. \u201cWe will deal with it as we have done [in the past]. When I won and Froome was third, when Egan won and I was second, the reason we both finished on the podium was that we were open and honest with each other. We pulled in the same direction, never chased each other down.\u201d In terms of his personal objective for next year, Thomas has the Tour firmly in his mind, but has yet to fix his programme. \u201cI\u2019m looking at targeting the Tour. We need to confirm it all, to chat it through, but at the moment it\u2019s all about the Tour again.\u201d It was, no doubt, with that in mind that this week he completed a marathon 190-mile lap of Majorca at his training camp, spending eight hours in the saddle at 22mph. There is, he says, no chance in the short term at least that he will line up the Giro d\u2019Italia or Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a as a target simply to ensure that he has an unhindered run at team leadership. \u201cYou have to weigh up your position in the team and it\u2019s about what motivates you. There is no point going to the Giro just to be the leader and only being 95% motivated. You need to be all-in. I\u2019d love to do the Giro [to win] one year, but next year what excites me is the Tour again.\u201d This is not the most straightforward of close seasons for Dave Brailsford\u2019s squad, with Froome still getting over the accident that cost him most of the 2019 season and left him with multiple fractures including to his femur, elbow and ribs. Froome has yet to race again, and asked about his teammate\u2019s chances of returning to the top, Thomas said: \u201cI think [he can] but I don\u2019t know how quickly or how good [he will be]. It was such a horrific crash. How and when is the million dollar question.\u201d Thomas is one of the few to have raced with Brailsford\u2019s Sky and Ineos since its inception in 2010, but he said he has not paid great attention to the current medical tribunal involving Team Sky\u2019s former doctor Richard Freeman, or the allegations around the team\u2019s former coach Shane Sutton. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t followed it too much. All I saw was Shane talking on BBC Breakfast about being able to get it up. It\u2019s crazy, Freeman against Shane, thrashing it out.\u201d Closer to home, however, is the departure of Thomas\u2019s former mentor Rod Ellingworth, the 2018 Tour winner\u2019s coach since his days in the Great Britain academy 15 years ago. Ellingworth now runs Bahrain-McLaren, and will be directly pitted against his former squad. \u201cI definitely miss him, 100%. But it\u2019s a great opportunity for him, I hope he has success there, but hopefully not when I\u2019m around. It\u2019s strange without him. Being [in Majorca] now, I keep expecting him to walk around the corner and say: \u2018How are you doing?\u2019\u201d Geraint Thomas: The Road Will Decide, Thursday 19 December, 9pm, BBC One Wales and BBC iPlayer",

      "body": "<p>Adam Driver really does not like to listen to the sound of his own voice. In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story.</p> <p>Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show\u2019s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air\u2019s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/adam-driver-walks-out-of-npr-fresh-air-interview-over-marriage-story-clip\">to the Daily Beast</a>. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work \u2013 he told Gross as much in a previous interview \u2013 and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,\u201d Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then wish I could change it, but you can\u2019t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.\u201d</p> <p>A New Yorker <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/adam-driver-the-original-man\">piece from October</a> touched on what they called Driver\u2019s \u201cphobia\u201d as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I was, like, I can\u2019t watch myself in things. I certainly can\u2019t watch this if we\u2019re going to continue doing it,\u201d he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just went totally cold,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.\u201d</p> <p>Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2015/12/actors-wont-watch-their-movies-tv-shows\">and others</a>, so Driver\u2019s reaction is not out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/12/the-real-reason-the-sound-of-your-own-voice-makes-you-cringe\">reasons for this are complicated</a> ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it\u2019s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why he left,\u201d Fresh Air\u2019s Miller told the Daily Beast. \u201cWe were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he\u2019s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn\u2019t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres.

      "bodyText": "Adam Driver really does not like to listen to the sound of his own voice. In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story. Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show\u2019s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air\u2019s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed to the Daily Beast. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work \u2013 he told Gross as much in a previous interview \u2013 and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,\u201d Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015. \u201cI\u2019ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then wish I could change it, but you can\u2019t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.\u201d A New Yorker piece from October touched on what they called Driver\u2019s \u201cphobia\u201d as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling. \u201cThat\u2019s when I was, like, I can\u2019t watch myself in things. I certainly can\u2019t watch this if we\u2019re going to continue doing it,\u201d he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d \u201cI just went totally cold,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.\u201d Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie and others, so Driver\u2019s reaction is not out of the ordinary. Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The reasons for this are complicated ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it\u2019s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why he left,\u201d Fresh Air\u2019s Miller told the Daily Beast. \u201cWe were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he\u2019s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn\u2019t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.\u201d Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Driver said: \u2018\u2018I just go into a room and wait with a guy in silence, and then I got to go back and sneak in and pretend like I was there the whole time. It always seems like a better alternative than watching all the mistakes that you\u2019re making that are now immortalised on film.\u2019\u2019 Driver is not alone in avoiding watching his own films. Julianne Moore once has said that \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of my movies\u201d. Reese Witherspoon says watching her own movies would make her \u201cspiral into a state of self-hate\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know who feels good looking at themselves.

More imperative was meeting the cutoff for Golden Globes voting. A not-quite-finished cut was shown to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, known for supporting razzle-dazzle musicals such as The Greatest Showman and Burlesque, but with dispiriting results: the effort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/09/golden-globes-2020-full-list-of-nominations\">yielded only one nomination</a>, for Taylor Swift\u2019s original song Beautiful Ghosts. Even that seemingly surefire Oscars bid was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/13/cats-premiere-golden-globes\">shot down this week</a>, as the Academy announced their shortlists for several categories: Swift\u2019s mournful ballad was nowhere to be seen among the 15 best song finalists, though the visual effects are still in contention.</p> \n<p>That those effects may be the film\u2019s best remaining shot at awards glory is somewhat ironic, considering what a point of contention they\u2019ve been. The images we saw back in the summer \u2013 to a global chorus of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/litter-ally-terrifying-is-cats-the-creepiest-film-of-the-year\">what-the-hell-is-that horror</a> and delight that made an instant and inexhaustible meme factory out of a two-minute trailer \u2013 were, apparently, not quite finished.</p> \n<p>The internet\u2019s gleefully aghast reaction didn\u2019t prompt the kind of studio panic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/12/the-new-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-is-a-giant-relief\">rethink and redesign</a> that we recently saw with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/30/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, but Hooper claims that some tweaking was done in response: \u201cThe visual effects [in the trailer] were at quite an early stage,\u201d he told Empire magazine. \u201cPossibly there were, in the extremity in some of the responses, some clues in how to keep evolving. When you watch the finished film, you\u2019ll see that some of the designs of the cats have moved on since then, and certainly our understanding of how to use the technology to make them work has gone up, too.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a17449fd26b7a74e307b66d45ad94c3e460cbae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a17449fd26b7a74e307b66d45ad94c3e460cbae/82_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Hudson in Cats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Hudson in Cats.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Working Title films/Amblin Entertainment</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If this is true, it may take eagle-eyed effects buffs to spot the exact evolution: a second trailer, released in November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/cats-new-trailer-the-most-disturbing-thing-ive-ever-seen\">didn\u2019t look appreciably different from the first</a>, though the shock impact of the human-cat hybrids\u2019 appearance was reduced with forewarning. (Ready or not from a technical perspective, Universal was wise to tease the film\u2019s look early and get us accustomed to its eccentricity.) And while the finished product is still under critical embargo for now, it\u2019s not incriminating to say that it delivers very much the spectacle that those fixated on the trailer are expecting: the technicians\u2019 many hours of painstaking work are nothing if not evident.</p> \n<p>Hooper is known in the industry for being exacting, but if he\u2019s been flustered by the film\u2019s scramble to the finish line, he\u2019s remained impassively cool in public \u2013 admitting casually on Monday\u2019s New York premiere that he\u2019d only locked the final cut at 8am the day before. He continues, moreover, to walk a fine line between deflecting the internet\u2019s bewilderment and humouring it. In response to a Variety reporter asking whether he was happy with Cats\u2019 finished look \u2013 not a question most directors would expect to be asked on the promotion trail, but a near-unavoidably salient one in this case \u2013 his answer was an expert PR play: having only officially finished the film 36 hours before, he was simply glad to be showing it at all. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here with it fully finished, and yeah, we\u2019ll let the audience decide, but it\u2019s come a long way since that first trailer.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s being left to the actors, it seems, to take a more defensive approach. \u201cI thought that reaction [to the trailer] was absolutely ludicrous,\u201d Ian McKellen fumed in an interview this week, going on to declare the finished film \u201can absolute classic\u201d. \u201cI can tell those doubters who\u2019ve only seen snippets of a trailer that they\u2019re absolutely wrong, and if they don\u2019t agree with me, then keep away.\u201d Hooper\u2019s more measured \u201clet the audience decide\u201d line is harder to argue with. Never a film made for critics, and with its awards-season hopes looking ever leaner, Cats will be counting on a vast, breathless public \u2013 one both uninformed of and uninterested in its production and scheduling complications \u2013 to make those sleepless nights worthwhile.</p>",

Even that seemingly surefire Oscars bid was shot down this week, as the Academy announced their shortlists for several categories: Swift\u2019s mournful ballad was nowhere to be seen among the 15 best song finalists, though the visual effects are still in contention. That those effects may be the film\u2019s best remaining shot at awards glory is somewhat ironic, considering what a point of contention they\u2019ve been. The images we saw back in the summer \u2013 to a global chorus of what-the-hell-is-that horror and delight that made an instant and inexhaustible meme factory out of a two-minute trailer \u2013 were, apparently, not quite finished. The internet\u2019s gleefully aghast reaction didn\u2019t prompt the kind of studio panic, rethink and redesign that we recently saw with Sonic the Hedgehog, but Hooper claims that some tweaking was done in response: \u201cThe visual effects [in the trailer] were at quite an early stage,\u201d he told Empire magazine. \u201cPossibly there were, in the extremity in some of the responses, some clues in how to keep evolving. When you watch the finished film, you\u2019ll see that some of the designs of the cats have moved on since then, and certainly our understanding of how to use the technology to make them work has gone up, too.\u201d If this is true, it may take eagle-eyed effects buffs to spot the exact evolution: a second trailer, released in November, didn\u2019t look appreciably different from the first, though the shock impact of the human-cat hybrids\u2019 appearance was reduced with forewarning. (Ready or not from a technical perspective, Universal was wise to tease the film\u2019s look early and get us accustomed to its eccentricity.) And while the finished product is still under critical embargo for now, it\u2019s not incriminating to say that it delivers very much the spectacle that those fixated on the trailer are expecting: the technicians\u2019 many hours of painstaking work are nothing if not evident. Hooper is known in the industry for being exacting, but if he\u2019s been flustered by the film\u2019s scramble to the finish line, he\u2019s remained impassively cool in public \u2013 admitting casually on Monday\u2019s New York premiere that he\u2019d only locked the final cut at 8am the day before. He continues, moreover, to walk a fine line between deflecting the internet\u2019s bewilderment and humouring it. In response to a Variety reporter asking whether he was happy with Cats\u2019 finished look \u2013 not a question most directors would expect to be asked on the promotion trail, but a near-unavoidably salient one in this case \u2013 his answer was an expert PR play: having only officially finished the film 36 hours before, he was simply glad to be showing it at all. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here with it fully finished, and yeah, we\u2019ll let the audience decide, but it\u2019s come a long way since that first trailer.\u201d It\u2019s being left to the actors, it seems, to take a more defensive approach. \u201cI thought that reaction [to the trailer] was absolutely ludicrous,\u201d Ian McKellen fumed in an interview this week, going on to declare the finished film \u201can absolute classic\u201d. \u201cI can tell those doubters who\u2019ve only seen snippets of a trailer that they\u2019re absolutely wrong, and if they don\u2019t agree with me, then keep away.\u201d Hooper\u2019s more measured \u201clet the audience decide\u201d line is harder to argue with. Never a film made for critics, and with its awards-season hopes looking ever leaner, Cats will be counting on a vast, breathless public \u2013 one both uninformed of and uninterested in its production and scheduling complications \u2013 to make those sleepless nights worthwhile.",

Our pricing strategy was vague at best. We generally plumped for \u00a31 for a paperback, \u00a32 for a hardback and \u00a34 for a coffee-table book or anything by Dickens. People always want Dickens, so we figured we may as well leave a little room for negotiation with the tough customers desperate for another copy of Oliver Twist.</p> <p>As we were hunting through a pile of books about wild falcons on our first morning, we turned around and suddenly the shop was full, with a family of American Baptists asking where the religious section was. Before we knew it, they were explaining how we were destined for eternity in hell. We sold them a dusty old book about God\u2019s suffering in exchange for \u00a31 and a prayer card explaining exactly what we needed to do to recognise Jesus as our lord and saviour.</p> <p>Because we were there during the winter season, the customers were few and far between, but always memorable. An old chap arrived just before we were about to close, who took a real interest in the old 1970s Playboy annual we had in stock. He proceeded to tell us \u2013 at length \u2013 about the differing aesthetics of Playboy and Penthouse models throughout each magazine\u2019s history. Forty minutes later, when we were just about losing the will to live, he left, having bought nothing.</p> <p>The name on everyone\u2019s lips, though, was Shaun Bythell. Owner of the town\u2019s largest bookshop, Shaun wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/22/diary-of-bookseller-shaun-bythell-review\">The Diary of a Bookseller</a>, the book that introduced me \u2013 as well as many others \u2013 to Wigtown. Referred to as the \u201cKing of Wigtown\u201d by other residents, he really seemed to be at the centre of everything that goes on there. We popped into his shop a few times over the week, but he always seemed to be out, which was a shame. As soon as I saw a Kindle mounted on the wall which had been blasted with a shotgun, I knew we\u2019d have got along.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"077ab3873a4646ffc5f75d6fd53f0c41195f0265\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077ab3873a4646ffc5f75d6fd53f0c41195f0265/0_36_1173_704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shaun Bythell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The king \u2026 Shaun Bythell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline McQuistin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Open Book is actually the brainchild of Shaun\u2019s ex-partner Jessica Fox. Fox is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/12/jessica-fox-bookshop-wigtown-scotland\">author of Three Things You Need to Know About Rockets</a>, a book about her move from LA, where she worked for Nasa, to Wigtown, where she came following her dream of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/12/jessica-fox-bookshop-wigtown-scotland\">running a bookshop and promptly fell in love with Shaun</a>. The pair are no longer together, but still get on really well, I was assured by literally every person I met. There\u2019s no sense of privacy in Wigtown, but I can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s a great story that, needless to say, has been optioned for a film.</p> <p>If we weren\u2019t being entertained by the customers, it was the other booksellers, who welcomed us like old friends. We became as much of a tourist attraction for the locals as the place was for us, and the conversations we had were worlds away from those back home. Nobody cared what our jobs were \u2013 they were more interested in what had brought us here. </p> <p>Our time in the bookshop was not an economic triumph. We probably bought more books than we sold, but it didn\u2019t matter. For me, as for so many others, the idea has been a long-held retirement plan. With high streets in ever increasing trouble, that plan has become more of a ridiculous dream. To be able to live it for a week was an undiluted pleasure, reminding me yet again of the need for bookshops in local communities. I feel like I left a part of myself in Wigtown and am already counting down the days until my next visit \u2026 even if I have to wait until 2023.</p>",

We sold them a dusty old book about God\u2019s suffering in exchange for \u00a31 and a prayer card explaining exactly what we needed to do to recognise Jesus as our lord and saviour. Because we were there during the winter season, the customers were few and far between, but always memorable. An old chap arrived just before we were about to close, who took a real interest in the old 1970s Playboy annual we had in stock. He proceeded to tell us \u2013 at length \u2013 about the differing aesthetics of Playboy and Penthouse models throughout each magazine\u2019s history. Forty minutes later, when we were just about losing the will to live, he left, having bought nothing. The name on everyone\u2019s lips, though, was Shaun Bythell. Owner of the town\u2019s largest bookshop, Shaun wrote The Diary of a Bookseller, the book that introduced me \u2013 as well as many others \u2013 to Wigtown. Referred to as the \u201cKing of Wigtown\u201d by other residents, he really seemed to be at the centre of everything that goes on there. We popped into his shop a few times over the week, but he always seemed to be out, which was a shame. As soon as I saw a Kindle mounted on the wall which had been blasted with a shotgun, I knew we\u2019d have got along. The Open Book is actually the brainchild of Shaun\u2019s ex-partner Jessica Fox. Fox is the author of Three Things You Need to Know About Rockets, a book about her move from LA, where she worked for Nasa, to Wigtown, where she came following her dream of running a bookshop and promptly fell in love with Shaun. The pair are no longer together, but still get on really well, I was assured by literally every person I met. There\u2019s no sense of privacy in Wigtown, but I can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s a great story that, needless to say, has been optioned for a film. If we weren\u2019t being entertained by the customers, it was the other booksellers, who welcomed us like old friends. We became as much of a tourist attraction for the locals as the place was for us, and the conversations we had were worlds away from those back home. Nobody cared what our jobs were \u2013 they were more interested in what had brought us here. Our time in the bookshop was not an economic triumph. We probably bought more books than we sold, but it didn\u2019t matter. For me, as for so many others, the idea has been a long-held retirement plan. With high streets in ever increasing trouble, that plan has become more of a ridiculous dream. To be able to live it for a week was an undiluted pleasure, reminding me yet again of the need for bookshops in local communities. I feel like I left a part of myself in Wigtown and am already counting down the days until my next visit \u2026 even if I have to wait until 2023.",

If they were three times higher, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Internet claims that vegans do not need extra B12 were not evidence-based, he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that many people think it is a myth,\u201d said Sanders. Gorillas eat a vegan diet, but B12 is produced in the colon and \u201cthey probably don\u2019t wash their hands\u201d, he said, so end up ingesting it. The Jains in India eat a vegan diet, but, he said, \u201call the Jain doctors I know have B12 injections\u201d.</p> <p>Studies have shown that B12 levels in vegans are about a third of what is needed. Other aspects of the vegan diet are healthy but, said Sanders, \u201cB12 is the one thing we are concerned about\u201d. There is particular worry about children. In one case, a baby who was breastfed by a mother who was B12 deficient ended up with neuropathy.</p> <p>Sanders and Tim Key, professor of epidemiology and deputy director of the Cancer Epidemiology unit at Oxford University, have both researched the health of those who eat a vegan diet for many years. Key is himself a vegan \u2013 and takes vitamin B12 tablets regularly.</p> <p>Key said there was limited data available. The Epic study based at Oxford follows about 2,000 people. Together with a study in California, there is data on about 10,000 people in total. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. We don\u2019t have precise estimates of long term health in vegans,\u201d said Key.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/01/cutting-out-cows-milk-iodine-intake\">Cutting out cows' milk?

      "bodyText": "A vegan diet is generally healthy, low in cholesterol and protective of heart disease, but its followers must take vitamin B12 supplements or risk a condition that causes permanent numbness in their hands and feet, experts say. Most people get their vitamin B12 from milk, but the plant-based substitutes do not have high enough levels to protect adults and children from peripheral neuropathy, which is irreversible. Young festival-goers on a vegan diet may be at particular risk. \u201cKids these days inhale laughing gas,\u201d said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThat can actively cause vitamin B12 deficiency. There is a danger of young people going vegan, not having B12 and it could tip the balance to them getting a serious neuropathy.\u201d It could easily be remedied by the manufacturers of plant-based milks, he said. \u201cLevels should be higher in plant milks than they are at the moment. If they were three times higher, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Internet claims that vegans do not need extra B12 were not evidence-based, he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that many people think it is a myth,\u201d said Sanders. Gorillas eat a vegan diet, but B12 is produced in the colon and \u201cthey probably don\u2019t wash their hands\u201d, he said, so end up ingesting it. The Jains in India eat a vegan diet, but, he said, \u201call the Jain doctors I know have B12 injections\u201d. Studies have shown that B12 levels in vegans are about a third of what is needed. Other aspects of the vegan diet are healthy but, said Sanders, \u201cB12 is the one thing we are concerned about\u201d. There is particular worry about children. In one case, a baby who was breastfed by a mother who was B12 deficient ended up with neuropathy. Sanders and Tim Key, professor of epidemiology and deputy director of the Cancer Epidemiology unit at Oxford University, have both researched the health of those who eat a vegan diet for many years. Key is himself a vegan \u2013 and takes vitamin B12 tablets regularly. Key said there was limited data available. The Epic study based at Oxford follows about 2,000 people. Together with a study in California, there is data on about 10,000 people in total. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. We don\u2019t have precise estimates of long term health in vegans,\u201d said Key. But what they have been able to observe so far is that people eating vegan diets tend not to be overweight \u2013 if anything, some are very thin and may have problems in older age when weight loss becomes an issue. They have low rates of type 2 diabetes and diverticular disease of the colon. They have low cholesterol and low rates of heart disease and they may have lower cancer rates. However, bone fractures are about 30% higher as a result of lower bone density. \u201cThat might have something to do with calcium and possibly even B12,\u201d said Key. They may also have higher rates of hemorrhagic stroke. A vegan diet that is high in fruit and vegetables and pulses is likely to be healthy, but vegans can still overdo the biscuits, confectionery, cakes, chips and beer, said the scientists, and some meat substitutes, such as vegan sausages, are high in salt. So far, there is no evidence that vegans live longer. \u201cThere is no significant difference in total mortality between vegans and meat eaters,\u201d said Key.",

Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

The Democrat Jamie Raskin, a constitutional scholar and member of the judiciary committee, laid out the majority\u2019s case in stark terms, calling Trump\u2019s obstruction \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdangerously unconstitutional\u201d. \u201cIf accepted and normalized now,\u201d Raskin said, \u201cit will undermine perhaps for all time the congressional impeachment power itself, which is the people\u2019s last instrument of constitutional self-defense against a sitting president who behaves like a king and tramples the rule of law.\u201d Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, said it was a \u201csad day\u201d for the country and accused Democrats of trying to interfere in the 2020 election by removing Trump from office. In the Senate, Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell vowed to carry forward Trump\u2019s defense, indicating he would oppose Democratic attempts to secure testimony from potentially key witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were blocked by the Trump administration from testifying before the House. Williams, the former justice department official, said this impeachment would be remembered not only for Trump\u2019s historic wrongdoing but for the Republicans\u2019 historic forfeiture of their civic duty. \u201cMembers of Congress swear an oath not to their constituents, but to the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are failing in their core responsibility when they are willing to sell that oath out simply because of the likelihood that the president will put out a nasty tweet about them if they step out of line.\u201d",

The art dealer John Brandler bought the Banksy from Ian Lewis, a steelworker who owned the garage and thus the artwork, for a six-figure sum and promised it would stay in Port Talbot for at least three years. In May, the 4.5-tonne Banksy was carefully moved to the former police station and earlier this week Neath Port Talbot council issued a modest press release announcing that for three days this week, the Banksy would be open to the public from 11am-3pm. Nigel Hunt, a Plaid Cymru councillor, said he was frustrated at how some on the Labour-controlled council had failed to make the most of the Banksy. \u201cSome of them are like characters from Charles Dickens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the global spotlight on us. This is a modern masterpiece and Banksy chose us to be part of the narrative. So much more could have been done.\u201d It is not too late: the council is still hoping to access funds to create a gallery around the work. Councillor Annette Wingrave, the cabinet member for regeneration, said progress was being made. \u201cWe have been working hard with other agencies to come up with ideas for a permanent display,\u201d she said. \u201cWith security, staffing and other costs, the council cannot do this alone but it is hoped that working with others, we can come up with a solution.\u201d",

In 2016 GQ magazine declared the original to be the worst song of all time, 2:D - Sheeran was at number one with Perfect, and his guest appearance with Eminem was a new entry in the charts that week at number two. Perfect, 3:C - Bailey was No 1 with Skyscraper in 2013 having won the TV show, 4:D - Rockabye stayed at No 1 for Christmas day having already topped the charts for the previous six weeks. Consistent., 5:A - The Spice Girls hogged the top spot in 96, 97 and 98 with 2 Become 1, Too Much and Goodbye respectively, 6:A - With a minimum amount of effort, the novelty single was simply given the same name as the 'hilarious' mischievous character. The 90s were weird like this to be honest, 7:B - Band Aid II topped the charts five years after the original had. Band Aid 20 repeated the feat in 2004. All of them somewhat patronisingly asking whether a continent that contains over 600 million Christians would know whether it was Christmas or not., 8:D - A Facebook campaign designed to prevent a fifth consecutive Christmas number one being the product of the X Factor TV show demonstrated that fuck you, the British people won't do what you tell them. Unless you tell them on Facebook to all buy the same song at Christmas, in which case we are down with that, 9:B - Ward was No 1 in 2005 with That's My Goal. Lewis, Jackon and Burke all topped the Christmas charts in the late noughties as well, 10:D - Last Christmas only reached number two - outsold by Band Aid's Do They Know Its Christmas, which the band also appeared on, 11:C - Yes it was the oddball science fiction psychological thriller with a big rabbit in it that spawned a Christmas No 1, 12:B - Three of these artists had Christmas No 1s this decade. Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir topped the charts with A Bridge Over You in 2015. Military Wives with Gareth Malone were top in 2011 with Wherever You Are, and the Justice Collective took He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother to No 1 in 2012. St Winifred's School Choir topped the chart way back in 1980, 13:A - That's him. They definitely like a particular type on X Factor, don't they?, 14:C - Well done, this is Matt, 15:D - It was a fab four for the Fab Four. I Want To Hold Your Hand, I Feel Fine, Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out and Hello Goodbye were all festive number ones for the band. Paul McCartney also had a Christmas number one with Wings in the shape of Mull of Kintyre, 16:C - Their cover of Somethin' Stupid was top spot in 2001, 17:A - Slade were the winners. Merry Xmas Everybody was No 1 at Christmas, while I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day stalled at number four, 18:B - It is Joan Jett who is the victim this year. Well her, and 70s rock band The Arrows who originally wrote and recorded it. And I guess Britney Spears, who also had a hit with it. LadBaby's version is all for a good cause though, so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"4\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Tried hard but could do better.

But a survey by StubHub has recently revealed that 95% of the British public cannot name a single Christmas No 1 from this decade. Can you believe that? We couldn\u2019t, and we were sure that Guardian readers would have their finger on the pulse of popular culture, and would prove this wrong. So have a crack at our quiz, on Christmas No 1s through the years. Remember, there are no prizes, it\u2019s just for fun. Let us know in the comments how brilliantly you\u2019ve got on.

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

Ilhan Omar and three of her colleagues in the House of Representatives called on Jim Jeffrey to provide a full briefing \u2013 in private if necessary \u2013 into whether it believes the incident during the Turkish invasion two months ago amounts to a war crime. They wrote: \u201cThe United States is uniquely positioned as a Nato ally of Turkey and a partner of the Syrian Kurds, who are the alleged victims of this attack, to take a lead on a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding [it].\u201d Pictures emerged at the time of Syrian children who had been seriously burned, prompting accusations that they had been targeted by Turkish forces using white phosphorus in or around the border town of Ras al-Ayn. White phosphorus is routinely held by militaries around the world and is used legally in combat as a smokescreen in daytime and as an incendiary to light up an area at night. But it is illegal to use it against civilians because it causes serious and exceptionally painful burns on contact with skin. Inspectors at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) initially said they were \u201ccollecting information\u201d on the incident, but subsequently concluded it would \u201cnot initiate an investigation\u201d. The OPCW said the case fell out of its remit because the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon was intended to exploit its thermal properties and not its chemical properties. The four members of Congress say that the situation has become \u201ca matter of urgency\u201d and called for tissue samples from the alleged victims, which they say are being held in Iraq, be studied so \u201cthe United States and the international community can have the full evidence\u201d. They also ask Jeffrey to spell out what the US state department\u2019s position would be \u201cin the event it is proven that Turkey used white phosphorus against civilians\u201d, whether it would \u201ccommit to a full, impartial and multilateral investigation into the allegations of chemical weapons use by Turkey in Syria\u201d and \u201cfull accountability for the perpetrators of the attack\u201d.

His rise, on the classless elevator of the Egyptian armed forces, was entirely the result of his competence in the military. Cairo intellectuals disliked his backslapping air-force bonhomie and quickly dubbed him \u201c<em>La vache qui rit</em>\u201d, after the laughing cow on the French processed cheese to whom the president was said to bear a resemblance.</p> <p>For two decades Mubarak provided Egypt with a plodding yet stable government, which many compared favourably with the attention-seeking antics of his predecessors Nasser and Sadat. It should not be forgotten that his ministers were corrupt, his police casually and strikingly brutal, and torture in Egyptian prisons was rife. Yet his regime was still better than its counterparts in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\" title=\"\">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</a>, who ultimately replaced Mubarak in 2013 after toppling the shortlived <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood </a>government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, celebrated his accession to power by presiding over the worst massacre in a major world capital since Tiananmen Square: outside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/rabaa-massacre-egypt-human-rights-watch\" title=\"\">Rabaa mosque in Cairo</a>, more than 800 protesters were gunned down by army snipers, while many more were \u201cdisappeared\u201d or done to death in prison: in one case, 37 prisoners died of asphyxiation in a single incident while being transported in a police truck. The entire Muslim Brotherhood opposition was put on show trial, in cages, and locked away for life under martial law. The press was subverted and civil society either jailed or crushed. It was a huge backward step.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac7c7183b51b8002db39401a5a3259b52c79e063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac7c7183b51b8002db39401a5a3259b52c79e063/0_284_2550_3184/801.jpg\" alt=\"Akhenaton with Aten, the Egyptian sun god.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akhenaton with Aten, the Egyptian sun god.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So bad has Sisi\u2019s crackdown been on liberals, writers and journalists that relatively few insiders have dared to write factual accounts of the failed revolution, though there has been some brilliant fiction, notably Omar Robert Hamilton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/04/city-always-wins-omar-robert-hamilton\" title=\"\"><em>The City Always Wins</em></a>. But Egypt\u2019s tragedy has now found a non-fiction writer equal to the task in Peter Hessler, the author of four brilliant books on China, and the New Yorker staff writer assigned to cover the revolution.</p> <p>Hessler is a skilled practitioner of what might be called \u201cslow journalism\u201d. He focuses not on the splashy events of capital cities, but instead on the ordinary lives lived far from the centre of things, as if he were transposing to the Middle East Turgenev\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jun/21/ivan-turgenev-brief-survey-short-story\" title=\"\"><em>Sketches from a Huntsman\u2019s Album</em></a>. He makes friends with people whose ways of living are undergoing rapid and often uncomfortable change, and writes about them with intelligence and sympathy. What separates him from most other foreign correspondents is a strange alchemy in his writing and storytelling that gives him an ability to spin golden prose from everyday lived experience.</p> <p>In <em>The Buried</em>, we meet Manu, his gay translator who is set up and entrapped by a police provocateur, then arrested and threatened with anal examinations. In the growing upheaval of the fraying revolution he is repeatedly beaten up, suffers panic attacks and eventually flees Egypt, seeking political asylum in Germany.</p> <p>We meet Sayyid the garbage collector, who makes a good living sorting and recycling the rubbish from middle-class flats. His is a unique insight into Cairene life derived from searching through bin bags: documents, cameras and photos all unlock the secrets of the people he works for, and through his eyes we meet everyone from Muslim Brothers disposing of their stashes of Auld Stag Whisky, Coptic priests with aphrodisiacs and Lebanese actresses with inexhaustible supplies of intimate lube. We also meet a cast of exiled Chinese businessmen starting Egypt\u2019s first plastic recycling plant and creating a lingerie empire by bringing Guangzhou\u2019s answer to Victoria\u2019s Secret to the niqab-wearing women of Upper Egypt.</p> <p>Hessler wrote about many of these characters first in his New Yorker columns, but this book amounts to far more than a collection of cuttings. For he has bound the book together by the clever conceit of weaving and intertwining it with the deeper and broader rhythms of Egyptian history and cosmology. There are, he explains at the start, two very different concepts of time in ancient Egyptian thought: \u201c<em>Neheh</em> is the time of cycles. It is associated with the movement of the Sun, the passage of the seasons and the annual flood of the Nile.

      "bodyText": "Of all the ill-fated revolutions of the Arab spring, none started more optimistically, or ended more disappointingly, than that of Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown with such rejoicing at the beginning of the revolution in 2011, was perhaps not the worst of the Arab dictators. His rise, on the classless elevator of the Egyptian armed forces, was entirely the result of his competence in the military. Cairo intellectuals disliked his backslapping air-force bonhomie and quickly dubbed him \u201cLa vache qui rit\u201d, after the laughing cow on the French processed cheese to whom the president was said to bear a resemblance. For two decades Mubarak provided Egypt with a plodding yet stable government, which many compared favourably with the attention-seeking antics of his predecessors Nasser and Sadat. It should not be forgotten that his ministers were corrupt, his police casually and strikingly brutal, and torture in Egyptian prisons was rife. Yet his regime was still better than its counterparts in Syria and Iraq. Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who ultimately replaced Mubarak in 2013 after toppling the shortlived Muslim Brotherhood government of Mohamed Morsi, celebrated his accession to power by presiding over the worst massacre in a major world capital since Tiananmen Square: outside the Rabaa mosque in Cairo, more than 800 protesters were gunned down by army snipers, while many more were \u201cdisappeared\u201d or done to death in prison: in one case, 37 prisoners died of asphyxiation in a single incident while being transported in a police truck. The entire Muslim Brotherhood opposition was put on show trial, in cages, and locked away for life under martial law. The press was subverted and civil society either jailed or crushed. It was a huge backward step. So bad has Sisi\u2019s crackdown been on liberals, writers and journalists that relatively few insiders have dared to write factual accounts of the failed revolution, though there has been some brilliant fiction, notably Omar Robert Hamilton\u2019s The City Always Wins. But Egypt\u2019s tragedy has now found a non-fiction writer equal to the task in Peter Hessler, the author of four brilliant books on China, and the New Yorker staff writer assigned to cover the revolution. Hessler is a skilled practitioner of what might be called \u201cslow journalism\u201d. He focuses not on the splashy events of capital cities, but instead on the ordinary lives lived far from the centre of things, as if he were transposing to the Middle East Turgenev\u2019s Sketches from a Huntsman\u2019s Album. He makes friends with people whose ways of living are undergoing rapid and often uncomfortable change, and writes about them with intelligence and sympathy. What separates him from most other foreign correspondents is a strange alchemy in his writing and storytelling that gives him an ability to spin golden prose from everyday lived experience. In The Buried, we meet Manu, his gay translator who is set up and entrapped by a police provocateur, then arrested and threatened with anal examinations. In the growing upheaval of the fraying revolution he is repeatedly beaten up, suffers panic attacks and eventually flees Egypt, seeking political asylum in Germany. We meet Sayyid the garbage collector, who makes a good living sorting and recycling the rubbish from middle-class flats. His is a unique insight into Cairene life derived from searching through bin bags: documents, cameras and photos all unlock the secrets of the people he works for, and through his eyes we meet everyone from Muslim Brothers disposing of their stashes of Auld Stag Whisky, Coptic priests with aphrodisiacs and Lebanese actresses with inexhaustible supplies of intimate lube. We also meet a cast of exiled Chinese businessmen starting Egypt\u2019s first plastic recycling plant and creating a lingerie empire by bringing Guangzhou\u2019s answer to Victoria\u2019s Secret to the niqab-wearing women of Upper Egypt. Hessler wrote about many of these characters first in his New Yorker columns, but this book amounts to far more than a collection of cuttings. For he has bound the book together by the clever conceit of weaving and intertwining it with the deeper and broader rhythms of Egyptian history and cosmology. There are, he explains at the start, two very different concepts of time in ancient Egyptian thought: \u201cNeheh is the time of cycles. It is associated with the movement of the Sun, the passage of the seasons and the annual flood of the Nile. It repeats; it recurs; it renews. Djet on the other hand, is time without motion \u2026 The term is sometimes translated as \u2018eternal\u2019, but it also describes a state of completion. Something in djet time is finished but not past; it exists forever in the present \u2026 Neheh was inspired by the cycles of the river valleys, while djet reflected the desert\u2019s timelessness.\u201d In this scheme, the fall of Mubarak, the chaos of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the restoration of authoritarian rule under Sisi also follow rhythms familiar to Egyptian history. Hessler sees a mirror in the story of the pharoah Akhenaten \u2013 a failed revolutionary whose attempt to introduce monotheism was crushed in \u201cwhat was possibly the first military coup in human history\u201d by his general Horemheb, and whose tyranny was consolidated by Horemheb\u2019s successor Ramesses II. As the archaeologist Anna Stevens points out when she takes Hessler round Akhenaten\u2019s citadel of Amarna the very same month that Sisi was massacring the opposition, \u201cliving through this time has made me think much more about Akhenaten, and the impact of revolutions and the downfall of dictators. I\u2019m struck by this interest in a strong, male leader.\u201d Even the gross inequalities of modern Egypt are mirrored by the malnourished skeletons of the ancient workers of Amarna. Akhenaten\u2019s son Tutankhamun may have been buried in solid gold inlaid with imported Afghan lapis, but the workers who built his dynastic cities had short, impoverished lives: \u201cSeventy per cent of individuals were younger than 35. More than one third were dead by the age of 15. Only a few individuals lived beyond 50.\u201d The Buried is a slow burner: it takes time and patience to enter its world, fall in with its rhythms and to distinguish its cast of initially unremarkable Egyptian characters.

As a musician, Lynch was one of the country\u2019s first black pop stars, touring with the Beatles and scoring two Top 10 hits, among them Up on the Roof \u2013 originally recorded by the Drifters \u2013 which was released in 1963. He also wrote the theme music for 1978\u2019s Carry on Emmanuelle, Love Crazy.

Broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/danny-baker\">Danny Baker</a> described him as \u201cone of the key witnesses to the 20th [century] UK music/entertainment scene [who] had a million stories\u201d, while Culture Club singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/boy-george\">Boy George</a> described him as \u201c[an] absolutely huge part of my 70s life\u201d. Broadcaster Samira Ahmed called Lynch a \u201chugely important &amp; stylish figure in British culture \u2026 proving to kids like me that we belonged\u201d.</p> <p>In a video interview with the digital project <a href=\"https://www.1000londoners.com/\">1,000 Londoners</a> last year, Lynch spoke about his family and early childhood, growing up at the beginning of the second world war. Lynch noted that they \u201cnever had racial problems with people in Cornwall Street, because basically we were probably a novelty \u2026 people would say \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got some black people living next door to us; you should come around and see them \u2013 they\u2019re almost the same as us\u2019\u201d. He would later become one of a small number of black artists to achieve pop fame in the 60s.</p> <p>More recently, Lynch toured with Jimmy Tarbuck as a comedian and variety performer, and appeared on the ITV show Last Laugh in Vegas in 2018, alongside Hi-de-Hi!\u2019s Su Pollard and Carry On actor Anita Harris. Lynch is survived by his two daughters, Amy and Bobby.</p>",

Born in Stepney, east London, in 1938, to a Barbadian father and a mother of British and Jamaican heritage, Lynch was a pioneer for black representation in the UK\u2019s entertainment industry. As a musician, Lynch was one of the country\u2019s first black pop stars, touring with the Beatles and scoring two Top 10 hits, among them Up on the Roof \u2013 originally recorded by the Drifters \u2013 which was released in 1963. He also wrote the theme music for 1978\u2019s Carry on Emmanuelle, Love Crazy. His TV career included roles and appearance on programmes such as Z-Cars, Celebrity Squares and Bullseye. Tributes have been paid to Lynch on social media. Broadcaster Danny Baker described him as \u201cone of the key witnesses to the 20th [century] UK music/entertainment scene [who] had a million stories\u201d, while Culture Club singer Boy George described him as \u201c[an] absolutely huge part of my 70s life\u201d. Broadcaster Samira Ahmed called Lynch a \u201chugely important &amp; stylish figure in British culture \u2026 proving to kids like me that we belonged\u201d. In a video interview with the digital project 1,000 Londoners last year, Lynch spoke about his family and early childhood, growing up at the beginning of the second world war. Lynch noted that they \u201cnever had racial problems with people in Cornwall Street, because basically we were probably a novelty \u2026 people would say \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got some black people living next door to us; you should come around and see them \u2013 they\u2019re almost the same as us\u2019\u201d. He would later become one of a small number of black artists to achieve pop fame in the 60s. More recently, Lynch toured with Jimmy Tarbuck as a comedian and variety performer, and appeared on the ITV show Last Laugh in Vegas in 2018, alongside Hi-de-Hi!\u2019s Su Pollard and Carry On actor Anita Harris. Lynch is survived by his two daughters, Amy and Bobby.",

      "bodyText": "Authorities have imposed an emergency law banning large gatherings in parts of India\u2019s capital, Delhi, as nationwide protests escalated, injuring police and demonstrators. A week after a controversial new citizenship law was passed by parliament, which has been accused of openly discriminating against Muslims, protests across the country showed no sign of abating. Clashes between demonstrators and police in the Seelampur district of Delhi turned violent on Tuesday, with 21 injured and buses and a police outpost set alight, leading police to bring in emergency measures to prevent the gathering of more than four people in certain Muslim-dominated areas of the city. Under the new legislation, tens of thousands of Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be allowed to claim Indian citizenship. The same will not apply for Muslims, who the BJP government argues are not a threatened minority in these countries. Some of the most violent altercations between protesters and police over the past week have occurred on Muslim-majority university campuses, where students who were marching against the citizenship law were met with police brutality. Harsh Mander, a prominent human rights activist, said he would be filing an official complaint of serious police atrocities over officers\u2019 actions at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. Police violently stormed the campus, firing teargas and detaining dozens of Muslim students. Speaking to the Guardian, Mander said multiple students and teachers recounted how the police had used Islamophobic slurs and taunts at the Muslim students as they beat them with batons, including calling them \u201ckhatana\u201d, which means circumcised, and shouting the Hindu nationalist slogan \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d, meaning Hail Lord Ram, a Hindu God.

It followed reports of \u201cbarbaric\u201d violence against students at the Muslim-majority Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi on Sunday, where dozens were injured, including one student who lost an eye after being hit with a teargas canister.

Sky News \u2013 27 September 2018 3,463 viewers alleged bias and defamation of character in the editing of an interview with Robinson. 5. The X Factor, ITV \u2013 11 December 2010 2,868 complaints that performances by Rihanna and Christina Aguilera were too explicit for broadcast before the 9pm watershed. 6. Channel 4 News, Channel 4 \u2013 29 March 2019 2,717 complaints when Snow said, following a day of rallies and protests relating to Brexit, that he had \u201cnever seen so many white people in one place\u201d. 7. Love Island, ITV2 \u2013 1 July 2018 2,644 viewers raised concerns about emotional distress to contestants, specifically Dani Dyer, after a clip was shown to her of her then boyfriend, Jack Fincham, with his former partner. 8.

      "body": "<p>The health secretary has denied the government is being forced to clear up its own mistakes by announcing a partial reintroduction of bursary grants for student nurses, which the Conservatives abolished in 2016.</p> <p>In the first major speech by a cabinet minister since last week\u2019s election, Matt Hancock said the annual grants of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000 would play a key part in the government\u2019s promise of having 50,000 extra nurses in place within five years.</p> <p>Repeating Conservative pledges to also to bring in 6,000 more GPs, 50m more GP appointments and 40 new hospitals, Hancock said the government would \u201cdeliver on these and each and every commitment in our manifesto\u201d.</p> <p>But answering questions following his speech to a thinktank in Westminster, Hancock declined to say whether there would be any repercussions if these targets were not met, for example ministers resigning, saying only that he was \u201cabsolutely committed to delivering\u201d the numbers.</p> <p>The announcement of the nursing student grants, made overnight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/26/nhs-short-of-70000-nurses-bursaries-abolished\">follows repeated warnings</a> about drops in the number of would-be nurses since the Conservatives abolished the existing bursary system, also making student nurses pay tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year.</p> <p>But Hancock denied the plan was an admission of error in abolishing the bursaries: \u201cThis training grant is different to the offer previously. It is more targeted, and in the last few years, when it hasn\u2019t been in place, we have seen the number of nurses increase by 5,000 in the last year.

      "bodyText": "The health secretary has denied the government is being forced to clear up its own mistakes by announcing a partial reintroduction of bursary grants for student nurses, which the Conservatives abolished in 2016. In the first major speech by a cabinet minister since last week\u2019s election, Matt Hancock said the annual grants of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000 would play a key part in the government\u2019s promise of having 50,000 extra nurses in place within five years. Repeating Conservative pledges to also to bring in 6,000 more GPs, 50m more GP appointments and 40 new hospitals, Hancock said the government would \u201cdeliver on these and each and every commitment in our manifesto\u201d. But answering questions following his speech to a thinktank in Westminster, Hancock declined to say whether there would be any repercussions if these targets were not met, for example ministers resigning, saying only that he was \u201cabsolutely committed to delivering\u201d the numbers. The announcement of the nursing student grants, made overnight, follows repeated warnings about drops in the number of would-be nurses since the Conservatives abolished the existing bursary system, also making student nurses pay tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year. But Hancock denied the plan was an admission of error in abolishing the bursaries: \u201cThis training grant is different to the offer previously. It is more targeted, and in the last few years, when it hasn\u2019t been in place, we have seen the number of nurses increase by 5,000 in the last year. That is good but 5,000 a year is about half the rate we need to be at to be reaching 50,000.\u201d In his speech, Hancock also promised a major advertising campaign to encourage more people to become student nurses, and to increase the number of places for nursing apprentices, as another route into the profession. He said the announcement of the new grants had been rushed through ahead of the 15 January deadline for university applications, so people could think over Christmas about taking a nursing courses. The money, which begins in September 2020, would also be available for those part-way through courses, he added. Hancock said the planned increase in nursing staff would form part of a wider revamp of the NHS based on better preventative health, and improved working culture, more use of technology and investment in infrastructure. He said: \u201cI am absolutely determined to meet the commitments that we have made, and to make sure that we repay the trust that has been put in us by delivering on the promises that we\u2019ve made and the commitments that we have to this nation\u2019s most-loved institution.\u201d There was, however, no new details on plans to revamp social care. Asked about this, Hancock: \u201cWe\u2019ve made very clear on social commitments in our manifesto, and we\u2019ve already been having discussions about starting that work.\u201d Responding to the overnight announcement of the new grants the Royal College of Nursing general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, welcomed it as \u201ca first victory for the campaign that our student nurses are running\u201d. \u201cThis announcement will hopefully encourage more people to apply to a nursing degree by the mid-January deadline,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the run-up to the budget, we continue to call for our students to not pay tuition fees up front.

      "bodyText": "Cabaret (1966) and Chicago (1975) became Broadway and West End perennials and prize-strewn movies for composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. But Curtains (2006) has struggled. Ebb died before completion and Rupert Holmes helped out, with Kander unusually writing some songs alone. There are three layers in the show. Admirers of Cabaret and Chicago may at first fear the worst, as the cast hoofs through a sub-Oklahoma chorus line relocating Robin Hood to the American midwest \u2013 a \u201ccowboy\u201d show both literally and in the sense of being substandard. This proves to be a musical within the musical, though: the show Robbin\u2019 Hood is flopping in Boston, when a murder occurs on stage. One of the best-ever Kander and Ebb numbers, The Woman\u2019s Dead \u2013 a furious fugue in which the creative team review their late colleague \u2013 triggers a sung-and-danced whodunnit. In a neat gag, homicide cop Frank Cioffi is a showbiz obsessive, keener to fix the problem with the finale ensemble than nail the perpetrator. The last level is a touching masterclass in memoir from Kander, Ebb and Holmes. Scores are settled \u2013 the cheeks of critics, directors, producers and actors will burn \u2013 and insights are shared. One show-within-the-show song is performed four times in different versions, as the team reworks it. Kander\u2019s solo song I Miss the Music poignantly describes a composer who has lost his lyricist. As Cioffi, Jason Manford, best known as a standup comic and TV host, has real musical charm and command. Rebecca Lock is funny and punchy as a producer unsure why serial killings should stop the show. The show\u2019s hilarious fictional director Christopher Belling, who always steals the credit, must here share it with real-life Curtains director Paul Foster, for giving audiences the missing link in Kander and Ebb\u2019s trilogy of \u201cC\u201d shows. Though not the equal of the other two, Curtains is a dazzling curiosity for musical theatre completists and smart, warm-hearted entertainment for all. At Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, until 11 January. Then touring.",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to the 2019 Fiver Christmas Awards. We lost count <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/19/the-fiver-christmas-awards-2018\">last year</a> of how many times we\u2019ve done this, so don\u2019t be expecting us to furnish you with a number now. All we know is, it\u2019s been too many. You know it too. But despite the grinding familiarity and futility of it all, we go again. It\u2019s a time-honoured festive tradition, see, like crackers, carols and crying. So here it is, merry Christmas, everybody\u2019s trudging on. Charge your glass with a generous shot of your cheapest aftershave, top it up with a little turps, dig out the packet of tablets you should have taken for your bad back a few months ago but decided to save for the holidays, and sink into a gorgeous haze of delight, the better to deal with the next few minutes of existence. Make sure to have a couple of rolls of that Regina Blitz to hand, just in case you wake up with a start in a puddle! Enjoy, enjoy.</p> <h2><strong>THE GRETA THUNBERG AWARD FOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR</strong></h2> <p>In the room the women come and go, talking of Megan Rapinoe. The USA! USA!! USA!!! captain gets things done on and off the park, whether winning the World Cup or virtually poking the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/megan-rapinoe-everything-trump-loves-except-we-are-powerful-women\">on the shoulder blade</a>, slowly, deliberately, repeatedly, until he snaps and makes an awful show of himself. Again. Six goals at the World Cup, a righteous fight for equality, and an innate ability to trigger paroxysms of impotent purple rage in <em>those</em> type of men.</p> <h2><strong>THE FIVER\u2019S BALLON D\u2019OH</strong></h2> <p>Most fair-minded folk had 2019 down as Virgil van Dijk\u2019s year, mainly because it\u2019s not often a defender proves to be such a transformative figure. Thing is, there have been times this year when his partner Jo\u00ebl Matip has outshone him. Also there have been a couple of games in which Degsy Lovren has been the man of the match too. So according to playground rules, that\u2019s three players just at one club who are better than actual Ballon d\u2019Or winner Lionel Messi. Two of them aren\u2019t even in the team right now! Oh Lionel. While we\u2019re on the subject of the most underwhelming greatest-ever player in history, CR7 is streets ahead too. Nations League, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/13/cristiano-ronaldo-superstar-era-international-record\">innit</a>. Yes we are doing this to deliberately annoy a certain section of our readership, but we\u2019re sure you\u2019d expect nothing less.</p> <h2><strong>THE GRAHAM POLL AWARD FOR BEST VAR DECISION</strong></h2> <p>No, we can\u2019t bring ourselves to do it. It\u2019s attention football\u2019s bureaucrats are after. We should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/28/james-milner-liverpool-interview-var-premier-league\">stop giving it to them</a>. Football\u2019s very own version of coitus interruptus, only more frustrating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>THE FINEFARE AWARD FOR BEST SUPERMARKET OWN-BRAND PRODUCT</strong></h2> <p>Alfredo \u2018Up Yours, Motherwell\u2019 Morelos fair racked up the numbers in 2019. He scored 38 goals, picked up 13 yellow cards, got himself sent off three times, missed one penalty and 174 chances in a cup final, and played a cumulative total of four and a half minutes in which he wasn\u2019t running around with an aggrieved look on his coupon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/the-fiver-alfredo-morelos-popes-newc-o-rangers\">searching out the nearest rammy</a>. We love him. Comparisons have been drawn to a certain fellow South American trailblazer, though by the time Luis Su\u00e1rez was Morelos\u2019 age, he\u2019d already got a controversial World Cup handball and his first biting incident to his name. Still, the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers man is only 23, so there\u2019s plenty of time to develop his act.</p> <h2><strong>THE ANDY GRAY AWARD FOR MOST DISINGENUOUS COMMENTARY</strong></h2> <p>Gary Neville wins this for his reaction upon witnessing Vincent Kompany lashing one in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/06/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">from 90 yards against Leicester</a>. His strange yelp of pseudo delight registered 9.6 on Gray\u2019s patented YaBeauty-o-Meter, though to be fair the United legend was caught between a rock and a hard place given City were battling with Liverpool for the title. And at the end of the day, a confected reaction is better than none at all, as anyone who heard Steve McManaman and Jermaine Jenas drone their way through the Big Cup final, as though Tramadol cakes and Mogadon sandwiches were the order of the day, will attest.</p> <h2><strong>THE SLOWTHAI AWARD FOR TELLING IT LIKE IT IS</strong></h2> <p>Royston Keane, whose punditry was consistently more entertaining than the matches he was paid to get annoyed about in the pantomime style. Keane plays the same song every time, but does so with such verve, turn of phrase and comic timing that it never fails to warm the heart. Our only regret is that the Sky Sports red button does not offer the opportunity to access his internal monologue, a service that would have been especially life-affirming when the knacked [sic] Paul Pogba turned up at Old Trafford for the Liverpool game wielding a walking stick, one bowler hat away from being a fully-fledged John Steed tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13864f92bd144a759e7c7fc4ac5bc5fe4e16d7ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13864f92bd144a759e7c7fc4ac5bc5fe4e16d7ab/0_0_3500_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oh Roy!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh Roy!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>THE BASIL FAWLTY AWARD FOR LOW-QUALITY HOSTING</strong></h2> <p>France underachieved in the Women\u2019s World Cup, while this nonsense in Qatar right now doesn\u2019t look particularly well organised, does it? But our gong goes to Egypt, who never really got going at their Africa Cup of Nations, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/africa-cup-of-nations-nigeria-dump-out-holders-cameroon-egypt-south-africa\">went out meekly</a> in the round of 16 to one of the worst South Africa teams in living memory. Cue a level of silence in the Cairo International Stadium that made the Maracan\u00e3 crowd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/18/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-no2-uruguay-brazil-1950-scott-murray\">at the 1950 World Cup</a> sound like My Bloody Valentine playing excerpts from the Ring Cycle. Egypt join a long list of disappointing, anti-climactic major-tournament hosts that includes Brazil 1950, Spain 1982, Brazil 2014 and England 2020.</p> <h2><strong>THE DIEGO MARADONA AWARD FOR DECLINING TO GIVE A SOLITARY ONE WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS ABOUT ANYTHING, EVER</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/06/marcelo-bielsa-leeds-premier-league-exile-championship-promotion\">Marcelo Bielsa</a>. This shouldn\u2019t require any additional comment.</p> <h2><strong>THE KLAUS TOPPM\u00d6LLER TIME-FOR-CIGARETTES AWARD</strong></h2> <p>Who else but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/12/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-hysteria-defence\">Maurizio Sarri</a>, who was caught on camera trying to sneak out of Wembley towards the end of the League Cup final, presumably because he\u2019d run clean out of snouts and/or Swan Vestas. That could be the only explanation for his making off in a slightly agitated fashion, right? Pop out quick to the corner shop, should be back in time to see the penalty shootout. The living Chelsea legend was also spotted at the end of the Big Vase final, enjoying a moment of silent solitude in the dugout, sucking down a valedictory cheroot. Such a shame the bloke on the PA didn\u2019t put on Bach\u2019s Air on the G String, it\u2019d have been the perfect mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.</p> <h2><strong>THE SON HEUNG-MIN AWARD FOR STRIKING FROM YOUR OWN HALF</strong></h2> <p>Gosport Borough\u2019s George Barker, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_Dart/status/1099570798010998784\">executing the perfect horizontal larrup</a>.

Another backward lunge, and then it was time to blooter a wild one-step effort several miles right of the target. Of course opponents Cuaiba went on to win in sudden death. Of <em>course</em> they did. But at least Caique left everyone with this memory for the ages, an instant modern classic that makes Simone Zaza look like Ray Stewart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/James_Dart/status/1198139520136470528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ro\" dir=\"ltr\">Key penalty in the Copa Verde shoot-out for Paysandu against Cuiab\u00e1 <a href=\"https://t.co/RtdK8BcF23\">pic.twitter.com/RtdK8BcF23</a></p>&mdash; James Dart (@James_Dart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/James_Dart/status/1198139520136470528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>THE JO SWINSON AWARD FOR SELF-AWARENESS</strong></h2> <p>The grown adults who decided to dig up social media disgrace posts made by young players when they were knee high to a grasshopper.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the 2019 Fiver Christmas Awards. We lost count last year of how many times we\u2019ve done this, so don\u2019t be expecting us to furnish you with a number now. All we know is, it\u2019s been too many. You know it too. But despite the grinding familiarity and futility of it all, we go again. It\u2019s a time-honoured festive tradition, see, like crackers, carols and crying. So here it is, merry Christmas, everybody\u2019s trudging on. Charge your glass with a generous shot of your cheapest aftershave, top it up with a little turps, dig out the packet of tablets you should have taken for your bad back a few months ago but decided to save for the holidays, and sink into a gorgeous haze of delight, the better to deal with the next few minutes of existence. Make sure to have a couple of rolls of that Regina Blitz to hand, just in case you wake up with a start in a puddle! Enjoy, enjoy. THE GRETA THUNBERG AWARD FOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR In the room the women come and go, talking of Megan Rapinoe. The USA! USA!! USA!!! captain gets things done on and off the park, whether winning the World Cup or virtually poking the president on the shoulder blade, slowly, deliberately, repeatedly, until he snaps and makes an awful show of himself. Again. Six goals at the World Cup, a righteous fight for equality, and an innate ability to trigger paroxysms of impotent purple rage in those type of men. THE FIVER\u2019S BALLON D\u2019OH Most fair-minded folk had 2019 down as Virgil van Dijk\u2019s year, mainly because it\u2019s not often a defender proves to be such a transformative figure. Thing is, there have been times this year when his partner Jo\u00ebl Matip has outshone him. Also there have been a couple of games in which Degsy Lovren has been the man of the match too. So according to playground rules, that\u2019s three players just at one club who are better than actual Ballon d\u2019Or winner Lionel Messi. Two of them aren\u2019t even in the team right now! Oh Lionel. While we\u2019re on the subject of the most underwhelming greatest-ever player in history, CR7 is streets ahead too. Nations League, innit. Yes we are doing this to deliberately annoy a certain section of our readership, but we\u2019re sure you\u2019d expect nothing less. THE GRAHAM POLL AWARD FOR BEST VAR DECISION No, we can\u2019t bring ourselves to do it. It\u2019s attention football\u2019s bureaucrats are after. We should stop giving it to them. Football\u2019s very own version of coitus interruptus, only more frustrating. THE FINEFARE AWARD FOR BEST SUPERMARKET OWN-BRAND PRODUCT Alfredo \u2018Up Yours, Motherwell\u2019 Morelos fair racked up the numbers in 2019. He scored 38 goals, picked up 13 yellow cards, got himself sent off three times, missed one penalty and 174 chances in a cup final, and played a cumulative total of four and a half minutes in which he wasn\u2019t running around with an aggrieved look on his coupon, searching out the nearest rammy. We love him. Comparisons have been drawn to a certain fellow South American trailblazer, though by the time Luis Su\u00e1rez was Morelos\u2019 age, he\u2019d already got a controversial World Cup handball and his first biting incident to his name. Still, the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers man is only 23, so there\u2019s plenty of time to develop his act. THE ANDY GRAY AWARD FOR MOST DISINGENUOUS COMMENTARY Gary Neville wins this for his reaction upon witnessing Vincent Kompany lashing one in from 90 yards against Leicester. His strange yelp of pseudo delight registered 9.6 on Gray\u2019s patented YaBeauty-o-Meter, though to be fair the United legend was caught between a rock and a hard place given City were battling with Liverpool for the title. And at the end of the day, a confected reaction is better than none at all, as anyone who heard Steve McManaman and Jermaine Jenas drone their way through the Big Cup final, as though Tramadol cakes and Mogadon sandwiches were the order of the day, will attest. THE SLOWTHAI AWARD FOR TELLING IT LIKE IT IS Royston Keane, whose punditry was consistently more entertaining than the matches he was paid to get annoyed about in the pantomime style. Keane plays the same song every time, but does so with such verve, turn of phrase and comic timing that it never fails to warm the heart. Our only regret is that the Sky Sports red button does not offer the opportunity to access his internal monologue, a service that would have been especially life-affirming when the knacked [sic] Paul Pogba turned up at Old Trafford for the Liverpool game wielding a walking stick, one bowler hat away from being a fully-fledged John Steed tribute. THE BASIL FAWLTY AWARD FOR LOW-QUALITY HOSTING France underachieved in the Women\u2019s World Cup, while this nonsense in Qatar right now doesn\u2019t look particularly well organised, does it? But our gong goes to Egypt, who never really got going at their Africa Cup of Nations, and went out meekly in the round of 16 to one of the worst South Africa teams in living memory. Cue a level of silence in the Cairo International Stadium that made the Maracan\u00e3 crowd at the 1950 World Cup sound like My Bloody Valentine playing excerpts from the Ring Cycle. Egypt join a long list of disappointing, anti-climactic major-tournament hosts that includes Brazil 1950, Spain 1982, Brazil 2014 and England 2020. THE DIEGO MARADONA AWARD FOR DECLINING TO GIVE A SOLITARY ONE WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS ABOUT ANYTHING, EVER Marcelo Bielsa. This shouldn\u2019t require any additional comment. THE KLAUS TOPPM\u00d6LLER TIME-FOR-CIGARETTES AWARD Who else but Maurizio Sarri, who was caught on camera trying to sneak out of Wembley towards the end of the League Cup final, presumably because he\u2019d run clean out of snouts and/or Swan Vestas. That could be the only explanation for his making off in a slightly agitated fashion, right? Pop out quick to the corner shop, should be back in time to see the penalty shootout. The living Chelsea legend was also spotted at the end of the Big Vase final, enjoying a moment of silent solitude in the dugout, sucking down a valedictory cheroot. Such a shame the bloke on the PA didn\u2019t put on Bach\u2019s Air on the G String, it\u2019d have been the perfect mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. THE SON HEUNG-MIN AWARD FOR STRIKING FROM YOUR OWN HALF Gosport Borough\u2019s George Barker, executing the perfect horizontal larrup. The sort of loose-limbed avant garde physical improvisation you only expect to see when poring over grainy footage of Ajax from 1971. THE JOFRA ARCHER AWARD FOR DECISIVE RUN-UP OF THE YEAR Brazil\u2019s Copa Verde was up for grabs. All Paysandu defender Caique had to do to seal victory was slot home the final kick of a penalty shootout. After placing the ball on the spot, he took 13 long confident strides backwards, followed by 19 smaller ones forward, in a manner which suggested procrastination and doubt were very much uppermost in mind. Another backward lunge, and then it was time to blooter a wild one-step effort several miles right of the target. Of course opponents Cuaiba went on to win in sudden death. Of course they did. But at least Caique left everyone with this memory for the ages, an instant modern classic that makes Simone Zaza look like Ray Stewart. THE JO SWINSON AWARD FOR SELF-AWARENESS The grown adults who decided to dig up social media disgrace posts made by young players when they were knee high to a grasshopper. Social Media Disgrace Twitter is practically taking us back to the doctrine of Original Sin. Meanwhile, the fact that a fair few of the folk calling the lads out have been involved in unedifying online media spats while skittered on Tin during their time, while in their 40s and 50s, is quietly ignored. THE JO SWINSON AWARD FOR VAULTING AMBITION Marko Arnautovic, who forced through a move to Shanghai SIPG in the Chinese Super League because he was \u201cdesperate to win trophies\u201d. Yes, nice one. THE KLAUS AUGENTHALER AWARD FOR HAVING A COSTLY BECKENBAUER COMPLEX John Stones, nobly and single-handedly ensuring England got stuck at the semi-final stage for the second year in a row. His mistake against the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final \u2013 best played at 1.5x speed and accompanied by Yakety Sax \u2013 was 24-carat blooper VHS gold. THE CHARLIE BROOKER ALTERNATE REALITY AWARD The Expected Goals (xG) Premier League table, which has Liverpool in second place, two points ahead of Manchester United and Chelsea, and Jeremy Corbyn making himself at home at No 10. THE DOMINIC CUMMINGS AWARD FOR POSITIVE SPIN Manchester United fans who celebrated a triumphant end to the 2018-19 season because Liverpool didn\u2019t win the Premier League and Manchester City didn\u2019t do the real treble. To do this while sitting under that leaking roof showed great moral fortitude. THE JOFRA ARCHER AWARD FOR GIVING SOCIAL MEDIA DISGRACES A HALF-DECENT NAME Coleen Rooney, P.I. THE JACOB REES-MOGG AWARD FOR DISAPPEARING WHEN IT MATTERS Having wowed the world with his genius in the first leg of the Big Cup semi-final, when he scored an open goal and a deflected free-kick, Messi was expected to finish Liverpool off in the second leg. Instead he was shoved about the noggin by Andy Robertson with such force that he disappeared into a black hole for the remainder of the match, reappearing just in time to slag off all his teammates for losing 4-0. Top work, wee man! THE HENRY/PIRES AWARD FOR TAKING ARSENAL BEYOND PARODY Alexandre Lacazette, who threw a beautiful dummy against Brighton \u2013 just before taking the kick-off. Arsenal lost the game but won the style argument. THE WALTER CRONKITE GLASSES-OFF AWARD FOR JFK MOMENT OF THE YEAR None of us will ever forget where we were on the afternoon of Monday 2 December 2019, when the Sky Sports Breaking News ticker roared into life to break the seismic news that a Sean Dyche press conference was coming up. THE EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR AWARD FOR PROVOCATIVE CELEBRATION The USA! USA!! USA!!!\u2019s Alex Morgan, who started an online riot by mocking England when she scored against them in the World Cup semi-final. Morgan\u2019s inflammatory gesture was to, erm, daintily drink a cup of imaginary tea.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, and Uncle Tom wants to hear the news. My 11-year-old self is wondering why on earth grownups want to hear the news on Christmas Day when there are vital things to be done, such as handing out presents. And then, while I am only half-listening, something weird happens: the Greenwich time pips start. Surely we have already heard those. And then the boring man with the plummy voice begins going on about a Christmas message to the world from the Vatican. Surely that\u2019s been on already, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s my older brother, Colin, who gets it! \u201cPete, Pete, it\u2019s a tape recorder, you idiot! We\u2019ve got our tape recorder.\u201d</p> <p>The penny drops: Uncle Tom and my dad have recorded the headlines, and are playing them back.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s often quite rare to experience real excitement over a present: in my experience, children are as good as adults at knowing what is expected of them and simulating joyful surprise, even when they don\u2019t feel it. But for me this was one of those rare moments when my insides gave an involuntary lurch and the world did a little somersault.</p> <p>Colin and I had both been blind from birth, and at this point were spending most of our time at a special boarding school, Worcester College for the Blind (now called New College Worcester). In the late 1950s, Britain had just reached the point when exciting consumer goods were coming within reach of the not-really-rich, and at Worcester reel-to-reel tape recorders were definitely the consumer gizmos of choice. For blind kids, they would trump cameras every time, especially at this moment when rock\u2019n\u2019roll was more of a religion than a pastime. For us, you could spot the better-off kids not by the clothes they wore, or the holidays they boasted about, but by the tape recorders they owned. So in our class, Iain Hopkin was marked out as something of a plutocrat by his Brenell recorder. Fortunately for us, Hoppy was a generous soul, and gave us all access to his recordings of Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers.</p> <p>Still, a recorder of your own was the height of aspiration, and Colin \u2013 better informed and more realistic about family finances than me \u2013 had no real expectations.</p> <p>I realised, much later, that at this time my dad, a very good joiner and carpenter, was probably earning about \u00a38 a week. The tape recorder my parents had bought us, although nowhere near at the top of the range, would have cost more than four times his weekly wage. My parents could only afford it by borrowing the money from Uncle Tom, who had a thriving grocery business. Family or not, I know my mum and dad would have thought long and hard before incurring the debt.</p> <p>The new toy, mains-powered and the size of a small suitcase, dominated the rest of Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays. Once we had mastered the controls (Colin was the technical one, but was surprisingly patient in sharing his discoveries with me), we recorded everything in sight: each other, our parents, the milkman, the dog \u2026 And we very quickly learned the fun to be had at catching people unawares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f6965fcbe918be096ef2ba81ea13d67022ad694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6965fcbe918be096ef2ba81ea13d67022ad694/555_55_1162_1452/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter White aged about 8, with his older brother, Colin, aged about 12.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter White aged about 8, with his older brother, Colin, aged about 12.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The White family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Uncle Tom, at whose house we were staying over the holiday, got an early reward for his generous loan. Some friends he regarded as a little pretentious were coming over for Boxing Day; my aunt and uncle always referred to the husband as \u201cthe mayor of Romford\u201d. (Whether that was because he was or just talked as if he was, I\u2019m not sure I ever learned.) Uncle Tom was keen Bill should be made to listen to his chirpy cockney accent, which he claimed he didn\u2019t have. (Things like this mattered 60 years ago.) My task was to record them when they arrived and then at a quiet moment play it back to set Bill straight. Delighted to be trusted in this adult conspiracy of inverted snobbery, I set the machine going as they came up the path. The reaction was more than Uncle Tom could have hoped for; I think he decided at that point that his \u00a330-odd investment had already been more than repaid.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first time I had been entranced by a tape recorder. I vividly remember, aged four, coming into a room and hearing a child singing, tunelessly, and raucously. I stopped dead. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Dad said. \u201cNoisy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. It turned out that he\u2019d borrowed a tape recorder because he and some friends were writing and performing songs and sketches for his former school\u2019s annual concert. And so for the first time, in the same way that a sighted child might react to seeing themselves in a mirror or a photograph, I got the sense of myself as a separate person, existing outside my head and experienced by other people. It was exciting and embarrassing \u2013 not a bad summing-up of my later life as a broadcaster.</p> <p>I really took my first steps down that path when I got back to school after the holidays ended. I was lucky to be in a class of imaginative and creative boys (yes, sadly, Worcester was single-sex then) and it wasn\u2019t long before \u2013 all of us radio-obsessed \u2013 we started to make our own embryo radio programmes. While studio managers at the BBC were still banging coconuts together to represent horses\u2019 hooves, we were using the little oblong pieces of lead we needed to represent numbers when doing sums to recreate shrapnel for our first world war battles. And very effective they were, dropped on to a desk from a great height.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I would wander round the school with my rudimentary microphone, commenting in the voices of my radio idols \u2013 the hushed, reverential tones of Richard Dimbleby, the gravel-voiced war correspondent Ren\u00e9 Cutforth, and, favourite of all, the mellow Hampshire burr of John Arlott.</p> <p>Most of what I described was pure imagination, although occasionally we would stage real events to heighten the excitement. Particularly memorable was a boxing match between Mick and Geoff (respectively the strongest and the gamest boys in the class, both totally blind. The commentary came from the only one of us with a little bit of sight, in a very passable imitation of the boxing commentator Raymond Glendenning). The strong boy beat the game boy, by the way.</p> <p>The acquisition of the tape recorder coincided with the formation of our own band: Reg Webb, Andy Woods and \u2013 yes \u2013 Peter White, imaginatively called the W Brothers and destined to be the greatest group ever, had not the Beatles come along and pinched our best material. Reg and Andy were good musicians, and went on to have professional careers. I wasn\u2019t in their musical class, but made up for it with what I thought at the time was my witty banter to introduce our songs. At one of our concerts a girl actually screamed \u2013 although it could have been that someone trod on her foot.</p> <p>In fact, the biggest challenge was not finding things to do with the tape recorder but wrestling it away from Colin \u2013 it was, after all, a joint present. His generosity on the first day we got it did not extend to his handing it over to his ham-fisted brother at school. I can still hear the phrases: \u201cYou\u2019ll break it; you\u2019ll lose it; you\u2019ll scramble up all the tapes.\u201d And, annoyingly, I did do all of those things. On one fraught occasion, trying in front of an open window to disentangle the hopelessly knotted tape that contained my latest radio gem, I managed to get yards of the stuff enmeshed in an overhanging tree.</p> <p>But 10 years later, by which time I had begun and abandoned a university law course, it was the confidence gained from those early excursions into sound that had me walking into the local radio station in Southampton, trying to sell myself as the next Robin Day.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, and Uncle Tom wants to hear the news. My 11-year-old self is wondering why on earth grownups want to hear the news on Christmas Day when there are vital things to be done, such as handing out presents. And then, while I am only half-listening, something weird happens: the Greenwich time pips start. Surely we have already heard those. And then the boring man with the plummy voice begins going on about a Christmas message to the world from the Vatican. Surely that\u2019s been on already, too. It\u2019s my older brother, Colin, who gets it! \u201cPete, Pete, it\u2019s a tape recorder, you idiot! We\u2019ve got our tape recorder.\u201d The penny drops: Uncle Tom and my dad have recorded the headlines, and are playing them back. I think it\u2019s often quite rare to experience real excitement over a present: in my experience, children are as good as adults at knowing what is expected of them and simulating joyful surprise, even when they don\u2019t feel it. But for me this was one of those rare moments when my insides gave an involuntary lurch and the world did a little somersault. Colin and I had both been blind from birth, and at this point were spending most of our time at a special boarding school, Worcester College for the Blind (now called New College Worcester). In the late 1950s, Britain had just reached the point when exciting consumer goods were coming within reach of the not-really-rich, and at Worcester reel-to-reel tape recorders were definitely the consumer gizmos of choice. For blind kids, they would trump cameras every time, especially at this moment when rock\u2019n\u2019roll was more of a religion than a pastime. For us, you could spot the better-off kids not by the clothes they wore, or the holidays they boasted about, but by the tape recorders they owned. So in our class, Iain Hopkin was marked out as something of a plutocrat by his Brenell recorder. Fortunately for us, Hoppy was a generous soul, and gave us all access to his recordings of Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers. Still, a recorder of your own was the height of aspiration, and Colin \u2013 better informed and more realistic about family finances than me \u2013 had no real expectations. I realised, much later, that at this time my dad, a very good joiner and carpenter, was probably earning about \u00a38 a week. The tape recorder my parents had bought us, although nowhere near at the top of the range, would have cost more than four times his weekly wage. My parents could only afford it by borrowing the money from Uncle Tom, who had a thriving grocery business. Family or not, I know my mum and dad would have thought long and hard before incurring the debt. The new toy, mains-powered and the size of a small suitcase, dominated the rest of Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays. Once we had mastered the controls (Colin was the technical one, but was surprisingly patient in sharing his discoveries with me), we recorded everything in sight: each other, our parents, the milkman, the dog \u2026 And we very quickly learned the fun to be had at catching people unawares. Uncle Tom, at whose house we were staying over the holiday, got an early reward for his generous loan. Some friends he regarded as a little pretentious were coming over for Boxing Day; my aunt and uncle always referred to the husband as \u201cthe mayor of Romford\u201d. (Whether that was because he was or just talked as if he was, I\u2019m not sure I ever learned.) Uncle Tom was keen Bill should be made to listen to his chirpy cockney accent, which he claimed he didn\u2019t have. (Things like this mattered 60 years ago.) My task was to record them when they arrived and then at a quiet moment play it back to set Bill straight. Delighted to be trusted in this adult conspiracy of inverted snobbery, I set the machine going as they came up the path. The reaction was more than Uncle Tom could have hoped for; I think he decided at that point that his \u00a330-odd investment had already been more than repaid. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had been entranced by a tape recorder. I vividly remember, aged four, coming into a room and hearing a child singing, tunelessly, and raucously. I stopped dead. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Dad said. \u201cNoisy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. It turned out that he\u2019d borrowed a tape recorder because he and some friends were writing and performing songs and sketches for his former school\u2019s annual concert. And so for the first time, in the same way that a sighted child might react to seeing themselves in a mirror or a photograph, I got the sense of myself as a separate person, existing outside my head and experienced by other people. It was exciting and embarrassing \u2013 not a bad summing-up of my later life as a broadcaster. I really took my first steps down that path when I got back to school after the holidays ended. I was lucky to be in a class of imaginative and creative boys (yes, sadly, Worcester was single-sex then) and it wasn\u2019t long before \u2013 all of us radio-obsessed \u2013 we started to make our own embryo radio programmes. While studio managers at the BBC were still banging coconuts together to represent horses\u2019 hooves, we were using the little oblong pieces of lead we needed to represent numbers when doing sums to recreate shrapnel for our first world war battles. And very effective they were, dropped on to a desk from a great height. Meanwhile, I would wander round the school with my rudimentary microphone, commenting in the voices of my radio idols \u2013 the hushed, reverential tones of Richard Dimbleby, the gravel-voiced war correspondent Ren\u00e9 Cutforth, and, favourite of all, the mellow Hampshire burr of John Arlott. Most of what I described was pure imagination, although occasionally we would stage real events to heighten the excitement. Particularly memorable was a boxing match between Mick and Geoff (respectively the strongest and the gamest boys in the class, both totally blind. The commentary came from the only one of us with a little bit of sight, in a very passable imitation of the boxing commentator Raymond Glendenning). The strong boy beat the game boy, by the way. The acquisition of the tape recorder coincided with the formation of our own band: Reg Webb, Andy Woods and \u2013 yes \u2013 Peter White, imaginatively called the W Brothers and destined to be the greatest group ever, had not the Beatles come along and pinched our best material. Reg and Andy were good musicians, and went on to have professional careers. I wasn\u2019t in their musical class, but made up for it with what I thought at the time was my witty banter to introduce our songs. At one of our concerts a girl actually screamed \u2013 although it could have been that someone trod on her foot. In fact, the biggest challenge was not finding things to do with the tape recorder but wrestling it away from Colin \u2013 it was, after all, a joint present. His generosity on the first day we got it did not extend to his handing it over to his ham-fisted brother at school. I can still hear the phrases: \u201cYou\u2019ll break it; you\u2019ll lose it; you\u2019ll scramble up all the tapes.\u201d And, annoyingly, I did do all of those things. On one fraught occasion, trying in front of an open window to disentangle the hopelessly knotted tape that contained my latest radio gem, I managed to get yards of the stuff enmeshed in an overhanging tree. But 10 years later, by which time I had begun and abandoned a university law course, it was the confidence gained from those early excursions into sound that had me walking into the local radio station in Southampton, trying to sell myself as the next Robin Day. It all nearly ended there, as the receptionist told me there were no vacancies, and that I\u2019d have to apply to the BBC in London \u201cthrough the normal channels\u201d. Luck intervened. A producer charged with putting together a weekly programme for blind people saw me and my white cane being ushered into the lift. As I prepared to hitchhike my disillusioned way back to university, he rang me at home, and asked if I would go back to Southampton to see him. Twenty-five years after that, I presented my first report for BBC TV\u2019s Six O\u2019Clock News, a date with the telly my dad had never missed. Although by then he\u2019d been dead for more than a decade, I like to think he\u2019d have realised that his inspired Christmas present really had not just changed, but shaped my life.

It is the ideal bridge between main course and dessert, allowing the last glass of wine to be enjoyed with delight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.recipewisdom.com/recipes/gougeres-recipe-2/\" title=\"\">American chef Thomas Keller</a> nails it for me, however, when he calls goug\u00e8res \u201cbasic and delicious\u201d \u2013 because, despite the fancy name, they are indeed pretty basic: a simple choux pastry that can be made weeks in advance, and baked to featherlight perfection straight from the freezer. Perfect Christmas fare, whenever you eat them.</p> <h2>The pastry</h2> <p>Choux pastry, the same one that\u2019s used to make profiteroles, sounds more complicated than it is: in fact, it requires very little in the way of skill, though an understanding of the process is helpful. Water is heated with butter until the latter has melted, then flour is beaten in to create a paste. This beating not only brings the mixture together, but activates the gluten in the flour, making the dough stronger and stretchier (helpful for rising), while the heat dries it out and denatures the proteins, so they\u2019re not so elastic that they immediately snap back into shape. Eggs are beaten in to emulsify the dough, the yolks adding softness, the whites strength, followed by cheese or other flavourings, before the choux is piped or spooned on to trays and put into a hot oven, where the remaining moisture evaporates and expands, causing the buns to rise and dry out, until eventually you\u2019re left with a crisp shell of savoury dough. That\u2019s the theory as I understand it, anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cab86cd32db4eb34dee1137533bf08fb45b8a3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab86cd32db4eb34dee1137533bf08fb45b8a3bf/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Kaplan\u2019s goug\u00e8res\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to the New York Times, Nicole Kaplan\u2019s goug\u00e8res leave behind \u2018a child-like impatience for more\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7143-nicole-kaplans-gougeres-served-at-eleven-madison-park\" title=\"\">Nicole Kaplan</a>\u2019s goug\u00e8res at New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/\" title=\"\">Eleven Madison Park</a> were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/magazine/food-say-cheese-balls.html\" title=\"\">described by Jonathan Reynolds in the New York Times</a> as: \u201ca gossamer of gruyere so light that it can be brought to your table by a butterfly and evaporates on your tongue seconds after making contact \u2013 leaving behind only the sound and memory of a thin crunch, the nutty aroma of milk\u2019s leap toward immortality, and a child-like impatience for more.\u201d Kaplan uses strong bread flour to achieve this, which, according to Segnit\u2019s Lateral Cooking, will help make the dough stretch further. But we find, in amateur hands at least, that it also makes it slightly tougher, putting us in mind of cheesy dough balls, rather than featherlight goug\u00e8res.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.judyjoo.com/\" title=\"\">Judy Joo</a> uses a mixture of milk and water in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/korean-food-made-simple-9781910254721.html\" title=\"\">Korean Food Made Simple</a> which gives a better flavour, but a softer finish. Given the amount of cheese that goes in, I don\u2019t think this dough needs much help on the flavour front, but a little crispness is very welcome, so I\u2019m going to stick with the plain water variety. Bear in mind that you want the dough to be as dry as possible, so don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking it once you put it back on the heat. It\u2019s also wise to let it cool a little before adding the egg, to reduce the risk of the latter scrambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6ed6b03d4357b0d97ef67793bd511dc313d83027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ed6b03d4357b0d97ef67793bd511dc313d83027/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Joo\u2019s goug\u00e8res.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Joo adds chilli flakes to her goug\u00e8res.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The cheese</h2> <p>Gruyere is the classic choice: in his book, Egg, <a href=\"http://ruhlman.com/2009/01/12/pate-a-choux/\" title=\"\">Michael Ruhlman</a> says there is a feeling that, \u201cbecause they are a French preparation, one should use only a French cheese \u2026 I say it\u2019s fine to add a little parmesan to the mix, and cheddar would surely work as well\u201d. I try grana padano and mature cheddar, and can confirm that both work well, as indeed would just about any hard cheese (mimolette, red leicester or Scottish red cheddar would give good colour). But for that distinctive, sweet-salty flavour, gruyere or another mountain cheese would be my pick every time \u2013 and, as Hopkinson observes in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/simon-hopkinson-cooks-9780091957247.html\" title=\"\">Simon Hopkinson Cooks</a>, \u201cthe better quality the cheese, the more delicious the goug\u00e8res\u201d.</p> <h2>The seasoning</h2> <p>You don\u2019t need anything more than salt, but a goug\u00e8re is improved immeasurably by a good pinch of mustard powder, which Segnit calls the \u201cunsurpassable flavour enhancer\u201d when it comes to cheese. Joo also adds Korean chilli flakes, which is a good call if you\u2019re looking for a touch of spice (Kaplan\u2019s cayenne pepper does much the same job), while Hopkinson and Willan go big on the nutmeg, which I always think pairs particularly well with gruyere and its ilk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6986926886a471fbe22d7660230e8b3a8eece8d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6986926886a471fbe22d7660230e8b3a8eece8d4/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Lanlard\u2019s goug\u00e8res\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Lanlard\u2019s goug\u00e8res with blue-cheese sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQTdCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=eric+lanlard+gougeres&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eJN9CRUqQf&amp;sig=ACfU3U2FpPa4V9fT58bhKdfZmZvOiPmznQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiFtqacrv7lAhUIJsAKHbAmBlIQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eric%20lanlard%20gougeres&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Eric Lanlard</a> fills the goug\u00e8res in his Afternoon Tea book with a blue-cheese sauce, which really tips us over the edge; I never turn my nose up at more cheese, of course, but this is quite daringly rich, and would certainly end up down my front after a glass of fizz, so is perhaps better as a starter with a green salad. (Note that recipes for larger goug\u00e8res can be found in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/delia-s-complete-cookery-course-9780563362494.html\" title=\"\">Delia Smith\u2019s Complete Cookery Course</a> and Luard\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/european-peasant-cookery-9781904943365.html\" title=\"\">European Peasant Cookery</a>, among others.)</p> <p>Finishing with a quick brush of egg and a sprinkle of cheese will give your goug\u00e8res a glorious tan: if you run out of either, however, it\u2019s not the end of the world.</p> <h2>The shaping and the baking</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d1f2fa63676651eb8d98c1bc2798a5843df9b535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f2fa63676651eb8d98c1bc2798a5843df9b535/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Keller\u2019s goug\u00e8res\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Keller\u2019s \u2018basic and delicious\u2019 goug\u00e8res.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though it\u2019s not necessary to wield a piping bag \u2013 you\u2019ll be pleased to know Hopkinson deploys two wetted spoons \u2013 it will yield more even results. Keller\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bouchon-bakery-9781579654351.html\" title=\"\">Bouchon Bakery book </a>calls for the goug\u00e8res to be frozen in silicone moulds, \u201cto ensure they are uniform\u201d; if you have them, use them, but they\u2019re certainly not necessary for anyone but the most serious control freaks. (Joo\u2019s batter is so very wet that I have to put hers into them, so they do come in useful, after all, turning out delicious, almost quiche-like results \u2013 not classic goug\u00e8res, perhaps, but that doesn\u2019t stop us all scoffing them.)</p> <p>Kaplan gives three tips for success to the New York Times: refrigerate or freeze the dough after piping, because \u201cit will rise better in the oven\u201d, eat them immediately \u2013 \u201clike topical plays, they lose value every couple of minutes\u201d \u2013 and, most importantly, \u201cif you\u2019re serving them to friends, make millions\u201d. Having baked a batch of the same dough immediately, after refrigeration and straight from the freezer, I don\u2019t notice a great deal of difference, though the frozen ones are perhaps slightly puffier. So \u2026 up to you, but Kaplan\u2019s right on the millions thing: people can really put these things away.

      "bodyText": "Goug\u00e8res, as we sophisticates call cheese puffs, are \u201cthe world\u2019s best canap\u00e9\u201d \u2013 not my words, but those of Niki Segnit, while Elisabeth Luard reckons they\u2019re \u201cthe perfect partner\u201d for the wines of their home region, Burgundy. \u201cTake the cork out of the bottle \u2013 there\u2019s just time for it to breathe while you cook the goug\u00e8re. You will never have a better chance for drinking it,\u201d she promises. For Simon Hopkinson, they provide \u201cmuch-needed ballast\u201d to a festive champagne cocktail, while Anne Willan recommends them for later in the meal, too. \u201cAs one wine connoisseur put it,\u201d she writes in French Regional Cooking, \u201c\u2018goug\u00e8re is not a cheese, though it has that savour; nor a pastry, though it has that appearance. It is the ideal bridge between main course and dessert, allowing the last glass of wine to be enjoyed with delight.\u2019\u201d American chef Thomas Keller nails it for me, however, when he calls goug\u00e8res \u201cbasic and delicious\u201d \u2013 because, despite the fancy name, they are indeed pretty basic: a simple choux pastry that can be made weeks in advance, and baked to featherlight perfection straight from the freezer. Perfect Christmas fare, whenever you eat them. The pastry Choux pastry, the same one that\u2019s used to make profiteroles, sounds more complicated than it is: in fact, it requires very little in the way of skill, though an understanding of the process is helpful. Water is heated with butter until the latter has melted, then flour is beaten in to create a paste. This beating not only brings the mixture together, but activates the gluten in the flour, making the dough stronger and stretchier (helpful for rising), while the heat dries it out and denatures the proteins, so they\u2019re not so elastic that they immediately snap back into shape. Eggs are beaten in to emulsify the dough, the yolks adding softness, the whites strength, followed by cheese or other flavourings, before the choux is piped or spooned on to trays and put into a hot oven, where the remaining moisture evaporates and expands, causing the buns to rise and dry out, until eventually you\u2019re left with a crisp shell of savoury dough. That\u2019s the theory as I understand it, anyway. Nicole Kaplan\u2019s goug\u00e8res at New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park were described by Jonathan Reynolds in the New York Times as: \u201ca gossamer of gruyere so light that it can be brought to your table by a butterfly and evaporates on your tongue seconds after making contact \u2013 leaving behind only the sound and memory of a thin crunch, the nutty aroma of milk\u2019s leap toward immortality, and a child-like impatience for more.\u201d Kaplan uses strong bread flour to achieve this, which, according to Segnit\u2019s Lateral Cooking, will help make the dough stretch further. But we find, in amateur hands at least, that it also makes it slightly tougher, putting us in mind of cheesy dough balls, rather than featherlight goug\u00e8res. Judy Joo uses a mixture of milk and water in Korean Food Made Simple which gives a better flavour, but a softer finish. Given the amount of cheese that goes in, I don\u2019t think this dough needs much help on the flavour front, but a little crispness is very welcome, so I\u2019m going to stick with the plain water variety. Bear in mind that you want the dough to be as dry as possible, so don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking it once you put it back on the heat. It\u2019s also wise to let it cool a little before adding the egg, to reduce the risk of the latter scrambling. The cheese Gruyere is the classic choice: in his book, Egg, Michael Ruhlman says there is a feeling that, \u201cbecause they are a French preparation, one should use only a French cheese \u2026 I say it\u2019s fine to add a little parmesan to the mix, and cheddar would surely work as well\u201d. I try grana padano and mature cheddar, and can confirm that both work well, as indeed would just about any hard cheese (mimolette, red leicester or Scottish red cheddar would give good colour). But for that distinctive, sweet-salty flavour, gruyere or another mountain cheese would be my pick every time \u2013 and, as Hopkinson observes in Simon Hopkinson Cooks, \u201cthe better quality the cheese, the more delicious the goug\u00e8res\u201d. The seasoning You don\u2019t need anything more than salt, but a goug\u00e8re is improved immeasurably by a good pinch of mustard powder, which Segnit calls the \u201cunsurpassable flavour enhancer\u201d when it comes to cheese. Joo also adds Korean chilli flakes, which is a good call if you\u2019re looking for a touch of spice (Kaplan\u2019s cayenne pepper does much the same job), while Hopkinson and Willan go big on the nutmeg, which I always think pairs particularly well with gruyere and its ilk. Eric Lanlard fills the goug\u00e8res in his Afternoon Tea book with a blue-cheese sauce, which really tips us over the edge; I never turn my nose up at more cheese, of course, but this is quite daringly rich, and would certainly end up down my front after a glass of fizz, so is perhaps better as a starter with a green salad. (Note that recipes for larger goug\u00e8res can be found in Delia Smith\u2019s Complete Cookery Course and Luard\u2019s European Peasant Cookery, among others.) Finishing with a quick brush of egg and a sprinkle of cheese will give your goug\u00e8res a glorious tan: if you run out of either, however, it\u2019s not the end of the world. The shaping and the baking Though it\u2019s not necessary to wield a piping bag \u2013 you\u2019ll be pleased to know Hopkinson deploys two wetted spoons \u2013 it will yield more even results. Keller\u2019s Bouchon Bakery book calls for the goug\u00e8res to be frozen in silicone moulds, \u201cto ensure they are uniform\u201d; if you have them, use them, but they\u2019re certainly not necessary for anyone but the most serious control freaks. (Joo\u2019s batter is so very wet that I have to put hers into them, so they do come in useful, after all, turning out delicious, almost quiche-like results \u2013 not classic goug\u00e8res, perhaps, but that doesn\u2019t stop us all scoffing them.) Kaplan gives three tips for success to the New York Times: refrigerate or freeze the dough after piping, because \u201cit will rise better in the oven\u201d, eat them immediately \u2013 \u201clike topical plays, they lose value every couple of minutes\u201d \u2013 and, most importantly, \u201cif you\u2019re serving them to friends, make millions\u201d. Having baked a batch of the same dough immediately, after refrigeration and straight from the freezer, I don\u2019t notice a great deal of difference, though the frozen ones are perhaps slightly puffier. So \u2026 up to you, but Kaplan\u2019s right on the millions thing: people can really put these things away. (For this reason, I prefer them bite-sized, though you can make them larger, if you wish; just adjust the cooking time accordingly.) As the moisture evaporates, the little buns will rise, creating a cavity in the middle; if there\u2019s too much liquid in there, however, they\u2019ll collapse (which is only a disaster for your pride; they\u2019ll still taste fabulous). To facilitate this process, like Keller, I\u2019d advise starting them off in a hot oven to drive off as much water as possible, and then turning the heat down so the outsides don\u2019t overcook before the middle has dried out, taking a tip from David Lebovitz and cutting a hole in the shell to let the steam out in the final five minutes. That said, I rather like a bit of squish in the centre, so you might want to play around with the timings until you find your own sweet spot. To reheat ready-cooked ones (hey, you might have leftovers, you never know), put them into an 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for five minutes. Perfect goug\u00e8res Prep 20 min Cook 25 min Makes About 30 250ml water 80g butter, cubed \u00bd-1 tsp fine salt 5 large eggs 150g plain flour, whisked \u00bc tsp freshly ground nutmeg (optional) 2 tsp mustard powder (optional) 175g gruyere or other hard cheese, grated Line two baking sheets and, if you\u2019re cooking immediately, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

      "body": "<p>Listening to Labour colleagues on the media over the last week, I have repeatedly heard the refrain that the problem we faced last Thursday was that \u201cthis became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/election-result-signifies-realignment-of-uk-politics\" title=\"\">Brexit election</a>\u201d. To which I can only say: I look forward to their tweets of shock when next Wednesday\u2019s lunch features turkey and brussels sprouts.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: this was always going to be the Brexit election, the first genuine single-issue election in 119 years. Back then, in 1900, the Tories were cynically capitalising on their early success in the Boer war to try to win another thumping majority over the Liberals. It was also Labour\u2019s very first election, and we went into it with noble domestic ambitions far distant from the South African veldt.</p> <p>Provision for the aged poor. Better houses. Useful work for the unemployed. Adequate maintenance for children. The nationalisation of railways. And the establishment of social and economic equality between the sexes. Worthy priorities indeed, but we only won two seats, while the Tories stuck to their single issue and claimed a majority of more than 130.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/emily-thornberry-throws-her-hat-into-ring-for-labour-leadership\">Emily Thornberry throws her hat into ring for Labour leadership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At least then, we never had a choice. Calling an election was entirely in the government\u2019s gift. But this time, we have no excuse. Boris Johnson proposed an election at a time of his own choosing, on an issue of his own choosing, and we went along with it \u2013 like crackers voting for Christmas. The Liberal Democrats agreed to it because they thought it would work in their favour, and Labour because we imagined we could change the subject. That was a total delusion.</p> <p>I wrote to the leader\u2019s office warning it would be \u201can act of catastrophic political folly\u201d to vote for the election, and explained exactly why we should not go along with it. I argued that the single issue of Brexit should not be enough to give Johnson a five-year mandate to enact his agenda on every issue. Instead, I said we should insist on a referendum on his proposed deal, to get the issue of Brexit out of the way before any general election.</p> <p>When I raised this at the shadow cabinet, and spoke forcefully against an election, some colleagues nodded along, but the loudest voices were pro-leave colleagues insisting that we should vote with Johnson. So we wilfully went into a single-issue election with no clear position on that issue and, as every pollster predicted, we were brutally squeezed by all the other parties with an unequivocal policy on Brexit, all of them sharing a clear strategy to eat into Labour\u2019s base.</p> <p>All over the country, we could see ourselves going backwards, despite the incredible hard work of our brilliant volunteers, councillors and candidates. They saw this result coming a mile off, and were amazed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/inside-labours-campaign-behind\" title=\"\">people running the campaign could not</a>.</p> <p>Worst of all, while we tried to focus on the implications of Brexit for the NHS, the Tories more successfully tied Labour\u2019s ambiguity on the issue to their other main argument: that Jeremy Corbyn could not be trusted with the levers of power \u2013 a complete contrast with 2017, when his clear principles and authenticity had been major assets.</p> <p>People can argue that our position should have been more pro-leave or more pro-remain, but the reality is we should never have allowed a Brexit election, which was Johnson\u2019s obvious strategic goal from the moment he took office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/red-wall-labour-south\">The red wall is only half the story \u2013 Labour must rebuild in the south too | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question now is: how do we fight back from here? The answer is certainly not to have some great ideological debate between left, right and centre. Neither is it to set this up as a battle between leave and remain, north and south, or indeed men and women. When did we stop being for the many, not just half of us?</p> <p>It won\u2019t earn raucous cheers at a rally, but our starting point should instead be to ask ourselves: where is the strategic thinking in our party? Who has a proper plan for the future?</p> <p>Say what you like about New Labour after 1994, and it\u2019s known that I disagree with much of what it did, but credit where credit\u2019s due: that team had deep political insight and absolute clarity of purpose, boiled down to a five-point pledge-card. It would never have voted to give Johnson the Brexit election he craved.</p> <p>When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-his-path-to-resigning-as-foreign-secretary\" title=\"\">foreign </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-his-path-to-resigning-as-foreign-secretary\" title=\"\">secretary</a>, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour\u2019s policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border; the war in Yemen; Donald Trump; human rights; and climate change.</p> <p>I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man \u2013 a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman.</p> <p>So when the Labour leadership contest begins, whoever is standing \u2013 and I hope to be one of the candidates \u2013 the first question shouldn\u2019t be about their position on Brexit, or where they live in our country.</p> <p>The first question should instead be: what\u2019s your plan for taking on Johnson over the next five years? And do you have the political nous and strategic vision to reunite our party, rebuild our machine, gain the trust of the public, give hope to our declining towns and smaller cities, and never again waste the opportunity to take back power?</p> <p>Goodness knows, we\u2019ve been taught a painful enough lesson in how to prosecute a successful political strategy by Johnson over the last five months.</p> <p>And if you\u2019re a Labour voter seized with gloom \u2013 or a Tory gleaming with complacency \u2013 just remember that in 1906, six years after the last single-issue election, the Liberal opposition won a majority of 124, with the Tories losing 246 seats. Why? Because the Tories were totally divided over trade policy and because their \u201csingle issue\u201d of the Boer war had turned into a disaster.</p> <p>Will history repeat itself now as the Tories grapple with the reality of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d?

      "bodyText": "Listening to Labour colleagues on the media over the last week, I have repeatedly heard the refrain that the problem we faced last Thursday was that \u201cthis became the Brexit election\u201d. To which I can only say: I look forward to their tweets of shock when next Wednesday\u2019s lunch features turkey and brussels sprouts. Let\u2019s be clear: this was always going to be the Brexit election, the first genuine single-issue election in 119 years. Back then, in 1900, the Tories were cynically capitalising on their early success in the Boer war to try to win another thumping majority over the Liberals. It was also Labour\u2019s very first election, and we went into it with noble domestic ambitions far distant from the South African veldt. Provision for the aged poor. Better houses. Useful work for the unemployed. Adequate maintenance for children. The nationalisation of railways. And the establishment of social and economic equality between the sexes. Worthy priorities indeed, but we only won two seats, while the Tories stuck to their single issue and claimed a majority of more than 130. At least then, we never had a choice. Calling an election was entirely in the government\u2019s gift. But this time, we have no excuse. Boris Johnson proposed an election at a time of his own choosing, on an issue of his own choosing, and we went along with it \u2013 like crackers voting for Christmas. The Liberal Democrats agreed to it because they thought it would work in their favour, and Labour because we imagined we could change the subject. That was a total delusion. I wrote to the leader\u2019s office warning it would be \u201can act of catastrophic political folly\u201d to vote for the election, and explained exactly why we should not go along with it. I argued that the single issue of Brexit should not be enough to give Johnson a five-year mandate to enact his agenda on every issue. Instead, I said we should insist on a referendum on his proposed deal, to get the issue of Brexit out of the way before any general election. When I raised this at the shadow cabinet, and spoke forcefully against an election, some colleagues nodded along, but the loudest voices were pro-leave colleagues insisting that we should vote with Johnson. So we wilfully went into a single-issue election with no clear position on that issue and, as every pollster predicted, we were brutally squeezed by all the other parties with an unequivocal policy on Brexit, all of them sharing a clear strategy to eat into Labour\u2019s base. All over the country, we could see ourselves going backwards, despite the incredible hard work of our brilliant volunteers, councillors and candidates. They saw this result coming a mile off, and were amazed that the people running the campaign could not. Worst of all, while we tried to focus on the implications of Brexit for the NHS, the Tories more successfully tied Labour\u2019s ambiguity on the issue to their other main argument: that Jeremy Corbyn could not be trusted with the levers of power \u2013 a complete contrast with 2017, when his clear principles and authenticity had been major assets. People can argue that our position should have been more pro-leave or more pro-remain, but the reality is we should never have allowed a Brexit election, which was Johnson\u2019s obvious strategic goal from the moment he took office. The question now is: how do we fight back from here? The answer is certainly not to have some great ideological debate between left, right and centre. Neither is it to set this up as a battle between leave and remain, north and south, or indeed men and women. When did we stop being for the many, not just half of us? It won\u2019t earn raucous cheers at a rally, but our starting point should instead be to ask ourselves: where is the strategic thinking in our party? Who has a proper plan for the future? Say what you like about New Labour after 1994, and it\u2019s known that I disagree with much of what it did, but credit where credit\u2019s due: that team had deep political insight and absolute clarity of purpose, boiled down to a five-point pledge-card. It would never have voted to give Johnson the Brexit election he craved. When I faced Johnson for the entire two years he was foreign secretary, the only ministerial job he previously held, my strategy was to focus relentlessly on five key issues where there were huge differences between Labour\u2019s policy and his, and where his position was indefensible: the Northern Ireland border; the war in Yemen; Donald Trump; human rights; and climate change. I took the fight to him every day, and pummelled him every week. Each time, the mask slipped, and we saw the real man \u2013 a mendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on. He hated it, especially coming from a woman. So when the Labour leadership contest begins, whoever is standing \u2013 and I hope to be one of the candidates \u2013 the first question shouldn\u2019t be about their position on Brexit, or where they live in our country. The first question should instead be: what\u2019s your plan for taking on Johnson over the next five years? And do you have the political nous and strategic vision to reunite our party, rebuild our machine, gain the trust of the public, give hope to our declining towns and smaller cities, and never again waste the opportunity to take back power? Goodness knows, we\u2019ve been taught a painful enough lesson in how to prosecute a successful political strategy by Johnson over the last five months. And if you\u2019re a Labour voter seized with gloom \u2013 or a Tory gleaming with complacency \u2013 just remember that in 1906, six years after the last single-issue election, the Liberal opposition won a majority of 124, with the Tories losing 246 seats. Why? Because the Tories were totally divided over trade policy and because their \u201csingle issue\u201d of the Boer war had turned into a disaster. Will history repeat itself now as the Tories grapple with the reality of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d? Well, history has a tendency to do that. And when the next election comes, I\u2019d certainly like Labour to have a leader and team in place with the strategic vision to foresee and exploit Johnson\u2019s failings. Because if we can overturn that Tory majority, we can start focusing on the pledges from that 1900 Labour manifesto, which are now more than a century overdue \u2013 on elderly people, on housing, on the unemployed, and on child poverty. That\u2019s the prize. Let\u2019s keep our eye on it. \u2022 Emily Thornberry is the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, and the shadow foreign secretary",

      "bodyText": "Emily Thornberry has declared she is entering the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, revealing she warned the Labour leadership that backing a Brexit election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. The shadow foreign secretary set out her pitch to be the next Labour leader in an article for the Guardian, arguing she has already \u201cpummelled\u201d Boris Johnson across the dispatch box and knows how to exploit his failings. Directly addressing those calling for a new leader from northern England, she made the case that Corbyn\u2019s replacement should be chosen on the basis of their \u201cpolitical nous and strategic vision\u201d, rather than where they come from or their views on Brexit. Her declaration makes her the first candidate to confirm she wants to be in the race, although Lisa Nandy, Keir Starmer, Clive Lewis and David Lammy have indicated they are seriously considering it. Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is backed by a number of Corbyn allies, is highly likely to stand, along with Jess Phillips and possibly Yvette Cooper. In her article, Thornberry sought to demonstrate her political judgment by revealing that she sent a lengthy written note to the leadership before the election, explaining it would be disastrous for Labour to go to the polls before Brexit was settled in a referendum. She likened the party\u2019s decision to back an election to \u201ccrackers voting for Christmas\u201d because it gave Johnson a chance to fight an election on a subject of his choosing at a time of his choosing. \u201cListening to Labour colleagues on the media over the last week, I have repeatedly heard the refrain that the problem we faced last Thursday was that \u2018this became the Brexit election\u2019. To which I can only say I look forward to their tweets of shock when next Wednesday\u2019s lunch features turkey and brussels sprouts \u2026 I wrote to the leader\u2019s office warning it would be \u2018an act of catastrophic political folly\u2019 to vote for the election, and set out a lengthy draft narrative explaining why we should not go along with it. \u201cI argued that the single issue of Brexit should not be enough to give Johnson a five-year mandate to enact his agenda on every issue. Instead, I said we should insist on a referendum on his proposed deal, to get the issue of Brexit out of the way before any general election.\u201d She blamed pro-leave colleagues in the shadow cabinet for having insisted on backing the election that Johnson wanted, which resulted in Labour losing a net total of 59 seats. Corbyn told the Guardian at the outset of the campaign that he had made the decision to support an election himself. Describing a shadow cabinet meeting, he said, \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said, Yes Jeremy.\u201d Since last week\u2019s disastrous result, some Labour MPs have called for the next leader to be someone from the north or Midlands who is not strongly pro-remain to help win back trust in Labour heartlands that went Tory in some cases for the first time. Caroline Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat, has said Long-Bailey and Nandy are the only candidates worth considering for that reason and accused Thornberry of insulting voters in the north, which has caused Thornberry to threaten to sue her for \u201cmaking shit up\u201d. Addressing such concerns, Thornberry, who is MP for Islington South, said: \u201cThe question is how we fight back from here. The answer is certainly not to have some great ideological debate between left, right and centre. Neither is it to set this up as a battle between leave or remain, north or south, and indeed men or women. When did we stop being for the many, not just half of us?\u201d She said the goal should be strategic thinking and a proper plan for the future rather than simply aiming to earn raucous cheers at a rally. Describing her time opposite Johnson as his shadow while he was foreign secretary, Thorberry claimed she \u201ctook the fight to him every day and pummelled him every week\u201d so that his mask slipped to expose a \u201cmendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on\u201d. \u201cSo when the Labour leadership contest begins, whoever is standing \u2013 and I hope to be one of the candidates \u2013 the first question shouldn\u2019t be about their position on Brexit, or where they live in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first question should instead be: what\u2019s your plan for taking on Boris Johnson over the next five years? And do you have the political nous and strategic vision to reunite our party, rebuild our machine, gain the trust of the public, give hope to our declining towns and smaller cities, and never again waste the opportunity to take back power?\u201d She said the prize was being able to focus on Labour\u2019s priorities over more than a century of helping the elderly, housing, the unemployed, and alleviating child poverty. Starmer, a fellow north London MP, set out his pitch for the leadership in the Guardian on Tuesday, without confirming he would definitely run. He called for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result and acknowledged Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d nor deal sufficiently with antisemitism. Both Thornberry and Starmer have served in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet, alongside Long-Bailey. In contrast, Nandy has been on the backbenches since she resigned in 2016 when Corbyn\u2019s leadership was challenged. She set out her thinking in the Observer last weekend, arguing Labour had \u201clost touch with the day-to-day lived experience\u201d of the people it wished to represent and calling for it to reconnect with the parts of the country that \u201chave come adrift\u201d to regain voters\u2019 trust. Phillips also told the Observer: \u201cBelief matters, and we failed the test. That is an existential problem for the party that is named for working people.\u201d The leadership contest will start formally in January and last until Corbyn steps down at the end of March.",

      "bodyText": "Ursula von der Leyen has warned that a cliff-edge Brexit at the end of 2020 will hurt the UK more than the EU as she laid out her intentions to \u201cmake the most\u201d out of the \u201cextremely challenging\u201d 11 months available to strike a trade deal. The European commission president acknowledged the danger of time running out during the negotiations, a risk many fear has been amplified by Boris Johnson\u2019s symbolic decision to legislate to block an extension of the transition period. Should the UK leave the EU on 31 January, as is now assumed in Brussels, the country will remain in the customs union and single market until 31 December 2020 at which point any newly negotiated arrangements on issues such as trade, security and fisheries will come into force. Speaking at the start of a debate in the European parliament in Strasbourg, Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, conceded that there was \u201cvery little time\u201d for those complex and potentially fraught talks to come to fruition. Boris Johnson has said he will not take up the opportunity to agree to an extension under any circumstances before 1 July, a deadline set in the withdrawal agreement. EU diplomats had been informed on Tuesday by the European commission that there was no legal basis to agree an extension any later than that date. Von der Leyen said: \u201cIn case we cannot conclude an agreement by the end of 2020 we will face again a cliff-edge situation and this would clearly harm our interests but it will impact the UK more than us as the EU will continue benefiting from its single market its customs union and the 70 international agreements we signed with our partners \u2013 but it\u2019s clearly not in our interest. \u201cWe will organise these negotiations to make the most out of the short period. On 1 February we will be ready to propose a mandate for the negotiations. Von der Leyen, said she would not miss the Brexit party MEPs, as they heckled her speech, but she offered her condolence to those parties who had campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU. \u201cIf I look at our very brave remain MEPs I can only say, I\u2019m sorry, we will miss you. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for having been at our side. We will never miss those who scream and yell.\u201d Charles Michel, the president of the European council, said the next stage of the negotiations would be guided by ensuring the UK cannot undercut EU standards after Brexit. \u201cThe idea of a level playing field will be our guide over the next stage of negotiations,\u201d he said, referring to the need for the UK to sign up to EU rules on state aid, tax and the environment. Michel said EU leaders had taken the news of Johnson\u2019s election triumph at a Brussels summit last week \u201cvery calmly\u201d and \u201cvery serenely\u201d. The former prime minister of Belgium added that it was not the EU\u2019s intention to extend the trade talks deadline of the end of 2020 \u2013 but he left the option open. The EU is within its rights to ask for an extension from the UK. Such is the lack of time, the EU is planning to prioritise issues around trade, fisheries and security, leaving key areas of cooperation such as data sharing, transport, including the rights of British air carriers, and any arrangements for the services sector, for after the 2020 deadline. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the extent to which tariffs and quotas on goods could be lifted, and friction on trade alleviated, would depend on the UK\u2019s answer to a single question: \u201cDoes it want to distance itself, and if so how far, from our regulatory model?\u201d Leaving without a deal in place at the end of next year will mean the UK will trade with the EU\u2019s 27 member states on World Trade Organization terms, which would include hefty tariffs on British goods entering the European market. Due to the withdrawal agreement, there will be protections in place for many of the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and British citizens living in the EU. The \u00a333bn divorce bill will still need to be paid and Northern Ireland will stay in the EU\u2019s single market. There will also be a customs border down the Irish sea with checks and paperwork to be filled in to account for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and vice versa.",

But this force is more symbolic than practical. How can one forget that art, especially music, has sometimes been used as instruments of torture in concentration camps and prisons? Artists collaborated with dictators while producing songs that filled hearts with joy. My idea is that artists work for values above money and politics.\u201d</p> <p>While on the surface the show feels like a celebration unburdened by politics, you don\u2019t need to dig too far to hit hard ground. Its venue in the Senegalese capital invites debate about foreign imperialism both new and old: the museum, which opened last December, was built with Chinese money, and its directors have joined the voices calling for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/12/750549303/across-europe-museums-rethink-what-to-do-with-their-african-art-collections\">the repatriation of African art</a> from former colonial powers.</p> <p>The show\u2019s title, Lend Me Your Dream, matches the seeming tranquillity of its curation. But there are monsters lurking in the reverie. You may feel like resting your head on the velvet cushion cradling Siriki\u2019s melted bronze<em> </em>Precious Heads<em>. </em>But from these warped, cracked craniums, griot knowledge is leaking out. Siriki\u2019s anxiety is that oral histories are, generation by generation, ebbing away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07c312aa530b969f72717ad8aec95853727ae02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07c312aa530b969f72717ad8aec95853727ae02d/0_884_2976_3084/965.jpg\" alt=\"Precious Heads by Ky Siriki\" width=\"965\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stories they tell \u2026 Precious Heads by Ky Siriki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Surtees</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9\u2019s giant woven masterpiece, Touareg Rouge No 1, may look like a lovingly made blanket to warm you from a Saharan winter. But it is a study of the aesthetic, colours and motifs of Tuareg culture \u2013 and potentially a cry for peace. After all, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/06/mali-tuareg-rebels-independence\">Tuareg rebel groups</a> who sparked the Mali conflict that was seized upon by Islamists and has destabilised the Sahel region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p>Koko Bi\u2019s Two Similar Worlds \u2013 a wooden canoe cut in half with a chainsaw and burnt with a blow torch \u2013 speaks to the dangers of the exodus of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean. \u201cThe young jobless Moroccan man who helped me create it told me he wanted to leave for Europe for a better life,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him Europe isn\u2019t easy and I cut the boat in two and he was so disappointed. I told him to sit in one of the chairs and he felt powerful. I said, \u2018That is how you will feel staying in Morocco and looking for a job.\u2019 We live in two similar worlds and neither one is better or worse than the other.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of European contact with Africa is similarly present in at least two other works. In Siriki\u2019s Africa Faces Its Destiny, young Africans approach white Europeans with begging bowls made from empty tins that once contained rich minerals. But the smiling European bankers have come with two objectives \u2013 to dole out wads of cash and simultaneously set up Africa\u2019s debt repayment plan at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/03/debt-crisis-warning-as-poorest-countries-repayment-bills-soar\">extortionate rates of interest</a>. They do not appear to notice that one young man who has made it across the sea now lies dead at their feet.</p> <p>Mansour Ciss Kanakassy\u2019s installation, Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation, explores how African nations ended up in economic and social turmoil thanks to European incursions. Two giant matchboxes feature a logo of the map of Africa, divided and imprisoned by the columns of the Reichstag. On the sandy beach are matchsticks \u2013 some burned, some yet to be ignited. It is a metaphor for <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/berlin-conference-1884-1885-divide-africa-1433556\">the Berlin Conference</a> of 1884-85, where Europe\u2019s governments, invited by German chancellor Otto van Bismarck, met to carve up African territory and resources among themselves. It won the Senegalese artist, now based in Berlin, the 2008 Dakar Biennale grand prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295e5378e436a2a7a0404fb9369b355d464ad037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295e5378e436a2a7a0404fb9369b355d464ad037/0_318_3968_2484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation by Mansour Ciss Kanakassy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catching fire \u2026 Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation by Mansour Ciss Kanakassy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Surtees</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Art is one way of invigorating African societies that are now emerging economies in their own right, and the Foundation pour le Development de la Culture Contemporain Africaine, who set up the exhibition, hopes to develop connoisseurship among collectors with newfound wealth. Egyptian painter Adel El Siwi, who presented an eye-catching triptych, believes the exhibition is the most important ever seen in Africa. \u201cIt is an unprecedented event,\u201d he says, \u201cin that it is fully organised and curated by Africans and does not focus on the African diaspora as a central theme.\u201d</p> <p> Bouabdellah, meanwhile, sees it as \u201cpart of a process of emancipation\u201d from privately foreign-funded projects conceptualised abroad, \u201cdemonstrating that south-south cooperation is possible\u201d.</p> <p> But as well as optimism about the current scene, there is caution, too. \u201cThe side effect of these trends is that a great deal of pressure is placed particularly on young artists, to produce for the market, in order to sustain their visibility,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cWhich can erode the distinct creative value that brought attention to their work in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Nigerian Nnenna Okore\u2019s ceramic and jute pieces, Earthbound and Bride Price, examine the repetitive nature of women\u2019s craft and domestic work culture. \u201cI am aware,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I am one of only five women in a group of 30 artists chosen to represent the continent. I feel privileged, but not without recognising that there is still much work to be done in elevating the voice of African female artists.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, two of the five women, Bouabdellah and Alexander, both reference masterworks by men. The former has reinvented Cabanel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435831\">The Birth of Venus</a> in dripping blood-red nail varnish \u2013 an antidote to the male-gaze representation of women in western art. \u201cWhile the French painter shows us a naked body lying prey to desire, I prefer a less virile version, which gives back her status as a woman who is mistress of her own passions,\u201d Bouabdellah explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63682530e68626b325faaa0b944158138f9d31bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63682530e68626b325faaa0b944158138f9d31bf/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo at work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo at work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fouad Maazouz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>International visibility is of course vital for African art to thrive.

It is rare, though, to see African art displayed as it is here, without any trace of ethnocentricity or the normally obligatory accompanying texts about the origins of primitivism and early naive work.</p> <p>Painter Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo wants more. \u201cWe don\u2019t see major European or American galleries coming here,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like the Guggenheim or Pompidou to settle in an African country!\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the cosmopolitanism and affluence growing out of the dust and bustle of Dakar, this feels like an achievable dream. But does Africa need a Tate gallery? Why should western museums continue to reap the benefits? All over Dakar, small contemporary galleries such as C\u00e9cile Fakhoury, Raw and Trames are thriving. On the opening night of local artist Fally Sene Sow\u2019s show at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agencetrames\">T</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/agencetrames\">rames</a> last week, Senegal\u2019s hipsters assembled in a stark industrial space, reminiscent of Hoxton or Williamsburg, with a DJ spinning electro tunes to an excitable, well-dressed crowd.</p> <p>Where once such an event would prompt stares of astonishment, outside on the busy thoroughfare off Place de l\u2019Independence, taxi drivers in their yellow cabs barely batted an eyelid.</p> <p>\u2022 Pr\u00eate-moi Ton R\u00eave is at the <a href=\"http://www.mcn.sn/\">Museum of Black Civilisations, Dakar, Senegal</a>, until 28 January.

Africa has produced world-famous names in music, but many of its star artists remain obscure \u2013 particularly on the continent itself, where talent leaves to study abroad, sometimes never to return. \u201cAll too often the careers of African artists are built on exhibitions in Paris, Berlin, London and New York \u2026 but go by without anybody in Africa actually noticing them,\u201d writes Konat\u00e9 in his programme notes. \u201cWe are haunted by these ghost-like events that create the nagging feeling that Africa\u2019s art scene has been completely ignored.\u201d Speaking from his home in Ivory Coast, Konat\u00e9 says he believes \u201cin the power of art [to heal]. But this force is more symbolic than practical. How can one forget that art, especially music, has sometimes been used as instruments of torture in concentration camps and prisons? Artists collaborated with dictators while producing songs that filled hearts with joy. My idea is that artists work for values above money and politics.\u201d While on the surface the show feels like a celebration unburdened by politics, you don\u2019t need to dig too far to hit hard ground. Its venue in the Senegalese capital invites debate about foreign imperialism both new and old: the museum, which opened last December, was built with Chinese money, and its directors have joined the voices calling for the repatriation of African art from former colonial powers. The show\u2019s title, Lend Me Your Dream, matches the seeming tranquillity of its curation. But there are monsters lurking in the reverie. You may feel like resting your head on the velvet cushion cradling Siriki\u2019s melted bronze Precious Heads. But from these warped, cracked craniums, griot knowledge is leaking out. Siriki\u2019s anxiety is that oral histories are, generation by generation, ebbing away. Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9\u2019s giant woven masterpiece, Touareg Rouge No 1, may look like a lovingly made blanket to warm you from a Saharan winter. But it is a study of the aesthetic, colours and motifs of Tuareg culture \u2013 and potentially a cry for peace. After all, it was Tuareg rebel groups who sparked the Mali conflict that was seized upon by Islamists and has destabilised the Sahel region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people. Koko Bi\u2019s Two Similar Worlds \u2013 a wooden canoe cut in half with a chainsaw and burnt with a blow torch \u2013 speaks to the dangers of the exodus of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean. \u201cThe young jobless Moroccan man who helped me create it told me he wanted to leave for Europe for a better life,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him Europe isn\u2019t easy and I cut the boat in two and he was so disappointed. I told him to sit in one of the chairs and he felt powerful. I said, \u2018That is how you will feel staying in Morocco and looking for a job.\u2019 We live in two similar worlds and neither one is better or worse than the other.\u201d The impact of European contact with Africa is similarly present in at least two other works. In Siriki\u2019s Africa Faces Its Destiny, young Africans approach white Europeans with begging bowls made from empty tins that once contained rich minerals. But the smiling European bankers have come with two objectives \u2013 to dole out wads of cash and simultaneously set up Africa\u2019s debt repayment plan at extortionate rates of interest. They do not appear to notice that one young man who has made it across the sea now lies dead at their feet. Mansour Ciss Kanakassy\u2019s installation, Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation, explores how African nations ended up in economic and social turmoil thanks to European incursions. Two giant matchboxes feature a logo of the map of Africa, divided and imprisoned by the columns of the Reichstag. On the sandy beach are matchsticks \u2013 some burned, some yet to be ignited. It is a metaphor for the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, where Europe\u2019s governments, invited by German chancellor Otto van Bismarck, met to carve up African territory and resources among themselves. It won the Senegalese artist, now based in Berlin, the 2008 Dakar Biennale grand prize. Art is one way of invigorating African societies that are now emerging economies in their own right, and the Foundation pour le Development de la Culture Contemporain Africaine, who set up the exhibition, hopes to develop connoisseurship among collectors with newfound wealth. Egyptian painter Adel El Siwi, who presented an eye-catching triptych, believes the exhibition is the most important ever seen in Africa. \u201cIt is an unprecedented event,\u201d he says, \u201cin that it is fully organised and curated by Africans and does not focus on the African diaspora as a central theme.\u201d Bouabdellah, meanwhile, sees it as \u201cpart of a process of emancipation\u201d from privately foreign-funded projects conceptualised abroad, \u201cdemonstrating that south-south cooperation is possible\u201d. But as well as optimism about the current scene, there is caution, too. \u201cThe side effect of these trends is that a great deal of pressure is placed particularly on young artists, to produce for the market, in order to sustain their visibility,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cWhich can erode the distinct creative value that brought attention to their work in the first place.\u201d Nigerian Nnenna Okore\u2019s ceramic and jute pieces, Earthbound and Bride Price, examine the repetitive nature of women\u2019s craft and domestic work culture. \u201cI am aware,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I am one of only five women in a group of 30 artists chosen to represent the continent. I feel privileged, but not without recognising that there is still much work to be done in elevating the voice of African female artists.\u201d Interestingly, two of the five women, Bouabdellah and Alexander, both reference masterworks by men. The former has reinvented Cabanel\u2019s The Birth of Venus in dripping blood-red nail varnish \u2013 an antidote to the male-gaze representation of women in western art. \u201cWhile the French painter shows us a naked body lying prey to desire, I prefer a less virile version, which gives back her status as a woman who is mistress of her own passions,\u201d Bouabdellah explains. International visibility is of course vital for African art to thrive. London\u2019s 1:54 art fair has joined Paris\u2019s Pompidou Centre as a regular platform for African artists, and MoMA recently acquired 45 major African artworks donated by Jean Pigozzi to its reopened permanent collection. It is rare, though, to see African art displayed as it is here, without any trace of ethnocentricity or the normally obligatory accompanying texts about the origins of primitivism and early naive work. Painter Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo wants more. \u201cWe don\u2019t see major European or American galleries coming here,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like the Guggenheim or Pompidou to settle in an African country!\u201d Looking at the cosmopolitanism and affluence growing out of the dust and bustle of Dakar, this feels like an achievable dream. But does Africa need a Tate gallery? Why should western museums continue to reap the benefits? All over Dakar, small contemporary galleries such as C\u00e9cile Fakhoury, Raw and Trames are thriving. On the opening night of local artist Fally Sene Sow\u2019s show at Trames last week, Senegal\u2019s hipsters assembled in a stark industrial space, reminiscent of Hoxton or Williamsburg, with a DJ spinning electro tunes to an excitable, well-dressed crowd. Where once such an event would prompt stares of astonishment, outside on the busy thoroughfare off Place de l\u2019Independence, taxi drivers in their yellow cabs barely batted an eyelid. \u2022 Pr\u00eate-moi Ton R\u00eave is at the Museum of Black Civilisations, Dakar, Senegal, until 28 January. Then travelling to Abidjan, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Cape Town and Marrakech until July.",

But how do you compare a staging of The Turn of the Screw with a marathon piano recital or a concert of Adams and Birtwistle?

Walking away from the hall as four trumpeters sounded a long Farewell out over the Thames, it was possible for even the previously doubtful to feel that some sort of cosmic order had been realigned.\u201d EJ Read the full review. 8 Brundib\u00e1r (Kr\u00e1sa), Welsh National Opera Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff We said: \u201cKr\u00e1sa\u2019s music is uncomplicatedly tuneful, direct and appealing. Hanus conducted with passion, his own children joining in a reprise of the final rousing chorus. There was a colourful immediacy to David Pountney\u2019s staging, but this was no cocooned-in-cotton-wool affair. The audience had filed in past metal railings wound with barbed wire, each member given a yellow scarf by a Nazi guard.\u201d RE Read the full review. 7 The Turn of the Screw Garsington Opera at Wormsley, Stokenchurch We said: \u201cSophie Bevan gives an extraordinary performance, sung with an almost radiant assertiveness that makes the Governess\u2019s self-deception all the more disquieting \u2026 In the pit, Richard Farnes inexorably ratchets up the tension while exploring every detail of Britten\u2019s remarkable instrumentation. A truly great achievement, devastating and unforgettable.\u201d TA Read the full review. 6 Alban Gerhardt St George\u2019s, Bristol/Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh We said: [With Steven Osborne, at St George\u2019s Bristol] \u201cThe sounds they conjured were playful, exotic and raw, with exhilarating immediacy, rhythmic exactitude and fire. It is hard to imagine a better partnership.\u201d RE Read the full review. We said: [at Snape Maltings, part of the Britten and Russia weekend] \u201cGerhardt played with an almost casual brilliance, wearing his virtuosity as lightly as anyone could; it\u2019s hard to think of a better cellist around today.\u201d AC Read the full review. 5 Berlioz at the Proms Royal Albert Hall, London We said: [of Prom 59: Benvenuto Cellini semi-staged by Orchestre R\u00e9volutionnaire et Romantique/John Eliot Gardiner] \u201cThe technical challenges [of the semi-staging] were all formidably met in playing and singing of tremendous precision and often hair-raising exuberance. Gardiner conducted with almost ferocious energy \u2026 It was impossible not to be swept away by it all.\u201d TA Read the full review. We said: [of Prom 72: Symphonie Fantastique (Aurora Orchestra/Nicholas Collon)] \u201cThere were many memorable visual moments \u2026 Yet nothing upstaged the music, with Collon driving the tempos and encouraging characterful playing from wind and brass. The performance was as vivid to the ear as it was to the eye. EJ Read the full review. 4 Simon Rattle conducts the LSO: Stravinsky, Birtwistle and Adams Barbican, London We said: \u201cAdams\u2019s \u2026 score perfectly suits Rattle\u2019s ability to focus musical energy with pinpoint accuracy, and the LSO responded with a performance of irresistible immediacy, just as they had laid out the intricacies of [Birtwistle\u2019s] The Shadow of Night with astonishing clarity.\u201d AC Read the full review. 3 Tamara Stefanovich\u2019s Art of the Etude Milton Court, London We said: \u201cHer mastery of the technical challenges one quickly took for granted, but the textural imagination she brought to every piece was a constant delight. Conceptually, musically and technically, the whole recital was a magnificent achievement.\u201d AC Read the full review. 2 Peter Grimes (Britten), Bergen Philharmonic / Edward Gardner Royal Festival Hall, London We said: \u201cThe Bergen orchestra\u2019s playing combines richness with precision, and Britten\u2019s seascapes glittered balefully even in moments of uneasy calm. The omnipresence of the chorus \u2013 observers of the drama in which they also participate \u2013 lends the work something of the inexorability of classical tragedy. Skelton combines lyricism with vocal weight \u2013 Now the Great Bear and Pleiades was pure poetry, ravishingly done \u2013 while Wall made a lovely Ellen, vulnerable yet principled. Roderick Williams was the thoughtful, empathetic Balstrode, and the denizens of the Borough, all sharply characterised, included Marcus Farnsworth\u2019s raffish Ned Keene, Susan Bickley\u2019s knowing, world-weary Auntie and Catherine Wyn-Rogers\u2019 hypocritical, drug-ridden Mrs Sedley. The choral singing \u2013 from the combined forces of the Bergen Philharmonic and Royal Northern College of Music Opera Choirs, the Edvard Grieg Kor and the Collige\u00fbm M\u00fbsic\u00fbm \u2013 was electrifying.\u201d TA Read the full review. 1 Bernard Haitink conducts the Vienna Philharmonic at the BBC Proms Royal Albert Hall, London We said: \u201cBernard Haitink\u2019s final UK concert was always going to be a big event. Outside the Albert Hall, the day began with a queue for tickets forming before most people had eaten breakfast. It ended inside with the audience on its feet, the arena full of glowing smartphone screens as people took the pictures that would prove they had been there. Here was evidence that some conductors\u2019 powers don\u2019t diminish with age: Haitink\u2019s pacing was masterful, and the special yet contained sound at that moment was characteristic of it. It\u2019s a cliche to talk of Bruckner\u2019s vast symphonies as cathedrals in sound: it suggests you can see the whole edifice from the start, which is a forbidding and limiting way to think about music that is so beautiful in the moment. Perhaps it would be better to think of a journey on a dark underground river, with the conductor holding the lantern \u2013 you can see each rock formation as you pass, but only towards the end does someone turn on a light and make you realise you have been passing through every inch of a vast and spectacular cavern.\u201d EJ Read the full review.",

He observed that Labour militants always claimed that the party lost national elections because it put forward candidates like Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband who were insufficiently Marxist; nominating Corbyn would put that theory to the test. Young foresaw that \u201cwith Corbyn at the helm, Labour\u2019s loss will be so catastrophic \u2013 so decisively humiliating \u2013 that the Left of the party might finally be silenced for good\u201d. He also foresaw that Boris Johnson would be the beneficiary of a Corbyn defeat.</p> <p>Beyond the unique liabilities of Corbyn, however, Labour\u2019s electoral collapse stems from a transformation common to other center-left parties in many western democracies. Like the Democratic party in the United States or the Social Democratic party in Germany, Labour began as a working-class party but now is dominated by university-educated, upper-middle-class professionals.

      "body": "<p>I was a child when I saw Terry Gilliam\u2019s Brazil for the first time. I expected a film about the stereotypes of my country \u2013 carnival, samba and football \u2013 but found something else. In Gilliam\u2019s surrealist story, the state imprisons, tortures and kills anyone it sees fit. Human rights disappear in a Kafkaesque maze.</p> <p>I met Gilliam 20 years later. He came to a screening in London of my film The Edge of Democracy, which chronicles Brazil\u2019s recent political crisis. He told me he was inspired to name his film Brazil not only by the famous song but also by the Latin American dictatorships of the 1970s. As I made my film, the dystopian future once imagined by Gilliam was now a reality captured by our cameras.</p> <p>In early 2016, I filmed a street protest in Copacabana. Hundreds of thousands of people were calling for the impeachment of our first female president, Dilma Rousseff, and the imprisonment of ex-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. I even saw some groups calling for the return of the military dictatorship. I left that protest deeply troubled by the fact that people were asking for the return of a regime that had killed hundreds and tortured thousands.</p> <p>Rousseff\u2019s impeachment went ahead, despite the fact that most congressmen could not explain what she was actually being tried for. \u201cI am Josef K,\u201d Rousseff said to our camera, in reference to Kafka\u2019s The Trial. In my assessment, Rousseff\u2019s government was guilty of the kind of garden-variety \u201ccreative accounting\u201d that does not rise to the level requiring impeachment.</p> <p>Two weeks after Dilma was impeached, the prosecutor\u2019s office accused her predecessor, Lula, of being responsible for an unprecedented corruption scheme named Car Wash. Yet the proof was dubious: an apartment that was not in his name, for which he did not have the key, and where he hadn\u2019t slept a single night. After a fast-tracked trial, Lula was sentenced to 12 years in prison.</p> <p>Operation Car Wash exposed a longtime corruption scheme involving contractor executives and many politicians, several of them members of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party. For the first time in Brazil\u2019s history, politicians and businessmen were no longer protected by a veil of impunity. While this, on the whole, represented a positive development, there were significant downsides: from the beginning the operation allegedly used questionable procedures, such as selectively <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/08/29/deltan-dallagnol-car-wash-leaks-brazil/\">leaking</a> information to the media and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history\">detaining</a> people before they were convicted in order to force confessions.</p> <p>In June 2019, the Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/\">published</a> a trove of leaked Telegram messages in which S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge overseeing Car Wash, offered prosecutors advice on how to prevent Lula from running in the 2018 election.</p> <p>Lula was the frontrunner; if he hadn\u2019t been imprisoned he probably would have won. Instead, he went to jail, and Jair Bolsonaro was elected in his place. Bolsonaro\u2019s first action was to name Moro minister of justice.</p> <p>This November, Lula was released following a supreme court decision affirming the country\u2019s 1988 constitution. Everyone has the right to exhaust their appeals before they\u2019re imprisoned, the court ruled. In 2016, federal judges had ignored that same constitutional principle because of the mounting political pressure to expose Operation Car Wash.</p> <p>Since Bolsonaro\u2019s election the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/world/americas/amazon-fires-bolsonaro-photos.html\">destruction</a> of the Amazon rain forest has increased dramatically, with a territory almost the size of Lebanon already deforested. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/americas/brazil-miners-amapa.html\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/world/americas/brazil-indigenous-amazon.html\">indigenous leaders</a> have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/08/amazon-indigenous-leaders-killed-in-brazil-drive-by-shooting\">assassinated</a>, and police killings have <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/09/03/police-killings-in-the-state-of-rio-de-janeiro-are-at-a-20-year-high\">spiked</a> by 20%. When questioned about how to end violence in Brazil, Bolsonaro suggested police should be able to kill with impunity and suspects should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-criminal-code-police-killings-far-right-interview-a9040796.html\">die in the streets</a> like cockroaches\u201d. The message was clear, and the targets have an obvious skin color, social class and address.</p> <p>In the last several months, poverty and inequality have sparked protests throughout Latin America. In response \u2013 and no doubt fearful of Lula\u2019s ability to organize the opposition \u2013 Brazil\u2019s finance minister recently made a thinly veiled threat, telling reporters not to be surprised if the government <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/brazil-outrage-minister-references-authoritarian-ai-5-decree-191126155856668.html\">restores AI-5</a>, a dictatorship-era decree used to close congress and suppress dissent.</p> <p>Bolsonaro himself has <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/11/11/bolsonaro-sobre-lula-a-lei-de-seguranca-nacional-esta-ai-para-ser-usada.htm\">flirted</a> with the possibility of invoking a national security law to imprison Lula. This comes from a man who has, in recent months, praised dictators such as Augusto Pinochet and has even argued that in 1964, there was no coup d\u2019etat in Brazil.</p> <p>His son, Eduardo, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the national congress, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/brazili-president-son-jair-eduardo-bolsonaro-dictatorship-era-tactics-leftist-foes\">warned</a> that if the protests roiling other Latin American countries reach Brazil, the government may adopt measures used during the military dictatorship to suppress them.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist, Steve Bannon, who supports Bolsonaro, recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-50367264\">expressed</a> his fear of Lula\u2019s release: \u201cHe is the leader of the globalist left now that Obama is out of politics.\u201d Since Bannon is a chief mouthpiece of the new international far right, those worried about the erosion of democracy worldwide should pay close attention to what happens to Lula and Brazil in the coming months.</p> <p>If you land in Rio these days, you won\u2019t find tanks on the streets, nor will you hear about journalists being arrested. But don\u2019t be fooled. The Brazilian far right, with the aid of the government itself, is executing a well-planned strategy to shrink the liberal democratic sphere.

      "bodyText": "I was a child when I saw Terry Gilliam\u2019s Brazil for the first time. I expected a film about the stereotypes of my country \u2013 carnival, samba and football \u2013 but found something else. In Gilliam\u2019s surrealist story, the state imprisons, tortures and kills anyone it sees fit. Human rights disappear in a Kafkaesque maze. I met Gilliam 20 years later. He came to a screening in London of my film The Edge of Democracy, which chronicles Brazil\u2019s recent political crisis. He told me he was inspired to name his film Brazil not only by the famous song but also by the Latin American dictatorships of the 1970s. As I made my film, the dystopian future once imagined by Gilliam was now a reality captured by our cameras. In early 2016, I filmed a street protest in Copacabana. Hundreds of thousands of people were calling for the impeachment of our first female president, Dilma Rousseff, and the imprisonment of ex-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. I even saw some groups calling for the return of the military dictatorship. I left that protest deeply troubled by the fact that people were asking for the return of a regime that had killed hundreds and tortured thousands. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment went ahead, despite the fact that most congressmen could not explain what she was actually being tried for. \u201cI am Josef K,\u201d Rousseff said to our camera, in reference to Kafka\u2019s The Trial. In my assessment, Rousseff\u2019s government was guilty of the kind of garden-variety \u201ccreative accounting\u201d that does not rise to the level requiring impeachment. Two weeks after Dilma was impeached, the prosecutor\u2019s office accused her predecessor, Lula, of being responsible for an unprecedented corruption scheme named Car Wash. Yet the proof was dubious: an apartment that was not in his name, for which he did not have the key, and where he hadn\u2019t slept a single night. After a fast-tracked trial, Lula was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Operation Car Wash exposed a longtime corruption scheme involving contractor executives and many politicians, several of them members of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party. For the first time in Brazil\u2019s history, politicians and businessmen were no longer protected by a veil of impunity. While this, on the whole, represented a positive development, there were significant downsides: from the beginning the operation allegedly used questionable procedures, such as selectively leaking information to the media and detaining people before they were convicted in order to force confessions. In June 2019, the Intercept published a trove of leaked Telegram messages in which S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge overseeing Car Wash, offered prosecutors advice on how to prevent Lula from running in the 2018 election. Lula was the frontrunner; if he hadn\u2019t been imprisoned he probably would have won. Instead, he went to jail, and Jair Bolsonaro was elected in his place. Bolsonaro\u2019s first action was to name Moro minister of justice. This November, Lula was released following a supreme court decision affirming the country\u2019s 1988 constitution. Everyone has the right to exhaust their appeals before they\u2019re imprisoned, the court ruled. In 2016, federal judges had ignored that same constitutional principle because of the mounting political pressure to expose Operation Car Wash. Since Bolsonaro\u2019s election the destruction of the Amazon rain forest has increased dramatically, with a territory almost the size of Lebanon already deforested. A number of indigenous leaders have been assassinated, and police killings have spiked by 20%. When questioned about how to end violence in Brazil, Bolsonaro suggested police should be able to kill with impunity and suspects should \u201cdie in the streets like cockroaches\u201d. The message was clear, and the targets have an obvious skin color, social class and address. In the last several months, poverty and inequality have sparked protests throughout Latin America. In response \u2013 and no doubt fearful of Lula\u2019s ability to organize the opposition \u2013 Brazil\u2019s finance minister recently made a thinly veiled threat, telling reporters not to be surprised if the government restores AI-5, a dictatorship-era decree used to close congress and suppress dissent. Bolsonaro himself has flirted with the possibility of invoking a national security law to imprison Lula. This comes from a man who has, in recent months, praised dictators such as Augusto Pinochet and has even argued that in 1964, there was no coup d\u2019etat in Brazil. His son, Eduardo, chair of the foreign affairs committee of the national congress, has warned that if the protests roiling other Latin American countries reach Brazil, the government may adopt measures used during the military dictatorship to suppress them. Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist, Steve Bannon, who supports Bolsonaro, recently expressed his fear of Lula\u2019s release: \u201cHe is the leader of the globalist left now that Obama is out of politics.\u201d Since Bannon is a chief mouthpiece of the new international far right, those worried about the erosion of democracy worldwide should pay close attention to what happens to Lula and Brazil in the coming months. If you land in Rio these days, you won\u2019t find tanks on the streets, nor will you hear about journalists being arrested. But don\u2019t be fooled. The Brazilian far right, with the aid of the government itself, is executing a well-planned strategy to shrink the liberal democratic sphere. NGOs and civil society groups have been marginalized from policymaking. The rule of law faces death by a thousand cuts. Safeguarding democracy is a daily struggle, and we are now especially vulnerable to the ravages of populism. The far right will always marshal imaginary enemies \u2013 whether they be communism, immigration or an overweening EU \u2013 to consolidate power and dismantle the pillars of democracy. Lula\u2019s case is, of course, as controversial as ever. I have realized, however, that what each person believes about Lula\u2019s guilt and innocence is not important. What matters is evidence and due process. This is what protects all of us and separates democracy from dictatorship. As the far right spreads, a crucial vaccine to this epidemic is the rule of law. Otherwise Brazil will once again become \u201cBrazil\u201d, the worst version of its surrealist nightmare, and fascism will not stop within its borders.

House prepares to vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment The House of Representatives is preparing to approve articles of impeachment against a president for only the third time in US history, as the charges against Donald Trump go to a vote on Wednesday morning after three months of White House obstacles, complaints and denials. In a final, furious challenge on the eve of the vote, Trump sent a letter to the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, accusing Democrats of waging \u201copen war on American democracy\u201d. History boys. Speaking of history, more than 700 American historians have signed an open letter calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal, as Tom McCarthy looks back on the past members of a club no president wants to join. On a historic day for America, help us reach our $1.5m goal In a matter of hours, Donald Trump faces an impeachment vote in the House, marking the latest twist in one of the most turbulent presidencies in US history. But the challenges to American democracy do not end today. 2020 will be an epic year \u2013 and could define the country for a generation. The need for robust, independent reporting has never been greater. We hope you\u2019ll consider a year-end gift to the Guardian as we prepare for 2020. Australia suffers hottest day on record as bushfires rage With an average maximum of almost 106F across the continent, Tuesday was the hottest day on record in Australia, which is also experiencing its worst ever wildfire weather season. The country\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology found that 95% of Australia had experienced fire-danger weather that was well above average throughout the spring, including sweltering temperatures, high winds and severe drought. The heatwave and bushfires have also created \u201cominous\u201d conditions for Australia\u2019s wine industry. Climate change. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been widely criticised for his failure to acknowledge the extent of the climate crisis, and dismissed a global study that ranked his government\u2019s response last out of of 57 countries. Why Juul is supporting a ban on US teens buying vape pens Congress is considering new legislation that would raise the minimum buying age for all tobacco products \u2013 including vape pens and electronic cigarettes \u2013 from 18 to 21, the biggest such sales restrictions in more than a decade. But while the measure is supported by health advocates, it also has some more unlikely backers in the form of vaping giant Juul and its biggest investor, Altria, the company that also produces Malboro cigarettes. Soft action. Tobacco industry critics claim Juul and Altria\u2019s support for the new age restrictions is designed to head off calls for even stricter government action, specifically the proposed ban on all flavoured tobacco products.

Almost a quarter of victims of trafficking in New Mexico are Native American, yet women and girls remain vulnerable and scarcely protected as the state struggles to address the problem. Nick Pachelli of Searchlight New Mexico reports. Why Brazil is a cautionary tale for the world\u2019s democracies The Brazilian film-maker Petra Costa has watched her country oust a progressive female president based on thin accusations of corruption, and then elect a rightwing government that harks back to the military dictatorship. Anyone worried about the erosion of democracy worldwide should pay close attention, she says. The world\u2019s most terrifying Christmas traditions Across Europe, there are places whose traditional Christmas customs would be far better suited to Halloween.

The Italian press, usually focused on Ferrari, were moved to describe Hamilton\u2019s recent win in Mexico as \u201ca masterpiece of speed and technique\u201d and the driver himself as \u201ca giant\u201d. Such superlatives are not bandied about lightly to a partisan audience. A title triumph with Ferrari would make him the driver who returned the Scuderia to the top \u2013 notably where Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel (next season notwithstanding) failed \u2013 and enable him to see out his career with the most famous team in F1. Having taken his first championship for McLaren, he would also have won the title with three different teams, a remarkable achievement that would cement his position as the driver who made the difference over machinery. He would also be joining another very select group. Only two British drivers have won titles for Ferrari, Mike Hawthorn and John Surtees. Surtees was the last to do so in 1964 and much as the tifosi took Nigel Mansell to their hearts, branding him \u201cIl Leone\u201d, he did not deliver a championship. Yet cold, hard analysis suggests that staying with Mercedes makes most sense. Their team principal, Toto Wolff, has said he believes it is a 75% probability Hamilton will do so but admitted there was a \u201c25% chance\u201d that Mercedes could not control. \u201cI think he should go to Ferrari but after he has beaten all he records,\u201d Berger says. \u201cIt would be too much to do it before because he has such a phenomenal team around him. You never leave a winning team, so perhaps it is not the right moment to do it now.\u201d Hamilton has also been clear that what Wolff chooses to do \u2013 staying at Mercedes, taking over running F1 or even joining Ferrari have all been mooted \u2013 will influence his decision, which opens further avenues. Perhaps a one-year extension at Mercedes in 2021 to see how the new rules play out before a final move rather than throwing it all behind the big gamble at Ferrari straight away. Either way, Hamilton has all the cards in his hands.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe BMW is still running fast,\u201d said Thomas Frank, the Brentford head coach, referring to Sa\u00efd Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/brentford-ollie-watkins\">Ollie Watkins</a> after watching his three-pronged attack combine to devastating effect against Fulham at Griffin Park on Saturday. Watkins carried the ball to the edge of the box, where Benrahma took over, buying a yard of space before scooping a cross towards the back post for Mbeumo to fire the only goal of the game, his eighth of the campaign. Brentford will leave their 115-year-old stadium at the end of this season and have designs of going out with a bang.</p> <p>Mbeumo, a \u00a35.5m club-record signing, has scored in Brentford\u2019s past four matches, including a 7-0 demolition of Luton. The 20-year-old winger is the latest Brentford player to make a seamless transition from Ligue 2 to the Championship after joining from Troyes in the summer, following in the footsteps of Benrahma and Neal Maupay, the striker who moved to Brighton in August for \u00a316m after two prolific seasons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/17/karl-robinson-oxford-united-manchester-city-carabao-cup\">Karl Robinson prepares his Oxford entertainers to dazzle Manchester City | Ben Fisher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Benrahma was a \u00a32.7m signing from Nice after impressing on loan at Ch\u00e2teauroux, and Maupay a \u00a31.6m arrival from Saint-\u00c9tienne after shining at Brest. The defender Julian Jeanvier, in effect John Egan\u2019s replacement 18 months ago, joined from Reims, while Maxime Colin, now of Birmingham, piqued Brentford\u2019s interest at Troyes. Yoann Barbet, now of Queens Park Rangers, joined in 2015 after a season at Chamois Niortais.</p> <p>It is not only in the French market where Brentford have found joy; Watkins was a \u00a31.8m buy from Exeter City in 2017, and in the summer they paid Barnsley \u00a33m for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/03/barnsley-football-league-tightest-defence-pinnock-lindsay-championship\">Ethan Pinnock</a>, who was playing for Dulwich Hamlet three years ago. Pinnock has been paired in central defence with Pontus Jansson, who was made captain after arriving from Leeds United in July. The pair in effect replaced Ezri Konsa and Chris Mepham, who this year sealed Premier League moves to Aston Villa and Bournemouth respectively, bringing in \u00a327m.</p> <p>Brentford have sold almost \u00a3100m of talent since 2014 and sales are vital to countering the club\u2019s \u00a310m-\u00a320m annual operating loss. At 28, Jansson represented a noticeable shift, being the oldest outfield player to join since Lasse Vibe four years ago, but strengthening the defence was a priority.</p> <p>\u201cWe conceded too many goals for a team who wants to get promoted,\u201d says the Brentford co-director, Phil Giles. \u201cThomas was big on that when he took over last October and [assistant head coach] Brian Riemer, who has done a great job with our defence, was very big on not just adding more experience but also the mentality; to really enjoy defending, to make sure you don\u2019t concede and being proud about that. They have done a fantastic job in changing the mentality.</p> <p>\u201cPontus has made a big impression and his leadership has been great. I think he saw Brentford as a team who scored lots of goals and were very good going forward but maybe not as good defensively. I think he felt he could help us become more solid at the back, [and be] the missing piece of the jigsaw to help us attack the top six and the top two.\u201d</p> <p>Brentford are not perfect \u2013 Giles highlights the departure for \u00a3250,000 of Jack O\u2019Connell, who has become a staple of Chris Wilder\u2019s Sheffield United \u2013 but they have delivered more hits than misses. Brentford, fourth after eight wins in their past 11 matches, hope the next step for Benrahma and co is the Premier League \u2013 with them. They have finished in the top half each season since promotion five years ago under Mark Warburton but have not reached the play-offs since 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237872860ff7e4d62eed45fce54a1706d1fd0c08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237872860ff7e4d62eed45fce54a1706d1fd0c08/0_183_4071_2443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Frank celebrates victory over Cardiff with Pontus Jansson, who was the oldest outfield player Brentford signed in four years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Frank celebrates victory over Cardiff with Pontus Jansson, who is the oldest outfield player Brentford signed in four years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Dennis/TGS Photo/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dean Smith returned to his former club for Konsa in the summer and the Villa manager is among Benrahma\u2019s admirers, though the Algeria winger is under contract until 2022. \u201cI think from our squad right now there are seven or eight players who can potentially play in the Premier League in the long term and the absolute main aim is that it is with us, hopefully next season,\u201d says Giles. \u201cIf we keep doing well I think we have a chance of getting into the top six, at least.\u201d</p> <p>No player under 22 has been involved in more goals in the Football League this season than Mbeumo and second in that list is Marcus Forss, the 20-year-old Brentford striker on loan at AFC Wimbledon. There is also excitement at the potential of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/jan/09/ten-football-league-teenagers-watch-2019\">teenage midfielder Dru Yearwood</a>, signed from Southend in the summer. Like Mepham, the Finnish striker Forss represents a success story for the Brentford B team, a development squad born after the club ditched their academy in 2016. Forss was released by West Brom, whom Brentford face at the Hawthorns on Saturday. The midfielder Arthur Read, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/dec/12/luton-town-aim-high-talented-youngsters\">came through the ranks at Luton</a> alongside the Norwich full-back Max Aarons, joined the B team in the summer. Against Reading in November, Brentford\u2019s bench comprised five B-team players, plus 19-year-old Dominic Thompson.</p> <p>\u201cThat was evidence of there being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/aug/08/football-league-blog-brentford-happy-own-way-promotion\">a magnificent pathway</a>,\u201d Giles says. \u201cYou cannot close your academy without a clear plan and an idea about what is to replace it and, because it was a little bit controversial at the time, there was a lot of pressure on the club to make sure we got it right. But we felt there was an opportunity to not develop players at eight, nine or 10 but focus more on can we pick up players released by mistake from other clubs or find players from overseas? This year players like Luka Racic, Jan Zamburek and Mads Roerslev have all played significant minutes for the first team.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 The Luton chief executive, Gary Sweet, has said the club cannot financially compete in the Championship \u201cmad house\u201d and believes a salary cap should be enforced. Luton are two points above the relegation zone following promotion last season but Sweet said the disparity did not mean they could not stay up. \u201cThere are more currencies in football than money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first one being points on the board, but the second one being a lot of ethical and moral values that we hold.\u201d Luton have turned down several lucrative sponsorship deals from gambling companies.<br><br>\u2022 Bristol Rovers\u2019 promotion push will not be derailed by Graham Coughlan\u2019s sudden departure, says the club\u2019s chief executive. Coughlan has traded Rovers, who are fourth in League One, for Mansfield, who are 18th in League Two, after growing frustrated with the level of financial investment. Coughlan also cited family reasons, with the Irishman\u2019s family based in Sheffield. \u201cThe wheels aren\u2019t going to come off,\u201d said Martyn Starnes. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the staff we have got here.\u201d<br><br>\u2022 Graham Westley has returned to Stevenage for a fourth spell in charge. Stevenage are second-bottom in League Two. \u201cGiven our current league position, this is not the time for us to experiment with managers,\u201d said the chairman, Phil Wallace. \u201cI need someone

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe BMW is still running fast,\u201d said Thomas Frank, the Brentford head coach, referring to Sa\u00efd Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins after watching his three-pronged attack combine to devastating effect against Fulham at Griffin Park on Saturday. Watkins carried the ball to the edge of the box, where Benrahma took over, buying a yard of space before scooping a cross towards the back post for Mbeumo to fire the only goal of the game, his eighth of the campaign. Brentford will leave their 115-year-old stadium at the end of this season and have designs of going out with a bang. Mbeumo, a \u00a35.5m club-record signing, has scored in Brentford\u2019s past four matches, including a 7-0 demolition of Luton. The 20-year-old winger is the latest Brentford player to make a seamless transition from Ligue 2 to the Championship after joining from Troyes in the summer, following in the footsteps of Benrahma and Neal Maupay, the striker who moved to Brighton in August for \u00a316m after two prolific seasons. Benrahma was a \u00a32.7m signing from Nice after impressing on loan at Ch\u00e2teauroux, and Maupay a \u00a31.6m arrival from Saint-\u00c9tienne after shining at Brest. The defender Julian Jeanvier, in effect John Egan\u2019s replacement 18 months ago, joined from Reims, while Maxime Colin, now of Birmingham, piqued Brentford\u2019s interest at Troyes. Yoann Barbet, now of Queens Park Rangers, joined in 2015 after a season at Chamois Niortais. It is not only in the French market where Brentford have found joy; Watkins was a \u00a31.8m buy from Exeter City in 2017, and in the summer they paid Barnsley \u00a33m for Ethan Pinnock, who was playing for Dulwich Hamlet three years ago. Pinnock has been paired in central defence with Pontus Jansson, who was made captain after arriving from Leeds United in July. The pair in effect replaced Ezri Konsa and Chris Mepham, who this year sealed Premier League moves to Aston Villa and Bournemouth respectively, bringing in \u00a327m. Brentford have sold almost \u00a3100m of talent since 2014 and sales are vital to countering the club\u2019s \u00a310m-\u00a320m annual operating loss. At 28, Jansson represented a noticeable shift, being the oldest outfield player to join since Lasse Vibe four years ago, but strengthening the defence was a priority. \u201cWe conceded too many goals for a team who wants to get promoted,\u201d says the Brentford co-director, Phil Giles. \u201cThomas was big on that when he took over last October and [assistant head coach] Brian Riemer, who has done a great job with our defence, was very big on not just adding more experience but also the mentality; to really enjoy defending, to make sure you don\u2019t concede and being proud about that. They have done a fantastic job in changing the mentality. \u201cPontus has made a big impression and his leadership has been great. I think he saw Brentford as a team who scored lots of goals and were very good going forward but maybe not as good defensively. I think he felt he could help us become more solid at the back, [and be] the missing piece of the jigsaw to help us attack the top six and the top two.\u201d Brentford are not perfect \u2013 Giles highlights the departure for \u00a3250,000 of Jack O\u2019Connell, who has become a staple of Chris Wilder\u2019s Sheffield United \u2013 but they have delivered more hits than misses. Brentford, fourth after eight wins in their past 11 matches, hope the next step for Benrahma and co is the Premier League \u2013 with them. They have finished in the top half each season since promotion five years ago under Mark Warburton but have not reached the play-offs since 2015. Dean Smith returned to his former club for Konsa in the summer and the Villa manager is among Benrahma\u2019s admirers, though the Algeria winger is under contract until 2022. \u201cI think from our squad right now there are seven or eight players who can potentially play in the Premier League in the long term and the absolute main aim is that it is with us, hopefully next season,\u201d says Giles. \u201cIf we keep doing well I think we have a chance of getting into the top six, at least.\u201d No player under 22 has been involved in more goals in the Football League this season than Mbeumo and second in that list is Marcus Forss, the 20-year-old Brentford striker on loan at AFC Wimbledon. There is also excitement at the potential of the teenage midfielder Dru Yearwood, signed from Southend in the summer. Like Mepham, the Finnish striker Forss represents a success story for the Brentford B team, a development squad born after the club ditched their academy in 2016. Forss was released by West Brom, whom Brentford face at the Hawthorns on Saturday. The midfielder Arthur Read, who came through the ranks at Luton alongside the Norwich full-back Max Aarons, joined the B team in the summer. Against Reading in November, Brentford\u2019s bench comprised five B-team players, plus 19-year-old Dominic Thompson. \u201cThat was evidence of there being a magnificent pathway,\u201d Giles says. \u201cYou cannot close your academy without a clear plan and an idea about what is to replace it and, because it was a little bit controversial at the time, there was a lot of pressure on the club to make sure we got it right. But we felt there was an opportunity to not develop players at eight, nine or 10 but focus more on can we pick up players released by mistake from other clubs or find players from overseas? This year players like Luka Racic, Jan Zamburek and Mads Roerslev have all played significant minutes for the first team.\u201d Talking points \u2022 The Luton chief executive, Gary Sweet, has said the club cannot financially compete in the Championship \u201cmad house\u201d and believes a salary cap should be enforced. Luton are two points above the relegation zone following promotion last season but Sweet said the disparity did not mean they could not stay up. \u201cThere are more currencies in football than money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first one being points on the board, but the second one being a lot of ethical and moral values that we hold.\u201d Luton have turned down several lucrative sponsorship deals from gambling companies. \u2022 Bristol Rovers\u2019 promotion push will not be derailed by Graham Coughlan\u2019s sudden departure, says the club\u2019s chief executive. Coughlan has traded Rovers, who are fourth in League One, for Mansfield, who are 18th in League Two, after growing frustrated with the level of financial investment. Coughlan also cited family reasons, with the Irishman\u2019s family based in Sheffield. \u201cThe wheels aren\u2019t going to come off,\u201d said Martyn Starnes. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the staff we have got here.\u201d \u2022 Graham Westley has returned to Stevenage for a fourth spell in charge. Stevenage are second-bottom in League Two. \u201cGiven our current league position, this is not the time for us to experiment with managers,\u201d said the chairman, Phil Wallace. \u201cI need someone I trust.\u201d Mark Sampson will revert to the role of first-team coach.",

      "body": "<p>I was born in Honduras in 1992. My parents broke up before I was born and when I was five, my father left for the United States. I lived with my mother and my sister and we were the poorest family in our small neighborhood. Eventually my mother got together with Faustino, the man who would become my stepfather. She was scared of him because he drank a lot and was violent. He used to hit my mom and throw chairs at her.</p> <p>One night my stepfather got drunk and came over to my bed and touched me inappropriately. I started yelling and ran out of the house. When my mom came home the next day, I told her what Faustino had done to me, but she didn\u2019t believe me. She sent me to another part of the city to work for his relatives. I cleaned their house, took care of two babies, washed clothes. I was their servant.</p> <p>I was only 12.</p> <p>When my father returned to Honduras to see me for the first time in 10 years, I asked him to take me back to the United States because I didn\u2019t have anything left in Honduras and I wanted to start a new life. </p> <p>It took us more than a month to get to the United States. We traveled from Honduras to Guatemala on a bus. There were gangsters on board who put a gun to my head, asking for all my money. I didn\u2019t have any but they didn\u2019t believe me. They took my pants off. I don\u2019t remember their faces. I just remember their hands. I remember hands touching me all over my body and I couldn\u2019t say anything. </p> <p>I was 14.</p> <p>We stayed in Guatemala for a day and then got in a van to travel to Mexico. We had to lie down with many people, one on top of the other. The coyotes [smugglers] put cardboard on top of us so la Migra<strong> </strong>[the authorities]<strong> </strong>wouldn\u2019t see us if they pulled us over. It was hard to breathe. We then walked through the Mexican desert for days. There were around 20 people in our group from all over the world. Some people got lost and didn\u2019t make it. On the second day, I became too weak, so my father paid the coyotes extra for a little pill to give me energy. After that, we rode in a van from Texas to northern California. There was a hiding place under the floor where they put us.

I got fake papers that said I was 21, even though I was really 14. Then I started working at a laundry doing two shifts a day. I started at seven in the morning and I got out at one the next morning. I was also sending money to my mom. One night my dad got angry and hit me, so I ran away to stay with a friend. I became depressed and lost my job. I didn\u2019t want to work or eat.</p> <p>A friend took me to San Francisco human services and I was put into the foster care system. The foster mother was old and she barely gave me anything to eat. She made me clean the house, so I was working for her without pay. She put me in summer school, and I passed out three times because I was starving. The foster program paid the foster mom around $600 per month to take care of me, but she\u2019d take me to garage sales and buy me used clothes with holes. Then she used the money from social services to buy things for her daughter at the mall and gave the receipts to the social worker.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know how the system worked because no one told me that foster parents are not supposed to treat you like this. Even though the social worker spoke Spanish, she never asked me, \u201cSoledad, how is everything going?\u201d They\u2019re supposed to talk to the child but we never had a private conversation about what was happening in the house. I was scared and nobody was there for me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even though the social worker spoke Spanish, she never asked me, 'Soledad, how is everything going?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I turned 18, I moved to San Francisco to continue my education. Accessing housing and the education system was difficult. I eventually enrolled at City College and got a job at Safeway, ringing up customers, cleaning the floor. I was working full-time and taking classes but lived in poor conditions.</p> <p>Many Americans think that migrants come here to take their jobs, to do bad things, to take advantage of the country. These ideas are not right \u2013 we are not bad people. I came here to survive, to do better in this world, to help my family and other people. There was no way to survive in my homeland. I was suffering from extreme poverty. I was physically and sexually abused. I didn\u2019t choose to come here; I didn\u2019t have another option.</p> <p>And it\u2019s been hard here in the United States: learning a new language and experiencing abuse in the foster care system; working multiple jobs and still being unable to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/dec/11/immigration-border-seized-items-photographs\">Shoes, pills, diaries: objects seized by border officials \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I worked very hard at school, and I later transferred to San Francisco State University, where I graduated with a degree in liberal studies and criminal justice.

It doesn\u2019t even end if we are lucky enough to be granted asylum. The story, the hardships, the aspirations continue in the US. Improved immigration policies and humane asylum procedures are critical, but they are only a first step. Everyone needs protection and support. My dream is to become a social worker and improve the foster system so other children in the US don\u2019t have to go through what I did.

I was also sending money to my mom. One night my dad got angry and hit me, so I ran away to stay with a friend. I became depressed and lost my job. I didn\u2019t want to work or eat. A friend took me to San Francisco human services and I was put into the foster care system. The foster mother was old and she barely gave me anything to eat. She made me clean the house, so I was working for her without pay. She put me in summer school, and I passed out three times because I was starving. The foster program paid the foster mom around $600 per month to take care of me, but she\u2019d take me to garage sales and buy me used clothes with holes. Then she used the money from social services to buy things for her daughter at the mall and gave the receipts to the social worker. I didn\u2019t know how the system worked because no one told me that foster parents are not supposed to treat you like this. Even though the social worker spoke Spanish, she never asked me, \u201cSoledad, how is everything going?\u201d They\u2019re supposed to talk to the child but we never had a private conversation about what was happening in the house. I was scared and nobody was there for me. When I turned 18, I moved to San Francisco to continue my education. Accessing housing and the education system was difficult. I eventually enrolled at City College and got a job at Safeway, ringing up customers, cleaning the floor. I was working full-time and taking classes but lived in poor conditions. Many Americans think that migrants come here to take their jobs, to do bad things, to take advantage of the country. These ideas are not right \u2013 we are not bad people. I came here to survive, to do better in this world, to help my family and other people. There was no way to survive in my homeland. I was suffering from extreme poverty. I was physically and sexually abused. I didn\u2019t choose to come here; I didn\u2019t have another option. And it\u2019s been hard here in the United States: learning a new language and experiencing abuse in the foster care system; working multiple jobs and still being unable to make ends meet. I worked very hard at school, and I later transferred to San Francisco State University, where I graduated with a degree in liberal studies and criminal justice. I currently work as a housing case manager for homeless youth in San Francisco, supporting them with accessing housing, education, and employment \u2013 all the areas I struggled with as a young migrant. I want everyone to know that the story doesn\u2019t end once migrants cross the border. It doesn\u2019t even end if we are lucky enough to be granted asylum. The story, the hardships, the aspirations continue in the US. Improved immigration policies and humane asylum procedures are critical, but they are only a first step. Everyone needs protection and support. My dream is to become a social worker and improve the foster system so other children in the US don\u2019t have to go through what I did. I want to make our cities safe, livable, healthy places for all people. I walked through the desert for days \u2013 to have these opportunities. On International Migrants Day this month \u2013 and beyond \u2013 seek out migrants in your community and listen to their stories. There are many ways you can support young migrants, such as donating or volunteering. Migrant narratives don\u2019t end once we arrive in our new communities. We\u2019re a part of this fabric and our stories aren\u2019t over. Soledad Castillo is an advisory board member at Voice of Witness, a not-for-profit human rights organization. She shared her story in the book Solito, Solita: Crossing Borders With Youth Refugees From Central America. She works as a housing case manager in San Francisco \u2022 The headline and subheading on this article was amended on 19 December 2019 to clarify that Castillo walked to the US, not America as we had it earlier, which includes both Honduras and the US.",

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s begin by borrowing a phrase by Alexandre Dumas <em>fils</em>: \u201cThe chains of marriage are so heavy that it takes two to bear them and sometimes three.\u201d</p> <p>In my 13th novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/isabelle-in-the-afternoon-9780091953744.html/\">Isabelle in the Afternoon</a>, a young American named Sam discovers <em>la</em> <em>verit\u00e9</em> at the heart of that epigram as he begins an intense but very circumscribed liaison with a married French woman in her late 30s. It\u2019s an affair that continues for more than three decades. The novel asks: is carnal desire more intense and profound when outside the strictures of marriage? It\u2019s a question posed by many writers, as adultery and other variants on illicit romance have always been key themes in fiction.</p> <p>On which note, here are my 10 favourite novels on the agonies and ecstasies of the extramarital adventure:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/26/100-best-novels-the-end-of-the-affair-graham-greene-observer-robert-mccrum\">The End of the Affair by Graham Greene</a></strong><br>A male novelist \u2013 unmarried, living a solipsistic existence in south London during the blitz \u2013 begins an affair with a senior civil servant\u2019s wife. He becomes obsessed with claiming Sarah as his own. His jealousy is fuelled by the despair of knowing that he will probably never have a proper life with her. And then there is her entrenched Catholicism. A brilliantly constructed novel about the way in which passion can often become a game of obsessive ownership.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/madame-bovary-9781509842889.html\">Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert</a></strong><br>It could be argued that the modern novel commenced with Flaubert\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 because it stands as the first work of fiction that grappled with the nightmare of marriage at its most prosaic. Of course Flaubert shocked the guardians of moral propriety by having his not-so\u2013bright heroine \u2013 whose has married a third-tier provincial doctor \u2013 starting an affair with a military man in town on secondment. Flaubert not only invented the so-called \u201cdesperate housewife\u201d genre, but also spoke a truth that few then or now want to recognise: stepping out from the bonds of fidelity is often a response to boredom.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-easter-parade-9780099518563.html\">The Easter Parade by Richard Yates</a></strong><br>Yes, Yates\u2019s 1961 novel Revolutionary Road remains a postwar American classic. But 15 years later he produced another masterpiece of national despair. The Easter Parade follows the sad destinies of two sisters who become unhinged after their parents\u2019 divorce. Sarah goes on to be a sad housewife. Emily makes a disastrous marriage, drifts from one bad affair to another, quietly embraces alcoholism. What Yates captures brilliantly in this tightly constructed novel \u2013 which spans five decades \u2013 is the way that drifting from one casual fling (often with a married man) to the next becomes an accumulated articulation of deep inner despair \u2026 and an even deeper malaise at the heart of the country.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-awakening-9780241341421.html\">The Awakening by Kate Chopin</a></strong><br> An absolute gem, first published in 1899 \u2013 now regarded as a landmark in American literature, even if many an upholder of the puritanical status quo back then condemned it as immoral. It\u2019s the story of Edna, who has married well and is comfortably placed in the world of the New Orleans bourgeoisie. But she has begun to question the way society has forced her into the role of adoring spouse and baby provider. When a certain young man makes his romantic yearnings known \u2013 and when another suitor makes an amorous move while Edna\u2019s husband is out of town \u2013 well, in true 19th-century style it all ends tragically. Chopin defied established proprieties by showing the sexual desires of a married woman outside the stifling conjugal bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0be65cfe193b81f434e42aa003501162e244d3a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0be65cfe193b81f434e42aa003501162e244d3a0/0_155_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jude Law as Karenin and Keira Knightley in the title role of Anna Karenina (2012).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charged carnality \u2026 Jude Law as Karenin and Keira Knightley in the title role of Anna Karenina (2012).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/rereading-anna-karenina-james-meek\">Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy</a></strong><br>One of the central cornerstones in the canon of world literature; a great state-of-the-nation novel that also deals with the absolute messiness of the human heart and the way that the biggest mystery in life might just happen to be yourself. An illicit love affair between two aristos also becomes a sweeping portrait of tsarist Russia and a daring (for its time) treatise on the charged carnality of the extramarital. And it remains a profound statement about how that very human pursuit of happiness is always just that \u2013 a pursuit.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/oct/05/alison-lurie-war-between-tates-foreign-affairs\">Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie</a></strong><br>Winner of a mid-80s Pulitzer prize, Lurie\u2019s novel is a sharp look at a lonely, single, deeply unloved American female academic on sabbatical in London. Her intellectual rigour and her misanthropy are upended when she meets, on the flight over, a gauche, chain-smoking, defiantly unintellectual fellow from Tulsa. Although she dismisses him initially as a married yahoo, something extraordinary develops between them. A smart, quietly piercing novel about love\u2019s improbable narratives.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/deception-9780099801900.html\">Deception by Philip Roth</a></strong><br>A much underrated novel from Roth\u2019s expatriate London years. A writer named Philip, immersed in midlife blues, is having an affair with an elegant Englishwoman still some years away from the precipice of turning 40 but stuck in a catastrophic marriage. A novel almost entirely composed of dialogue, its pre/post-coital conversations speak volumes about the furtive, edgy passionate intimacy that two people bring to the hours they set aside for their clandestine adventure.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/rabbit-run-9780141187839.html\">Rabbit, Run by John Updike</a></strong><br>Though Updike was looked upon in the 1960s as the master of suburban adultery, please go back to his early masterpiece Rabbit, Run for its affecting yet uncompromising portrait of failed American promise and the stifling tedium of marriage. As it follows a high school basketball star whose life shifts into day-to-day banality after he marries his pregnant sweetheart and tries to make ends meet with a dismal sales job, we see him drift into an adulterous affair. The inherent musicality of Updike\u2019s prose is here married to a vision of American life that underscores the need for eroticism as a way of escaping the prosaic.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-9780571135394.html\">The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera</a></strong><br>Can you adore your spouse but still have multiple affairs? Why should sex outside love (and the vows of marriage) be considered a breach of all sorts of societal norms? To be compulsively attached to the sex act \u2026 is this an addiction or a positive existential choice? These complex moral questions, for which there are no definitive answers, are played out in a Czechoslovakia reeling under Soviet domination at the height of the cold war. Kundera\u2019s ever-dazzling novel is finely attuned to the contradictory interplay of the libido and the quasi-stability of long-term love.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/25/top-10-books-about-escape-from-captivity-toby-litt-jane-austen\">Top 10 books about escape from captivity | Toby Litt</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-postman-always-rings-twice-9780752864365.html\">The Postman Always Rings Twice by James M Cain</a></strong><br>Cain was a seriously great writer working in the genre of crime fiction; a chronicler of small desperate lives in the Great American Nowhere. The Postman \u2026 is a straightforward tale of a drifter who ends up at a diner in a dusty corner of California owned by a blob of a guy \u2013 who also has a garage and a very young, sultry American wife, bored to despair by her husband. Naturally, the drifter picks up her sexual need. Naturally he fulfils it. Naturally they begin to plot her husband\u2019s death.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s begin by borrowing a phrase by Alexandre Dumas fils: \u201cThe chains of marriage are so heavy that it takes two to bear them and sometimes three.\u201d In my 13th novel, Isabelle in the Afternoon, a young American named Sam discovers la verit\u00e9 at the heart of that epigram as he begins an intense but very circumscribed liaison with a married French woman in her late 30s. It\u2019s an affair that continues for more than three decades. The novel asks: is carnal desire more intense and profound when outside the strictures of marriage? It\u2019s a question posed by many writers, as adultery and other variants on illicit romance have always been key themes in fiction. On which note, here are my 10 favourite novels on the agonies and ecstasies of the extramarital adventure: 1. The End of the Affair by Graham Greene A male novelist \u2013 unmarried, living a solipsistic existence in south London during the blitz \u2013 begins an affair with a senior civil servant\u2019s wife. He becomes obsessed with claiming Sarah as his own. His jealousy is fuelled by the despair of knowing that he will probably never have a proper life with her. And then there is her entrenched Catholicism. A brilliantly constructed novel about the way in which passion can often become a game of obsessive ownership. 2. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert It could be argued that the modern novel commenced with Flaubert\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 because it stands as the first work of fiction that grappled with the nightmare of marriage at its most prosaic. Of course Flaubert shocked the guardians of moral propriety by having his not-so\u2013bright heroine \u2013 whose has married a third-tier provincial doctor \u2013 starting an affair with a military man in town on secondment. Flaubert not only invented the so-called \u201cdesperate housewife\u201d genre, but also spoke a truth that few then or now want to recognise: stepping out from the bonds of fidelity is often a response to boredom. 3. The Easter Parade by Richard Yates Yes, Yates\u2019s 1961 novel Revolutionary Road remains a postwar American classic. But 15 years later he produced another masterpiece of national despair. The Easter Parade follows the sad destinies of two sisters who become unhinged after their parents\u2019 divorce. Sarah goes on to be a sad housewife. Emily makes a disastrous marriage, drifts from one bad affair to another, quietly embraces alcoholism. What Yates captures brilliantly in this tightly constructed novel \u2013 which spans five decades \u2013 is the way that drifting from one casual fling (often with a married man) to the next becomes an accumulated articulation of deep inner despair \u2026 and an even deeper malaise at the heart of the country. 4. The Awakening by Kate Chopin An absolute gem, first published in 1899 \u2013 now regarded as a landmark in American literature, even if many an upholder of the puritanical status quo back then condemned it as immoral. It\u2019s the story of Edna, who has married well and is comfortably placed in the world of the New Orleans bourgeoisie. But she has begun to question the way society has forced her into the role of adoring spouse and baby provider. When a certain young man makes his romantic yearnings known \u2013 and when another suitor makes an amorous move while Edna\u2019s husband is out of town \u2013 well, in true 19th-century style it all ends tragically. Chopin defied established proprieties by showing the sexual desires of a married woman outside the stifling conjugal bed. 5. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy One of the central cornerstones in the canon of world literature; a great state-of-the-nation novel that also deals with the absolute messiness of the human heart and the way that the biggest mystery in life might just happen to be yourself. An illicit love affair between two aristos also becomes a sweeping portrait of tsarist Russia and a daring (for its time) treatise on the charged carnality of the extramarital. And it remains a profound statement about how that very human pursuit of happiness is always just that \u2013 a pursuit. 6. Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie Winner of a mid-80s Pulitzer prize, Lurie\u2019s novel is a sharp look at a lonely, single, deeply unloved American female academic on sabbatical in London. Her intellectual rigour and her misanthropy are upended when she meets, on the flight over, a gauche, chain-smoking, defiantly unintellectual fellow from Tulsa. Although she dismisses him initially as a married yahoo, something extraordinary develops between them. A smart, quietly piercing novel about love\u2019s improbable narratives. 7. Deception by Philip Roth A much underrated novel from Roth\u2019s expatriate London years. A writer named Philip, immersed in midlife blues, is having an affair with an elegant Englishwoman still some years away from the precipice of turning 40 but stuck in a catastrophic marriage. A novel almost entirely composed of dialogue, its pre/post-coital conversations speak volumes about the furtive, edgy passionate intimacy that two people bring to the hours they set aside for their clandestine adventure. 8. Rabbit, Run by John Updike Though Updike was looked upon in the 1960s as the master of suburban adultery, please go back to his early masterpiece Rabbit, Run for its affecting yet uncompromising portrait of failed American promise and the stifling tedium of marriage. As it follows a high school basketball star whose life shifts into day-to-day banality after he marries his pregnant sweetheart and tries to make ends meet with a dismal sales job, we see him drift into an adulterous affair. The inherent musicality of Updike\u2019s prose is here married to a vision of American life that underscores the need for eroticism as a way of escaping the prosaic. 9. The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera Can you adore your spouse but still have multiple affairs? Why should sex outside love (and the vows of marriage) be considered a breach of all sorts of societal norms? To be compulsively attached to the sex act \u2026 is this an addiction or a positive existential choice? These complex moral questions, for which there are no definitive answers, are played out in a Czechoslovakia reeling under Soviet domination at the height of the cold war. Kundera\u2019s ever-dazzling novel is finely attuned to the contradictory interplay of the libido and the quasi-stability of long-term love. 10. The Postman Always Rings Twice by James M Cain Cain was a seriously great writer working in the genre of crime fiction; a chronicler of small desperate lives in the Great American Nowhere. The Postman \u2026 is a straightforward tale of a drifter who ends up at a diner in a dusty corner of California owned by a blob of a guy \u2013 who also has a garage and a very young, sultry American wife, bored to despair by her husband. Naturally, the drifter picks up her sexual need. Naturally he fulfils it. Naturally they begin to plot her husband\u2019s death. Written with a spare, dustbowl lyricism it is the best adultery noir ever written. \u2022 Isabelle in the Afternoon by Douglas Kennedy is published by Hutchinson on 9 January.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI see Chris Kamara has released a Christmas album, which led me to wonder if any football teams have ever released a Christmas record?\u201d asks David Wesley. \u201cQPR released this oddity but as a lip-sync it wouldn\u2019t have been released.\u201d Unbelievable though it may seem Jeff readers, Kamara has indeed released an album of festive songs but, much like his pitchside reporting for Soccer Saturday, his overexcitement has affected his performance in the charts. By releasing Here\u2019s To Christmas in November it would appear that he has peaked too soon \u2013 at No 8 in the album charts last month \u2013 and has slipped down the top 100 to No 64 at the time of publication. Kamara\u2019s velvet singing voice is worlds away from the yelping character we see trying to make sense of football matches every weekend and when he was given the opportunity to warble into a microphone in a more tuneful manner he could not pass it up. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve always liked a bit of singing,\u201d Kamara told the Express and Star. \u201cSo to sing with a 22-piece big band and a conductor, it blows your mind away. It\u2019s all your Christmases coming into one. It\u2019s like a dream. Even if people don\u2019t like my singing, they can listen to the music. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d It\u2019s certainly incredible he was given this opportunity.

Do you want to see Neil Lennon conducting a choir singing We Three Kings? Here\u2019s Celtic\u2019s Christmas offering this year then. Lovely, yes? And here\u2019s Petr Cech drumming his way through a collection of seasonal ditties at Arsenal back in 2015. Much like the QOR effort above, Everton did their best to bring their fans a little cheer back in 2013 with some lip-syncing. Perhaps the most festive football team in Europe is Union Berlin, now of the Bundesliga. The right-on Berliners host an annual Christmas carols singalong in their stadium in which players and up to 30,000 of their fans can wave candles around sing Christmas songs on the pitch until they are full up on seasonal cheer. Not so tuneful is Aleksandar Kolarov reciting the words to Jingle Bells from a clipboard as though Manchester City were holding him against his will in 2012. It proved so popular that fans demanded he spread more Christmas cheer the following year. And yes, yes, we know this isn\u2019t a footballer singing a Christmas song, but fitting 119 footballers\u2019 names into the tune of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas is still some feat.

We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do.Make a contribution. Here\u2019s a recap of today: Tomorrow, the full House of Representatives will vote on articles of impeachment against Trump: one for abuse of power, and one for obstruction of Congress. The House Rules Committee is still working to set the rules for tomorrow\u2019s debate. Across the country, demonstrators are rallying for impeachment. It appears Democrats have all the votes they need to impeach the president, amidst speculation over how Democrats from conservative districts will vote. Catch up on impeachment news, and tune in tomorrow for more live coverage. Bill Taylor, who provided a firsthand account of US officials negotiating a quid pro quo, is expected to leave his post as acting ambassador to Ukraine in January, according to multiple reports. Taylor\u2019s appointment in Kiev expires in January, and he will not seek to extend his stay, sources have told NBC and CNN. Tens of thousands of people across the country are expected to attend rallies in support of impeachment. Some of these protests are already underway in Washington, New York City, Philadelphia, Charleston and Cleaveland. The demonstrations were organized by the advocacy group MoveOn.org, with the support of other progressive organizations. On the night before the full Hosue of Representatives will consider articles, hundreds of profestors showed up at the steps of the US Capitol, urging members of Congress to vote for impeachment. Elsewhere, bundled-up demonstrators marched through the streets. Here\u2019s a scene from Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Houston, Texas: The mayor of Salem, Massachusetts has taken issue with Donald Trump and his supporters comparing the impeachment process with the witch trials. \u201cOy vey,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cLearn some history.\u201d She recommended some books on the history of Massachusetts for the president. As the House prepares to vote on articles of impeachment against Trump tomorrow, Gabbard \u2014 who is publicly undecided on impeachment \u2014 is expected to introduce an alternative, according to ABC. The 2020 presidential candidate and Hawaii representative plans to introduce a measure that will formally censure the president. Gabbard has criticized the impeachment inquiry as \u201cpartisan\u201d. Andrew Jackson is the only president that has been censured in this way. Democrats have the votes to impeach Donald Trump, according to a tally by the Associated Press. Though there has been some speculation around how some centrist Democrats and those from Republican-leaning districts would vote, it appears that the Nancy Pelosi has enough votes to see the impeachment through. From the AP: One by one centrist Democrats, including many freshmen lawmakers who risk reelection in districts where the president is popular, announced this week that they would support the articles of impeachment. The first article on abuse of power now has a majority.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is all but certain to have the numbers as debate begins Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment that charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Per most tallies, 218 members have indicated they\u2019ll vote for at least one article of impeachment, 198 are likely to vote against, and 15 haven\u2019t indicated how they\u2019ll vote. As speculation over exactly how the impeachment votes tomorrow will break down, one freshman Democrat from a Republican-leaning district has said he\u2019ll split his vote \u2014 yes on the abuse of power but no on obstruction of Congress. Representative Jared Golden of Maine is one of several Democratic members of Congress who narrowly defeated Republican challengers in districts that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. The Bangor Daily News reports: The congressman has worked to draw a line between his October vote in support of the impeachment inquiry and his feelings on whether Trump should be impeached, but he has been hammered by Republicans running against him in the 2020 election. Since House Democrats have enough members to advance the articles to a Senate trial even with Republican opposition, the effect Golden\u2019s vote will be largely on him. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House rules committee is still holding its hearing on setting debate parameters for tomorrow\u2019s vote on the impeachment resolution, but the panel\u2019s discussion has largely focused on relitigating the accusations against Trump. The president sent a fiery letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, condemning the impeachment inquiry and accusing Democrats of declaring \u201copen war on American Democracy.\u201d Mitch McConnell said he would not be an \u201cimpartial juror\u201d when the Senate holds its impeachment trial. \u201cThis is a political process,\u201d the Senate majority leader told reporters. \u201cI expect we will have a largely partisan outcome in the Senate. I\u2019m not impartial about this at all.\u201d The House passed its massive $1.3 trillion funding deal, which would allow the government to avoid a shutdown at the end of the week, and Trump is expecetd to sign it. Several more Democrats from Trump districts have said they will vote in favor of impeachment, quashing Republican hopes of attracting bipartisan opposition to the resolution. Joe Biden released a letter from his doctor, saying he was a \u201chealthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male\u201d who could perform all the duties of the presidency. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.

The House rules committee is still holding its hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution, more than five hours after chairman Jim McGovern gaveled in the hearing. Members of the rules committees are still largely relitigating the accusations against Trump contained in the impeachment resolution, while largely avoiding discussion of the parameters for tomorrow\u2019s debate. The full House is expected to take up the procedural rule tomorrow morning before debating the impeachment resolution itself. Three more staffers working for congressman Jeff Van Drew, the House Democrat who has signaled he will switch parties over his opposition to impeachment, have reportedly resigned. Van Drew has dodged reporters\u2019 questions today about whether he will switch his party affiliation to Republican, but Trump praised the New Jersey lawmaker in a tweet late last night. The timing of tomorrow\u2019s impeachment debate is starting to become clearer, with the final House vote expected no earlier than 4:30 p.m. E.T., according to a Fox News reporter. House members will meet at 9 a.m. E.T., but they will not be able to debate the impeachment resolution itself right away. First, members will have to vote on the rules establishing parameters for debate on the resolution, which the House rules committee is currently discussing. Once the rule is passed, members will move on to debating the actual impeachment resolution, which could last several hours. It\u2019s likely the bill will pass shortly before Trump takes the stage for his campaign rally in Michigan tomorrow night. In case there wasn\u2019t enough happening on Capitol Hill this week, the House is on track to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreeement by Thursday, likely making it the last piece of business before lawmakers leave for the holidays. The FISA court has issued a public rebuke of the FBI over its handling of warrant applications on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, ordering the bureau to tell the court how it intends to improve its practices. The Wall Street Journal reports: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\u2014which operates in near total secret\u2014called a recent watchdog report \u2018troubling\u2019 and described the behavior of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as \u2018antithetical to the heightened duty of candor\u2019 owed to the court. The court ordered the government to explain to the court by early next year what steps it was taking to prevent such lapses in the future. The court order comes after a critical watchdog report found serious lapses in the FBI\u2019s handling of the warrant against Mr. Page. Joe Biden has released a summary of his medical history, providing the most in-depth look at his health since the former vice president ran alongside Barack Obama in 2008. \u201cVice President Biden is a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State, and Commander in Chief,\u201d wrote Kevin C. O\u2019Connor, the director of executive medicine at the GW Medical Faculty Associates who served as Biden\u2019s physician when he was vice president. O\u2019Connor noted Biden was being treated for several conditions, including an irregular heartbeat and gastroesophageal reflux, but said those ailments should not prevent him from performing his duties as president. \u201cHe does not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol at all, and he works out at least five days per week,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote. The three top-polling candidates in the Democratic presidential primary --Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are all in their 70\u2019s, raising concerns about the health of the eventual nominee. Warren released a letter from her longtime doctor earlier this month, which described the Massachusetts senator as \u201cvery healthy.\u201d Sanders, who suffered a heart attack in October, has promised to release his medical records by the end of the year.

Congressman Jeff Van Drew, the House Democrat who has signaled he intends to switch parties over his opposition to impeachment, has reportedly bashed Trump in the past. The Daily Beast reports: Behind closed doors, Van Drew has told colleagues that the president was stupid and mentally unstable\u2014and that his opposition to impeachment stemmed from his belief that impeaching Trump would ensure his re-election, according to two Democrats present at closed-door discussions with the congressman. A third verified Van Drew had disparaged the president in harsh terms, calling him \u2018crazy.\u2019 \u2018He was almost obsessively anti-Trump,\u2019 said one of the Democrats. \u2018His only justification, and this was adamant, was that he thinks that [impeachment] will help Trump win.\u2019 Of the 31 House Democrats representing districts that Trump won in 2016, only two have not yet signaled how they will vote on the impeachment resolution. The overwhelming majority of the Democratic lawmakers -- 27 of them -- have said they will vote to impeach the president, while two have indicated they will oppose the resolution. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who reportedly plans to switch his party affiliation to Republican over his opposition to impeachment, is now dodging reporters\u2019 questions about whether he will make the change. But several of Van Drew\u2019s staffers have already quit in protest of his plans, and the president tweeted out praise for the New Jersey congressman late last night. Two more House Democrats from Trump districts, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, have confirmed they intend to vote in favor of impeaching the president. The announcements from the two congresswomen leave very few House Democrats who have not yet declared their support, quashing Republican hopes of picking off lawmakers across the aisle in order to claim bipartisan opposition to impeachment. Over on Capitol Hill, the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative Democrats, have just ejected congressman Jeff Van Drew as a member following reports the New Jersey lawmaker intended to switch parties over his opposition to impeachment. \u201cPer our by laws, which require all members to be a member of the Democratic Party, Congressman Van Drew is no longer a member of the Blue Dog Coalition,\u201d chairwoman Stephanie Murray said. However, when asked about the news by a reporter, Van Drew interestingly appeared to raise doubt about whether he would actually switch his party affiliation to Republican. \u201cThey are doing that on the basis of the fact that it is a Demcoratic \u2014 and a good one \u2014 organization, and you could not be a member if you were to change. And they are assuming I\u2019m going to change,\u201d Van Drew said. The president certainly seems to be under the impression that Van Drew is switching parties, tweeting out praise for the congressman late last night. While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office moments ago, Trump slammed the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cmark on our country.\u201d \u201cOther presidents, in the future, unless they do something about this, other presidents are going to have to live with this,\u201d Trump said, echoing an argument fro his Republican allies in Congress. Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office whether he assumed any responsibility for the trajectory of the impeachment inquiry, Trump replied that he did not. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t take any. Zero, to put it mildly,\u201d Trump responded. As Trump condemned the impeachment inquiry as an unconstitutional abuse of congressional power, Mitch McConnell was busy foreclosing any chance of an impartial Senate trial. \u201cI am not an impartial juror,\u201d the Senate majority leader told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis is a political process. ... I expect we will have a largely partisan outcome in the Senate. I\u2019m not impartial about this at all.\u201d As the White House released an angry letter from Trump condemning the impeachment inquiry, the president himself similarly criticized House Democrats while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cThe whole impeachment thing is a hoax,\u201d Trump told reporters as he welcomed the Guatemalan president to the White House. \u201cWe look forward to getting on to the Senate. ... We\u2019re not entitled to anything in the House. It\u2019s a total sham.\u201d Trump defended his July phone call with the Ukrainian president, which kicked off the impeachment inquiry, as \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d and insisted Republicans are united in supporting him. Trump\u2019s letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the impeachment inquiry reads much like his Twitter feed, complete with exclamation points and accusations of Democrats \u201cdeclaring open war on American Democracy.\u201d \u201cYou have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!\u201d Trump wrote in the letter. The president goes on to claim he has done nothing wrong in regards to his actions toward Ukraine, predicting Democrats will suffer electoral losses next year because of the impeachment inquiry. Trump has sent a six-page letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi condemning the impeachment inquiry, calling it an \u201cunprecedented and unconstiutional abuse of power.\u201d The House has passed its $1.3 trillion funding bill, likely avoiding a government shutdown at the end of the week -- assuming Trump follows through on signing it. The first of the two bills -- which repealed three taxes in the Affordable Care Act and rasied the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21, among other things -- passed 297-120. The second -- which controversially included funding for Trump\u2019s border wall -- passed with a vote of 280-138. Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said this morning the president was expected to sign the bills to avoid a government shutdown, even though Trump has previously complained about such massive spending bills. Another House Democrat from a Trump district, Cindy Axne of Iowa, has announced she will support impeachment when the resolution is taken up for a chamber-wide vote tomorrow. Trump carried Iowa\u2019s 3rd congressional district by 3 points in 2016, but Axne won her race last year by 2 points. The vice president, Mike Pence, said in an interview this week with a local Des Moines news outlet that Iowans should contact Axne to encourage her to vote \u201cno\u201d on impeachment. Apparently, the congresswoman chose to ignore the vice president\u2019s advice. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House rules committee is in the middle of holding its hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution, although the panel\u2019s discussion so far has focused on relitigating the accusations against Trump. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Chuck Schumer\u2019s suggestion of tying the resolution outlining impeachment trial procedures to Democratic requestsfor White House officials to testify. More House Democrats from Trump districts, including Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Abby Finkenauer of Iowa, have said they will vote in favor of impeachment -- stemming Republican hopes of crafting bipartisan opposition to the resolution. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Jim McGovern, the Democratic chairman of the House rules committee, has recessed the panel\u2019s hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution to allow for floor votes. After more than two hours of questioning from McGovern and Tom Cole, the Republican ranking member, the committee has not yet turned to discussing debate procedures. Intead, Democrat Jamie Raskin and Republican Doug Collins, two members of the House judiciary committee, have simply relitigated the accusations against Trump and whether they are legitimate. Congressman Steny Hoyer, the Democratic House majority leader, has said he expects a \u201csignificant\u201d number of \u201chours\u201d for floor debate on the impeachment resolution, throwing the timing of the chamber-wide vote tomorrow into question. Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer, another freshman House Democrat whose district voted for Trump in 2016, has said she will support impeaching the president. Finkenauer\u2019s Iowa district voted for Trump by 4 points in 2016, while the congresswoman won her seat by 5 points last year. The House rules committee hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution has dissolved into a partisan debate over the intelligence committee\u2019s handling of the inquiry. Republicans Tom Cole, the ranking member of the rules committee, and Doug Collins, the ranking member of the judiciary committee, are arguing the intelligence committee oversaw an unfair process that reflected poorly upon the president, while Democrat Jamie Raskin has emphasized Trump chose not to send a representative to the judiciary committee hearings to defend himself. The hearing has been underway for almost two hours at this point, and the conversation has not yet turned to specific debate procedures for tomorrow\u2019s floor debate. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence for tax fraud and conspiracy, has reportedly been hospitalized for a \u201ccardiac event.\u201d ABC News reports: Manafort has been serving out his sentence as of late in a federal correction institute in central Pennsylvania. Manafort has been recovering since last Thursday at a local Pennsylvania hospital under the watch of correctional officers. Sources tell ABC News the 70 year old longtime Republican strategist is stable and could be released soon. Manafort was scheduled for a court appearance on Wednesday but his attorney was informed that he would not be appearing. Todd Blanche, who has represented Manafort since his conviction, tells ABC News, that he has not communicated with Manafort since early last week. The news comes the same day that Manafort\u2019s former deputy, Rick Gates, was sentenced to 45 days in jail stemming from his 2018 guilty plea for conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, is not present for today\u2019s rules committee hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution -- which has somewhat hampered Republicans\u2019 strategy today. Nadler traveled back to New York for a family medical emergency but is expected to return to Washington for tomorrow\u2019s floor debate on the impeachment resolution. As the House rules committee holds it hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution, intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff has called on the vice president\u2019s office to declassify a supplemental letter from aide Jennifer Williams, who testified during the public impeachment hearings. Schiff argued the letter \u201craises profound questions\u201d about what Mike Pence knew of Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to open investigations and is \u201cdirectly relevant to Congress\u2019s consideration of articles of impeachment.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, your unwillingness to declassify the Supplemental Submission raises the serious question of whether your continuing efforts to obstruct the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry are intended not just to protect President Trump, but yourself as well,\u201d Schiff wrote. A Democratic senator praised the performance of congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the House judiciary committee and a former constitutional law professor presenting the party\u2019s position on the articles of impeachment. Raskin\u2019s experitse has proven helpful to House Democrats as they navigate the impeachment inquiry, and his name has been raised as a potential impeachment manager. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the House judiciary committee and a former constitutional law professor, is explaining why impeachment is in the constitution and why abuse of power is an impeachable offense, demonstrating the expertise he has offered throughout the inquiry. CNN has more details on the sentencing of Rick Gates, the former deputy to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort who became a key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation: He agreed to plead guilty to related charges of conspiracy and lying to investigators in February 2018. He also signed up to cooperate, giving Mueller\u2019s team key insights into Manafort and Trump\u2019s actions in 2016 during the height of the Russia investigations. \u2018I accept complete responsibility for my actions,\u2019 Gates told Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Tuesday. Gates will also pay a $20,000 fine and fulfill 300 hours of community service. He will be allowed to serve his jail sentence on weekends during his three years of probation. Jackson made clear that the failure of Gates, and his former boss Manafort, to disclose they were lobbying on behalf of Ukrainian clients was a significant wrong. \u2018When people don\u2019t have the facts, democracy fails to work,\u2019 Jackson said. The judge said she believed that Gates was motivated by greed, and rejected one letter of support that suggested politics was a factor. Congressman Doug Collins, the Republican ranking member of the House judidicary committee, warned that Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry would come back to haunt them. \u201cThe clock and the calendar are terrible masters, and they leave to awful results,\u201d Collins said while appearing before the rules committee. \u201cAnd yes, there will be a day of reckoning.\u201d Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign official who was a close ally of Paul Manafort\u2019s, has been sentenced to 45 days in jail and three years probation. Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI last year. Congressman Doug Collins, the Republican ranking member of the House judiciary committee, told the rules committee that it was a \u201csad day,\u201d criticizing Democratic leaders\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry. The Georgia Republican said Democrats were making decisions on impeachment based on \u201cthe clock and the calendar,\u201d rather than working in a bipartisan manner. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the House judiciary committee, outlined the accusations against Trump, accusing the president of \u201csystematic abuses of his powers.\u201d Raskin argued Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine represented the worst fears of America\u2019s founders about presidential overreach, requiring Congress to act. The Maryland Democrat also warned Trump\u2019s actions marked a \u201cconstitutional crime in progress up to this very minute,\u201d noting Rudy Giuliani\u2019s recent comments that he wanted Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, \u201cout of the way\u201d to push for investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the House judiciary committee and a former constitutional law professor, is now presenting his party\u2019s argument about the two articles of impeachment. Raskin is appearing in the place of judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler, who had to briefly leave Washinton for a family medical emergency. Raskin, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the House rules committee, offered warm wishes to Nadler and his family. Congressman Tom Cole, the Republican ranking member of the House rules committee, used his opening statement to criticize Democratic leaders\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquriy. \u201cMr. Chairman, it didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Cole said, noting polling has shown the American public is evenly split on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But Cole and chairman Jim McGovern both began their remarks by praising each other\u2019s work on the committee. Kendra Horn, a freshman House Democrat whose congressional district voted for Trump by more than 13 points in 2016, has just announced she will support impeachment. Given the relatively conservative make-up of her district, Horn had been watched closely for how she would vote on impeachment, but she has now confirmed she will join the overwhelming majority of the Democratic caucus to support the resolution. Congressman Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House rules committee, called on his Republican colleagues to criticize Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine. \u201cI get it \u2013 it\u2019s hard to criticize a president of your own party,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t matter here.\u201d The Massachusetts Democrat went on to extol the virtues of American democracy, recalling how he handed out leaflets as a young man for former presidential candidate George McGovern. \u201cNo relation, by the way,\u201d McGovern joked. Congressman Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House rules committee, has gaveled in the panel\u2019s hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution. McGovern began the hearing by outlining the allegations against Trump, accusing the president of holding up military assistance to a key ally, Ukraine, to extract a political favor. The House rules committee has gathered in its hearing room to start discussing debate procedures for the impeachment resolution, but senior Democratic aides say they have little sense of when the chamber-wide vote will take place. Chuck Schumer suggested there would be Senate votes on whether White House officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, would be called to testify during the likely impeachment trial. \u201cSenators who oppose this plan will have to explain why less evidence is better than more evidence,\u201d Schumer said of the Democratic proposal to have the four White House officials testify. In his Senate floor speech criticizing Mitch McConnell for rejecting his witness request, Chuck Schumer cited a new poll showing a significant majority of Americans believe Trump should allow his advisers to testify during a Senate impeachment trial. According to the Washington Post/ABC News poll, seven in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his aides to testify, and six in 10 expect a fair Senate trial. However, the American public remains sharply divided on the question of whether Trump should be removed from office. The poll found that 49% support removal, compared to 46% who oppose it. The House rules committee hearing on debate procedures for the impeachment resolution, which was set to start a few minutes ago, appears to be delayed. Chuck Schumer went to the Senate floor to criticize Mitch McConnell after the majority leader rejected Democrats\u2019 request to have four White House officials testify during the Senate impeachment trial. Schumer called the request a \u201cgood-faith proposal to kickstart the discussions that Leader McConnell has so far delayed,\u201d adding that he did not hear the Republican leader make a \u201csingle argument\u201d as to why the requested witnesses should not testify. Schumer has asked that four White House officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, be called to testify. \u201cImpeachment trials, like most trials, have witnesses,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cTo have none would be an abberation.\u201d The New York Democrat called on McConnell to provide \u201cspecific reasons why the four witnesses we\u2019ve asked for shouldn\u2019t testify.\u201d \u201cWhat is Leader McConnell afriad of? What is President Trump afraid of? The truth?\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBut the American people want the truth.\u201d In his fiery floor speech, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Chuk Schumer\u2019s efforts to tie a resolution outlining impeachment trial procedures to a Democratic request for White House officials to testify. Criticizing House Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry, McConnell accused Schumer of trying to launch a \u201cfishing expedition to see whether his own ideas can make Chairman Schiff\u2019s sloppy work more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell argued Chuck Schumer\u2019s request to have White House officials testify during the impeachment trial was an effort to make up for the House\u2019s inability to compel the Trump advisers to appear before impeachment investigators. \u201cIt is not the Senate\u2019s job to leap into the breach and search desperately for ways to \u201cget to \u2018guilty,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThat would hardly be impartial justice.\u201d The Kentucky Republican suggested House Democrats should not vote to impeach if they are expecting the Senate to do additional fact-finding. \u201cIf House Democrats\u2019 case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the Senate,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe answer is that the House should not impeach on this basis in the first place.\u201d On the subject of Chuck Schumer\u2019s letter calling on White House officials to testify during the likely impeachment trial, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell accused the minority leader of trying to \u201cshort circuit\u201d efforts to reach an agreement on trial procedures. McConnell said he would still meet with Schumer to discuss trial procedures, but he seemed very skeptical of allowing witnesses to testify. In his letter, Schumer specifically called on acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton to testify. \u201cThe Democratic leader wants to write a completely new set of rules,\u201d McConnell said. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is speaking on the Senate floor about the impeachment inquiry, calling the investigation the \u201cmost rushed, least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in recent history.\u201d The Kentucky Republican argued the result of the Democrats\u2019 months-long investigation was a \u201cslapdash work product.\u201d McConnell also offered a word of advice on the eve of the House\u2019s expected vote on the impeachment resolution. \u201cHouse Democrats still have an opportunity to do the right thing for the country,\u201d the Senate leader said. \u201cThe House can turn back and not deploy this constitutional remedy of last resort.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times, Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, detailed his conversations with Trump about Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled earlier this year. The Times reports: [Giuliani] described how he passed along to Mr. Trump \u2018a couple of times\u2019 accounts about how [Yovanovitch] had frustrated efforts that could be politically helpful to Mr. Trump. They included investigations involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ukrainians who disseminated documents that damaged Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The president in turn connected Mr. Giuliani with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who asked for more information, Mr. Giuliani said. Within weeks, Ms. Yovanovitch was recalled as ambassador at the end of April and was told that Mr. Trump had lost trust in her. ... \u2018There\u2019s a lot of reasons to move her,\u2019 Mr. Giuliani said, asserting that his briefings of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo most likely played a role in their decision to recall Ms. Yovanovitch. \u2018I think my information did,\u2019 he said. \u2018I don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask them. But they relied on it.\u2019 The Times\u2019 story came the same day that the New Yorker published an article in which Giuliani was quoted as saying he wanted Yovanovitch \u201cout of the way\u201d to push for investigations into Biden and the 2016 election. Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said Trump would sign the massive government spending deal, which is expected to pass the House this afternoon, to avoid a shutdown. But the $1.3 trillion spending bill has consequences far beyond keeping the government open. The Washington Post has more details: A high-profile conflict over border wall spending \u2014 the issue that sparked a record 35-day partial government shutdown a year ago \u2014 was resolved with a retreat to the status quo: Funding remains unchanged from 2019 levels at $1.375 billion, short of the $8.6 billion President Trump requested from Congress. ... The continuation of any border-wall funding is a blow to Democrats, who pushed to halt construction and block Trump from diverting funds appropriated for other projects. Trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico \u2014 not U.S. taxpayers \u2014 would pay for the wall. But Democrats touted significant wins elsewhere in the bill \u2014 including $25 million in funding for federal gun violence research and $425 million in election security grants, as well as a $208 million boost in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency.

As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do.Make a contribution. The majority of House Democrats representing districts that Trump carried in 2016 have now signaled they intend to support the president\u2019s impeachment, but several vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have not yet indicated how they will vote. The positions of these lawmakers will likely become clearer by tomorrow, when the impeachment resolution reaches the House floor for debate. The House is expected to vote this afternoon on its government spending deal, which would avoid a shutdown at the end of the week. Trump has not yet sent a clear signal on whether he will support the deal, although an adviser to former Republican House speaker Paul Ryan noted lawmakers have used a technicality to try to secure the president\u2019s signature. It appears the food services company Sodexo has reached an agreement with its employees at Loyola Marymount University, the site of Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate. The presidential candidates who have qualified for the debate threatened to boycott the event if the union dispute was not resolved, but this announcement should clear the way for the debate to continue as scheduled. Neil Gorsuch, the first of two US supreme court justices appointed by Trump, has appeared on Fox and Friends to tout his book \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It.\u201d His live interview on Trump\u2019s favorite morning TV show provoked expressions of disapproval on social media. Brian Stelter of CNN sniped: \u201cHow is it appropriate for a Supreme Court justice to try to goose sales of his three-month-old book by chatting on one of the most partisan shows on TV?\u201d In the end, the most outrageous thing about the Fox and Friends interview was that it failed to elicit a single interesting comment from the conservative justice. Plenty of folksy banter about Colorado fly-fishing, female in-laws and how the justices sing together at Christmas and on birthdays. But no questions on impeachment, Trump, Roe v Wade or any of the other seismic conflicts battering the nation\u2019s highest court. About the most grabby remark Gorsuch made was to lament that almost one in 10 American college graduates believe that Judith Sheindlin - better known as Judge Judy - sits on the US supreme court. The way this interview went, she might as well have been. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious set of reforms to fight global corruption, arguing that \u201cfinancial transparency is a necessary component of any responsible domestic and international policy agenda.\u201d \u201cAround the world -- in places including Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran \u2013 protesters are rising up against corruption and economic inequality,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post. \u201cThe United States must stand with them. Financial transparency is a necessary component of any responsible domestic and international policy agenda, but international controls are only as strong as their weakest links. The United States has the means to compel change, and we must lead by example.\u201d Her plan would: Require the disclosure of \u201cultimate beneficial owner of a company\u201d \u2013 the real owners behind shell companies that allow individuals to mask their identities and the sources of their money Gather better data on cross-border financial flows Expand anti-bribery laws that penalize foreign officials who extort American companies Impose new rules to clamp down on dark money with stiff penalties for violations Deploy targeted sanctions to \u201cinvestigate, name, and shame corrupt individuals and their criminal rings\u201d Warren\u2019s proposal makes multiple references to the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of records from one of the world\u2019s largest offshore law firms that exposed the many ways the wealthy and powerful exploit secretive offshore tax havens. The records were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, who worked with a network of media partners, including the Guardian. \u201cLaundered money represents 2 to 5 percent of global GDP, or as much as $2 trillionannually,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd the flow of illicit money and lack of financial transparency are not just problems for developing countries or systems exploited by autocrats \u2013 they also affect the United States and its interests around the world.\u201d The plan also comes ahead of a House vote on impeachment that centers on the US\u2019 anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Multiple diplomats and administration testified during the impeachment investigation this year that those efforts were disrupted by a parallel pressure campaign by Trump\u2019s allies to extract a political favor from the country\u2019s newly elected president. Another freshman House Democrat, Mikie Sherill of New Jersey, has announced she will vote to impeach Trump, who carried her congressional district by 1 point in 2016. So far, the only House Democrats to signal they will oppose impeachment are Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, who has indicated he will switch his party affiliation. Trump, who helped convince Van Drew to change sides, tweeted praise at the freshman congressman late last night. Good morning, live blog readers! The House rules committee is set to meet at 11am ET to discuss the parameters for the impeachment debate, which will take place tomorrow on the House floor before a chamber-wide vote. Although the rules committee meeting will likely not be as chaotic as tomorrow\u2019s floor debate, viewers can expect some heated moments as two representatives from the judiciary committee \u2013 Democrat Jamie Raskin and Republican Doug Collins \u2013 take questions from members of the panel about the two articles of impeachment. (Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler was originally scheduled to attend but will be unable to appear due to a family emergency.) Democratic leadership also received some good news this morning; congressman Anthony Brindisi, a freshman House Democrat whose district voted for Donald Trump by 15 points in 2016, said he would support impeachment. Brindisi is one of more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats who have now signaled their support for impeaching Trump, indicating the Democratic caucus will likely be largely unified when the vote takes place. But once the House approves the articles of impeachment, which seems all but certain at this point, the debate will then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where Trump has already been guaranteed a much more favorable audience. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will welcome the Guatemalan president and first lady to the White House and later speak at a Christmas reception. The House is expected to vote on government funding to avoid a shutdown. Joe Biden is attending a fundraiser in his home state of Delaware. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

It is incredibly difficult to believe Houghton does not watch a huge amount of women\u2019s football. Manchester City and their manager, Nick Cushing, are known for a thorough tactical analysis of opponents. Walk through their training ground and you will often see a player sitting with a coach talking through tape. Houghton studies footage.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cIf it\u2019s on the telly, I mean \u2026 I won\u2019t break my neck to go and watch it, whereas, if there\u2019s a good game on in men\u2019s football, our whole nights revolve around watching that.\u201d</p> <p>One person online said the impact of Houghton\u2019s comments could be seen in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realrob39/status/1206546441616920583\">this reply</a> to a TalkSport article on Liverpool\u2019s draw with Chelsea: \u201cThe women\u2019s England captain doesn\u2019t even watch women\u2019s football.\u201d Except many people do not need an excuse to mock the women\u2019s game. It is extremely likely that regardless of Houghton\u2019s slip, they would comment.</p> <p>Watching women\u2019s football is extremely difficult and, to a certain extent, you do have to break your neck to watch it. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/fa-womens-football-wsl-streaming\">introduction of the FA Player</a>, which streams every game not picked up by broadcasters, is a game-changer but the overwhelming majority of matches are played at the same time on Sundays \u2013 when Houghton is on the field.</p> <p>Uefa is centralising broadcasting rights of the early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/04/womens-super-league-to-get-extra-champions-league-spot-from-2021\">women\u2019s Champions League rounds from 2021</a> because, at present, until the semi-finals, streams and rights are left to clubs, which results in patchy and inaccessible coverage.</p> <p>By contrast, Friday night football, weekend football, Monday night football, men\u2019s Champions League and Europa League football mean you can switch on your TV and watch a top-level men\u2019s game with ease.</p> <p>Rarely is there a choice between watching a men\u2019s or women\u2019s game, which makes the question slightly unfair.</p> <p>And when there is a clash, who can begrudge a player wanting to watch a match that will dominate the national conversation in the way a big Premier League or men\u2019s Champions League game will do?</p> <p>Houghton is 31. The FA WSL has existed only since 2011. The opportunity to watch any women\u2019s football on TV or online is very much a new phenomenon.</p> <p>For the overwhelming majority of Houghton\u2019s career, and life, women\u2019s football has been amateur and lacked visibility. Watching men\u2019s football is what inspired the careers of the majority of female players, particularly those of Houghton\u2019s generation.</p> <p>That generation has sacrificed a lot just for the right to play football. To question Houghton\u2019s commitment to growing the game, as some on social media have, is in poor taste.</p> <p>Plenty of male footballers don\u2019t watch football at all. Carlos Tevez and Gareth Bale have said they would rather watch golf. Ronaldinho famously said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to watch football, I like to play it.\u201d Neymar said he would not watch Barcelona\u2019s rivals when he was playing in Spain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a8523631403f7775006ba5a75a037a3e5e1fdc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a8523631403f7775006ba5a75a037a3e5e1fdc1/98_91_2216_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronaldinho, here testing Celtic\u2019s defence with Barcelona, famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t like to watch football, I like to play it.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronaldinho, here testing Celtic\u2019s defence with Barcelona, famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t like to watch football, I like to play it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Female footballers have a rawer deal than their male counterparts. Because the game is still fledging, they take on the responsibility of growing it and we expect them to do so. Perhaps we should give them a little more leeway, accept they are human beings and, as in the case of Houghton, that they will sometimes let the agenda dip, meaning that a touch of honest insight that may not be totally helpful to the cause will slip out.</p> <p>\u201cI love watching any form of football but if it comes to Premier League, Champions League, I actually just love watching the pace of the game, the intensity, watching the formations, watching the best teams play,\u201d said Houghton.</p> <p>It reads badly, as if belittling the pace and intensity of the women\u2019s game, but it can also be read more simply. Not everyone wants to take their work home with them. Men\u2019s football is different. There is no subconscious analysis of a team that Houghton might face, which could be the case should she watch women\u2019s football recreationally. Instead, she can enjoy the things she loves about football unhindered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>With her husband, Stephen Darby, a former Bolton, Bradford and Liverpool defender, having announced his retirement in September 2018 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, three months after they married, Houghton has played on.

      "bodyText": "\u201cTo be honest, even though I\u2019m in the women\u2019s game, I don\u2019t really watch a lot of women\u2019s football.\u201d The England captain Steph Houghton\u2019s reply on The Greatest Game podcast to Jamie Carragher\u2019s somewhat loaded question was not ideal. However the vitriol aimed at the defender on social media feels massively exaggerated. Defining \u201ca lot\u201d is extremely problematic for starters. It is incredibly difficult to believe Houghton does not watch a huge amount of women\u2019s football. Manchester City and their manager, Nick Cushing, are known for a thorough tactical analysis of opponents. Walk through their training ground and you will often see a player sitting with a coach talking through tape. Houghton studies footage. She continued: \u201cIf it\u2019s on the telly, I mean \u2026 I won\u2019t break my neck to go and watch it, whereas, if there\u2019s a good game on in men\u2019s football, our whole nights revolve around watching that.\u201d One person online said the impact of Houghton\u2019s comments could be seen in this reply to a TalkSport article on Liverpool\u2019s draw with Chelsea: \u201cThe women\u2019s England captain doesn\u2019t even watch women\u2019s football.\u201d Except many people do not need an excuse to mock the women\u2019s game. It is extremely likely that regardless of Houghton\u2019s slip, they would comment. Watching women\u2019s football is extremely difficult and, to a certain extent, you do have to break your neck to watch it. The introduction of the FA Player, which streams every game not picked up by broadcasters, is a game-changer but the overwhelming majority of matches are played at the same time on Sundays \u2013 when Houghton is on the field. Uefa is centralising broadcasting rights of the early women\u2019s Champions League rounds from 2021 because, at present, until the semi-finals, streams and rights are left to clubs, which results in patchy and inaccessible coverage. By contrast, Friday night football, weekend football, Monday night football, men\u2019s Champions League and Europa League football mean you can switch on your TV and watch a top-level men\u2019s game with ease. Rarely is there a choice between watching a men\u2019s or women\u2019s game, which makes the question slightly unfair. And when there is a clash, who can begrudge a player wanting to watch a match that will dominate the national conversation in the way a big Premier League or men\u2019s Champions League game will do? Houghton is 31. The FA WSL has existed only since 2011. The opportunity to watch any women\u2019s football on TV or online is very much a new phenomenon. For the overwhelming majority of Houghton\u2019s career, and life, women\u2019s football has been amateur and lacked visibility. Watching men\u2019s football is what inspired the careers of the majority of female players, particularly those of Houghton\u2019s generation. That generation has sacrificed a lot just for the right to play football. To question Houghton\u2019s commitment to growing the game, as some on social media have, is in poor taste. Plenty of male footballers don\u2019t watch football at all. Carlos Tevez and Gareth Bale have said they would rather watch golf. Ronaldinho famously said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to watch football, I like to play it.\u201d Neymar said he would not watch Barcelona\u2019s rivals when he was playing in Spain. Female footballers have a rawer deal than their male counterparts. Because the game is still fledging, they take on the responsibility of growing it and we expect them to do so. Perhaps we should give them a little more leeway, accept they are human beings and, as in the case of Houghton, that they will sometimes let the agenda dip, meaning that a touch of honest insight that may not be totally helpful to the cause will slip out. \u201cI love watching any form of football but if it comes to Premier League, Champions League, I actually just love watching the pace of the game, the intensity, watching the formations, watching the best teams play,\u201d said Houghton. It reads badly, as if belittling the pace and intensity of the women\u2019s game, but it can also be read more simply. Not everyone wants to take their work home with them. Men\u2019s football is different. There is no subconscious analysis of a team that Houghton might face, which could be the case should she watch women\u2019s football recreationally. Instead, she can enjoy the things she loves about football unhindered. With her husband, Stephen Darby, a former Bolton, Bradford and Liverpool defender, having announced his retirement in September 2018 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, three months after they married, Houghton has played on. She led England at the World Cup in France after helping Manchester City to a domestic cup double while her husband battles an illness with devastatingly short life expectancy. Sometimes it is important to look at the context of what a player has delivered and is delivering, both on the pitch but more widely to the development of the game, when they speak a little out of turn. Perhaps sometimes we should just give them a bit of a break. Talking points \u2022 There is relief for Arsenal and England after an X-ray confirmed that Beth Mead has suffered bruising to a leg and not a fracture. The 24-year-old forward fell to the ground screaming in pain after a tame challenge and was taken off on a stretcher after lengthy treatment during Arsenal\u2019s 3-1 defeat of Everton at Southport. \u2022 Manchester City will play the Championship team Sheffield United in the quarter-finals of the Continental League Cup. Chelsea also face Championship opposition in Aston Villawhile Arsenal have drawn Reading and Manchester United host Brighton. The ties are scheduled to take place on 15-16 January. \u2022 Manchester United\u2019s 18-year-old forward Lauren James has signed her first professional contract, having joined Casey Stoney\u2019s project from Arsenal in July 2018. James, sister of the Chelsea full-back Reece James, scored 24 goals in 29 games last season as United romped to the Championship title. \u2022 Australia and New Zealand have launched a joint bid to host the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2023. Japan, who host next summer\u2019s Olympics, Colombia and Brazil have also submitted bids. South Africa and South Korea had previously announced their intention to bid but recently pulled out. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "body": "<p>\u2019Tis the season to be jolly. I know, I know. Santa has some seriously heavy lifting to do, because never has the most magical time of the year been more desperately needed. Christmas is a care package of cinnamon baked goods and Baileys, timed to land at the moment when the world outside is at its darkest and coldest and most unwelcoming. And if ever a midwinter could do with a mood lift, it\u2019s this one.</p> <p>The second Thursday in December is usually when the party season gets going, but this time around, the hangover kicked in before the fun. Mood plummeting, nausea rising: the election result was about as Christmassy as the scene in Gremlins when Phoebe Cates\u2019s Kate explains how she found out Santa didn\u2019t exist. (If you don\u2019t know this scene, promise me you won\u2019t look it up.)</p> <p>Being sentimental and schmaltzy by nature, I absolutely love Christmas, with its month-long licence to indulge those traits. But even if that\u2019s not you, festive cheer is a three-line whip this year. Scrooge is not an option, frankly. We all owe it to our fellow humans to be as Christmassy as possible. That means wishing merry Christmas to every single bus driver and not taking the hideous cracker hat off the moment you think no one is looking. For Christmas magic to work, you need to believe in it.</p> <p>Being Christmassy in 2019 can feel complicated. The families who aren\u2019t fractured and frazzled by arguments are worn down by collective hand-wringing. Brexit has politicised nostalgic ideas of Britishness, making the lamplit-snowy-cobblestones, rosy-cheeked Victoriana we associate with Christmas feel loaded. And while that referendum has a lot to answer for \u2013 not to mention the general election \u2013 they are not the only issues. The call for sustainability has taken the feelgood factor away from turbocharged shopping sprees. Even traditional Christmas cooking feels a bit out of sync with the zeitgeist: a turkey you can barely fit in the oven, plus sausages wrapped in bacon, isn\u2019t going to work when half the family have gone veggie or vegan.</p> <p>So, as John Lennon sang about Christmas in 1971, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a good one. We\u2019ve still got gingerbread houses and Mariah Carey. We\u2019ve got ice-skating, panto and seeing Christmas trees being carried home in nets. Gavin and Stacey. Some Christmas traditions are getting bigger every year. Advent calendars were once only for kids and were, in any case, just a picture of a reindeer behind a paper door. They are now marketed at grownups and filled with gin or luxury eye cream. Front door wreaths, which used to be for posh hotels or people with too much time on their hands, are everywhere.</p> <p>And it wouldn\u2019t be Christmas without getting dressed up. The phrase \u201cparty season\u201d makes December sound like a choreographed procession of sparkly red carpet moments that, even in jollier years, didn\u2019t quite chime with reality. The reality, of course, being an endless round of emoji-heavy WhatsApp debates about which pub is more likely to have a table for 9pm on a Friday. But Christmas itself is worth getting dressing up for, whether you are on the tiles or on the sofa.</p> <p>This year, a tuxedo-style jacket has replaced the little black dress as the centre of gravity for your December wardrobe. Fashion has been very covered-up for the past couple of years, and when you have been in a polo neck and midiskirt for months, spaghetti-strap sequins are a big step out of the comfort zone. A tuxedo jacket turns your favourite black trousers and a silk camisole or blouse into instant black tie. (See Victoria Beckham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/victoriabeckham/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram feed</a> for a masterclass on this look.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6e21b919db9fefa2d64749441674216fcc63329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6e21b919db9fefa2d64749441674216fcc63329/305_1037_1713_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prairie-inspired O Pioneers dresses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prairie-inspired <a href=\"https://www.opioneers.co.uk/\">O Pioneers</a> dresses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But once you finish the afterwork drinking season and segue into Christmas proper, you need a cosier, more homely kind of dress-up. This year\u2019s inspiration comes directly from Greta Gerwig\u2019s new film adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson\" title=\"\">Little Women</a>, which will arrive in cinemas on Boxing Day. With their messages of feminism and resilience, not to mention their Greta Thunberg braids, Liberty print florals and penchant for baskets rather than handbags (very Loewe), the March sisters are fashion gold, right now. The designer Clara Francis, who made the beaded wedding headdress that Emma Watson as Meg wears in the film, recently launched <a href=\"https://www.opioneers.co.uk/about\" title=\"\">O Pioneers</a>, a sustainable fashion brand making dresses that mix the romance of Little House on the Prairie\u2019s 70s take on pioneer-dressing with the elegantly modern, long, slim party dress silhouette of Susie Cave\u2019s cult label <a href=\"https://thevampireswife.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_qav8uKZ5gIVxrHtCh18tQHREAAYASAAEgLSyfD_BwE\" title=\"\">The Vampire\u2019s Wife</a>. \u201cWe like to think our thing is dressing up for the daytime,\u201d says Francis. \u201cOur dresses all have pockets, you can wash them in the machine \u2013 but they make you feel special. It\u2019s like playing subtle dress-up, every day.\u201d</p> <p>Lucinda Chambers and Serena Hood, ex-Vogue editors and the founders of the new tastemaking edit <a href=\"https://collagerie.com/\" title=\"\">Collagerie</a>, have an eye for a high street treasure \u2013 they have trawled Arket and Maisons du Monde for the best affordable pieces \u2013 but are not recommending a supermarket sweep for a whole new set of Christmas decorations, however temptingly inexpensive. \u201cBuy one decoration a year \u2013 that way, your collection is really meaningful,\u201d says Chambers.</p> <p>With this month\u2019s Vogue cover starring Taylor Swift in an archive Chanel jacket \u2013 a landmark disruptive moment in the history of the fashion magazine as a shop window \u2013 glamour that doesn\u2019t come with a side-order of landfill-guilt is a crucial element in the feelgood factor, which is what Christmas is all about.</p> <p>This week may not feel full to the brim with festive cheer. But chin up, buttercup. Like Roald Dahl said, those who don\u2019t believe in magic never find it. This year your Christmas needs you.</p>",

But Christmas itself is worth getting dressing up for, whether you are on the tiles or on the sofa. This year, a tuxedo-style jacket has replaced the little black dress as the centre of gravity for your December wardrobe. Fashion has been very covered-up for the past couple of years, and when you have been in a polo neck and midiskirt for months, spaghetti-strap sequins are a big step out of the comfort zone. A tuxedo jacket turns your favourite black trousers and a silk camisole or blouse into instant black tie. (See Victoria Beckham\u2019s Instagram feed for a masterclass on this look.) But once you finish the afterwork drinking season and segue into Christmas proper, you need a cosier, more homely kind of dress-up. This year\u2019s inspiration comes directly from Greta Gerwig\u2019s new film adaptation of Little Women, which will arrive in cinemas on Boxing Day. With their messages of feminism and resilience, not to mention their Greta Thunberg braids, Liberty print florals and penchant for baskets rather than handbags (very Loewe), the March sisters are fashion gold, right now. The designer Clara Francis, who made the beaded wedding headdress that Emma Watson as Meg wears in the film, recently launched O Pioneers, a sustainable fashion brand making dresses that mix the romance of Little House on the Prairie\u2019s 70s take on pioneer-dressing with the elegantly modern, long, slim party dress silhouette of Susie Cave\u2019s cult label The Vampire\u2019s Wife. \u201cWe like to think our thing is dressing up for the daytime,\u201d says Francis. \u201cOur dresses all have pockets, you can wash them in the machine \u2013 but they make you feel special. It\u2019s like playing subtle dress-up, every day.\u201d Lucinda Chambers and Serena Hood, ex-Vogue editors and the founders of the new tastemaking edit Collagerie, have an eye for a high street treasure \u2013 they have trawled Arket and Maisons du Monde for the best affordable pieces \u2013 but are not recommending a supermarket sweep for a whole new set of Christmas decorations, however temptingly inexpensive. \u201cBuy one decoration a year \u2013 that way, your collection is really meaningful,\u201d says Chambers. With this month\u2019s Vogue cover starring Taylor Swift in an archive Chanel jacket \u2013 a landmark disruptive moment in the history of the fashion magazine as a shop window \u2013 glamour that doesn\u2019t come with a side-order of landfill-guilt is a crucial element in the feelgood factor, which is what Christmas is all about. This week may not feel full to the brim with festive cheer. But chin up, buttercup. Like Roald Dahl said, those who don\u2019t believe in magic never find it. This year your Christmas needs you.",

      "bodyText": "Will we remember the news of 2019 fondly? I mean, no. It was grim and relentless \u2013 marred by, among other things, the bloviating of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, the accelerating climate emergency, and by the deaths of Boo the dog, Grumpy Cat and Lil\u2019 Bub. Just when we thought we were getting to the end of this godforsaken decade, a million penises were retched forth by the sea. Yet even in the darkness there is likable content \u2013 stories that did our hearts good. Here goes: Humps are back After centuries of whaling, researchers worried humpback whale populations would struggle to recover. But their numbers are now up from mere hundreds in the 80s to over 25,000, exceeding experts\u2019 most optimistic expectations. More good news for endangered species: sea turtle populations have officially increased 980% since becoming protected in 1973, and in February, Galapagos conservationists found a living member of a giant tortoise species previously thought to be extinct. Keanu Reeves got cuffed Beset by a lifetime of personal tragedy and meme-ified as the internet\u2019s purest embodiment of despair, Keanu Reeves has long occupied the role of saintly yet enigmatically sad and self-professedly lonely celebrity dreamboat. This year, however, Reeves publicized his relationship with the artist Alexandra Grant, with whom, sources confirm, he is \u201cextremely happy\u201d. We\u2019re all happy for you, Keanu! You\u2019re breathtaking! The reefs are alive with the sound of music In Michael Ondaatje\u2019s poem Sweet Like a Crow, \u201cthe clicking sound of a reef when you put your head in the sea\u201d is made out to be a nasty noise \u2013 but this year, researchers found that when audio recordings of healthy reefs are played at the site of dying reefs, fish assume the reef is poppin\u2019 and swim over to hang out, thus helping revitalize the ecosystem. That\u2019s music to conservationists\u2019 ears. Megan Rapinoe kicked balls This year, American soccer star Megan Rapinoe won the World Cup, the Golden Boot and the Ballon D\u2019or, all while fighting homophobia and inequality in the world of sports, and delivering sick burns to the president. Oh, and her hair looked great the whole time. Black beauty queens reigned supreme When Zozibini Tunzi was crowned Miss Universe this December, it marked the first time that the top prizes in all five major beauty pageants were simultaneously held by black women \u2013 a meaningful moment for diversity and representation, especially given pageants have long been criticized for their racism and antiquated, eurocentric beauty standards. We understand Alzheimer\u2019s better than ever \u2026 \u201cWe are on the verge of something truly transformational,\u201d Maria C Carrillo, head of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, wrote in Time this October. Not only are scientists newly optimistic that the drug aducanumab may slow the disease, but researchers at Berkeley have also found that drugs that relieve inflammation in the brain could slow or even reverse cognitive decline and German scientists learned how to monitor subtle early manifestations of Alzheimer\u2019s long before clinical signs appear. \u2026 and we could stop HIV transmissions A study published in the Lancet this May revealed treatment can prevent the sexual transmission of the HIV virus. The eight-year study found no cases of transmission between almost 1,000 gay male couples who had sex without condoms, in which one partner was HIV positive and treating the condition with antiretrovirals. These findings have enormous implications for the global treatment of HIV. A quilting project stitched up our hearts This autumn, Chicago\u2019s Shannon Downey bought a $5 unfinished quilt at an estate sale \u2013 a crafting project initially embarked on by 99-year-old Rita Smith, who died earlier in 2019. The quilt design \u2013 a representation of every American state flower and bird in a hexagon \u2013 was so ambitious it took Downey and a hundred volunteer women across the US working together to finish it this year, which they did in honor of Smith and the underrated value of crafting. A Thai grocery store went bananas In an effort to reduce plastic waste from produce packaging, Thai grocery chain Rimping began using banana leaves (which are sturdy, waxy and usually discarded) and biodegradable banana-fibre twists to secure bundles of fruit and veg. Banana leaves may not be an option in North America, but Rimping\u2019s a-peeling solution is a good reminder that meaningful innovation need not be complicated. Greta the great This year, teen activist (and Time magazine\u2019s person of the year, and coiner of Collins English Dictionary\u2019s word of the year \u2013 \u201cclimate strike\u201d) Greta Thunberg became the fresh face of climate action, focusing international attention on environmental injustice, pressuring governments to respond to the escalating global climate crises and inspiring the largest climate demonstration in human history.

In recent years, the Krampuses\u2019 tendency to go on drunken rampages, getting in fights and destroying property, has become a bit of a problem. 2. Frau Perchta (Austria and Bavaria) Frau Perchta is a witch who comes to see who has been naughty or nice. She slits the bellies of bad children and stuffs their corpses with straw. It\u2019s sort of like Santa bringing coal, but with disembowelment instead. 3. Mari Lwyd (Wales) Imagine: it is New Year\u2019s Eve. You are a small Welsh child. You hear a knock on the door. You open it. Looming over you is a creature with a horse\u2019s skull, wearing a long, billowing cloak and trailed by people chanting. In the horse\u2019s eye cavities are fake eyeballs. Its mouth is slightly ajar. You are paralyzed in terror. As you wet yourself in fear, adults around you wish each other happy new year. 4. Gryla and the Yule Cat (Iceland) Gryla is a giant ogre who lives in a cave. During Christmas she emerges to hunt for children, which she kidnaps, takes to her cave, and cooks in a vat of stew. Gryla has a variety of companions, including the Yule Lads \u2013 her 13 unruly troll children/Large Adult Sons \u2013 and the J\u00f3lak\u00f6tturinn, or Yule Cat. Did you think that the Yule Cat sits on your lap as you open gifts, playing with the wrapping paper and contributing to the overall atmosphere of cozy Christmas hygge? Wrong. The Yule Cat is terrifying. Like Satan, walking among us like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, the massive Yule Cat lopes through town in the dark, peering into the lighted windows of children\u2019s bedrooms. The only way to save yourself from being eaten is to show him that you got clothes for Christmas because you were good this year. If you didn\u2019t get any new clothes, you leave out old clothes, and hope to God they meet his standards. 5. Hans Trapp (Alsace-Lorraine, France) According to Alsatian lore, Hans Trapp was a local man renowned for his greed and unscrupulousness. He used witchcraft and deals with the Devil to become rich. After being excommunicated from the Catholic church, he lost his wealth and social standing. He took to roaming the countryside disguised as a scarecrow. At some point, Hans Trapp became consumed with the idea of tasting human flesh. He lured a shepherd boy to his death, then cooked him over a fire. Before Hans Trapp could take his first bite, however, God \u2013 finally feeling that things had gone too far \u2013 struck him with lightning. Hans Trapp died, but he returns sometimes on Christmas, to go from door to door looking for young, tasty children. 6. The Kallikantzari (Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Turkey) The Kallikantzari are goblins who spend most of the year underground, trying to bring about the apocalypse. During Advent they come out on to human territory to cause mischief and evil. They are sometimes described as black furry creatures with tusks and horns. They are usually male, and grotesquely well endowed. 7. P\u00e8re Fouettard (France, Belgium, Switzerland) P\u00e8re Fouettard was a butcher. He and his wife kidnapped, robbed and killed wealthy children, then carved up their bodies and hid them in salting barrels. Saint Nicholas discovered the crime and brought the children back to life. As punishment, he forced P\u00e8re Fouettard into bondage as his eternal cannibal manservant. He follows St Nick around, dealing with the problem children.",

Her work interrogates the position of the individual \u2013 particularly women \u2013 in society, favouring the wider perspective of nature and imagination over the confines of the political. In her first novel translated into English, following the 2015 short-story collection <em>The Well of Trapped Words</em>, an unnamed second-person narrator is addressing a silent woman who has lost an integral sense of who she is. The voice reminds the woman of her memories and tells her tales reaching far back in time.</p> <p>Who is this young woman? What has happened to her? We\u2019re offered the briefest glimpses: her ground-floor apartment in present-day Istanbul; her work as a photographer; her attendance at a H\u0131drellez celebration in honour of the prophet-saint H\u0131z\u0131r revered by Alevi Muslims. There are visits to the young woman\u2019s grandmother, Bese, who tells fantastical stories of her encounters with H\u0131z\u0131r. And there is the inherited memory of Bese as a young child, fleeing the Turkish army\u2019s massacre of Alevi Kurds in the eastern Dersim province in 1938.</p> <p>\u201cI know from my grandmother how pain gives way to silence,\u201d Kaygusuz writes in her afterword to the novel. Although her own grandmother, an exile from Dersim, constantly told stories, she never spoke of what she witnessed in those few months of her childhood. Perhaps her silence was due to fear, in the face of a monolithic Turkish-Sunni narrative. Perhaps it was the impossibility of giving words to the horror. Perhaps it was the shame of being alive. It is this silence that the novel\u2019s protagonist has inherited and whose deafening void she tries to fill with stories.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The stories widen the scope of a shared and violent past, beyond cultural and temporal frames</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The woman\u2019s story never comes into full focus; the events of her life do not add up as they might in an official telling.

      "bodyText": "The voice of Every Fire You Tend seems to reach us from the depths of a cave: confined, echoing, intense. The stories it tells are allusive, building up and breaking apart, splintered through centuries and civilisations. Sema Kaygusuz has become an important figure in contemporary Turkish literature, for numerous novels, story collections and essays that blend the quotidian, historical and mystical with lyrical humanism. Her work interrogates the position of the individual \u2013 particularly women \u2013 in society, favouring the wider perspective of nature and imagination over the confines of the political. In her first novel translated into English, following the 2015 short-story collection The Well of Trapped Words, an unnamed second-person narrator is addressing a silent woman who has lost an integral sense of who she is. The voice reminds the woman of her memories and tells her tales reaching far back in time. Who is this young woman? What has happened to her?

Han Xiao, the chair of the USOPC Athlete Advisory Council, testified to Congress in July that completing a coaching certification is a \u201cmere formality\u201d that \u201ccan be granted upon viewing a video or having somebody pickup a certificate for them.\u201d While Hogshead-Makar is supportive of legislation introduced by senators in July aimed at bolstering resources for the US Center for SafeSport and including athletes on relevant governing boards, she claims that it won\u2019t prevent governing bodies from retaliating against whistleblowers. \u201cI see the Olympic ideals as being perverted by the administrators and that really saddens me,\u201d Hogshead-Makar say. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to come cynical about the Olympics.\u201d With Tokyo 2020 approaching, Hogshead-Makar is intent on proving that it\u2019s the athletes, not the governing bodies, who embody the Olympic spirit and that sports are one of the best activities for empowerment and recovery from trauma. To achieve that, she argues, means eliminating those who exploit the Olympic spirit for power. \u201cSports are a way to unhinge women from gender stereotypes and ideas of what their life is supposed to be like,\u201d she says. \u201cSports makes women stronger character-wise and the message of being subservient needs to end.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is still unpleasantly warm here in Melbourne, and across much of southern Australia east of the Nullarbor. Fire activity is predicted to increase tomorrow and on Friday. Here is a roundup of where things stand: Tuesday, 17 December, was Australia\u2019s hottest day on record. Ever. The average maximum temperature across the country was 40.9C. Temperatures of 46C and above were recorded in multiple localities in three states (SA, WA, NT) on Wednesday. Preliminary results from the Bureau of Meteorology showed that December heat records were broken in 17 towns in South Australia on Wednesday. Extreme heatwave conditions will continue over the next few days, with temperatures peaking in South Australia and Victoria on Friday, and New South Wales on Saturday. All of NSW, all of South Australia, large parts of Queensland, and northern Victoria have been placed under a total fire ban on Thursday. We are about to head into three really high fire danger days: Greater Sydney, the Illawarra and the Southern Ranges regions of NSW have extreme fire danger tomorrow. South Australia will have catastrophic fire danger in some regions on Friday, with extreme and severe danger in others, and Victoria is forecast to have extreme fire danger in two regions on Friday. We still don\u2019t know where Scott Morrison is. Stay safe, drink a lot of water, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Queensland fire update As of Wednesday afternoon there were about 70 bushfires burning across Queensland. Evacuation warnings were issued for fires near Bundaberg and in the Gold Coast hinterland. Residents at Peregian Springs on the Sunshine Coast were told to leave at 3.30pm, while residents near the Cainbable, Carneys Creek, Mount Maria and Gregory River fires were told to be ready to leave. Queensland Fire and Emergency Service said more than 30 crews were working on fires at Peregian Springs, Weyba Downs and Noosa Heads as conditions are expected to worsen. The fire is travelling north-west and may affect Lakewood Drive and Monak Road. Residents have been told to flee along Murdering Creek Road onto the Sunshine Motorway (also known as Emu Mountain Road) and travel south-west towards Coolum. The Sunshine Motorway has been closed both directions at the Doonan roundabout. Fire crews have been using a water-bombing aircraft on the large and fast-moving fire at Carneys Creek, in the Scenic Rim region. A man in his 50s received burns to his face, neck and arms while battling a blaze at Lowmead, in the Wide Bay region north of Brisbane on Tuesday afternoon, AAP reported. A 60-year-old woman at the same property has burns to her face and airway, while another man in his 50s suffered respiratory issues. All three were taken to hospital in a stable condition. It was hot pretty much everywhere, but these weather stations recorded the highest temperatures, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. NSW Smithville \u2014 44C at 2.30pm Borrona Downs \u2014 43.1C at 3.20pm Tibooburra airport \u2014 42.9C at 3.14pm Victoria Walpeup \u2014 44.1 at 3.19pm Hopetoun airport \u2014 42.9C at 3.03pm Warracknabeal airport \u2014 42.6C at 2.59pm Queensland Birdsville \u2014 47.7C at 1.42pm Urandangi \u2014 46.4C at 2.02pm Ballera \u2014 45.3C at 2.19pm ACT Canberra \u2014 36.7C at 3.20pm Western Australia Mandora Station \u2014 46.9C at 12.24pm Fitzroy Crossing \u2014 46.8C at 12.24pm Marble Bar \u2014 46.1C at 12.11pm South Australia Wudinna airport \u2014 46.9C at 3.04pm Tarcoola \u2014 46.6C at 3.03pm Ceduna \u2014 46.5C at 1.43pm Northern Territory Walungurru (Kintore) \u2014 46.4C at 2.16pm Rabbit Flat \u2014 46.1 at 2.14pm Jervois \u2014 at 45.9 2.13pm Tasmania Ouse \u2014 31.2C at 3.40pm Fingal \u2014 30.9C at 3.18pm Bushy Park \u2014 30.6C at 3.38pm Large parts of South Australia will experience catastrophic or extreme fire danger on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology has said. A catastrophic rating has been declared for Mount Lofty Ranges, Kangaroo Island and the lower south-east, while extreme fire danger is forecast for the lower Eyre Peninsula, the mid-north, and Yorke Peninsula. The rest of the state will experience severe fire danger conditions. Catastrophic, called code red in some states, is the highest fire danger rating and denotes conditions in which bushfires are not survivable. The rating was added after the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, in which 173 people died. Catastrophic fire danger ratings are usually accompanied by a preliminary evacuation order, before the fire has even started. The line used by emergency services is that it is not a question of if a fire will start on a day like that, but when and where. Residents in bushfire-prone properties \u2014 basically anyone living in a rural area or small village \u2014 are usually advised to be away from home. Thousands across Victoria are without power as the state swelters, with just one day of respite from the hot weather before the mercury soars again. Melbourne reached a scorching 39.7C just before 3pm today, while the state\u2019s northwest is expecting to crack the mid-40s, AAP has reported. Power went out out for about 3,000 PowerCorp customers in Werribee and surrounding suburbs about 4pm. Crews are working to restore power to about 2,000 who still don\u2019t have it. The Bureau of Meteorology expects a southerly wind change to bring temperatures slightly down overnight, with milder conditions across southern areas forecast for tomorrow. It will stay hot in the north, with a total fire ban in place for the region. The mild weather will be short-lived, as Friday\u2019s maximum temperature in Melbourne has been upgraded to 43C, with a chance the city could record its hottest December day since a temperature of 43.7C in 1876. \u201cNortherly winds are going to bring that very hot air over the north right down across the state right down to the coast, so 43C in the city some suburbs even nudging 44C,\u201d Mr Stewart said. Response Controller Gavin Freeman said while the state\u2019s fire agencies and emergency managers are on alert and prepared for the conditions, it was vital the rest of the community were also prepared. \u201cWe urge all Victorians to be aware that fires can happen anywhere and without warning, and to make their plans accordingly,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFire agency crews are well prepared and it\u2019s extremely important that the community is also prepared, not only for the next couple of days, but for the months to come\u201d. As the mercury climbs, authorities are warning people to prepare for the hot weather. \u201cWith dry, windy and close to 40 degree days predicted, we want everyone to be alert to the symptoms of heat-related illnesses,\u201d Ambulance Victoria\u2019s Justin Dunlop said. Heat-related illness symptoms include heat rash, muscle cramps, heavy sweating, paleness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and fainting. Residents are urged to check on their neighbours, infants, the elderly and expectant mothers who are some of the most vulnerable in this weather. There are currently 100 bush and grass fires burning in New South Wales, 54 of which are uncontained. And remember: the heatwave will not move east of Wagga Wagga until tomorrow. The SA Country Fire Service has just declared a statewide total fire ban for tomorrow. New South Wales is already under a total fire ban \u2013 it started at midnight last night and will not lift until midnight Saturday. Victoria will have a total fire ban in the northern and north-east districts tomorrow. Here\u2019s a brief list of the things you cannot do under a total fire ban: Light a campfire of any type or use a barbecue unless it is fuelled solely by gas or electricity, is commercially manufactured or part of a permanently fixed structure, and is three metres from any flammable material. Use a solid fuel barbecue, such as a spitroast. Use a scaring gun. Drive a vehicle with a dodgy muffler over long grass or crops. Weld with the door open. Extract honey. I have a much needed bit of good news about one of the victims of the NSW bushfires. Nina Jongen\u2019s family home was one of 85 destroyed in the fire that went through Nymboida on 8 November. The mud brick property was built by her parents 32 years ago when she was just a year old. Like many of the more than 700 families who have lost their homes in the NSW fires so far this year, she was facing spending Christmas in temporary accomodation. And then she won a tiny home. A friend entered her in the Amazon Prime competition, and the tiny house was delivered to her family property, complete with Christmas tree and presents, on Wednesday. She says: [This house] means we can be back on property, we can be present for the cleanup. I am so excited to have comfort, and somewhere to rest and relax and to be. A little home.\u201d An extreme heatwave emergency warning has been issued for the Murraylands district of South Australia, which is forecast to have temperatures in the mid-40s all week with no real respite overnight. According to the alert issued by the SA state emergency services: When we experience unusually high night and daytime temperatures over several days, there is no chance for your body to recover. This is dangerous for anyone who does not take precautions to keep cool \u2013 even those who are healthy. People who work or exercise outdoors are particularly at risk.\u201d The recommendations are: stay indoors if you can. If you must exercise, do so in the early morning or in the evening and do a less arduous routine. Drink plenty of water, and plan ahead if you\u2019re taking public transport as there may be delays. If you\u2019re going camping, don\u2019t pitch your tent under a tree \u2013 eucalypts can drop branches in the heat. That huge Gospers Mountain fire north and west of Sydney is now an emergency level incident again. The fire is out of control, and has so far burned through more than 415,000 hectares, including through several national parks, state forests and residential areas. See the RFS website and the Fires Near Me app for more specific info about particular areas \u2013 the size of the affected area from this fire is huge. This relates to a watch and act fire at Peregian Springs, north of Brisbane on the Queensland coast. The QFES says conditions are getting worse. \u201cFire crews and waterbombing aircraft are working to contain the fire but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. Queensland police are door-knocking in the area. Power, water, and mobile phone service may be lost.\u201d Smithville in north-western NSW recorded a temperature of 44C this afternoon, the highest in the state. Wilcannia recorded a temperature of 42.5C, Borrona Downs 43.1C, Tibooburra 42.9C. According to the Bureau of Meteorology it\u2019s only going to get worse. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some very hot air that will be dragged from central Australia into NSW by northerly and westerly winds over the next couple of days,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Elli Blandford. \u201cThis will bring hot temperatures to most of NSW up to the mid 40s in most of inland NSW for the next couple of days. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting very hot temperatures, well above averages for this time of year.\u201d It\u2019s wise to take more notice of the BoM\u2019s recordings, but that\u2019s still pretty hot down in Port Augusta. A Gosford High student and climate activist Varsha Yajman, who made the papers this morning after achieving an ATAR of 99.15 despite ignoring politicians\u2019 nagging to stop striking from school, addressed the NAB board this afternoon. ABC reporter Julia Holman reports Yajman told the bank it needs to get out of coal, but the motion was voted down by 95% of shareholders. Other shareholders also spoke. A bit more feedback on Scott Morrison\u2019s holiday. Lara Worthington, if you need reminding, shot to fame for her delivery of the famous line in this commercial put out by Tourism Australia. Tourism Australia\u2019s managing director at the time was Scott Morrison. People in the line of the Carneys Creek fire in Queensland have been told to leave now, with the fire expected to hit Chalk Road within the next half an hour. \u201cCurrently as at 2.40pm [AEST] Wednesday 18 December a large and fast-moving fire is travelling in a westerly direction from Carneys Creek Road towards Chalk Road. It is expected to impact Chalk Road within the next 30 minutes. The fire could have a significant impact on the community. \u201cFire crews are working with waterbombing aircraft to contain the fire but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. Power, water, and mobile phone service may be lost.\u201d It\u2019s the afternoon, which this week has become synonymous with upgraded fires. Fire activity is increasing at the Gospers Mountain blaze, in the Wallerawang area to the south, and the RFS has moved its status to Watch and Act. In New South Wales an extreme fire warning is in place for greater Sydney, the Illawarra Shoalhaven region, and the southern ranges tomorrow. The rest of the coastal regions, as well as the entire north of the state and much of the middle, are rated severe or very high. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the blog for the afternoon. A former federal minister, Christopher Pyne, has written in support of Scott Morrison who is copping some flak over his decision to take a family holiday under an apparent shroud of secrecy. There are a lot of opinions around about whether he should be leaving in the middle of the crisis, whether he should have at least been more transparent about it, or whether it\u2019s entirely fine. Pyne is very much in the latter camp. Short of becoming one of the superheroes in the Marvel series of movies with the special skill of putting out fires with the freezing nature of his breath, what more do people expect him to do? He isn\u2019t a member of the Rural Fire Service, so he can\u2019t volunteer to help on the front line ... With great respect to him, he would just be in the way.\u201d Pyne, while also paying tribute to the victims and firefighters and everyone working hard in the bushfire response, says the criticisms of Morrison by the \u201coutrage brigade\u201d are unfair. The NSW premier has warned firefighters will confront an \u201cenormous challenge\u201d in coming days as temperatures soar and volatile winds whip up dangerous bushfires across the state. Gladys Berejiklian says the state faces significant bushfire risk on Thursday and Saturday with the potential for \u201cexceedingly concerning\u201d winds to blow embers well ahead of fire fronts. \u201cNot only are we going to experience very high temperatures on Thursday and Saturday but there\u2019s the exceedingly concerning wind conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a number of wind fronts escalating the fuel, the fires burning, and the potential to have spot fires and embers travelling very long distances. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean very unpredictable fire conditions.\u201d The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said fire behaviour is forecast to be \u201cerratic and significant\u201d due to the volatile winds. \u201cThe heat will start moving through NSW on Thursday and conditions will worsen on Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can expect the winds to be up and conditions to be at their peak very early in the morning and we\u2019ll have high sustained fire dangers for something like 15 hours.\u201d A statewide total fire ban is in place from Wednesday morning to midnight Saturday. Firefighters will work around the clock to contain fires before the worst of the conditions hit. There were about 100 fires burning across NSW on Wednesday at midday with more than half uncontained, the RFS said. Daytime temperatures in parts of NSW and the ACT are expected to exceed 40C through to Saturday while in the western half of the state the mercury could top 45C. Wind gusts could top more than 100km/h. The NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, said complacency was a significant threat. \u201cJust because you haven\u2019t seen a fire at the end of your street, just because you can\u2019t see smoke in your suburb, doesn\u2019t mean that you are not at risk,\u201d he said. This is not the highest temperature reached anywhere on the continent, but the hottest \u201caverage maximum across the country\u201d ever recorded. Queensland. Beautiful one day. Forty. Seven. Degrees. The. Next. As a kid sitting in an unairconditioned primary school in Brisbane, we used to stare at a thermometer on a shaded wall outside as the mercury inched towards the mythical 38C mark when we all believed we would be sent home under some arcane law (nobody ever checked that this was actually the case, but we believed it because a big kid from year seven had told us). The thermometer never quite got there, and we never went home, but I still remember the anticipation, and just how brutally hot it felt, even short of the threshold. It\u2019s going to be low-to-mid 40s from Friday (I note school has already broken up, but mid-40s in Queensland humidity ...) AAP reports: Queensland is bracing for a sweltering run-up to Christmas, with most of the state\u2019s interior expected to reach at least 40C by the weekend. The Bureau of Meteorology says temperatures throughout the interior west of Ipswich, near Brisbane, right up to Doomadgee on the northern Territory border, will sit in the low- to mid-40s for at least a few days from Friday. Sunday is expected to be the hottest, with temperatures up to 12C above average in some towns. Birdsville was expected to hit 47C on Wednesday, well above its December average of 38.9C. It will \u201ccool\u201d to 45C before heating up again on Monday. However, its Christmas Eve forecast of 47C is still well shy of its state record of 49.5C on the same day in 1972. The state\u2019s south-east will escape the worst of the heat, but Brisbane will still hit 35C on Sunday. The coastal areas will be cooler with parts of the Gold Coast expected to be under 30C on Christmas Eve. NSW update: Two buildings have reportedly been damaged in the fires at Mount Maria and Lowmead. Firefighters worked overnight to try to contain the fires. On Wednesday morning residents were told to be ready to leave if conditions worsened, and some who had evacuated are not being allowed to return home. The fires have claimed at least two properties, Gladstone\u2019s mayor, Matt Burnett, told the ABC. \u201cUnfortunately we have had reports overnight that we\u2019ve lost two, probably three structures, which would be people\u2019s homes in the area there,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cSo obviously they\u2019re doing rapid assessment damages this morning as they were doing yesterday, at the same time, of course, trying to fight the fire which is impacting around the Lowmead, Tablelands Road area.\u201d The fire is burning in a south-westerly direction towards John Clifford Way. The Queensland Rural Fire Service has also issued prepare to leave warnings for Promisedland and Pine Creek, south-west of Bundaberg. Residents of the three towns have told to travel to an evacuation centre at Miriam Vale\u2019s community hall, or towards Bundaberg if they have to leave on Wednesday. Much of Queensland will suffer a heatwave for the rest of this week, but the worst is expected in the state\u2019s interior. A petition demanding more resources for firefighters facing longer, hotter bushfire seasons has been delivered to politicians outside NSW parliament, despite authorities insisting they are happy with funding levels. A small crowd of demonstrators carrying placards gathered in Sydney on Wednesday to hand over the petition which has more than 59,000 signatures. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, who received the petition with Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe and Emma Hurst of the Animal Justice party, said the vital volunteer firefighter service was under serious, unsustainable pressure. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the volunteers that they\u2019re in danger of losing their jobs,\u201d Shoebridge said. \u201cTheir employers can\u2019t keep putting them on indefinite leave without state government support ... And where\u2019s the premier? Well, she\u2019s not here.\u201d hoebridge said. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was at Rural Fire Service headquarters on Wednesday for a briefing on the current bushfire threat and the outlook for coming days. At parliament, Leighton Drury, state secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees Union, said volunteers could not be expected to keep fighting long-running, growing fires. \u201cOur volunteers are exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are doing an overwhelming, great job. But should we be expecting them to do this? Well, I say \u2018no\u2019. Even they\u2019re starting to say \u2018no\u2019. We need more professional firefighters.\u201d rury said. He also claimed there has been a \u201csystematic defunding of fire services in NSW\u201d in the past eight years, including a reduction in professional firefighter numbers. Persistent claims of underfunding have been consistently rejected by the Berejiklian government and the premier said on Wednesday that she was proud of the \u201crecord investment\u201d in emergency fire services. The Rural Fire Service\u2019s commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said resourcing and funding for the organisation had \u201cnever been better\u201d. Sydney Water has estimated water usage is going to go up by 6.6% over summer, and has advised people to keep mindful of saving water during the drought period. On the hottest day of summer last summer, 1.919bn litres of water was used, the equivalent of 768 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to Sydney Water. The total daily average water use in Sydney increased by 103m litres over summer compared with the full-year average, too, Sydney Water said. This poses a challenge now. Sydney Water has said people should try to limit showers to four minutes; each extra minute accounts for up to nine litres of water. Using local swimming pools or beaches and the showers there is another option. While the drought rages on, one Queensland mayor needs water for a water skiing complex. Via AAP: An outback mayor said he was confident hundreds of millions litres of water would be secured to fill an enormous water skiing complex at a drought-stricken town in the new year. A 2.4km water ski circuit excavated at Barcaldine, about 1,000km north-west of Brisbane, was ready to receive the water from the Great Artesian Basin, says the mayor, Rob Chandler. He said the project, built to a standard to host state and national barefoot-skiing championships, would be a win for the community suffering through one of its worst droughts on record. Ausgrid is also reminding people to be wary of fallen power lines in bushfire-affected areas. One resident in Spencer, on the Hawkesbury River, almost walked on to a concealed fallen powerline. Albanese also pointed out that Christmas pageants and concerts are being cancelled with the smoke and fire situation. \u201cThis is a crisis and the government is very complacent.\u201d Albanese said he wrote to Morrison to convene a Coag meeting on the bushfire crisis, and he said the PM\u2019s attitude has been \u201cnothing to see here\u201d. \u201cIf there is nothing to see here it\u2019s because they can\u2019t see through the smoke coming from those fires,\u201d he said. He said volunteer firefighters had been in the field for months, giving up wages. \u201cThese are brave and courageous Australians and they deserve more support than they are getting at the moment, and that is the feedback that I have had.\u201d The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, says he isn\u2019t going to criticise the prime minister for going on an overseas holiday (to a destination unknown) while the bushfires are raging across Australia. \u201cI have many criticisms of Scott Morrison, one isn\u2019t when he chooses to go on leave with his family. People are entitled to have leave and that\u2019s a matter for him when he takes it. \u201cMy criticism of him is about his complacency and his failure in areas like this. His failure to develop a national economic plan to deal with the sluggish economy. His failure to have a national drought strategy and his failure to have a national policy. \u201cWhat this government is doing is essentially engaging in a victory tour since May rather than doing, on the economic front, environmental front or on the social policy front, where we\u2019ve had an inadequate response to the interim report on aged care.\u201d An important reminder for when it gets very hot in Victoria today. Industry groups are calling on the Victorian government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to ensure a fair transition for workers in those industries. The groups include the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Victorian head of the Australian Industry Group, Investor Group on Climate Change, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Victorian Council of Social Service, and Environment Victoria. More here, via AAP: \u201cClimate change poses a major threat to the Victorian community, economy and each of the sectors we represent,\u201d the group says. \u201cVictoria is already living with the impacts of 1C of warming above pre-industrial levels, causing more frequent and extreme droughts, bushfires and heatwaves. \u201cThese events cost lives, disproportionately impact vulnerable people and communities, damage infrastructure and ecosystems, and increase costs to businesses and governments.\u201d The group called on the Andrews Labor government, which has already set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, to establish an independent authority to lead the transition. Decarbonising the energy sector \u2013 the biggest contributor to Victorian emissions \u2013 \u201cwill inevitably be a priority\u201d but should be balanced with job creation. Support should also be provided to communities, organisations and businesses to build resilience and adapt to new weather extremes and climatic conditions, the group says. Melbourne has so far been spared the smoky conditions suffered in New South Wales and the ACT, but although today is still forecast to have good air quality in Victoria there is a chance smoke from fires in East Gippsland could be blown to the outer south-eastern suburbs today. A man and a woman were burned fighting fires in regional Queensland on Tuesday afternoon, AAP reports: A man in his 50s received burns to his face, neck and arms while battling a blaze at Lowmead, in the Wide Bay region, north of Brisbane, on Tuesday afternoon. A 60-year-old woman at the same property has burns to her face and airway, and another man in his 50s suffered respiratory problems. All three were taken to hospital in a stable condition. Firefighters have been working overnight to try to contain the fire in Lowmead, which is part of the bigger Mount Maria fire. On Wednesday morning residents were ready to leave if conditions worsened, and some who had evacuated are not yet allowed to go home. That fire is burning in a south-westerly direction towards John Clifford Way. The Queensland Rural Fire Service has also issued prepare to leave warnings for the communities of Promisedland and Pine Creek, south-west of Bundaberg. Residents of the three towns have been told to go to the evacuation centre at Miriam Vale\u2019s community hall, or towards Bundaberg if they have to leave on Wednesday. Much of Queensland will suffer a heatwave for the rest of this week but the worst is expected in the state\u2019s interior. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has urged residents to consider their travel plans over the Christmas period, particularly for those visiting fire-affected towns that have only one road in and out. \u201cWe\u2019ve received a briefing also from the Bureau of Meteorology who indicate that not only are we going to experience very high temperatures on Thursday and on Saturday, but ... exceedingly very concerning wind conditions ... wind fronts that are going to escalate the fuel, or escalate the fires burning. \u201c[There is] also the potential to have spot fires and embers travelling very long distances because of what has been described to me as turbulent wind conditions. [This] is going to mean very unpredictable fire conditions.\u201d he said. The weather bureau says the temperature is set to hit 39C in Melbourne on Wednesday and Swan Hill, in the state\u2019s north-west, is expected to reach 43C, AAP reports: A severe fire danger warning has been issued for the Wimmera which is under a total fire ban. \u201cWith dry, windy and close to 40-degree days predicted, we want everyone to be alert to the symptoms of heat-related illnesses,\u201d Ambulance Victoria\u2019s Justin Dunlop said. \u201cThis heatwave is likely to continue on and off over the coming weeks and we have made sure we have adequate clinical and support staff available to provide the appropriate level of care and response.\u201d Heat-related illness symptoms include heat rash, muscle cramps, heavy sweating, paleness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and fainting. Residents are urged to check on their neighbours, infants, the elderly and expectant mothers who are some of the most vulnerable in this heat, Dunlop said. Metro Trains and Yarra Trams will closely monitor conditions throughout the day to ensure commuters get to their destination. There are no planned service changes so far. Drivers should check their vehicles as breakdowns are more likely to happen in extreme heat, the transport department warned. Three people have been burned while fighting bushfires in Queensland, AAP reports. Two men and a woman were injured at Lowmead, in the Wide Bay region, and were taken to hospital in a stable condition. On Wednesday morning residents were ready to leave if conditions worsened, and some who have already evacuated are not yet being allowed to return home. The fire is burning in a south-westerly direction towards John Clifford Way. Here\u2019s how hot it was in Adelaide. The coolest it got overnight was 28.6C. And as of 9am, it\u2019s already 35.6C. There is a total fire ban across the whole of NSW today, for four days. There are fire bans across eight South Australian districts, in the south and south-east; along the Queensland coast; and one in Victoria (Wimmera). NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is giving a press conference now on the heatwave conditions. \u201cThere is still an element of unpredictability, which is what concerns us,\u201d she says. \u201cGiven the heatwave conditions on Thursday but worse on Saturday, we need everyone to be alert and mindful of the conditions.\u201d Police and emergency services minister David Elliott adds: \u201cThe biggest risk to the people of New South Wales over the four days is complacency.\u201d The Northern Territory and central Australia will bear the brunt of the heat today. The bureau\u2019s forecast is a series of 45C and over, for nearly the whole region. Titjikala and Wulungurru (Kintore) could reach 46C. And on that note, listen to today\u2019s Full Story Podcast \u2013 Is central Australia becoming too hot for humans? \u2013 or read the investigation from Lorena Allam. And fair play to their radio colleagues, who were also evacuated, and had to be a bit sneakier about it. Yesterday, the bushfire smoke was so thick in Canberra it set off the fire alarm in the ABC\u2019s Dickson studio \u2013 a few minutes before the 7pm news. Undeterred, anchor Dan Bourchier and studio crew set up outside the building and broadcast from there. The lead item that night was, ironically, the smoke. \u201cThis appears to be becoming the new normal,\u201d Bourchier said. Good morning. Welcome to day three of this week\u2019s coverage of the bushfire crisis and heatwave. Today, we\u2019re at the start of an extreme, national hot spell, coast to coast, that could smash all kinds of records. There\u2019s a good chance the record for Australia\u2019s hottest single day could be broken \u2013 either today or tomorrow. It currently stands at 40.3C, set in 2013. That\u2019s for the average maximum temperature across the country. It\u2019s forecast to hit 42C in Adelaide \u2013 the start of four days above 40C. Inland, it could be as high 47C in Oodnadatta and Port Augusta; and 43C in Alice Springs in the NT. In Victoria, it will be 39C in Melbourne and 43C in Mildura, while it will be 43C in Wilcannia in New South Wales. In Western Australia, it could reach 46C at Marble Bar and 43C in Kalgoorlie. In Queensland, Birdsville could reach 47C. Stay with us for the latest heat and bushfire updates.",

      "bodyText": "The Norwegian energy giant Equinor has been granted environment approval for its controversial bid to drill to explore for oil in the Great Australian Bight. The decision, announced by the federal offshore petroleum regulator on Wednesday, means Equinor has cleared the second, and most significant, of four regulatory hurdles it needs to pass before it can start drilling. Environment groups immediately flagged a likely legal challenge to the decision by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as Nopsema. The company says its plan shows drilling in waters more than 2km off the South Australian coast can be done safely. Opponents say Equinor has failed to properly consult with affected groups, the bight is a unique marine environment that includes the world\u2019s most important nursery for the endangered southern right whale and rough seas make the proposed site a risky place to drill. Nopsema said it had approved the plan after a rigorous assessment that took almost eight months. Equinor still needs a well operations plan and a facility safety case approved before it can begin drilling. Equinor said Nopsema\u2019s decision was an important milestone. Its Australian manager, Jone Stangeland, said the company had been preparing its proposal for two-and-a-half years, holding more than 400 meetings with community and other organisations. The Wilderness Society said the regulator had ignored the concerns of scientists, coastal councils, traditional owners and environmental groups, and the decision would further mobilise community opposition.

Scientists are also investigating a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2198048\">possible link to cancer</a>.<br><br>As with any chemical, the risks depend on the amount and duration of exposure. Cobalt is a metal that occurs naturally in rocks, water, plants, and animals. It is less toxic than many other metals. At low levels, it is <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=371&amp;tid=64\">beneficial to human health</a> and is a component of vitamin B12.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths\">Apple and Google named in US lawsuit over Congolese child cobalt mining deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the dangers of high doses are increasingly apparent. They were first discovered in the 1960s, when a Canadian brewer started adding cobalt to beer to ensure a consistently foamy head. A surge of <a href=\"https://www.cobaltinstitute.org/cobalt-and-heart-disease.html\">fatal heart attacks among heavy drinkers</a>, who also had poor diets, was linked to the cobalt additive. More recently, German doctors have questioned whether <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5336431/\">surgical implants</a> containing cobalt might also be causing hypersensitivity reactions.<br><br>Cobalt is used in alloys, semiconductors, fertiliser, as a drying agent for varnish and enamel coating for steel. In the form of cobalt sulphate, it is particularly important in lithium batteries, where it acts as a cathode stabiliser.<br><br>These lithium-ion batteries are increasingly in demand for electric cars, laptops and mobile phones, which means cobalt \u2013 once deemed a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cobalt-canada-batteries-1.4903276\">worthless</a> chemical \u2013 is now the object of a geo-strategic rivalry between the world\u2019s biggest economies. It is also potentially exposing humans and other species to greater doses.<br><br>A <a href=\"http://www.aloki.hu/pdf/1705_1141911449.pdf\">study</a> this year noted that global production had increased more than sevenfold between 2008 and 2015 with an increasingly evident impact. \u201cThe appearance of cobalt levels exceeding the environmental threshold levels has led, however, to disturbances in the proper functioning of living organisms,\u201d the paper concluded.</p> <p>Another paper said extended blood concentrations of more than 700 \u00b5g led to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2013.779633\">heart problems and impaired eyesight and hearing</a>. It considered pregnant women who ingest food or drinks containing high levels of the chemical at greatest risk. Earlier research has detected side-effects including diarrhoea, headaches, blood pressure changes and damage to the immunological system. High concentrations of cobalt have been <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303871730_Biological_activity_of_soil_contaminated_with_cobalt_tin_and_molybdenum\">linked to the death of crops and worms </a> vital for soil fertility.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=371&amp;tid=64\">warns that </a>chronic exposure can cause \u201chard metal disease\u201d and even skin contact with cobalt salts or hard metals can result in rashes. They say the safe workweek limit is 0.1 milligrams per cubic metres.<br><br>The environmental impact extends through the life-cycle of the product from refineries, battery plants, consumers goods manufacturers, electronic recycling facilities and waste dumps. Among the most affected are workers at poorly-regulated mines.</p> <p>This has allegedly reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths\">alarming levels in the Congo</a>, which produces more than 60% of the world\u2019s cobalt. Concerns have also been reported in many other countries, where the mineral is often mined in tandem with nickel, copper or silver. <br><br>In Australia, which is the world\u2019s second biggest producer, authorities issued the Whim Creek mine in Pilbara with an environmental protection notice after floods led to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-18/balla-balla-creek-poisoned-by-upstream-copper-mine/11379570\">levels of cobalt, copper and other metals </a>significantly above water quality guidelines. <br><br>In Cuba \u2013 which has the world\u2019s third biggest cobalt reserves \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225406790_Chromium_Cobalt_and_Nickel_Contents_in_Urban_Soils_of_Moa_Northeastern_Cuba\">satellite analysis of the huge open-cast nickel and cobalt mine at </a><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225406790_Chromium_Cobalt_and_Nickel_Contents_in_Urban_Soils_of_Moa_Northeastern_Cuba\">Moa in Holgu\u00edn Province</a> appears to show what researchers have described as a \u201clunar-like landscape\u201d devoid of life over 570 hectares (1,408 acres), while they say their research shows pollution plumes have contaminated 8km of coastline and 10km of the Caba\u00f1as River.</p> <p>Despite these environmental problems, cobalt production is <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/01/is-cuba-the-solution-to-americas-cobalt-insecurity.aspx\">seen as the key to rapprochement</a> with the US, which needs the mineral for its electric car industry and wants to ease Chinese domination of the global supply chain.<br><br>In Zambia, <a href=\"https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/an-investigation-of-concentrations-of-copper-cobalt-and-cadmium-minerals-insoils-and-mango-fruits-growing-on-konkola-copper-mine-t.php?aid=86537\">studies </a>of soil and mango fruit grown near copper and cobalt mines have revealed metals above the safety limit. NGOs say miners in the country are also <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019361456\">prone to silicosis and tuberculosis</a>. <br><br>It is a similar story at Madagascar\u2019s biggest foreign investment project \u2013 the $8bn (\u00a35.9bn) Ambatovy nickel and cobalt mining complex near Toamasina, which <a href=\"https://theecologist.org/2017/nov/23/ambatovy-nickel-mine-madagascar-has-caused-numerous-environmental-problems\">has been blamed </a>for air and water pollution, as well as health problems among the local population. <br><br>Official data, independent reports and scientific studies are scarcer in other producing countries, though the authorities appear to be concerned. In China inspections by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in June 2018 <a href=\"https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3811083/Environmental-scrutiny-disrupts-cobalt-production-in-China-market-participants-downplay-impact-on.html\">temporarily halted production</a> in Jiangxi province, which is the global centre of cobalt refining. Two years ago, the Philippines <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-mining-idUSKBN15H0BQ\">closed or suspended 17 nickel mines</a> \u2013 several of which also produce cobalt \u2013 because of environmental concerns.<br><br>The concerns are likely to grow along with production. It is an exaggeration to say lithium-ion batteries will become the new oil, but a low-carbon future will almost certainly mean high-cobalt energy storage. In 2017, the world\u2019s battery makers used 41,000 tonnes of cobalt (a third of total production). By 2025, this is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/2276/cobalt/\">expected to increase </a>to 117,000 tonnes.</p> <p>The surge in production will increase the dangers of exposure to high doses. To prevent this, more studies and better safeguards are needed now \u2013 particularly in DRC and other countries where people and habitats are most at risk. Failure to do this will mean batteries wreck lives rather than saving the climate.<br><br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "If the prophets of technology are to be believed, the best hope for solving the climate crisis is ever more efficient batteries. But the race to produce enough materials for this energy-storage revolution is creating a host of other environmental problems, as cobalt-producing nations like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Cuba are discovering. Lung disease and heart failure have been linked to high levels of this element, while the mines that produce it are blamed for devastated landscapes, water pollution, contaminated crops and a loss of soil fertility. Scientists are also investigating a possible link to cancer. As with any chemical, the risks depend on the amount and duration of exposure. Cobalt is a metal that occurs naturally in rocks, water, plants, and animals. It is less toxic than many other metals. At low levels, it is beneficial to human health and is a component of vitamin B12. But the dangers of high doses are increasingly apparent. They were first discovered in the 1960s, when a Canadian brewer started adding cobalt to beer to ensure a consistently foamy head. A surge of fatal heart attacks among heavy drinkers, who also had poor diets, was linked to the cobalt additive. More recently, German doctors have questioned whether surgical implants containing cobalt might also be causing hypersensitivity reactions. Cobalt is used in alloys, semiconductors, fertiliser, as a drying agent for varnish and enamel coating for steel. In the form of cobalt sulphate, it is particularly important in lithium batteries, where it acts as a cathode stabiliser. These lithium-ion batteries are increasingly in demand for electric cars, laptops and mobile phones, which means cobalt \u2013 once deemed a worthless chemical \u2013 is now the object of a geo-strategic rivalry between the world\u2019s biggest economies. It is also potentially exposing humans and other species to greater doses. A study this year noted that global production had increased more than sevenfold between 2008 and 2015 with an increasingly evident impact. \u201cThe appearance of cobalt levels exceeding the environmental threshold levels has led, however, to disturbances in the proper functioning of living organisms,\u201d the paper concluded. Another paper said extended blood concentrations of more than 700 \u00b5g led to heart problems and impaired eyesight and hearing. It considered pregnant women who ingest food or drinks containing high levels of the chemical at greatest risk. Earlier research has detected side-effects including diarrhoea, headaches, blood pressure changes and damage to the immunological system. High concentrations of cobalt have been linked to the death of crops and worms vital for soil fertility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US warns that chronic exposure can cause \u201chard metal disease\u201d and even skin contact with cobalt salts or hard metals can result in rashes. They say the safe workweek limit is 0.1 milligrams per cubic metres. The environmental impact extends through the life-cycle of the product from refineries, battery plants, consumers goods manufacturers, electronic recycling facilities and waste dumps. Among the most affected are workers at poorly-regulated mines. This has allegedly reached alarming levels in the Congo, which produces more than 60% of the world\u2019s cobalt. Concerns have also been reported in many other countries, where the mineral is often mined in tandem with nickel, copper or silver. In Australia, which is the world\u2019s second biggest producer, authorities issued the Whim Creek mine in Pilbara with an environmental protection notice after floods led to levels of cobalt, copper and other metals significantly above water quality guidelines. In Cuba \u2013 which has the world\u2019s third biggest cobalt reserves \u2013 satellite analysis of the huge open-cast nickel and cobalt mine at Moa in Holgu\u00edn Province appears to show what researchers have described as a \u201clunar-like landscape\u201d devoid of life over 570 hectares (1,408 acres), while they say their research shows pollution plumes have contaminated 8km of coastline and 10km of the Caba\u00f1as River. Despite these environmental problems, cobalt production is seen as the key to rapprochement with the US, which needs the mineral for its electric car industry and wants to ease Chinese domination of the global supply chain. In Zambia, studies of soil and mango fruit grown near copper and cobalt mines have revealed metals above the safety limit. NGOs say miners in the country are also prone to silicosis and tuberculosis. It is a similar story at Madagascar\u2019s biggest foreign investment project \u2013 the $8bn (\u00a35.9bn) Ambatovy nickel and cobalt mining complex near Toamasina, which has been blamed for air and water pollution, as well as health problems among the local population. Official data, independent reports and scientific studies are scarcer in other producing countries, though the authorities appear to be concerned. In China inspections by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in June 2018 temporarily halted production in Jiangxi province, which is the global centre of cobalt refining. Two years ago, the Philippines closed or suspended 17 nickel mines \u2013 several of which also produce cobalt \u2013 because of environmental concerns. The concerns are likely to grow along with production. It is an exaggeration to say lithium-ion batteries will become the new oil, but a low-carbon future will almost certainly mean high-cobalt energy storage. In 2017, the world\u2019s battery makers used 41,000 tonnes of cobalt (a third of total production). By 2025, this is expected to increase to 117,000 tonnes. The surge in production will increase the dangers of exposure to high doses. To prevent this, more studies and better safeguards are needed now \u2013 particularly in DRC and other countries where people and habitats are most at risk. Failure to do this will mean batteries wreck lives rather than saving the climate.",

The PM has also banned his ministers from attending the World Economic Forum in Davos next month, in what\u2019s being seen as an effort to consolidate the party\u2019s position among working-class voters. * * * Trump hits back \u2013 As the vote on whether to impeach Donald Trump approaches, the president has written a stinging letter accusing Democrats of waging an \u201copen war on democracy\u201d. Six pages packed with scathing criticism accused his opponents of breaking their allegiance to the constitution and cheapening what he calls \u201cthe very ugly word, impeachment!\u201d He accused Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, of having contracted \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d and of viewing \u201cdemocracy as your enemy!\u201d His attack came as more than 700 American historians called for his impeachment and removal from office. * * * Zero-carbon shipping \u2013 Companies owning freighters would have to pay a small levy on every tonne of fuel they use under proposals aimed at developing zero-carbon vessels within 10 years. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which represents 80% of the global shipping industry, is proposing a $2 levy on every tonne of fuel consumed by ships, raising $500m a year that would be devoted to research and development of zero-carbon vessels. The ICS said while the proposed levy was small, it was designed to make it affordable for developing countries, while still raising enough to fund the development of a new generation of carbon-zero ships in a decade or so. * * * Poverty affects patients \u2013 The poorest people have a 29% greater risk of dying from emergency surgery than those from wealthy areas. A University College London study has found a \u201ca significant association between patient poverty and the mortality rates following this commonly performed emergency procedure\u201d. The study suggests that someone\u2019s housing, education, employment status and working conditions \u2013 not just their medical condition \u2013 can influence who is most likely to die. * * * Australia swelters \u2013 As the country experienced its hottest day on record (average maximum temperature on 17 December: 40.9C), there were warnings that smoke taint and sun damage from blazes and heatwaves could affect some of the country\u2019s biggest wine producers. The Hunter Valley \u2013 home to some of the UK\u2019s best-selling wines \u2013 is bounded by bushfires on two sides. Smoke can permeate the skin of the grapes as they ripen, causing the wine to have an unpleasant smokey characteristic. It is worst in red wine, when the skins are used to create colour. Temperatures in the mid to high 40s are expected in wine-producing regions in New South Wales and South Australia this week. * * * \u2018I\u2019m speechless\u2019 \u2013 Fallon Sherrock has made darts history, becoming the first woman to beat a man at the PDC world championship. \u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel really happy because I have proven something for women\u2019s darts, that women can play the men and beat them.\u201d The 25-year-old, whose twin sister Felicia also plays darts, earned her place by winning the UK and Ireland women\u2019s qualifying event. She beat her opponent Ted Evetts as only the fifth woman to take part in the men\u2019s championship. Today in Focus podcast: Inside the mind of scientist James Lovelock James Lovelock, who turned 100 this year, discusses his life\u2019s work, including his latest theory that AI might be the key to saving the planet. And: former US ambassador Samantha Power on finding ways to make a difference in the face of daunting challenges. Lunchtime read: Ian Wright on celebrity, the jungle and being content When Ian Wright entered the jungle for I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!, he was one of the favourites and not put off by the physical challenges. But what he wasn\u2019t expecting was the mental challenge and intense environment (hunger, arguments, isolation), plus the stress of the challenges: \u201cIn hindsight, if I\u2019m being totally honest, I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he says. But in another way, it was a triumph of how far he has come in taking on the challenges of his childhood. Sport J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Fifa\u2019s scheduling of the Club World Cup undermines respect for the competition but Liverpool did not \u201cfly 3,000 miles not to show up\u201d in Qatar. In the first team\u2019s absence, Liverpool\u2019s second string were 4-0 down by half-time before losing their Carabao Cup quarter-final 5-0 at Aston Villa. Eddie Jones is yet to reach an agreement with the Rugby Football Union over continuing as the England coach until 2023 despite a series of meetings with the chief executive, Bill Sweeney. Jess Varnish has won the right to an appeal in her employment case against British Cycling and said: \u201cI believe we\u2019re doing the right thing by not giving up.\u201d Joe Root, Joe Denly and Dom Sibley all scored unbeaten half-centuries as England got their tour of South Africa under way with a leisurely day at the crease in Benoni. And seven jockeys banned at Sandown for allegedly ignoring a stop-race flag have won their appeals and will be able to take part in races throughout the Christmas period. Business All eyes will be on sterling today, after it tumbled by about two cents against the dollar and the euro on the international money markets, as the decision to enshrine time-limited Brexit negotiations into law caught investors by surprise. Yesterday, the PM said he would write into law that the UK will leave the EU in 2020 and will not extend the transition period. It set alarm bells ringing in the City, where bosses and investors have largely been anticipating that the year-long Brexit transition period would likely be extended. Sterling came under heavy selling pressure on the foreign exchanges, falling to about $1.31 against the dollar and to about \u20ac1.18 against the euro, reversing all the post-election gains made since Thursday evening last week. It\u2019s dipped further to \u20ac1.177 and $1.310. The papers The Guardian splashes with Keir Starmer\u2019s push to put an end to Labour\u2019s damaging infighting. The Times has \u201cFurious Labour MPs slam Corbyn for election defeat\u201d, while the Telegraph pictures Boris Johnson being sworn in and the headline: \u201cFurious MPs confront Corbyn over election disaster\u201d. The latter saves its splash for \u201cTurkey lets Hamas plot war on Israel\u201d. The Express has \u201cBoris told to end the agony of HRT drugs crisis\u201d.

Calvino\u2019s dazzling 1973 novel <em>The Castle of Crossed Destinies</em> (published before he was co-opted into the group in 1974) was inspired by two spreads of the Tarot, which he called \u201ca machine for constructing stories\u201d. Perec\u2019s 1969 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/19/1000-novels-comedy-georges-perec\" title=\"\">La Disparition</a></em> is an avant-garde detective novel written entirely without the letter E. In Oulipian terms it is a \u201clipogram in E\u201d, where moreover the missing letter is the crux of the novel (as Philip Terry notes, \u201cthe missing \u2018e\u2019 is a homophone for \u2018<em>eux</em>\u2019, those who disappeared in the Holocaust\u201d). When La Disparition was translated into English by Gilbert Adair in 1995 as A Void, Adair honoured Perec\u2019s central constraint throughout.</p> <p>Mathews\u2019s \u201c35 Variations on a Theme from Shakespeare\u201d functions as an Oulipo sampler in which he demonstrates constraints by applying them, one after another, to Hamlet\u2019s most famous soliloquy.

All of these, and more wonders by all three authors, are sampled in <em>The Penguin Book of Oulipo</em>, a superb selection of 100 Oulipian texts published on the eve of the group\u2019s 60th anniversary.</p> <p>As well as writings by the group itself, Terry\u2019s survey includes the work of so-called \u201canticipatory plagiarists\u201d: Jonathan Swift\u2019s writing machine in <em>Gulliver\u2019s Travels</em>, Lewis Carroll\u2019s experiments with scale in <em>Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</em>, and the painting machine from the \u201cClinamen\u201d chapter of Alfred Jarry\u2019s <em>Exploits and Opinions of Dr Faustroll, Pataphysician</em>. The name of the chapter the last appeared in, \u201cClinamen\u201d, became the Oulipian term for an allowable deviation from the strict application of a constraint that can only be used if it is not needed. Avoiding disappearing down a rabbit hole of his own, Terry briefly sketches but doesn\u2019t go too deeply into the historical connections between Oulipo and the Coll\u00e8ge de \u2019Pataphysique, nor too far into the proliferation of official and unoffocial \u201cOu-X-Po\u201d groups in other fields and genres such as Oulipopo, the study of crime fiction; the extra \u201cpo\u201d from <em>policier</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"140ad53f40a506b1ab39b70d13d50dd1d11caf60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/140ad53f40a506b1ab39b70d13d50dd1d11caf60/0_140_3066_1840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georges Perec in France in 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Georges Perec\u2019s <em>Life, a User\u2019s Manual</em> uses chess moves and other constraints to depict every room in a large Parisian apartment building.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louis Monier/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Illustrating the group\u2019s legacy and the principle that these constraints are available to anyone, Terry also includes examples of writings \u201cafter Oulipo\u201d. There\u2019s an extract from Richard Beard\u2019s arch Donald Barthelme-esque 2011 novel <em>Lazarus Is Dead</em>, the chapters of which shrink then grow again as Lazarus is reborn (schematically reminiscent, in its symmetry, of \u201canticipatory plagiarist\u201d George Herbert\u2019s 1633 calligram \u201cEaster Wings\u201d). We also find Alice Oswald, whose poignant and beautiful <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/02/memorial-alice-oswald-review\" title=\"\">Memorial</a></em> removes most of the <em>Iliad</em>, to leave only accounts of the deaths of 200 soldiers. which she garlands with choruses drawn from Homer\u2019s extended similes: \u201cLike leaves/Sometimes they light their green flames/And are fed by the earth/And sometimes it snuffs them out.\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s in it for the reader? Lovers of puzzles and word games will relish the many sometimes deceptively simple constraints, such as the \u201csnowball\u201d, in which each successive line is one unit (a letter, syllable or word) longer, or the \u201cprisoner\u2019s constraint\u201d, in which letters with ascenders or descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t and y) cannot be used. For Mathews, though, interviewed in the Paris Review, \u201cWhat distinguishes Oulipo from other language games, is that its methods have to be capable of producing valid literary results.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a debate about whether Oulipian authors need be open about the constraints they\u2019re using. Jacques Jouet is pro-transparency \u2013 the \u201cscaffold\u201d is part of the substance of the work. Calvino and Mathews preferred that the reader detect hidden patterns without necessarily knowing what they are; Calvino initially forbade publication of the algorithm behind his most famous novel,<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/22/fiction.italocalvino\" title=\"\">If on a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveller</a></em>. Terry takes Calvino and Mathews\u2019s lead, so as you read through <em>The Penguin Book of Oulipo </em>the writing stands on its own. I\u2019m with Jouet, and like to have ready access to further information. I found the index of constraints challenging and occasionally mystifying, since in trying to discover which were employed in a particular text, one must use it in reverse.</p> <p>Some Oulipian works far transcend whatever constraints produced them. Perec\u2019s masterpiece, <em>Life, a User\u2019s Manual</em>, uses chess moves and various constraints to depict every room in a large Parisian apartment building, and the myriad stories, texts, objects and lives they contain. Even in excerpt, it is a multilayered and supercharged reading experience. When it first appeared in David Bellos\u2019s masterly English translation in 1987, the UK publisher included no mention whatsoever of Oulipo: readers apprehended that something out of the ordinary was afoot, but could grasp only fleeting impressions, enhanced by the typographic games and acrostics captured or created in English.</p> <p>In their provocative 2013 book <em>The End of Oulipo?</em>, Lauren Elkin and Veronica Esposito suggest that Oulipo today can\u2019t help but be overshadowed by its illustrious former members; that \u201cthe dynamism \u2026 has flagged\u201d, and the group is now more concerned with self-promotion, resulting in a kind of Oulipo-lite. Anxieties about live performance \u2013 that Oulipians risk \u201cbecoming \u2018seasoned performers\u2019, working on their stage presence\u201d \u2013 feel like a page v stage straw man. But Elkin also robustly dismantles what she calls the \u201cfrustratingly macho\u201d output of Oulipo\u2019s current president, Herv\u00e9 Le Tellier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/27/top-10-experimental-thrillers\">Top 10 experimental thrillers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the real discovery in <em>The Penguin Book of Oulipo</em> are the works by women. Of particular interest is the British author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/23/christine-brooke-rose1\" title=\"\">Christine Brooke-Rose</a> (1923\u20132012), whose virtuosic, typographically volatile 1998 novel <em>Next</em> is an Oulipo-inspired <em>policier</em> set among the homeless, and written without using the verb \u201cto have\u201d. Juliana Spahr of feminist offshoot Foulipo \u201cslenderises\u201d (removes parts of) the text of anti-abortion legislation to produce the oppositional poem, \u201cHR 4881 is a Joke\u201d.</p> <p>The biggest surprise is Anne Garr\u00e9ta, whose novel <em>Sphinx</em>, first published in 1986, explores DJ culture, gender and sexual politics in Parisian nightclubs. The two main characters are the narrator and their lover A***, the sex or gender of neither of whom is given. <em>Sphinx</em> (available in Emma Ramadan\u2019s 2015 English translation) is ahead of its time, a radical bridge between Kathy Acker, the \u201cchemical generation\u201d authors of the 90s, and emerging innovators such as this year\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/06/we-are-made-of-diamond-stuff-isabel-waidner-review\" title=\"\">Isabel Waidner</a>.</p> <p><em>The Penguin Book of Oulipo</em> already feels indispensable. It\u2019s also a welcome celebration of the contribution of literary translators, including Bellos, Gilbert Adair and William Weaver, to the popularising of this initially reclusive group. Terry\u2019s anthology connects us to a wider world of Oulipian wordplay, and beyond. Perhaps that\u2019s the point.

Avoiding disappearing down a rabbit hole of his own, Terry briefly sketches but doesn\u2019t go too deeply into the historical connections between Oulipo and the Coll\u00e8ge de \u2019Pataphysique, nor too far into the proliferation of official and unoffocial \u201cOu-X-Po\u201d groups in other fields and genres such as Oulipopo, the study of crime fiction; the extra \u201cpo\u201d from policier. Illustrating the group\u2019s legacy and the principle that these constraints are available to anyone, Terry also includes examples of writings \u201cafter Oulipo\u201d. There\u2019s an extract from Richard Beard\u2019s arch Donald Barthelme-esque 2011 novel Lazarus Is Dead, the chapters of which shrink then grow again as Lazarus is reborn (schematically reminiscent, in its symmetry, of \u201canticipatory plagiarist\u201d George Herbert\u2019s 1633 calligram \u201cEaster Wings\u201d). We also find Alice Oswald, whose poignant and beautiful Memorial removes most of the Iliad, to leave only accounts of the deaths of 200 soldiers. which she garlands with choruses drawn from Homer\u2019s extended similes: \u201cLike leaves/Sometimes they light their green flames/And are fed by the earth/And sometimes it snuffs them out.\u201d So what\u2019s in it for the reader? Lovers of puzzles and word games will relish the many sometimes deceptively simple constraints, such as the \u201csnowball\u201d, in which each successive line is one unit (a letter, syllable or word) longer, or the \u201cprisoner\u2019s constraint\u201d, in which letters with ascenders or descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t and y) cannot be used. For Mathews, though, interviewed in the Paris Review, \u201cWhat distinguishes Oulipo from other language games, is that its methods have to be capable of producing valid literary results.\u201d There\u2019s a debate about whether Oulipian authors need be open about the constraints they\u2019re using. Jacques Jouet is pro-transparency \u2013 the \u201cscaffold\u201d is part of the substance of the work. Calvino and Mathews preferred that the reader detect hidden patterns without necessarily knowing what they are; Calvino initially forbade publication of the algorithm behind his most famous novel, If on a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveller. Terry takes Calvino and Mathews\u2019s lead, so as you read through The Penguin Book of Oulipo the writing stands on its own. I\u2019m with Jouet, and like to have ready access to further information. I found the index of constraints challenging and occasionally mystifying, since in trying to discover which were employed in a particular text, one must use it in reverse. Some Oulipian works far transcend whatever constraints produced them. Perec\u2019s masterpiece, Life, a User\u2019s Manual, uses chess moves and various constraints to depict every room in a large Parisian apartment building, and the myriad stories, texts, objects and lives they contain. Even in excerpt, it is a multilayered and supercharged reading experience. When it first appeared in David Bellos\u2019s masterly English translation in 1987, the UK publisher included no mention whatsoever of Oulipo: readers apprehended that something out of the ordinary was afoot, but could grasp only fleeting impressions, enhanced by the typographic games and acrostics captured or created in English. In their provocative 2013 book The End of Oulipo?, Lauren Elkin and Veronica Esposito suggest that Oulipo today can\u2019t help but be overshadowed by its illustrious former members; that \u201cthe dynamism \u2026 has flagged\u201d, and the group is now more concerned with self-promotion, resulting in a kind of Oulipo-lite. Anxieties about live performance \u2013 that Oulipians risk \u201cbecoming \u2018seasoned performers\u2019, working on their stage presence\u201d \u2013 feel like a page v stage straw man. But Elkin also robustly dismantles what she calls the \u201cfrustratingly macho\u201d output of Oulipo\u2019s current president, Herv\u00e9 Le Tellier. And the real discovery in The Penguin Book of Oulipo are the works by women. Of particular interest is the British author Christine Brooke-Rose (1923\u20132012), whose virtuosic, typographically volatile 1998 novel Next is an Oulipo-inspired policier set among the homeless, and written without using the verb \u201cto have\u201d. Juliana Spahr of feminist offshoot Foulipo \u201cslenderises\u201d (removes parts of) the text of anti-abortion legislation to produce the oppositional poem, \u201cHR 4881 is a Joke\u201d. The biggest surprise is Anne Garr\u00e9ta, whose novel Sphinx, first published in 1986, explores DJ culture, gender and sexual politics in Parisian nightclubs. The two main characters are the narrator and their lover A***, the sex or gender of neither of whom is given. Sphinx (available in Emma Ramadan\u2019s 2015 English translation) is ahead of its time, a radical bridge between Kathy Acker, the \u201cchemical generation\u201d authors of the 90s, and emerging innovators such as this year\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-nominated Isabel Waidner. The Penguin Book of Oulipo already feels indispensable. It\u2019s also a welcome celebration of the contribution of literary translators, including Bellos, Gilbert Adair and William Weaver, to the popularising of this initially reclusive group. Terry\u2019s anthology connects us to a wider world of Oulipian wordplay, and beyond. Perhaps that\u2019s the point. After all, as Calvino reminds us in The Castle of Crossed Destinies, there are certain fountains that \u201conce you drink from them, increase your thirst instead of slaking it\u201d. \u2022 The Penguin Book of Oulipo: Queneau, Perec, Calvino and the Adventure of Form, edited by Philip Terry, is published by Penguin (RRP \u00a325).

      "body": "<p>Keir Starmer has set out his pitch for the Labour leadership with a call for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result.</p> <p>While the leadership race has not yet formally been launched, the shadow Brexit secretary confirmed to the Guardian that, as widely expected in Westminster, he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Starmer said Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d nor sufficiently deal with antisemitism, and urged his party to return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d.</p> <p>He insisted Labour could win the next general election; but only if it sticks to its values. \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding from it. It is a devastating result, but it\u2019s important not to oversteer. The case for a bold and radical Labour government is as strong now as it was last Thursday. We need to anchor ourselves in that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI want trust to be restored in the Labour party as a progressive force for good: and that means we have to win. But there\u2019s no victory without values.\u201d</p> <p>He said these include opposing \u201cthe moral injustice of poverty, inequality, homelessness\u201d while advocating for internationalism and human rights.</p> <p>Starmer was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/election-coverage-dominated-by-johnson-and-corbyn-study-finds\">given few opportunities to speak for his party</a> during the election campaign as Labour strategists sought to dodge the fraught question of Brexit. But he believes he could have made a better job than Corbyn of criticising the central claim of the Tories\u2019 campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we tackled the \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 slogan strongly enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have taken it down. Frankly I\u2019d have liked the opportunity to have done it.\u201d</p> <p>He also echoed the view that the Labour manifesto represented a \u201cpolicy overload\u201d. \u201cWe had important things, housing and public sector pay rises, but you couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear is that they have a majority now to do pretty much as they like. They have a leader who I don\u2019t think has any moral compass, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere he won\u2019t go to stay in power. I think they have a leader who has made all sorts of promises he\u2019s never going to be able to keep, and he will distract from his own failures by attacking those that are already the most vulnerable in our society.\u201d </p> <p>Starmer, whose remain stance was partly blamed by some allies of Corbyn, including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, for losing Labour the election, conceded that the argument for a referendum had been \u201cswept away\u201d by the election result.</p> <p>But he said his party must not give up the fight against the Conservatives. \u201cThe Brexit debate changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will leave in January and the argument will have to be about the type of deal that we have with Europe: and we will argue, as we argued before, for a deal that protects our economy, protects our jobs, and working standards, the environment and consumers. That is really important.\u201d</p> <p>He also criticised the \u201cbaggage\u201d Labour took into the election campaign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deal with antisemitism and that became a question of values and a question of competence,\u201d he said, blaming \u201cfactionalism\u201d for the failure to tackle the issue.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of being seen as a moral issue, where you were judging what people had said, the question became \u2018what side are you on?\u2019 It got tangled up. Frankly there\u2019s been too much factionalism.\u201d</p> <p>This is perhaps his strongest critique of the party\u2019s outgoing leader, whom Starmer is still careful to praise for setting a radical course and making anti-austerity a crusading issue.</p> <p>He said Labour must now return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d and praised Momentum as well as \u201cpeople who might self-identify as Blairites\u201d. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a fight for one side to obliterate the other,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey, widely considered the continuity candidate in the leadership election, is likely to pitch herself on the left of the political spectrum as a Corbynite. But Starmer suggested such labels are unhelpful.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would call me a Corbynista, but I\u2019m a socialist,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed on my head to know what I think.</p> <p>\u201cA Labour party that strays too far from its values, loses. In the end, the Labour party strayed too far from its values between 1997 and 2010,\u201d he said, citing the Iraq war and the failure to reduce inequality.</p> <p>Different errors were made by the party in its opposition years, he added. \u201cIn 2010, we thought because they\u2019d won the election, they\u2019d won the argument about austerity \u2013 they hadn\u2019t. We thought in 2015 because they\u2019d won the election, they\u2019d won the argument about welfare \u2013 they hadn\u2019t. We mustn\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"047e03eb9d1385e223b99b550f11dcf871b2c176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/047e03eb9d1385e223b99b550f11dcf871b2c176/0_131_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Long-Bailey and Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Long-Bailey is widely considered to be the leadership\u2019s favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starmer defended himself against accusations from his critics that he is too middle-class to speak to the heartlands and too lawyerly to connect with voters.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad was a toolmaker and my mum was a nurse. And not everybody knows that and that\u2019s because I don\u2019t say it very often,\u201d he said, adding his father wouldn\u2019t have trumpeted it. \u201cHis pride came not from the fact that he worked in a factory, but from the fact that because he worked in a factory, his son could go to university, and become a lawyer. So the middle class background just doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d</p> <p>He also described his late mother\u2019s almost lifelong struggle with the debilitating and chronically painful Still\u2019s disease, which left her in a wheelchair. \u201cShe was unable to eat or speak. And she never spoke, before she died, to our children \u2026 She wouldn\u2019t have moaned. If you\u2019d asked her how she was, she\u2019d say, \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Starmer said half his time as a lawyer was spent doing pro bono work for people who needed his assistance. He cited a life-saving, decades-long project to get rid of the death penalty in the Caribbean and in Africa. \u201cThat was work done for free, out of a deep sense of cause \u2026 Politics can be done in many different ways and many different forms.\u201d</p> <p>Famously, he assisted Dave Morris and Helen Steel in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/16/foodanddrink\">the \u201cMcLibel\u201d case</a>. Less well known is that he was on the picket line at Wapping \u201cas a legal observer, but in the middle of the crowd as the horses were charging towards us,\u201d and brought numerous cases against the Blair government. \u201cI\u2019m sure actually Blair would disown me.\u201d </p> <p>Though he lacks heartland credentials, \u201cthe leader of the opposition has to speak for all of England, and Scotland, and Wales, and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said.</p> <p> He said it was \u201cundeniably true\u201d that he could be running for Labour leader at a time when many believe the role should be filled by a woman.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there will be very good women candidates in this race, we know that. If I am in this race, it will be because of the ideas I want to put forward, and my determination that the Labour party can be a force for good and can bring about radical change. To get from where we are to where we need to be in four and a half years is a mountain to climb. This is not going to be done by one person alone, it is a team effort.\u201d</p> <p><br>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 &amp; 18 January 2020 because an earlier version referred to Starmer defending the Helen Steel and Dave Morris in the McLibel case. To clarify: Starmer assisted them during the trial and appeal in the English courts and represented them at the European court action against the UK government which ended in 2005. But Steel and Morris famously defended themselves throughout the litigation in England which spanned 9 years.</p> <p><br></p>",

Starmer was given few opportunities to speak for his party during the election campaign as Labour strategists sought to dodge the fraught question of Brexit. But he believes he could have made a better job than Corbyn of criticising the central claim of the Tories\u2019 campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think we tackled the \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 slogan strongly enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have taken it down. Frankly I\u2019d have liked the opportunity to have done it.\u201d He also echoed the view that the Labour manifesto represented a \u201cpolicy overload\u201d. \u201cWe had important things, housing and public sector pay rises, but you couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fear is that they have a majority now to do pretty much as they like. They have a leader who I don\u2019t think has any moral compass, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere he won\u2019t go to stay in power. I think they have a leader who has made all sorts of promises he\u2019s never going to be able to keep, and he will distract from his own failures by attacking those that are already the most vulnerable in our society.\u201d Starmer, whose remain stance was partly blamed by some allies of Corbyn, including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, for losing Labour the election, conceded that the argument for a referendum had been \u201cswept away\u201d by the election result. But he said his party must not give up the fight against the Conservatives. \u201cThe Brexit debate changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will leave in January and the argument will have to be about the type of deal that we have with Europe: and we will argue, as we argued before, for a deal that protects our economy, protects our jobs, and working standards, the environment and consumers. That is really important.\u201d He also criticised the \u201cbaggage\u201d Labour took into the election campaign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deal with antisemitism and that became a question of values and a question of competence,\u201d he said, blaming \u201cfactionalism\u201d for the failure to tackle the issue. \u201cInstead of being seen as a moral issue, where you were judging what people had said, the question became \u2018what side are you on?\u2019 It got tangled up. Frankly there\u2019s been too much factionalism.\u201d This is perhaps his strongest critique of the party\u2019s outgoing leader, whom Starmer is still careful to praise for setting a radical course and making anti-austerity a crusading issue. He said Labour must now return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d and praised Momentum as well as \u201cpeople who might self-identify as Blairites\u201d. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a fight for one side to obliterate the other,\u201d he said. Rebecca Long-Bailey, widely considered the continuity candidate in the leadership election, is likely to pitch herself on the left of the political spectrum as a Corbynite. But Starmer suggested such labels are unhelpful. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would call me a Corbynista, but I\u2019m a socialist,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. \u201cA Labour party that strays too far from its values, loses. In the end, the Labour party strayed too far from its values between 1997 and 2010,\u201d he said, citing the Iraq war and the failure to reduce inequality. Different errors were made by the party in its opposition years, he added. \u201cIn 2010, we thought because they\u2019d won the election, they\u2019d won the argument about austerity \u2013 they hadn\u2019t. We thought in 2015 because they\u2019d won the election, they\u2019d won the argument about welfare \u2013 they hadn\u2019t. We mustn\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d Starmer defended himself against accusations from his critics that he is too middle-class to speak to the heartlands and too lawyerly to connect with voters. \u201cMy dad was a toolmaker and my mum was a nurse. And not everybody knows that and that\u2019s because I don\u2019t say it very often,\u201d he said, adding his father wouldn\u2019t have trumpeted it. \u201cHis pride came not from the fact that he worked in a factory, but from the fact that because he worked in a factory, his son could go to university, and become a lawyer. So the middle class background just doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d He also described his late mother\u2019s almost lifelong struggle with the debilitating and chronically painful Still\u2019s disease, which left her in a wheelchair. \u201cShe was unable to eat or speak. And she never spoke, before she died, to our children \u2026 She wouldn\u2019t have moaned. If you\u2019d asked her how she was, she\u2019d say, \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019\u201d Starmer said half his time as a lawyer was spent doing pro bono work for people who needed his assistance. He cited a life-saving, decades-long project to get rid of the death penalty in the Caribbean and in Africa. \u201cThat was work done for free, out of a deep sense of cause \u2026 Politics can be done in many different ways and many different forms.\u201d Famously, he assisted Dave Morris and Helen Steel in the \u201cMcLibel\u201d case. Less well known is that he was on the picket line at Wapping \u201cas a legal observer, but in the middle of the crowd as the horses were charging towards us,\u201d and brought numerous cases against the Blair government. \u201cI\u2019m sure actually Blair would disown me.\u201d Though he lacks heartland credentials, \u201cthe leader of the opposition has to speak for all of England, and Scotland, and Wales, and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. He said it was \u201cundeniably true\u201d that he could be running for Labour leader at a time when many believe the role should be filled by a woman. \u201cAnd there will be very good women candidates in this race, we know that. If I am in this race, it will be because of the ideas I want to put forward, and my determination that the Labour party can be a force for good and can bring about radical change. To get from where we are to where we need to be in four and a half years is a mountain to climb. This is not going to be done by one person alone, it is a team effort.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 &amp; 18 January 2020 because an earlier version referred to Starmer defending the Helen Steel and Dave Morris in the McLibel case. To clarify: Starmer assisted them during the trial and appeal in the English courts and represented them at the European court action against the UK government which ended in 2005. But Steel and Morris famously defended themselves throughout the litigation in England which spanned 9 years.",

The charges would then be sent to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, setting up a much more challenging constitutional bar: no president has ever been convicted and removed from office, Richard Nixon having resigned in 1974 before a vote on articles of impeachment.</p> \n<p>Around the country, thousands of protestors attended rallies in support of impeachment. The demonstrations were organized by <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FMoveOn.org\">MoveOn.org</a> and a coalition of progressive groups.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has accused Democratic leaders in the House of declaring \u201copen war on American democracy\u201d, on the eve of a historic vote that is likely to make him only the third president in US history to be impeached. Trump issued the incendiary accusation in an intemperately-worded letter sent to the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday. Over six pages packed with scathing criticism, the president charges the architects of the impeachment process with violating their oaths of office, breaking their allegiance to the constitution and cheapening what he calls \u201cthe very ugly word, impeachment!\u201d The president\u2019s claim that the impeachment process declares \u201copen war\u201d on democracy is a thinly veiled attempt to redirect back at his opponents accusations that he abused his power and obstructed Congress. A consistent Democratic line has been that the president violated his position in pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, the former vice-president Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s letter rehashes several of his favorite talking points, regurgitated profusely on his Twitter feed. He claims his phone conversations with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, were \u201cperfect\u201d and repeats a debunked conspiracy theory that Biden had forced the ousting of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to stymie an investigation into corruption at an energy company that employed his son Hunter. Most colorfully, Trump accuses Pelosi of having contracted \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d and of viewing \u201cdemocracy as your enemy!\u201d The letter finishes on a grandiose flourish, saying it was composed \u201cfor the purpose of history\u201d. \u201cOne hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it \u2026 so that it can never happen to another president again.\u201d The letter was delivered hours after Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, who will control an impeachment trial should the House vote as expected on Wednesday to bring formal charges against Trump, rebuffed a Democratic request to call new witnesses and dismissed the process as a \u201csloppy \u2026 fishing expedition\u201d. The majority leader took to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday to underline what he has already made clear \u2013 his disdain for the impeachment process. Swatting aside a suggestion from Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, that senior White House officials should be called to testify, he scathingly said: \u201cSo now the Senate Democratic leader would apparently like our chamber to do House Democrats\u2019 homework for them. And he wants to volunteer the Senate\u2019s time and energy on a fishing expedition.\u201d He added: \u201cFrom everything we can tell, House Democrats\u2019 slapdash impeachment inquiry has failed to come anywhere near \u2013 anywhere near \u2013 the bar for impeaching a duly elected president, let alone removing him for the first time in American history.\u201d McConnell\u2019s pugnacious response came on the eve of a historic vote in the House that is all but certain to pass two articles of impeachment against Trump. According to a count by the Associated Press on Tuesday, Pelosi had enough votes in favor, despite some speculation on how centrist Democrats and those from Republican-leaning districts would vote. The first accuses the president of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. The second charges him with obstructing Congress by blocking the appearance of key administration figures at impeachment hearings. The vote would make Trump only the third president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. The charges would then be sent to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, setting up a much more challenging constitutional bar: no president has ever been convicted and removed from office, Richard Nixon having resigned in 1974 before a vote on articles of impeachment. Around the country, thousands of protestors attended rallies in support of impeachment. The demonstrations were organized by MoveOn.org and a coalition of progressive groups. Bundled up in winter parkas, protestors marched across New York\u2019s Times Square chanting \u201cNo one\u2019s above the law\u201d. McConnell\u2019s outburst came in reply to a letter from Schumer that outlined how he thought a trial should be conducted. Schumer said four new witnesses should be called, including John Bolton, the national security adviser fired by Trump in September, and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Both Bolton and Mulvaney have first-hand knowledge of events relating to Trump\u2019s interaction with the Ukraine government. Neither complied with requests to testify during House intelligence committee hearings that laid out evidence against the president. McConnell\u2019s refusal to entertain the idea of calling extra witnesses falls in step with the Republican strategy of dealing with impeachment by largely shunning it in a hyper-partisan display. Other key Republicans, including the Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham, have said they have made their minds up about the verdict they will deliver even though they are given the role under the constitution of impartial jurors. In his own Senate floor speech criticizing McConnell, Schumer said: \u201cWe will have votes on whether these people should testify and whether these documents should be made public ... and the American people will be watching.\u201d He added: \u201cSenators who oppose this plan will have to explain why less evidence is better than more evidence.\u201d The Democrat also cited a new poll that showed a significant majority of Americans believe Trump should allow his advisers to testify in a Senate trial. According to the Washington Post/ABC News poll, seven in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his aides to testify and six in 10 expect a fair Senate trial. However, the public remains sharply divided on the question of whether Trump should be removed. The poll found that 49% support removal, compared with 46% who oppose it. On Tuesday, a succession of moderate Democrats representing districts Trump won in 2016 announced that they would vote for impeachment. Trump also faced rebuke by more than 700 leading American historians who signed an open letter which said he should be removed. \u201cIt is our considered judgment,\u201d the historians wrote, \u201cthat if President Trump\u2019s misconduct does not rise to the level of impeachment, then virtually nothing does.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Lynn Enright had a hysteroscopy to examine the inside of the womb, her searing pain was dismissed by medical professionals. She finally understood why when she started working on her book on female anatomy, Vagina: A Re-education. She was looking for research on pain and women\u2019s health, only to be shocked by how little data she found. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the topic of pain that was poorly researched. The lack of evidence was a problem she encountered time and time again, which is no surprise when you look at the research gap: <a href=\"http://www.ukcrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/UKCRCHealthResearchAnalysis2014-WEB.pdf\">less than 2.5% of publicly funded research </a>is dedicated solely to reproductive health, despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/survey-reveals-women-experience-severe-reproductive-health-issues\">one in three women in the UK</a> will suffer from a reproductive or gynaecological health problem. There is five times more research into erectile dysfunction, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/why-do-we-still-not-know-what-causes-pms\">which affects 19% of men</a>, than into premenstrual syndrome, which affects 90% of women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/13/were-at-breaking-point-will-uk-scientists-big-ideas-survive-brexit\">'We're at breaking point': will UK scientists' big ideas survive Brexit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWomen have been woefully neglected in studies on pain. Most of our understanding of ailments comes from the perspective of men; it is overwhelmingly based on studies of men, carried out by men,\u201d Enright says.</p> <p>Her book is one of several in the past year about the female body and the impact a lack of knowledge can have on diagnosis and treatment. They include Emma Barnett\u2019s Period, Eleanor Morgan\u2019s Hormonal, and Gabrielle Jackson\u2019s Pain and Prejudice, which draws on her experience of being diagnosed with endometriosis, a chronically underfunded condition.</p> <p>Given that in the US, which produces a lot of medical research, research trials weren\u2019t required by the National Institutes of Health to include women <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/30/us/research-neglects-women-studies-find.html\">until 1993</a>, the lack of knowledge is perhaps no surprise. Traditionally this was justified by the idea that women\u2019s bodies were seen to be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800017/\">too complex due to fluctuating hormon</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800017/\">es, </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800017/\">so clinical trials often excluded them</a>.</p> <p>But why does the gender health gap still exist? Andrew Horne, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Edinburgh, argues that funding disparities remain a problem.</p> <p>\u201cHistorically, although this got better, the main funding bodies like the Medical Research Council, the National Institutes of Health, and the Wellcome Trust didn\u2019t particularly favour reproductive health research,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s changing now, but for a long time the panels were made up of men who weren\u2019t aware of reproductive health research. A lot of funding went to conditions which either affected both men and women, or just men.\u201d</p> <p>He puts this down to a lack of knowledge about the conditions and how common they are, pointing out that endometriosis affects one in 10 women, which means it is as common as diabetes in women.</p> <p>\u201cThe proportion of funding that goes into diabetes far exceeds the levels of funding that goes into endometriosis. From a personal perspective, as a researcher, it\u2019s been difficult: you sometimes feel quite despondent when you get rejected from funding bodies and when the funding landscape is quite limited.\u201d</p> <p>One reason for this is the lack of charities solely focused on women\u2019s health. For example, cardiovascular disease is a well-funded area of medical research thanks in part to large charities such as the British Heart Foundation, which invests <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/research-funding\">an average of \u00a3100m a year</a>.</p> <p>One of the only grant-giving bodies for women\u2019s health is <a href=\"https://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/\">Wellbeing For Women</a>, which focuses on three areas: pregnancy and birth, gynaecological cancers, and wellbeing issues such as endometriosis and menopause. The charity is currently funding 30 projects in universities. Horne is one of its current benefactors, with a project looking into the possibility of repurposing anti-cancer drugs to treat endometriosis.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s support is in high demand. It received 127 applications to its 2019 grant, scholarship and fellowship funding rounds but made only 14 awards (a total value of more than \u00a3975,000). Only 11% of all applications considered by its research advisory committee received funding.</p> <p>Sarah Francis, a spokesperson for the charity, says that although things have improved, women\u2019s health continues to be \u201coverlooked and underfunded\u201d. Francis believes stigma still plays a part in why.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough things are changing, there is and has been a lot of taboo around women\u2019s health issues. Women themselves often don\u2019t want to talk about menstrual disorders or incontinence,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWith the menopause, we have noticed that more women are talking about it and companies now want to support employees better, so we have been funding research into tools for women going through the menopause in the workplace. For a long time, however, it wasn\u2019t something that was discussed openly.

      "bodyText": "When Lynn Enright had a hysteroscopy to examine the inside of the womb, her searing pain was dismissed by medical professionals. She finally understood why when she started working on her book on female anatomy, Vagina: A Re-education. She was looking for research on pain and women\u2019s health, only to be shocked by how little data she found. It wasn\u2019t just the topic of pain that was poorly researched. The lack of evidence was a problem she encountered time and time again, which is no surprise when you look at the research gap: less than 2.5% of publicly funded research is dedicated solely to reproductive health, despite the fact that one in three women in the UK will suffer from a reproductive or gynaecological health problem. There is five times more research into erectile dysfunction, which affects 19% of men, than into premenstrual syndrome, which affects 90% of women. \u201cWomen have been woefully neglected in studies on pain. Most of our understanding of ailments comes from the perspective of men; it is overwhelmingly based on studies of men, carried out by men,\u201d Enright says. Her book is one of several in the past year about the female body and the impact a lack of knowledge can have on diagnosis and treatment. They include Emma Barnett\u2019s Period, Eleanor Morgan\u2019s Hormonal, and Gabrielle Jackson\u2019s Pain and Prejudice, which draws on her experience of being diagnosed with endometriosis, a chronically underfunded condition. Given that in the US, which produces a lot of medical research, research trials weren\u2019t required by the National Institutes of Health to include women until 1993, the lack of knowledge is perhaps no surprise. Traditionally this was justified by the idea that women\u2019s bodies were seen to be too complex due to fluctuating hormones, so clinical trials often excluded them. But why does the gender health gap still exist? Andrew Horne, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Edinburgh, argues that funding disparities remain a problem. \u201cHistorically, although this got better, the main funding bodies like the Medical Research Council, the National Institutes of Health, and the Wellcome Trust didn\u2019t particularly favour reproductive health research,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s changing now, but for a long time the panels were made up of men who weren\u2019t aware of reproductive health research. A lot of funding went to conditions which either affected both men and women, or just men.\u201d He puts this down to a lack of knowledge about the conditions and how common they are, pointing out that endometriosis affects one in 10 women, which means it is as common as diabetes in women. \u201cThe proportion of funding that goes into diabetes far exceeds the levels of funding that goes into endometriosis. From a personal perspective, as a researcher, it\u2019s been difficult: you sometimes feel quite despondent when you get rejected from funding bodies and when the funding landscape is quite limited.\u201d One reason for this is the lack of charities solely focused on women\u2019s health. For example, cardiovascular disease is a well-funded area of medical research thanks in part to large charities such as the British Heart Foundation, which invests an average of \u00a3100m a year. One of the only grant-giving bodies for women\u2019s health is Wellbeing For Women, which focuses on three areas: pregnancy and birth, gynaecological cancers, and wellbeing issues such as endometriosis and menopause. The charity is currently funding 30 projects in universities. Horne is one of its current benefactors, with a project looking into the possibility of repurposing anti-cancer drugs to treat endometriosis. The charity\u2019s support is in high demand. It received 127 applications to its 2019 grant, scholarship and fellowship funding rounds but made only 14 awards (a total value of more than \u00a3975,000). Only 11% of all applications considered by its research advisory committee received funding. Sarah Francis, a spokesperson for the charity, says that although things have improved, women\u2019s health continues to be \u201coverlooked and underfunded\u201d. Francis believes stigma still plays a part in why. \u201cAlthough things are changing, there is and has been a lot of taboo around women\u2019s health issues. Women themselves often don\u2019t want to talk about menstrual disorders or incontinence,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the menopause, we have noticed that more women are talking about it and companies now want to support employees better, so we have been funding research into tools for women going through the menopause in the workplace. For a long time, however, it wasn\u2019t something that was discussed openly. With less public support, there is less money to fund research.\u201d Not everyone agrees that funding is the problem. Lucilla Poston, head of the department of women and children\u2019s health at Kings College, London says the Medical Research Council (MRC) and other bodies would argue that it is competitive funding anybody can apply for. \u201cThe MRC doesn\u2019t ring-fence money for any particular area. If a project is competitive, it stands a good chance of getting funded,\u201d she says. The latest statistics show MRC\u2019s funding for projects involving women\u2019s health totalled \u00a320m in 2015-16. This money funded research into caesarian sections and associated complications, preeclampsia, contraceptive use and endometriosis, among other projects. In fact, contrary to recent headlines, Poston doesn\u2019t believe there is any prejudice; instead, she thinks the real problem is that not enough researchers are attracted into \u2013 and retained in \u2013 the field of women\u2019s health. \u201cCancer, genetics and cardiovascular have got much bigger populations of researchers working in the field. The fact that a disproportionate amount of funding goes to them is probably largely due to the number of researchers they have who are applying for grants,\u201d she says. Poston says the solution is to have more competitive fellowships. \u201cThere are very few focused on women\u2019s health. We could do with more to increase the actual critical mass of researchers in the field,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have good, high-quality scientists, they will be competitive as everybody else when it comes to applying for grants.\u201d Until more research is done into women\u2019s health, women will continue to be ignored when they speak to medical professionals about their symptoms, Enright argues. This needs to be addressed urgently, especially given that the gender gap can be compounded by worrying racial disparities: black women are five times more likely to die during pregnancy and birth in the UK. \u201cThese stats, which show a distressing disparity, play into a lot of what I have found about women not being listened to,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen of colour, in particular, are not having their concerns addressed as urgently as they should be.

That speech described accurately the science of human-induced climate change and the scale of its economic impact. The prime minister advocated a strong global response then; but what followed was too little. You have the opportunity to lead a better international effort. But first, we must get our own house in order.\u201d</p> <p>Renewed economic policies and new regulations will both be vital, the committee said. There should also be more work on helping the UK adapt to the likely impacts of global heating, including more resources for flood prevention and planning for long droughts, such as the UK drought that caused widespread problems two years ago.</p> <p>Buildings, transport, electricity, industry and agriculture must be the five key areas of focus, the CCC said, and action on all fronts must begin urgently.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been nearly seven months since the net-zero target became law. Every day of inaction makes the challenge of cutting emissions harder and costlier. Technological innovation is only part of the answer. We must not wait for future technologies to solve the problems we can already tackle with known solutions,\u201d the committee said.</p> <p>Campaigners urged Johnson to make following the committee\u2019s advice a priority. \u201cAside from being crucial to life and wellbeing, action on climate change makes economic sense. It brings significant benefits for public health, UK jobs, and industries,\u201d said Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister was alarmingly quiet on the climate crisis during his election campaign \u2013 failing to attend the televised debate on climate, and giving little attention to the issue in his party manifesto.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more lost time where science is ignored and ministers dawdle over climate action. It\u2019s time that the government listens to its own advisers and stops the climate crisis worsening.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cIn the manifesto, which delivered a majority for the prime minister, he clearly set out his vision to ensure Britain has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on Earth. This government will deliver on our science-led target of net zero by 2050.</p> <p>\u201cFrom increasing tree planting rates to bringing forward the phase out date for petrol and diesel cars, we will provide the policies needed to ensure we are on track to hit our world-leading climate targets and demonstrate our global leadership in advance of the crucial COP26 talks in Glasgow next year.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been urged to follow in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher by taking to the world stage to lead international action on the climate emergency \u2013 but to put the UK\u2019s own emissions-cutting efforts back on track first. The prime minister was told on Wednesday that the UK had so far \u201cfallen short\u201d on its commitments to tackle greenhouse gases, in a letter from the committee on climate change (CCC). To succeed, Johnson must bring forward new policies across the board as a matter of urgency, \u201cdemanding ambitious policy from all departments to ensure homes, businesses, industry, transport and land are helping to deliver net zero\u201d, according to a letter to Downing Street from the government\u2019s statutory advisers on how to achieve the UK\u2019s long-term goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2050. The UK is to host crunch UN talks on the climate emergency in Glasgow next November, at which nations will be asked to update their commitments on emissions under the Paris agreement. Lord Deben, the chair of the committee and a former Conservative environment minister under Thatcher, wrote: \u201cWe marked recently the 30th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1989 speech to the UN general assembly. That speech described accurately the science of human-induced climate change and the scale of its economic impact. The prime minister advocated a strong global response then; but what followed was too little. You have the opportunity to lead a better international effort. But first, we must get our own house in order.\u201d Renewed economic policies and new regulations will both be vital, the committee said. There should also be more work on helping the UK adapt to the likely impacts of global heating, including more resources for flood prevention and planning for long droughts, such as the UK drought that caused widespread problems two years ago. Buildings, transport, electricity, industry and agriculture must be the five key areas of focus, the CCC said, and action on all fronts must begin urgently. \u201cIt has been nearly seven months since the net-zero target became law. Every day of inaction makes the challenge of cutting emissions harder and costlier. Technological innovation is only part of the answer. We must not wait for future technologies to solve the problems we can already tackle with known solutions,\u201d the committee said. Campaigners urged Johnson to make following the committee\u2019s advice a priority. \u201cAside from being crucial to life and wellbeing, action on climate change makes economic sense. It brings significant benefits for public health, UK jobs, and industries,\u201d said Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth. \u201cThe prime minister was alarmingly quiet on the climate crisis during his election campaign \u2013 failing to attend the televised debate on climate, and giving little attention to the issue in his party manifesto. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more lost time where science is ignored and ministers dawdle over climate action. It\u2019s time that the government listens to its own advisers and stops the climate crisis worsening.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cIn the manifesto, which delivered a majority for the prime minister, he clearly set out his vision to ensure Britain has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on Earth. This government will deliver on our science-led target of net zero by 2050. \u201cFrom increasing tree planting rates to bringing forward the phase out date for petrol and diesel cars, we will provide the policies needed to ensure we are on track to hit our world-leading climate targets and demonstrate our global leadership in advance of the crucial COP26 talks in Glasgow next year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the arid lands that have seen one of the most brutal wars of the 21st century so far, green shoots of peace may finally be appearing. In the hot Darfur fields farmed by Adam Ali Mohammed, these green shoots are alternating rows of lentils and melons. \u201cWe tried lentils before, but there was not enough water,\u201d the farmer says. Here in the Sahel, water is the key to life, but there is precious little of it \u2013 just 20cm of rain a year \u2013 and it is the source of much of the conflict. The climate crisis is making marginal existences even more fragile. It is no future threat here, with the Sahara marching southwards, temperatures rising and precious annual rains becoming ever more erratic. But a new approach is bearing fruit. The seasonal river that runs by El Fasher, the capital of Sudan\u2019s North Darfur state, has been transformed by community-built weirs. These slow the flow of the rainy season downpours, spreading water and allowing it to seep into the land. Before, just 150 farmers could make a living here: now, 4,000 work the land by the Sail Gedaim weir. Crucially, the weirs are not just promising a more bountiful future, but a more peaceful one. Communities of farmers and nomadic camel herders, deadly enemies during the war, are coming together to plan and build them. This has often meant meeting face to face for the first time since the conflict began in 2003, but recrimination has turned into cooperation over shared water, and even resulted in wedding invitations. \u201cThere was a lot of killing here \u2013 there isn\u2019t enough time to tell you about it all,\u201d says Sheik Abdoelhman Saeed, part of the Sail Gedaim weir committee. \u201cBut now we are planning among ourselves to reach new areas with weirs.\u201d Millet and sorghum were the staples, but Ali Mohammed has been able to expand into cucumbers and okra, lemons and grapefruit, and is trying sunflowers for the first time, all of which are valuable cash crops. \u201cYou give me the seed, and I will test it,\u201d he says. Millions were forced to flee the violence in Darfur that killed as many as 400,000 people during a decade of conflict from 2003. Many people remain in huge camps today. \u201cBut if the fields are green like now, nothing could force me to go anywhere else,\u201d says Ali Mohammed. The weir project on the Wadi El Ku river has also brought women, who do much of the farming work, to the fore. \u201cBefore, I was not able to sit with these men, and to speak like this,\u201d says Azaz Mohammed, as the dam committee from 22 villages meets, sitting on carpets in the shade of a tree and sharing a meal harvested from the surrounding fields. The weirs are a \u201cpioneer project\u201d, says Enaam Ismail Abdalla, director general at the ministry of production in North Darfur, adding that the timing of the rains has completely changed due to climate change. The weirs are enabling people to return to their villages and adapt to the changing climate, which would otherwise drive them away once again, she says. She hopes they will be replicated in other parts of Darfur, Sudan and beyond. The collaborative climate-proofing provided by the Wadi El Ku project shows a way to tackle the complex mix of climate impacts, conflict and migration that are thought to be rising around the world. The Darfur conflict was labelled \u201cthe first climate change war\u201d by some observers, with the then-UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon saying in 2007: \u201cAmid the diverse social and political causes, it began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.\u201d Research has shown that climate impacts such as drought and increasing temperatures increase the risk of armed struggles, particularly in regions where populations are already divided. Bitter divisions are starting to dissolve 50 miles (80km) north of El Fasher along the Wadi El Ku, where the next phase of the project is taking place. Until very recently, project staff needed a convoy of dozens of heavily armed soldiers to visit. \u201cNow we can go on our own: that is a real sign of improvement,\u201d says Atila Uras, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Sudan, which oversees the \u20ac16m EU-funded project, which is aiming to help 180,000 people.

      "body": "<p>Three generations of one Windrush-descended family are struggling to prove that they are British in a protracted fight for documentation which has left a London-born woman facing homelessness with her two-year-old son.</p> <p>Courtney Lawrence, 25, was denied emergency housing in May because officials said she needed to show a passport to prove she was eligible for council support, despite the fact that she was born in the UK and has never left the country. As a result of this refusal she was forced to sofa-surf with her son for five months; she has subsequently been given emergency accommodation in a Travelodge hotel.</p> <p>Both her parents arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as small children more than half a century ago, and have never formally naturalised as British citizens. They did not realise that their immigration status was uncertain until their daughter told them she was having difficulty getting council support. The citizenship of Courtney\u2019s son, Kasion, also born in London, is now also in question.</p> <p>The family\u2019s difficulties reveal the complex problems still being experienced by many Windrush descendants 18 months after the government apologised and promised to \u201cdo right\u201d by those affected by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\">Home Office scandal</a>.</p> <p>Courtney\u2019s father, Joseph Lawrence, a retired construction worker, arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1957 when he was three, and has lived in England for the past 63 years.</p> <p>Her mother, Gillian St Rose, a former special-needs teaching assistant, came in 1969 aged five from Saint Lucia, and has not left Britain in the past 50 years. Since both Jamaica and St Lucia were British colonies when they left, they travelled as British subjects on Citizens of the UK and Colonies passports. Courtney was born in London in 1994.</p> <p>Until April, she and her parents had not realised that there was any problem with their immigration status. They had all watched the news about the Windrush scandal in April 2018, but did not think that they might be affected by the government\u2019s mistreatment of thousands of Commonwealth-born citizens who were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants, despite being legally resident in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI was very aware of it but I didn\u2019t think for a second that it would affect me,\u201d Courtney said. She was shocked when officials in the Newham council housing department questioned whether she was British. She showed her birth certificate and her National Insurance number to officials (which was what she had always shown prospective employers) but was told that this was not enough to prove that she was British and that she would need to bring her mother\u2019s and father\u2019s passports in order to prove her eligibility; neither parent has a British passport.</p> <p>\u201cThey said the Home Office has said that you\u2019re not British. They said they wouldn\u2019t help me until I could prove I was British. It upset me. I was born here, I haven\u2019t left the country, I\u2019ve done good jobs here and this has never arisen,\u201d Courtney, who has worked as a teaching assistant in nurseries and as a sales assistant, said. \u201cThis has made me depressed; I feel like I don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Courtney should be recognised as a British citizen, since she was born in the UK to British citizens, but because neither parent is currently able to prove their status as British citizens, she has struggled to persuade officials to believe her. Since changes to nationality legislation in 1983, just being born in the UK is not enough to make someone British; one or both parents must be British or have settled status in the UK. There are believed to be tens of thousands of children who were born here who were not automatically British at birth; many of them do not realise they have any immigration issues until adulthood, when they have difficulties accessing student loans or housing support.</p> <p>As a result of the council\u2019s decision to refuse her emergency housing, she had nowhere to stay. \u201cI made it clear to them I was homeless,\u201d she said. The council offered to refer her case to child services, but she was worried that this could result in her child being removed. \u201cIt sounded like they were offering services for my child and not for me.\u201d Even when she presented officials with a letter explaining that she was affected by the Windrush scandal, staff still refused to believe that she was eligible for support.</p> <p>Her parents were equally unaware that their immigration status was vulnerable. Since they realised that they have to regularise their status, they have both felt very anxious about whether they will find themselves targeted by immigration enforcement officers. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for someone to ring and say, \u2018right, now you\u2019re evicted\u2019. I\u2019ve become paranoid and been waiting to be deported,\u201d Gillian St Rose said. \u201cI\u2019ve cried tears for her. I feel bad because it is my fault I didn\u2019t get a passport \u2013 which I didn\u2019t think I needed.\u201d</p> <p>The council changed its position in October and gave Courtney and her son an emergency room in a Travelodge hotel. She is delighted to have a room, although points out that being housed in a hotel means it is only possible to cook things which can be heated up with boiling water from a kettle (packet soup, noodles), and that the space is not appropriate for a two-year-old. She is more concerned about the passport problems facing her son, if her own immigration difficulties are not resolved.</p> <p>Bethan Lant, advice manager at the charity Praxis which has been helping the family, described the risks facing the son as \u201cserious\u201d. \u201cIf he applies for a passport now, the Passport agency would want evidence of his mother\u2019s status and there is currently no proof of that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She helped Courtney Lawrence and her parents submit applications to the Windrush taskforce, and is waiting for a response. This unit was set up by the Home Office in the wake of the scandal last year, when the government was forced to apologise for criminalising thousands of legal UK residents, some of whom were wrongfully deported, detained, sacked from their jobs, evicted from their homes and denied access to healthcare.</p> <p>Courtney has gathered extensive documentation from her childhood to try to prove to the Home Office that she has lived all her life in the UK. Her parents have collected photographs placing them in the UK in the 1960s; her mother has submitted a picture of herself in school uniform, details of her confirmation service, a primary school admission letter. Staff at Praxis are surprised at the length of time it is taking for the unit to respond to Courtney\u2019s application.</p> <p>Sally Daghlian, the Praxis CEO, said: \u201cThe policies that created the so-called Windrush scandal are extending across the generations and all those who do not have a British passport risk being denied essential services and left in limbo.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said staff would not routinely comment on individual cases. Newham councillor Charlene McLean said staff would be given more training to help them assess the eligibility of Windrush cases, as a result of the Lawrence family\u2019s experience. \u201cI am embarrassed this has happened and apologise to Ms Lawrence on behalf of the mayor of Newham and the council,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hugely proud of all our migrant communities and that is why an important motion was passed last year to ensure the Windrush generation and their relatives would be fully supported by the council with all policies and procedures reviewed to reflect this. I am sorry this did not happen in this case. Although officers followed the law with regards to this particular case, this is not in line with usual procedure and more action could have been taken to check this resident\u2019s UK citizenship.\u201d </p> <p>The council is now in the process of moving Courtney Lawrence into a flat.</p>",

Kattan tells me that the market, inaugurated in 1929, is a showcase of the best Palestinian food produce.</p> <p>Much of the produce is brought from nearby villages by sellers such as Um Nabil, who has worked in the market for almost four decades. She used to sell dairy products but today she brings vegetables, including boxes of fresh green chickpeas, beans and sacks of herbs. There is the chance to taste almost anything \u2013 from Um Nabil\u2019s chunky raw garlic to <em>makdous</em> (tangy aubergine in olive oil with walnuts and carrots) sold at Samer Daoudi\u2019s pickle and dairy shop, which was recently visited by Jamie Oliver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a97b053482335a07282563e5f4fb660c4441c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a97b053482335a07282563e5f4fb660c4441c19/0_53_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fadi Kattan, French Palestinian chef and hotel owner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a7c463a43633c2c772175209cbaa4ba167780b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c463a43633c2c772175209cbaa4ba167780b42/0_0_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"bright-pink pickled cauliflower\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"52c16d8603c09c185516e6c9f2d07e83c88d591b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c16d8603c09c185516e6c9f2d07e83c88d591b/0_424_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"A young boy serves olives at a stall at Bethlehem market.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c25b7c44a9cc6b061f1ce6f4d83a7f96fd4a0478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c25b7c44a9cc6b061f1ce6f4d83a7f96fd4a0478/193_665_1516_1895/800.jpg\" alt=\"Um Nabil, stall holder, Bethlehem\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"ceea4e9d0b705360a1205225b77e13a41f57b382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceea4e9d0b705360a1205225b77e13a41f57b382/0_178_2456_3070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Um Nabil, stall holder, Bethlehem, holds a handful of beans from her stock.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Chef and hotel owner Fadi Kattan and, below, scenes from Bethlehem market, with a smiling Um Nabil at her stall</p></li> </ul> <p>At midday, we sit down at our final stop: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AlyaffawiAfteem/\">Afteem</a>. The restaurant, off Manger Square, is run by a family who fled Jaffa during the period Palestinians mark as the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, when the state of Israel was created and when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced. On the wall hangs a picture of Saliba Salameh, the man who established Afteem in 1948. The restaurant has since become a local institution, and alongside Salameh\u2019s picture are photographs of dignitaries who have since visited to taste its famously light and crispy falafel. There used to be a picture of Tony Blair, says Alaa Salameh, the third generation to run the family restaurant. It had to be taken down because some British guests kept placing napkins over Blair\u2019s head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e29a5d3b684fd42c0f3023f03a6b10be1ff7de64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e29a5d3b684fd42c0f3023f03a6b10be1ff7de64/0_653_1709_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef at Afteem, Bethlehem making vegetable dish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"9f27bd29f51a2c4933d0b122a0e345f2447b8b6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f27bd29f51a2c4933d0b122a0e345f2447b8b6d/0_62_1709_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef at Afteem, Bethlehem making vegetable dish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa8535ba9e0e82906ccbae566e017ff4a9adc04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa8535ba9e0e82906ccbae566e017ff4a9adc04/0_985_1709_1025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Array of food and breads on a wooden table at Afteem, Manger Square, Bethlehem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Chef at Afteem preparing dishes, the restaurant has become known for its light and crispy falafel</p></li> </ul> <p>In Manger Square, tourists are waiting to take tours of the nativity church. Most come on a coach and leave after only a few hours, says Kattan. \u201cThey may have a cheap, quick meal. Or they\u2019re taken to a shop that is a Disneyland of everything that has a relation to God,\u201d he adds, referring to the religious souvenir shops. They miss out on much of the town \u2013 its market, museums and many restaurants \u2013 and rarely go anywhere else in Palestine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My hotel's restaurant sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf those people walk around the town and see how we live, it\u2019s a fantastic way to get our real story out,\u201d he says. \u201cOur story to me is anything beyond the perceptions there have been about Palestinians, whether they are the misery side, \u2018Oh, the poor Palestinians\u2019, or the fantasy of \u2018Oh, Palestine is dangerous\u2019,\u201d says Kattan.</p> <p>Palestinians are especially hospitable because they want outsiders to see their country, he says: \u201cWe have a beautiful country and people don\u2019t realise it.\u201d Kattan, who opened a hotel in the town four years ago, is on a mission to change this. Over the next four days he recommends a tour of Palestine\u2019s cultural sites, markets and diverse landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"02716b66efdf237e954f428a27a7f267f79ff635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02716b66efdf237e954f428a27a7f267f79ff635/0_301_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Hosh Al-Syrian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"7a1e5109cd9fe00c7600b0278c739871c4248d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1e5109cd9fe00c7600b0278c739871c4248d0e/0_531_2299_2873/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Hosh Al-Syrian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"6023b5997776b4f3c438fa6da60277c2b33ca52b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6023b5997776b4f3c438fa6da60277c2b33ca52b/0_355_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast chalkboard at Hotel Hosh Al-Syrian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"efda4ae703b23a64eba569e00716f8d78fcddbd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efda4ae703b23a64eba569e00716f8d78fcddbd5/0_424_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"View from terrace at Hotel Hosh Al-Syrian.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Hosh Al-Syrian hotel, its menu chalkboar and views from its rooftop</p></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m staying at his hotel, <a href=\"https://www.hoshalsyrian.com/\">Hosh Al-Syrian</a> (doubles from \u00a363 B&amp;B), in a renovated building in the old city, which dates back 1,000 years. Its 12 rooms have arched walls and deep-red carpets. Its adjoining restaurant, Fawda, sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine. It is not designed for pilgrims looking for a bargain room but for people with an interest in Palestinian food, geopolitics and culture.</p> <p>Hosh Al-Syrian is a contrast to Banksy\u2019s much-publicised <a href=\"http://walledoffhotel.com/\">Walled Off hotel</a>, which opened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/03/banksy-opens-bethlehem-barrier-wall-hotel\">nearby in 2017</a>. On my first afternoon in Palestine, I visit <a href=\"http://walledoffhotel.com/facilities.html\">its museum</a>. Interiors are an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation. Afternoon tea is served on the patio, in a gilded china teapot, while the grey concrete wall that divides Israel from the Palestinian territories looms opposite. It\u2019s a jarring experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"033da8329367568ccaaf0116d342fa4a19f78657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033da8329367568ccaaf0116d342fa4a19f78657/0_698_1709_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of Banksy's Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--halfWidth\"> <blockquote> <p>The Walled Off hotel is an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some argue that aspects of the hotel trivialise the occupation. There are, says Kattan, plenty of hotels and restaurants that offer a more authentic experience. Local businesses \u2013 which have far less financial clout \u2013 face the greatest challenges when operating in a volatile political context. Another day, we eat at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Abueli.restaurant/\">Abu Eli\u2019s restaurant</a>, <strong> </strong>where I\u2019m told the family\u2019s kebabs are so good that his father was once escorted by security to cook for Yasser Arafat (I\u2019m vegetarian, but enjoy a delicious range of salads). Kattan also recommends having a drink in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Rewinedmd/\">Rewined</a> bar, but unfortunately, it\u2019s closed when I\u2019m in town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58a82bf80ce88e5c512f6d80f113771a68d97b0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58a82bf80ce88e5c512f6d80f113771a68d97b0a/0_0_2560_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Eli\u2019s restaurant, Bethlehem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The kitchen at Abu Eli\u2019s restaurant</p></li> </ul> <p>I visit the Bethlehem Historical Museum, established by the town\u2019s <a href=\"https://bethawu.org/\">Arab Women\u2019s Union</a>, which Kattan\u2019s late grandmother, Julia, helped to found. The association, created in 1947 (during the Arab-Israeli war to provide employment for women and deliver aid to refugees) became a cultural beacon in the city, Kattan tells me. \u201cThey opened the first mixed-sex pool in Palestine, the first public library in Palestine,\u201d he says. Many of its projects closed but the museum and food production projects survived. Lots of its exhibits have been donated by local families and show how life in the town has changed: from the designs of homes to traditional clothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"437c6a5f20fd01a6d722f45ae1eb3b6a8bb713a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/437c6a5f20fd01a6d722f45ae1eb3b6a8bb713a1/0_173_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Room at the Bethlehem Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Room at Bethlehem Historical Museum</p></li> </ul> <p>Palestine\u2019s key museums are in Ramallah, an hour\u2019s journey by bus from Bethlehem. The most extensive, the <a href=\"https://yam.ps/en\">Yasser Arafat museum</a> (in the complex where Arafat spent his last years under Israeli siege) covers almost 100 years of modern history. Downstairs is Arafat\u2019s old office and bedroom: a basic wooden bed and blanket, uniform jackets hanging in the wardrobe below piles of keffiyeh headscarves. The <a href=\"https://www.palmuseum.org/language/english\">Palestinian Museum</a> is also nearby, as is the highly recommended <a href=\"http://mahmouddarwish.ps/article/1395/%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%81-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B4--%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A9-\">Mahmoud Darwish museum</a>, dedicated to the poet who became a voice of the Palestinian resistance.</p> <p>To get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, tourists must show a passport and visa at a checkpoint, but they don\u2019t face the same travel restrictions as Palestinians living in the West Bank. They have to apply for a permit to enter East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.</p> <p>Heading for Jerusalem, I walk through checkpoint 300 before taking a taxi. In the late morning, there\u2019s only a short queue of families waiting to get through the turnstiles. In the early hours it\u2019s a different story: thousands of Palestinians start queuing as early as 3am to get through in time to start their jobs in Jerusalem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"2e0387d0d318d794d4c9ec8f43cfb894d15327de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e0387d0d318d794d4c9ec8f43cfb894d15327de/322_533_1386_1732/800.jpg\" alt=\"Armenian Quarter, Old City, Jerusalem.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1de12c3fea5eb05505084025221c9ab253a4e9dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1de12c3fea5eb05505084025221c9ab253a4e9dd/0_245_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"Armenian Quarter, Old City, Jerusalem.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Armenian Quarter, Jerusalem\u2019s Old City</p></li> </ul> <p>Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is heaving with crowds as I walk towards the Armenian quarter with Christine Najarian, who co-founded Farayek with Baboun. To see the holy sites and the old city, you need at least three days, says Kattan. He also recommends <a href=\"https://www.educationalbookshop.com/about_us.html\">The Educational Bookshop</a>, which has a wide collection of books on, and by, Palestinians, and suggests going for a coffee at the nearby <a href=\"https://www.americancolony.com/\">American Colony hotel</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit [like] the hangout of all the diplomats, journalists, spies and others,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery city has these emblematic places, where everybody who has impacted the history of the place has stayed.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the West Bank, we travel to Sebastia in the north of the territory to view the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. It is believed that the remains of John the Baptist (except for his head, which was apparently taken to Damascus) are buried here in a tomb in the cental courtyard of a mosque whose outside used to be a Crusader church. The site shows the layering of history that has shaped Palestine, says Kattan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6ff7f03c4cce72e89c5c9c2414793353334a1eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff7f03c4cce72e89c5c9c2414793353334a1eb1/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastia, West Bank, Palestine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8d62f29cfc9f79987bb44c093d12270402dc68a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d62f29cfc9f79987bb44c093d12270402dc68a9/0_424_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"Derelict-looking house, Sebastia, West Bank, Palestine.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"ce46acfe382ea16d154d38a7d4a3a7c46991e29c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce46acfe382ea16d154d38a7d4a3a7c46991e29c/0_258_1709_2136/800.jpg\" alt=\"Remains of Roman amphitheatre, Sebastia, West Bank, Palestine.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"65d08e2a54e9fc0af9b9b69ed75042ffa9e3f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65d08e2a54e9fc0af9b9b69ed75042ffa9e3f4a6/0_0_2456_3070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sign at the entrance to the Jerusalem Pottery\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d04a7e4522a84596bf32e783b4dacf38327405dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d04a7e4522a84596bf32e783b4dacf38327405dc/0_303_2456_3070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jerusalem Pottery plates on the wall at Hosh Al-Syrian.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Sebastia, a street scene and the remains of its Roman amphitheatre.

In the early morning, the sound of church bells mingles with the call to prayer. There are several myths about the territory, Kattan adds, including the belief that it is home to just one religion. \u201cIt\u2019s varied. Even within each of the individual religions you have so many small communities where the traditions are different,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where you learn more about brotherhood between religions \u2026 historically all faiths have lived together here.\u201d</p> <p>On the walls of the dining area hang colourful patterned plates made by the famous <a href=\"https://www.jerusalempottery.biz/\">Jerusalem Pottery</a>, a business run by an Armenian family, part of the diverse range of communities in East Jerusalem.</p> <p>For Kattan, and many others in Bethlehem, tourism is a way to protect and promote Palestine\u2019s heritage \u2013 its food and historic buildings. \u201cI think a lot of regular Palestinians feel [tourism] is the only way we can get our story out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by Hosh Al-Syrian, <a href=\"https://www.amostrust.org/\">Amos Trust</a> (a small, creative human rights organisation</em><em>) and <a href=\"https://www.zaytoun.org/\">Zaytoun</a>, </em><em>a social enterprise and community interest company</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Smells of spices and coffee waft from shop doorways in Bethlehem\u2019s market. Outside limestone buildings, sellers perch under parasols with stacks of sweet ma\u2019moul biscuits and buckets of bright-pink pickled cauliflower, orange loquat fruits and green sour cherries. I\u2019m being shown around by Fadi Kattan, a French Palestinian chef and hotel owner, and Nadine Baboun, co-founder of Farayek, which runs food tours of Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. Kattan tells me that the market, inaugurated in 1929, is a showcase of the best Palestinian food produce. Much of the produce is brought from nearby villages by sellers such as Um Nabil, who has worked in the market for almost four decades. She used to sell dairy products but today she brings vegetables, including boxes of fresh green chickpeas, beans and sacks of herbs. There is the chance to taste almost anything \u2013 from Um Nabil\u2019s chunky raw garlic to makdous (tangy aubergine in olive oil with walnuts and carrots) sold at Samer Daoudi\u2019s pickle and dairy shop, which was recently visited by Jamie Oliver. Top: Chef and hotel owner Fadi Kattan and, below, scenes from Bethlehem market, with a smiling Um Nabil at her stall At midday, we sit down at our final stop: Afteem. The restaurant, off Manger Square, is run by a family who fled Jaffa during the period Palestinians mark as the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, when the state of Israel was created and when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced. On the wall hangs a picture of Saliba Salameh, the man who established Afteem in 1948. The restaurant has since become a local institution, and alongside Salameh\u2019s picture are photographs of dignitaries who have since visited to taste its famously light and crispy falafel. There used to be a picture of Tony Blair, says Alaa Salameh, the third generation to run the family restaurant. It had to be taken down because some British guests kept placing napkins over Blair\u2019s head. Chef at Afteem preparing dishes, the restaurant has become known for its light and crispy falafel In Manger Square, tourists are waiting to take tours of the nativity church. Most come on a coach and leave after only a few hours, says Kattan. \u201cThey may have a cheap, quick meal. Or they\u2019re taken to a shop that is a Disneyland of everything that has a relation to God,\u201d he adds, referring to the religious souvenir shops. They miss out on much of the town \u2013 its market, museums and many restaurants \u2013 and rarely go anywhere else in Palestine. \u201cIf those people walk around the town and see how we live, it\u2019s a fantastic way to get our real story out,\u201d he says. \u201cOur story to me is anything beyond the perceptions there have been about Palestinians, whether they are the misery side, \u2018Oh, the poor Palestinians\u2019, or the fantasy of \u2018Oh, Palestine is dangerous\u2019,\u201d says Kattan. Palestinians are especially hospitable because they want outsiders to see their country, he says: \u201cWe have a beautiful country and people don\u2019t realise it.\u201d Kattan, who opened a hotel in the town four years ago, is on a mission to change this. Over the next four days he recommends a tour of Palestine\u2019s cultural sites, markets and diverse landscape. Hosh Al-Syrian hotel, its menu chalkboar and views from its rooftop I\u2019m staying at his hotel, Hosh Al-Syrian (doubles from \u00a363 B&amp;B), in a renovated building in the old city, which dates back 1,000 years. Its 12 rooms have arched walls and deep-red carpets. Its adjoining restaurant, Fawda, sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine. It is not designed for pilgrims looking for a bargain room but for people with an interest in Palestinian food, geopolitics and culture. Hosh Al-Syrian is a contrast to Banksy\u2019s much-publicised Walled Off hotel, which opened nearby in 2017. On my first afternoon in Palestine, I visit its museum. Interiors are an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation. Afternoon tea is served on the patio, in a gilded china teapot, while the grey concrete wall that divides Israel from the Palestinian territories looms opposite. It\u2019s a jarring experience. Some argue that aspects of the hotel trivialise the occupation. There are, says Kattan, plenty of hotels and restaurants that offer a more authentic experience. Local businesses \u2013 which have far less financial clout \u2013 face the greatest challenges when operating in a volatile political context. Another day, we eat at Abu Eli\u2019s restaurant, where I\u2019m told the family\u2019s kebabs are so good that his father was once escorted by security to cook for Yasser Arafat (I\u2019m vegetarian, but enjoy a delicious range of salads). Kattan also recommends having a drink in the Rewined bar, but unfortunately, it\u2019s closed when I\u2019m in town. The kitchen at Abu Eli\u2019s restaurant I visit the Bethlehem Historical Museum, established by the town\u2019s Arab Women\u2019s Union, which Kattan\u2019s late grandmother, Julia, helped to found. The association, created in 1947 (during the Arab-Israeli war to provide employment for women and deliver aid to refugees) became a cultural beacon in the city, Kattan tells me. \u201cThey opened the first mixed-sex pool in Palestine, the first public library in Palestine,\u201d he says. Many of its projects closed but the museum and food production projects survived. Lots of its exhibits have been donated by local families and show how life in the town has changed: from the designs of homes to traditional clothing. Room at Bethlehem Historical Museum Palestine\u2019s key museums are in Ramallah, an hour\u2019s journey by bus from Bethlehem. The most extensive, the Yasser Arafat museum (in the complex where Arafat spent his last years under Israeli siege) covers almost 100 years of modern history. Downstairs is Arafat\u2019s old office and bedroom: a basic wooden bed and blanket, uniform jackets hanging in the wardrobe below piles of keffiyeh headscarves. The Palestinian Museum is also nearby, as is the highly recommended Mahmoud Darwish museum, dedicated to the poet who became a voice of the Palestinian resistance. To get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, tourists must show a passport and visa at a checkpoint, but they don\u2019t face the same travel restrictions as Palestinians living in the West Bank. They have to apply for a permit to enter East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967. Heading for Jerusalem, I walk through checkpoint 300 before taking a taxi. In the late morning, there\u2019s only a short queue of families waiting to get through the turnstiles. In the early hours it\u2019s a different story: thousands of Palestinians start queuing as early as 3am to get through in time to start their jobs in Jerusalem. Armenian Quarter, Jerusalem\u2019s Old City Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is heaving with crowds as I walk towards the Armenian quarter with Christine Najarian, who co-founded Farayek with Baboun. To see the holy sites and the old city, you need at least three days, says Kattan. He also recommends The Educational Bookshop, which has a wide collection of books on, and by, Palestinians, and suggests going for a coffee at the nearby American Colony hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit [like] the hangout of all the diplomats, journalists, spies and others,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery city has these emblematic places, where everybody who has impacted the history of the place has stayed.\u201d Back in the West Bank, we travel to Sebastia in the north of the territory to view the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. It is believed that the remains of John the Baptist (except for his head, which was apparently taken to Damascus) are buried here in a tomb in the cental courtyard of a mosque whose outside used to be a Crusader church. The site shows the layering of history that has shaped Palestine, says Kattan. Sebastia, a street scene and the remains of its Roman amphitheatre. A sign outside Jerusalem Pottery and its plates on the wall at Hosh Al-Syrian From the rooftop of Hosh Al-Syrian there\u2019s a view across all Bethlehem\u2019s churches and mosques. In the early morning, the sound of church bells mingles with the call to prayer. There are several myths about the territory, Kattan adds, including the belief that it is home to just one religion. \u201cIt\u2019s varied. Even within each of the individual religions you have so many small communities where the traditions are different,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where you learn more about brotherhood between religions \u2026 historically all faiths have lived together here.\u201d On the walls of the dining area hang colourful patterned plates made by the famous Jerusalem Pottery, a business run by an Armenian family, part of the diverse range of communities in East Jerusalem. For Kattan, and many others in Bethlehem, tourism is a way to protect and promote Palestine\u2019s heritage \u2013 its food and historic buildings. \u201cI think a lot of regular Palestinians feel [tourism] is the only way we can get our story out,\u201d he says. \u2022 The trip was provided by Hosh Al-Syrian, Amos Trust (a small, creative human rights organisation) and Zaytoun, a social enterprise and community interest company Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Significant reforms are needed to stop people with learning disabilities being unnecessarily detained because of flaws in Scotland\u2019s mental health legislation, according to an independent review. The review said Scotland\u2019s mental health act 2003 breached the human rights of people with learning disabilities and autism because it treated their disabilities as mental disorders. Andrew Rome, who chaired the review, said there were cases of offenders with learning disabilities or autism being held as patients in secure accommodation for far longer than non-disabled offenders who committed identical offences. They could be locked up without a formal diagnosis of mental illness. The most severe delays included 15 people whose discharge was delayed for more than 10 years, and another six people held for more than five years longer than necessary because the right support was not available in the community. The review recommended that the Scottish parliament introduces new legislation to protect the rights of people with autism or learning difficulties, and establish a new commissioner to safeguard their rights. After the new legislation came into force, those conditions had to be removed from the legal definition of mental disorder in the 2003 act, the report said. Rome said the current law breached the UK\u2019s legal undertakings under the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, ratified by the UK in 2009, as well as linked duties under European human rights legislation. The convention gives people the right to family life and to independent living, yet they were often held in facilities which were cramped, noisy, badly maintained or dirty, or have rules and environments which traumatised people with autism. Previous studies cited by the review found 453 people with learning disabilities were placed in facilities far from home, including about 55 with autism, while almost a third of inpatients with learning disabilities experienced long waits to be discharged. The review, set up by the Scottish government two years ago, said other public services failed to uphold the convention\u2019s codes, which meant new duties were needed to ensure local councils and public bodies fully met the needs and views of people with autism or learning disabilities.

One of the best evenings in the theatre for many years. Acting, directing, writing and set design all outstanding. <strong>Barrie</strong></p> <h2>The Butterfly Lion</h2> <p><strong>Minerva, Chichester</strong><br><br>Not a dry eye in the packed house. New adaptation of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novel added a Proust-like dive into real or half-real memories. Action-packed, happy/sad, full of pathos, with superb puppetry, and amazing lighting and sound, we were whisked from boarding school in England to the African veldt and back to school via a first world war battlefield. Fabulous performances across the whole cast, including the lion. <strong>Andrew Finnegan</strong></p> <h2>Pavilion</h2> <p><strong>Theatr Clwyd, Mold</strong></p> <p>I was so impressed by the staging, writing and performances that I ( and several of my friends) saw it twice! The play examined the struggles of a small Welsh town to deal with deprivation and decline and a desperate need to find a renewed identity for the 21st century. It centred around the last night of the local club which was closing its doors and joining all the other victims of austerity and globalisation.</p> <p>A variety of well defined characters arrive to drink, reminisce, commiserate, dance, fight, sing and eat chips from the mobile chip van, served by the effervescent Myfanwy. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride that had you belly laughing one minute and weeping the next; emotionally drained by the beautiful singing and then uplifted by the messages of hope; shamed by the injustice and proud of the people, their resilience and their past.</p> <p>This is a play that deserves to be seen by a wider audience as it spoke for not just the small Welsh towns but all the forgotten towns and villages that have been left behind and that are desperate to be heard. <strong>Paul</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/26/present-laughter-review-old-vic-london-andrew-scott\">Present Laughter</a></h2> <p><strong>Old Vic, London</strong></p> <p>I was only able to see the NT Encore film screening at my local theatre, living out in the sticks, but it was utterly spellbinding, with Andrew Scott dominating proceedings.

Having seen the 2003 original I was curious to see how it would translate for our \u2018woke\u2019 culture \u2013 very well as it turned out. It still felt relevant and it still had a message. What I thought this version did so well was to give it a real heart. I found myself comparing its central themes with those of Come from Away ... That humans can do terrible things but that love always beats hate.</p> <p>It was clearly an ensemble piece where nobody was \u2018the star\u2019 and each cast member was given their moment to shine. From the central performance of Jerry by Michael Howe through to the two very funny ensemble girls, who appeared to be channelling The Shining Twins, all were equal and all were excellent.

Two fantastic actresses conjure up a tiny Scottish island, fighting to stay inhabited, and the eerie world of whales and wonder. Using just a loop pedal, a flight case, two mics and a sound desk, the audience was transported. Relevant politically, and culturally, this fable is beautifully written and deserves a bigger audience. <strong>Rowan Whiteside</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/08/its-true-its-true-its-true-review-rape-drama-feminist-rage-edinburgh-fringe-underbelly-cowgate\">It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True</a></h2> <p><strong>The North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford</strong></p> <p>A fiercely evocative verbatim performance of 17th-century court transcripts telling of the rape trial of Agostino Tassi accused by Artemisia Gentileschi.

      "bodyText": "Tay Bridge Dundee Rep, Dundee A superbly directed play with a brilliant ensemble cast. One of the best evenings in the theatre for many years. Acting, directing, writing and set design all outstanding. Barrie The Butterfly Lion Minerva, Chichester Not a dry eye in the packed house. New adaptation of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novel added a Proust-like dive into real or half-real memories. Action-packed, happy/sad, full of pathos, with superb puppetry, and amazing lighting and sound, we were whisked from boarding school in England to the African veldt and back to school via a first world war battlefield. Fabulous performances across the whole cast, including the lion. Andrew Finnegan Pavilion Theatr Clwyd, Mold I was so impressed by the staging, writing and performances that I ( and several of my friends) saw it twice! The play examined the struggles of a small Welsh town to deal with deprivation and decline and a desperate need to find a renewed identity for the 21st century. It centred around the last night of the local club which was closing its doors and joining all the other victims of austerity and globalisation. A variety of well defined characters arrive to drink, reminisce, commiserate, dance, fight, sing and eat chips from the mobile chip van, served by the effervescent Myfanwy. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride that had you belly laughing one minute and weeping the next; emotionally drained by the beautiful singing and then uplifted by the messages of hope; shamed by the injustice and proud of the people, their resilience and their past. This is a play that deserves to be seen by a wider audience as it spoke for not just the small Welsh towns but all the forgotten towns and villages that have been left behind and that are desperate to be heard. Paul Present Laughter Old Vic, London I was only able to see the NT Encore film screening at my local theatre, living out in the sticks, but it was utterly spellbinding, with Andrew Scott dominating proceedings. It made me want to see as much live theatre as I can in the time I have left on Earth. Fun and moving experience; emotions turning on a sixpence. Steve Morgan My Beautiful Laundrette Belgrade, Coventry Original stage version of a classic film. Brilliant from the beginning, entering the auditorium stage already lit with the Laundrette soundtrack, and actors appeared on stage one at a time before the house lights go out. The cast play two parts throughout \u2013 fun, frightening and touchy. Still brilliant. Simon Doughty Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Sadler\u2019s Wells, London Amazing dancers and the whole thing had such life, joy and a wonderful spirit that really seeped into me. In fact months later I keep thinking about it and passages of the show return to my mind, a sign of an awesome creation. Hamish Macdougall Life of Pi Sheffield Crucible The most amazing theatre I have seen in decades. The staging, the script, the \u2013 everything. The whole audience stood instantly in response to the end. It had to be seen to be believed. I count myself fortunate to have been there. I understand it is moving to the West End \u2026 go! Pat Walker Jerry Springer the Opera Hope Mill, Manchester A bold, fresh take on a controversial piece. Having seen the 2003 original I was curious to see how it would translate for our \u2018woke\u2019 culture \u2013 very well as it turned out. It still felt relevant and it still had a message. What I thought this version did so well was to give it a real heart. I found myself comparing its central themes with those of Come from Away ... That humans can do terrible things but that love always beats hate. It was clearly an ensemble piece where nobody was \u2018the star\u2019 and each cast member was given their moment to shine. From the central performance of Jerry by Michael Howe through to the two very funny ensemble girls, who appeared to be channelling The Shining Twins, all were equal and all were excellent. This production proved that high quality theatre CAN and DOES happen outside of London. Jacqueline Islander Southwark Playhouse, London A truly enchanting theatre piece, which did so much with so little.

A lot of ink has been spilt trying to work out how she did it. Barely older than her fans, Eilish is both an aspirational figure \u2013 18 today, she appears to be completely in control of her own destiny, eschewing standard music industry pop procedures in favour of writing and producing her own material at home with her elder brother \u2013 and, to use a current buzzword, relatable.</p> <p>She seems to speak to her audience unmediated. If she is carefully styled, she doesn\u2019t look it: her image most closely resembles what would happen if you let a teenager loose in a succession of skatewear shops and designer boutiques with an unlimited budget. In almost every photograph, she fixes the camera with a heavy-lidded glare, her eyes saucers of contempt. She looks remarkably as though she\u2019s about to start an interminable argument about hanging up her towel in the bathroom after she\u2019s used it or whether or not she needs to be home by 11 at the latest.</p> <p>Her lyrics offer up an index of very teenage preoccupations and fears \u2013 rivalry, rejection, drugs, sexuality, escaping your home town \u2013 whipped up into gothic melodrama. Amid the imagery of blood and death and cannibalism, When We All Fall Asleep features Eilish singing along to hook lines in a mocking tone, punctuating songs with an eye-rolling \u201cduh!\u201d, and slurping saliva out of the braces on her teeth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-the-pop-icon-who-defines-21st-century-teenage-angst\">Billie Eilish: the pop icon who defines 21st-century teenage angst</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The kind of audience Eilish attracts traditionally ends up being sold short \u2013 pop aimed at tweens and young teens frequently comes permeated by the tang of \u201cwill this do?\u201d, giving the sense that the actual music has come very much bottom of the list of priorities.

      "bodyText": "Over the last two years, Billie Eilish has attained a startling dominion over teen and tweenage pop fans: on release, her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? went to No 1 in 21 countries. A lot of ink has been spilt trying to work out how she did it. Barely older than her fans, Eilish is both an aspirational figure \u2013 18 today, she appears to be completely in control of her own destiny, eschewing standard music industry pop procedures in favour of writing and producing her own material at home with her elder brother \u2013 and, to use a current buzzword, relatable. She seems to speak to her audience unmediated. If she is carefully styled, she doesn\u2019t look it: her image most closely resembles what would happen if you let a teenager loose in a succession of skatewear shops and designer boutiques with an unlimited budget. In almost every photograph, she fixes the camera with a heavy-lidded glare, her eyes saucers of contempt. She looks remarkably as though she\u2019s about to start an interminable argument about hanging up her towel in the bathroom after she\u2019s used it or whether or not she needs to be home by 11 at the latest. Her lyrics offer up an index of very teenage preoccupations and fears \u2013 rivalry, rejection, drugs, sexuality, escaping your home town \u2013 whipped up into gothic melodrama. Amid the imagery of blood and death and cannibalism, When We All Fall Asleep features Eilish singing along to hook lines in a mocking tone, punctuating songs with an eye-rolling \u201cduh!\u201d, and slurping saliva out of the braces on her teeth. The kind of audience Eilish attracts traditionally ends up being sold short \u2013 pop aimed at tweens and young teens frequently comes permeated by the tang of \u201cwill this do?\u201d, giving the sense that the actual music has come very much bottom of the list of priorities. This only makes When We All Fall Asleep all the more striking. It\u2019s adventurous, beautifully crafted, devoid of filler, packed not just with hooks but finely wrought sonic details (it feels as if it was designed to be listened to on headphones rather than laptop or smartphone speakers) and flashes of lyrical wit. \u201cTo give your lack of interest an explanation,\u201d she sings on Wish You Were Gay, \u201cjust say I\u2019m not your preferred sexual orientation.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to say that it sounds like music made by someone who\u2019s grown up on playlists rather than albums \u2013 eclectic compilations where dubstep coexists alongside showtunes, trap rubs shoulders with pop-punk and traditional acoustic singer-songwriters with early 2000s R&amp;B. But it works as an album, rather than a collection of songs. Streaming figures that showed fans were listening to the whole thing \u2013 as opposed to, say, Drake\u2019s Scorpion, which generated 60% of its revenue off three tracks \u2013 tell you something about the level of devotion Eilish inspires. But they tell you more about how good When We All Fall Asleep is. The singles that heralded its arrival were spectacular: the crawling menace of You Should See Me in a Crown; Bury a Friend\u2019s warped, unsettling glam stomp; Bad Guy\u2019s cocktail of sharp lyrics and 60s spy thriller theme pastiche.

In truth, though, Wright had been battling to control his anger long before he stepped on to a football pitch.</p> <p>Born in Woolwich, south London, Wright grew up on the Honor Oak estate in Brockley.

Although he loved Maurice, he never bonded with his other siblings. His stepfather \u2013 who he has described as a weed-smoking, gambling womaniser \u2013 was cruel and neglectful to Wright (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/ian-wright-earning-my-smile\" title=\"\">He was rough with my mum and rough with all of us kids,</a>\u201d he told the Players\u2019 Tribune), while his mother rarely showed him support or affection. Yet there was one adult who did take an interest in Wright\u2019s early development: his teacher, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2018/03/09/sydney-pigden-inspirational-teacher-obituary/\" title=\"\">Sydney Pigden</a>. For a time, he was the only positive male role model in Wright\u2019s life and would tell Wright to overcome the \u201cred mist\u201d by counting to 10 (\u201cIt always made me smile because, when I was young, it never worked\u201d).</p> <p>He felt rejected, he says, by his family, but also by football clubs: Wright\u2019s footballing career is notorious for its late start. \u201cIt was something I had to deal with from a very, very young age,\u201d he says. \u201cRejected by a mum, stepfather, older brother, little sister \u2026 then you come out of the house and everybody talks about how good you are at football, but you get rejected by everybody you go for trial for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a9a83b8e17f91c8e76aebcbd10633a51fdcc068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a9a83b8e17f91c8e76aebcbd10633a51fdcc068/0_215_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing for Arsenal in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing for Arsenal in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until 1985 that Crystal Palace took a punt on Wright, then a 21-year-old striker playing for the Sunday league club Ten-em-Bee.

Sometimes I believe, sometimes I don\u2019t. I just ask him: \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Off the pitch for some of his years at Arsenal, things were less harmonious; his swift fame and commercial success (including the lucrative sponsorship from Nike) took its toll. \u201cI got caught up with people who didn\u2019t have my best interests at heart,\u201d says Wright. \u201cI got caught up with women who were using me. I got caught up with believing the hype, just because I was playing great football. You kind of get into this hedonistic mindset where you think everything\u2019s just amazing, you could do anything you want, like you\u2019re breathing different air.\u201d</p> <p>In his 2016 book, <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/ian-wright-2/a-life-in-football-my-autobiography/9781472123572/\" title=\"\">A Life in Football: My Autobiography,</a> Wright says of these years that he came to hate himself. Yet, he says, he cannot regret these experiences \u201cbecause it shapes you\u201d and he understands why he behaved the way he did. \u201cWhen you grew up in a situation where the love wasn\u2019t forthcoming, then all of a sudden, you get into a situation where you are successful and everybody loves you, you can get a little bit high on that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is why counselling is so good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re able to go back and let people know what you were going through, and you can only try to apologise and make people understand that you were just losing it.\u201d The counselling also encouraged him to try to reconcile with his mother.</p> <p>\u201cAs time went by we spoke,\u201d he says, slowly wringing his hands: \u201cShe said she had her own problems as well. Whatever her problems were I always wanted to find out, but she was never forthcoming. She didn\u2019t want to speak about those things. I\u2019m not going to put a spotlight on her. I learned to deal with it myself because at the end of the day, you can only heal yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Wright has eight children \u2013 with ages ranging from nine to 38 \u2013 with four women. He has said he \u201cfell into\u201d fatherhood during his turbulent young adulthood, although Wright adopted his eldest child, the former professional footballer Shaun Wright-Phillips, when he was just 19 and Wright-Phillips was a baby. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have such a disturbing time with my stepfather, I probably wouldn\u2019t have adopted Shaun to try to give him as much love as I could. I didn\u2019t want any of my kids to not be loved, like how I felt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b519b3ce359b21fb579f3a82dfd0cbc11984a6ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b519b3ce359b21fb579f3a82dfd0cbc11984a6ac/0_26_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As a pundit on ITV \u2026 \u2018You want to see footballers have more of an opinion.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a pundit on ITV \u2026 \u2018You want to see footballers have more of an opinion.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wright stopped playing football in 2000 (he moved from Arsenal to West Ham in 1998, with stints at Nottingham Forest, Celtic and Burnley afterwards), launching his own ITV chatshow, Friday Night\u2019s All Wright, shortly before his retirement. The series saw him interview stars from Elton John to Mariah Carey, but today he says he wishes he had taken a different path.</p> <p>\u201cI regret not doing [coaching] badges, and being too weak to say no. I didn\u2019t need money.\u201d</p> <p>He was advised, he says, that \u201cmanagement is really tough. \u2018Why do you want to do that? Television\u2019s waiting.\u2019 And I listened. That\u2019s the only thing I regret.\u201d</p> <p>He has gone on to have a successful career in TV and radio, and is still a popular pundit on football shows including Match of the Day. But at first, he says, the reception was not what he had hoped for. \u201cYou should have seen some of the stuff they used to say: \u2018He can\u2019t finish a sentence. What\u2019s he doing on there?\u2019\u201d says Wright. At the time, there were few black chatshow hosts on British TV and I ask whether he felt the strength of the criticism was because of his race.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say just race,\u201d says Wright, \u201cbut we know that in black culture when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re told that you have to try twice as hard because you can\u2019t give the establishment the opportunity to say: \u2018Well, if you\u2019d worked this hard, you would have been able to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We meet as racism in football is, once more, dominating the headlines, after a fan was accused of making monkey noises at the Manchester United player Fred during the recent Manchester derby. Wright is clear that racism at football matches needs to be dealt with more vigorously. \u201cEverybody talks about education and we do need to educate young people, but when you look at the people who are racially abusing players now, they\u2019re older people, so education is wasted on those people. Those people need to be punished severely so it can be a deterrent, so people will see that when you racially abuse someone in this ground you are out for life.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the incident, Gary Neville suggested Boris Johnson had fuelled racism with his rhetoric. Although Wright doesn\u2019t disagree, he\u2019s not sure how helpful this is. \u201cBoris Johnson may be involved in some way, just because it\u2019s intrinsically linked with the things he says and what he does. But you can\u2019t really point at one person.\u201d</p> <p>As Neville\u2019s comments highlight, football players past and present have become less afraid of making political statements in recent years. The week before the general election the Arsenal vice-captain H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn posted a tweet encouraging young people to vote. Then signed off with \u201c#FuckBoris\u201d. Many of the replies called on Beller\u00edn to leave politics out of the game.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t take people who just sit there pointing their finger [saying] H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn shouldn\u2019t be saying that,\u201d says Wright. \u201cFootball and politics are always linked. Why shouldn\u2019t he, somebody who is affected by the government, have an opinion on Boris?</p> <p>\u201cYou want to see footballers have more of an opinion,\u201d Wright insists. \u201cHector used his platform to ask young people to vote. To have a say in what happens in your country. Is that a bad thing? You can\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Today Wright is happy, and keen to move on from \u2013 if not to forget \u2013 his early trauma. \u201cSometimes I get into moods and I think, well, what\u2019s going on? Why do I feel like this? I\u2019ve got everything that I need right now,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain Ian that I need to let go of because I\u2019m in a different phase, where it\u2019s very good.\u201d</p>",

Yet, he says, he cannot regret these experiences \u201cbecause it shapes you\u201d and he understands why he behaved the way he did. \u201cWhen you grew up in a situation where the love wasn\u2019t forthcoming, then all of a sudden, you get into a situation where you are successful and everybody loves you, you can get a little bit high on that.\u201d \u201cThis is why counselling is so good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re able to go back and let people know what you were going through, and you can only try to apologise and make people understand that you were just losing it.\u201d The counselling also encouraged him to try to reconcile with his mother. \u201cAs time went by we spoke,\u201d he says, slowly wringing his hands: \u201cShe said she had her own problems as well. Whatever her problems were I always wanted to find out, but she was never forthcoming. She didn\u2019t want to speak about those things. I\u2019m not going to put a spotlight on her. I learned to deal with it myself because at the end of the day, you can only heal yourself.\u201d Wright has eight children \u2013 with ages ranging from nine to 38 \u2013 with four women. He has said he \u201cfell into\u201d fatherhood during his turbulent young adulthood, although Wright adopted his eldest child, the former professional footballer Shaun Wright-Phillips, when he was just 19 and Wright-Phillips was a baby. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have such a disturbing time with my stepfather, I probably wouldn\u2019t have adopted Shaun to try to give him as much love as I could. I didn\u2019t want any of my kids to not be loved, like how I felt.\u201d Wright stopped playing football in 2000 (he moved from Arsenal to West Ham in 1998, with stints at Nottingham Forest, Celtic and Burnley afterwards), launching his own ITV chatshow, Friday Night\u2019s All Wright, shortly before his retirement. The series saw him interview stars from Elton John to Mariah Carey, but today he says he wishes he had taken a different path. \u201cI regret not doing [coaching] badges, and being too weak to say no. I didn\u2019t need money.\u201d He was advised, he says, that \u201cmanagement is really tough. \u2018Why do you want to do that? Television\u2019s waiting.\u2019 And I listened. That\u2019s the only thing I regret.\u201d He has gone on to have a successful career in TV and radio, and is still a popular pundit on football shows including Match of the Day. But at first, he says, the reception was not what he had hoped for. \u201cYou should have seen some of the stuff they used to say: \u2018He can\u2019t finish a sentence. What\u2019s he doing on there?\u2019\u201d says Wright. At the time, there were few black chatshow hosts on British TV and I ask whether he felt the strength of the criticism was because of his race. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say just race,\u201d says Wright, \u201cbut we know that in black culture when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re told that you have to try twice as hard because you can\u2019t give the establishment the opportunity to say: \u2018Well, if you\u2019d worked this hard, you would have been able to do it.\u2019\u201d We meet as racism in football is, once more, dominating the headlines, after a fan was accused of making monkey noises at the Manchester United player Fred during the recent Manchester derby. Wright is clear that racism at football matches needs to be dealt with more vigorously. \u201cEverybody talks about education and we do need to educate young people, but when you look at the people who are racially abusing players now, they\u2019re older people, so education is wasted on those people. Those people need to be punished severely so it can be a deterrent, so people will see that when you racially abuse someone in this ground you are out for life.\u201d In the wake of the incident, Gary Neville suggested Boris Johnson had fuelled racism with his rhetoric. Although Wright doesn\u2019t disagree, he\u2019s not sure how helpful this is. \u201cBoris Johnson may be involved in some way, just because it\u2019s intrinsically linked with the things he says and what he does. But you can\u2019t really point at one person.\u201d As Neville\u2019s comments highlight, football players past and present have become less afraid of making political statements in recent years. The week before the general election the Arsenal vice-captain H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn posted a tweet encouraging young people to vote. Then signed off with \u201c#FuckBoris\u201d. Many of the replies called on Beller\u00edn to leave politics out of the game. \u201cI can\u2019t take people who just sit there pointing their finger [saying] H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn shouldn\u2019t be saying that,\u201d says Wright. \u201cFootball and politics are always linked. Why shouldn\u2019t he, somebody who is affected by the government, have an opinion on Boris? \u201cYou want to see footballers have more of an opinion,\u201d Wright insists. \u201cHector used his platform to ask young people to vote. To have a say in what happens in your country. Is that a bad thing? You can\u2019t win.\u201d Today Wright is happy, and keen to move on from \u2013 if not to forget \u2013 his early trauma. \u201cSometimes I get into moods and I think, well, what\u2019s going on? Why do I feel like this? I\u2019ve got everything that I need right now,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain Ian that I need to let go of because I\u2019m in a different phase, where it\u2019s very good.\u201d",

He knows her instinctively, inside and out. The sex, when it happens, is hot too. Kneeling in church will never be the same again. What would in lesser hands be a simple raising of the dramatic stakes for shock value becomes the beginning of Fleabag\u2019s redemption. He relieves her of some of her armour and her burdens and shows what forgiveness, hope and self-acceptance look like, and how a better life can be built out of rubble. There are all sorts of other pieces of brilliance along the way \u2013 the peaks and troughs of sisterly love, and Kristin Scott Thomas\u2019s monologue about women\u2019s embodied pain and the liberation of the menopause, among many others \u2013 but we end where we began, with Fleabag alone. She doesn\u2019t get the happy ending we and, less certainly, she wanted, but she gets the one she needs. Some have questioned Fleabag\u2019s \u201crelatability\u201d as a posh, thin, beautiful, white woman, but this seems to me to miss the point. For one thing, Waller-Bridge is writing about universal themes \u2013 Fleabag covers a vast amount of human experience in its 12 tight half-hours \u2013 and to suggest that people cannot appreciate a piece of art unless it closely correlates with their own exact life and makeup is absurd. And for another, the valiant fight for diversity will \u2013 like any other struggle for progression \u2013 be won in increments, not all at once. To scorn rather than support a first step will not help us reach the ideal state of affairs \u2013 which is that one day Waller-Bridge will not be required to be all things to all people, but will be one voice among many others, equally talented, from everywhere, showing us life utterly in the round. We\u2019ll kneel before them all.",

      "bodyText": "If a medieval pilgrim was looking for the most extraordinary collection of festive relics \u2013 a fragment from the manger, perhaps, or a finger bone of St Nicholas \u2013 then the place to go was an abbey built to commemorate one of England\u2019s fiercest battles. English Heritage has revealed new research into its property Battle Abbey in East Sussex. Today it is an atmospheric ruin but it was once one of the most abundantly endowed religious sites in England. A medieval manuscript listing its relics has been analysed and transcribed for the first time by English Heritage historian Michael Carter. It reveals that the relics were the most prestigious given to any abbey, more significant even than those at Westminster Abbey. The manuscript lists 175 individual relics, many given by the abbey\u2019s founder, William the Conqueror, to atone for the bloodshed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Many are directly associated with the story of Christmas, good and bad. They include objects purporting to be from the ground, swaddling and manger where Jesus was born and wood from the cross on which he was crucified. There is also a rock used to stone St Stephen, whose feast day is Boxing Day; and bones of several of the Holy Innocents killed on the orders of King Herod, a massacre commemorated in the west on 28 December. St Nicholas, the original Santa Claus, is represented by a finger bone and fragments from his napkin and hair-shirt. Carter recalled seeing the manuscript, written in Latin and dating from the early 15th century, for the first time. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe what I had come across,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a low hanging fruit kind of find, it was fruit lying on the floor which everyone before me had overlooked. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how connections to our Christmas today can be traced back almost a thousand years and despite Henry VIII\u2019s violent suppression, these great monasteries are still giving up their secrets.\u201d The extensive gifts from the Norman king to Battle are especially interesting because he gave very little to other abbeys. \u201cWilliam the Conqueror was really mean to English monasteries,\u201d said Carter. The reason was salvation, Carter said. \u201cThe bloodshed at the Battle of Hastings, even by medieval standards, was absolutely horrific.

Bizarre as this might sound, I believe this thinking could help inform a new model of politics. It is time for political rewilding.</p> <p>When you try to control nature from the top down, you find yourself in a constant battle with it. Conservation groups in this country often seek to treat complex living systems as if they were simple ones. Through intensive management \u2013 cutting, grazing and burning \u2013 they strive to beat nature into submission until it meets their idea of how it should behave. But ecologies, like all complex systems, are highly dynamic and adaptive, evolving (when allowed) in emergent and unpredictable ways.</p> <p>Eventually, and inevitably, these attempts at control fail. Nature reserves managed this way tend to lose abundance and diversity, and require ever more extreme intervention to meet the irrational demands of their stewards. They also become vulnerable. In all systems, complexity tends to be resilient, while simplicity tends to be fragile. Keeping nature in a state of arrested development in which most of its natural processes and its keystone species (the animals that drive these processes) are missing makes it highly susceptible to climate breakdown and invasive species. But rewilding \u2013 allowing dynamic, spontaneous organisation to reassert itself \u2013 can result in a sudden flourishing,<a href=\"https://treesforlife.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> often in completely unexpected ways</a>, with a great improvement in resilience.</p> <p>The same applies to politics. Mainstream politics, controlled by party machines, has sought to reduce the phenomenal complexity of human society into a simple, linear model that can be controlled from the centre. The political and economic systems it creates are simultaneously highly unstable and lacking in dynamism; susceptible to collapse, as many northern towns can testify, while unable to regenerate themselves. They become vulnerable to the toxic, invasive forces of ethno-nationalism and supremacism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/from-the-nhs-to-brexit-what-can-we-expect-from-johnsons-government\">From the NHS to Brexit: what can we expect from Johnson's government?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in some parts of the world, towns and cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/24/will-of-the-people-british-democracy\" title=\"\">have begun to rewild politics</a>. Councils have catalysed mass participation, then \u2013 to the greatest extent possible \u2013 stepped back and allowed it to evolve. Classic examples include <a href=\"http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/op/\" title=\"\">participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre in Brazil</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/democraciaabierta/bernardo-guti-rrez/madrid-as-democracy-lab\" title=\"\">Decide Madrid system in Spain,</a> and the <a href=\"https://reykjavik.is/en/better-reykjavik-0\" title=\"\">Better Reykjavik programme</a> in Iceland. Local people have reoccupied the political space that had been captured by party machines and top-down government. They have worked out together what their communities need and how to make it happen, refusing to let politicians frame the questions or determine the answers. The results have been extraordinary: a massive re-engagement in politics, <a href=\"https://www.eurozine.com/participatory-budgeting-an-empowering-democratic-institution/\" title=\"\">particularly among marginalised groups</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X13000156\" title=\"\">dramatic improvements</a> in local life. Participatory politics does not require the blessing of central government, just a confident and far-sighted local authority.</p> <p>Is this a formula for a particular party to regain power? No. It\u2019s much bigger than that. It\u2019s a formula for taking back control, making our communities more resilient and the machinations of any government in Westminster less relevant. This radical devolution is the best defence against capture by any political force. Let\u2019s change the nature of politics in this country. Let\u2019s allow the fascinating, unpredictable dynamics of a functioning society to emerge. Let the wild rumpus begin.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Nature reserves managed this way tend to lose abundance and diversity, and require ever more extreme intervention to meet the irrational demands of their stewards. They also become vulnerable. In all systems, complexity tends to be resilient, while simplicity tends to be fragile. Keeping nature in a state of arrested development in which most of its natural processes and its keystone species (the animals that drive these processes) are missing makes it highly susceptible to climate breakdown and invasive species. But rewilding \u2013 allowing dynamic, spontaneous organisation to reassert itself \u2013 can result in a sudden flourishing, often in completely unexpected ways, with a great improvement in resilience. The same applies to politics. Mainstream politics, controlled by party machines, has sought to reduce the phenomenal complexity of human society into a simple, linear model that can be controlled from the centre. The political and economic systems it creates are simultaneously highly unstable and lacking in dynamism; susceptible to collapse, as many northern towns can testify, while unable to regenerate themselves. They become vulnerable to the toxic, invasive forces of ethno-nationalism and supremacism. But in some parts of the world, towns and cities have begun to rewild politics. Councils have catalysed mass participation, then \u2013 to the greatest extent possible \u2013 stepped back and allowed it to evolve. Classic examples include participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre in Brazil, the Decide Madrid system in Spain, and the Better Reykjavik programme in Iceland. Local people have reoccupied the political space that had been captured by party machines and top-down government. They have worked out together what their communities need and how to make it happen, refusing to let politicians frame the questions or determine the answers. The results have been extraordinary: a massive re-engagement in politics, particularly among marginalised groups, and dramatic improvements in local life. Participatory politics does not require the blessing of central government, just a confident and far-sighted local authority. Is this a formula for a particular party to regain power? No. It\u2019s much bigger than that. It\u2019s a formula for taking back control, making our communities more resilient and the machinations of any government in Westminster less relevant. This radical devolution is the best defence against capture by any political force. Let\u2019s change the nature of politics in this country. Let\u2019s allow the fascinating, unpredictable dynamics of a functioning society to emerge. Let the wild rumpus begin. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The search engine giant Google has agreed to pay $481.5m to the Australian Tax Office in a major win for the agency in its battle to force big technology companies to pay tax in Australia. The settlement, which covers a decade\u2019s worth of tax between 2008 and 2018, will also help bolster a federal budget surplus that has been undermined by weak economic growth and the collapse of the Morrison government\u2019s robodebt scheme. It follows a lengthy campaign to get multinationals, especially technology and resources giants, to pay tax in Australia that was launched in 2015 by the then treasurer, Joe Hockey, and spearheaded by the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan. Moves included more audits of tech and resources companies through a special ATO taskforce and introducing a suite of laws designed to force tech companies to book sales made in Australia locally, rather than running them through a tax haven such as Singapore or Ireland. The ATO said Google\u2019s settlement, together with others made by companies including Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, brought the total extra amount of cash collected from ecommerce industry players to $1.25bn. Deputy commissioner Mark Konza, who has overseen much of the ATO\u2019s work dealing with tax-shy multinationals, said the settlement was \u201canother great outcome for the Australian tax system\u201d. \u201cIt adds to the significant success of the ATO in positively changing the behaviour of digital taxpayers and significantly increasing the tax they pay in Australia,\u201d he said. The life of the tax avoidance taskforce had been extended until 2023, ensuring \u201cthat the ATO is able to continue to pursue these issues and provide assurance to the community that we are doing everything in our power to protect Australia\u2019s tax base\u201d. A Google spokeswoman said that as well as settling the company\u2019s back tax the deal would \u201calso provide certainty in relation to future tax treatment\u201d. The company formerly operated by billing Australian customers through its branch in Singapore while insisting its local office merely performed services for the global group. This structure meant that revenue from Australian customers, estimated at the time to be about $2bn a year, never touched the local company. As a result Google Australia made little or no profit on which it could be taxed by the ATO. However, in 2016 after the introduction of the multinational anti-avoidance law by the Abbott government, Google restructured its business. The Australian company became a reseller of the group\u2019s services, bringing some of the revenue stream onshore and under the ATO\u2019s umbrella. Jason Ward, principal analyst at the union-backed Centre for International Corporate Tax and Research, said the settlement was \u201cgreat news\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt that the ATO collects more of what is owed from these tech giants than most other global tax authorities; they do a great job,\u201d he said. But he said more reform was urgently needed to end tax avoidance. \u201cThe system is still rigged and in urgent need of reform,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia should step up and help push meaningful and fair global tax changes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal star Mesut \u00d6zil tends to cause controversy on and off the pitch. That is why he should be applauded for speaking out about the plight of Uighurs in China and helping to raise awareness of one of the worst human rights atrocities of the modern era. \u00d6zil posted to his millions of followers on social media on Friday about the persecution of Uighurs, condemning silence from Muslims on the issue. \u00d6zil is a Muslim who won the World Cup with the German national team before quitting international football amid claims of \u201cracism and disrespect\u201d over his Turkish heritage. He is right to speak out. The Chinese government is committing ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and the world should not stay silent. United Nations experts have described the region as a \u201cno-rights zone\u201d where Uighurs are \u201ctreated as enemies of the state based on nothing more than their ethno-religious identity\u201d. Recently, leaked government documents added to the body of evidence about the vast system of internment camps, which are holding more than a million Uighurs and Turkic Muslims. It is the largest detention of an ethno-religious minority since the second world war. \u00d6zil\u2019s post prompted anger from Chinese state-controlled media and social media platforms. The Chinese Football Association issued a statement that the Arsenal star \u201churt the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d but censored the content of the post, so readers didn\u2019t know why their feelings had been hurt. China\u2019s foreign ministry even stepped in and said the footballer had been \u201cblindfolded by fake news\u201d. There is nothing fake about the horrific human rights abuses the government of China is perpetrating against Uighurs in an attempt to erase their cultural and religious identity. Muslim women have been forcibly sterilised in internment camps and Uighur children separated from their parents and sent to state-run orphanages. The Chinese government has demolished mosques, cemeteries, historical sites, and neighbourhoods. The Uighur language has been banned in schools. Arsenal\u2019s response has been a cynical attempt to placate government-manufactured outrage in the pursuit of profits over principles. Executives should remember that critical Chinese voices face detention and censorship. Following in the footsteps of many brands that adopted the Chinese Communist party (CCP) political stance, the club released a Chinese-language statement that \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d The statement still does not appear on its English-language social media accounts or website. As many NBA fans found out in October, when the Houston Rockets manager sparked a major crisis for briefly supporting the Hong Kong protestors, sports clubs are not prepared to stand up to the Chinese government for fear that it will shut down a significant source of revenue. Though global football institutions stayed silent when Uighur footballer Erfan Hezim was sent to an internment camp, they should not look away now that one of the sport\u2019s most prominent players has forced the issue. China will host the 2021 Club World Cup and Xi Jinping has his eye on hosting the World Cup. Human rights abuses should not be swept under the rug. No matter how much brands grovel to the Chinese government, they will always be vulnerable to nationalist sentiment inflamed by the Communist party that has tied its legitimacy on having led the country out of its \u201ccentury of national humiliation\u201d. Self-censorship is not a guarantee of protection for western brands and only exposes their hypocrisy to fans back home in democracies. Instead of falsely claiming they do not involve themselves in politics, Arsenal should use this opportunity to stand up for human rights.

The most high-risk period for smoke taint and sun damage will not begin until late January, with the onset of ripening, or veraison. But in the Hunter, where veraison begins in early January, and which is bounded on two sides by bushfires, the impact of smoke taint could be severe, says University of Melbourne viticulture professor Snow Barlow. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance they will have smoke taint,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cThey are looking to be the most affected of the major wine growing regions.\u201d Bushfire smoke can permeate the skin of the grapes as they ripen, causing wine made from those grapes to have an unpleasant smoky characteristic.

The president of the New South Wales Wine Industry Association, Mark Bourne, said the industry was sampling and monitoring grapes in the Hunter Valley and other regions that could be affected by smoke taint. Bourne said early tests had come back negative for smoke taint, and the association\u2019s focus was on supporting people employed by the NSW wine industry who might have been adversely affected by the fires. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early to speculate on the potential effects of this season\u2019s grapes and wines because we haven\u2019t hit veraison yet, the main risk period,\u201d Bourne said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t a great deal that growers can do [to prevent smoke taint].\u201d A heatwave this week, which is forecast to produce four days above 40C in South Australia\u2019s Barossa Valley, could also cause stressed grapevines to drop leaves, leaving them at greater risk of sunburn later in the season. The Barossa Valley has a mix of non-irrigated heritage vineyards, with vines 70 to 120 years old, and younger irrigated vineyards. \u201cIt is ominous getting 44C, 45C days at this time of the year,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cBut if vineyards are going to have these temperatures it\u2019s better to have it now than to have it after veraison.\u201d Vineyards in Mildura and Swan Hill, where temperatures are expected to reach up to 47C on Friday, and where grapes have already begun to ripen, could lose fruit.

As the manager, Ian Underwood, says: \u201cWe are a destination store.\u201d</p> <p>So with Christmas around the corner, here are just some of Australia\u2019s independent bookstores doing things differently \u2013 and where to find them.</p> <h2><em>Melbourne</em></h2> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://paperbackbooks.com.au/\">The Paperback Bookshop</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>60 Bourke Street, Melbourne </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab59607368bbcb267963d06ccde5c485c0457b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab59607368bbcb267963d06ccde5c485c0457b1f/0_0_2200_2945/747.jpg\" alt=\"What to buy?

During the week it stays open until 10pm, and on Fridays and Saturdays it\u2019s open until 11pm, meaning this is the place to get your boozy book hit or to stop by on a literary date before or after cocktails and dinner on happening Bourke Street. It was founded in the early 1960s to stock paperbacks, and it has now branched out to hardbacks, too.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.hares-hyenas.com.au/\">Hares &amp; Hyenas</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>63 Johnston Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne </strong></p> <p>Hares &amp; Hyenas was founded in 1981 and stocks books ranging from coffee table tomes to erotica to memoirs by the likes of Patti Smith, and caters to queer and gender-diverse communities. But what differentiates it from other queer bookshops is its jazzy performance venue, the Hare Hole. An average of three shows are put on a week at the Hole, from comedy to spoken word events to Melbourne Fringe festival theatre. There is even a Gay Stuff markets with all sorts of paraphernalia for sale. A book club, too, tackles a new queer novel each second Saturday of the month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/10/state-library-victorias-triumphant-redesign-its-not-just-about-books-but-community\">State Library Victoria's triumphant redesign: it's not just about books, but community</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>But wait, there\u2019s more</strong></em></p> <p>Australia\u2019s city of literature is most famously the home of <a href=\"https://www.readings.com.au/\">Readings Books</a>.

      "bodyText": "Independent bookshops in Australia are having a revival, the people who run them say. And after evidence from Britain last year that the number of independent bookshops grew for the second year running \u2013 a dramatic turnabout after a 20-year-decline \u2013 Australian retailers claim they, too, are thriving. What\u2019s behind the revival? Although online shopping is often cheaper and more convenient, when it comes to books people are increasingly looking for something more. Kate Treloar, co-founder of the Pop-Up Bookshop in the Adelaide Central Market, characterises it as \u201cexperience and soul\u201d. \u201cIt does feel like it plateaued for a little while there and now it\u2019s coming out the other side,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have probably reached screen saturation.\u201d Anna Low, owner of Potts Point Bookshop in Sydney, says embedding itself in the local community, as well providing pitch perfect service, has been critical to its success. \u201cEveryone who works here is a crazy book person,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to connect the right book with the right person.\u201d Storytime events for kids and author talks for adults help, too. \u201cPeople really like being part of something, being part of the conversation,\u201d Low says. The Architect\u2019s Bookshop in Sydney\u2019s Surry Hills, meanwhile, has focused on carving a niche as a community space for architects. \u201cWe do talks, book launches, we are involved in the Sydney Architecture festival,\u201d says Tom Dwyer, one of the store\u2019s managers. \u201cAnd we rely a lot on our customers for suggestions. We are always looking for what they are asking for.\u201d The bookshop next door, Title, has taken a different tack. It doesn\u2019t do talks or events but it has diversified: selling records, gifts, headphones, hi-fi systems and board games alongside books. As the manager, Ian Underwood, says: \u201cWe are a destination store.\u201d So with Christmas around the corner, here are just some of Australia\u2019s independent bookstores doing things differently \u2013 and where to find them. Melbourne The Paperback Bookshop 60 Bourke Street, Melbourne Few stores in Australia endorse late night shopping, but the Paperback is an exception. During the week it stays open until 10pm, and on Fridays and Saturdays it\u2019s open until 11pm, meaning this is the place to get your boozy book hit or to stop by on a literary date before or after cocktails and dinner on happening Bourke Street. It was founded in the early 1960s to stock paperbacks, and it has now branched out to hardbacks, too. Hares &amp; Hyenas 63 Johnston Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne Hares &amp; Hyenas was founded in 1981 and stocks books ranging from coffee table tomes to erotica to memoirs by the likes of Patti Smith, and caters to queer and gender-diverse communities. But what differentiates it from other queer bookshops is its jazzy performance venue, the Hare Hole. An average of three shows are put on a week at the Hole, from comedy to spoken word events to Melbourne Fringe festival theatre. There is even a Gay Stuff markets with all sorts of paraphernalia for sale. A book club, too, tackles a new queer novel each second Saturday of the month. But wait, there\u2019s more Australia\u2019s city of literature is most famously the home of Readings Books. Its flagship store is at 309 Lygon Street, Carlton, but it also has stores in Doncaster, Hawthorn, Malvern and St Kilda, and at the State Library Victoria. You could also visit: Hill of Content \u2013 one of Melbourne\u2019s oldest bookstores, providing a \u201cbroad and discerning range of books\u201d, at 86 Bourke Street Coventry Bookstore \u2013 small contemporary bookstore at 265 Coventry Street, South Melbourne Brunswick Street Bookstore \u2013 warm and friendly indie space at 305 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy City Basement Books \u2013 a bargain basement of secondhand books at 342 Flinders Street Sun Bookshop \u2013 beloved westside literary haven, tucked into the similarly beloved Sun Theatre, at 10 Ballarat Street, Yarraville Books for Cooks \u2013 for lovers of wine, food and the culinary arts, and books old and new about the same, at 115-121 Victoria Street Metropolis \u2013 specialises in graphic design, architecture, photography, pop culture, film, art and the like, with a curated general range, at level 3 of the beautiful art deco Curtin House, 252 Swanston Street Brown and Bunting \u2013 specialising in good quality secondhand literature and children\u2019s books and more at 237 High Street, Northcote Kay Craddock, Antiquarian Bookseller \u2013 beautiful antiquarian and secondhand books in the Assembly Hall building at the leafy end of the city, 156 Collins Street Wayward Books \u2013 a tiny bookstore in leafy surrounds catering to the quirky, at 172 Bellair Street, Kensington Brisbane Avid Reader 193 Boundary Street, West End For budding writers, Avid Reader is a bookshop that provides something more: a workshop series aimed at honing your craft. In 2020 author JP Pomare, journalist Jenny Valentish and literary agent Alex Adsett will provide the lowdown on everything from crime writing to finding your character\u2019s voice to the ins and outs of the publishing world. While slightly pricey (half-day workshops start at $75, full day at $150), this is one way to get your ideas out of your head and maybe, one day, into a book and on to a bookshelf. But wait, there\u2019s more Riverbend Books \u2013 breezy and friendly bookshop with cafe adjacent, and the place where the Indigenous Literacy Foundation got its start, at 193 Oxford Street, Bulimba Archives Fine Books \u2013 specialises in rare books and in the heritage-listed John Mills Himself warehouse, at 40 Charlotte Street Folio Books \u2013 a wide range of titles, offering discounts for members of RAIA (Australian Institute of Architects), at 33 Mary Street Sydney Grand Days 220 William Street, Woolloomooloo, Sydney Kings Cross may be dead, but Grand Days harks back to its bohemian glory era. Front and centre are the beautifully presented secondhand books, although bric-a-brac and vintage clothes also make an appearance. An entire back room is dedicated to vinyl, with founders Tamara and Tom often on hand to help with any selections. In the evening come for the \u201cgrand nights\u201d, ranging from scarf-tying workshops (who doesn\u2019t want to learn how to tie a neckerchief?) to fashion sales, acoustic gigs and movie screenings, all with refreshments in tow. This is a neighbourhood gem. Gertrude &amp; Alice bookstore and cafe 46 Hall Street, Bondi beach This firm Bondi favourite is minutes from the beach but feels like its own world. Although there are a sprinkling of outside seats for those wanting to bask in the sunshine, most patrons stop by to sink into oblivion in one of the old armchairs or communal wooden tables in the darker, cosy, European-feeling interior. There are thousands of secondhand books to choose from but the cafe menu and Campos coffee are themselves reasons to visit. Try the breakfast crumble served with coconut yogurt and the floral pink-coloured rose latte. But wait, there\u2019s more Sydney is thriving with independent bookshops. Here is a (by no means exhaustive) list: Gleebooks \u2013 while its satellite stores can be found around New South Wales, including Blackheath, Dulwich Hill, and even the Roslyn Packer Theatre, its main store can be found at 49 Glebe Point Road, Glebe, right next door to \u2026 Sappho Books \u2013 a secondhand bookstore, cafe and tapas bar that also hosts Da Capo music bookshop, at 51 Glebe Point Road Bookoccino \u2013 northern beaches bookstore and literary events hub led by Pulitzer prize-winning writer Raymond Bonner, at 66 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon beach Better Read than Dead \u2013 20-year-old Newtown institution with popular events schedule, at 265 King Street, Newtown The Architect\u2019s Bookshop \u2013 a community space for architects, at 499 Crown Street, Surry Hills Title \u2013 books, records, gifts, headphones, hi-fi systems and board games, at 400 Barangaroo Avenue, Sydney Potts Point Bookshop\u2013 modern bookstore with a wide range of children\u2019s books and free gift-wrapping at 14 Macleay Street The Bookshop \u2013 catering to Syney\u2019s queer community, at 207 Oxford Street, Darlinghurst The Best Little Bookshop in Town \u2013 new and secondhand books at 97 Cronulla Street, Cronulla Dog Eared Books \u2013 specialises in new releases and paperbacks, at 2/7 Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills Berkelouw Books \u2013 sixth-generation booksellers whose flagship store specialising in antiquarian and secondhand books is at 19 Oxford Street, Paddington Adelaide Adelaide\u2019s Pop-Up Bookshop Shop 10, Central Market Arcade, Adelaide Founded by Kate Treloar and Nick Patrick, Adelaide\u2019s Pop-Up Bookshop started as a pop up all over the city, appearing everywhere from unused shopfronts to street corners. The idea was to both repopulate Adelaide with books (critical since so many bookshops have closed) and to create an ever-changing space in which readers can browse. Now the bookshop \u2013 which features secondhand titles and also buys books from punters \u2013 can be found online and in a flagship shop in the Adelaide Central Market, stuffed with treasures. When the Central Market is redeveloped in a $400m makeover, however, it will go back to what it does best: pop-ups. But wait, there\u2019s more Dillons Norwood Bookshop \u2013 South Australia\u2019s largest independent family owned bookstore, at 160-166 The Parade, Norwood Imprints Booksellers \u2013 selling an eclectic range of books since 1984, at 107 Hindley Street O\u2019Connell\u2019s Bookshop \u2013 secondhand and antiquarian books at 19 Bank Street Booknook &amp; Bean \u2013 coffee, books and a cosy corner to read, at Topham Mall, shop 18, 52-54 Waymouth Street Michael Treloar Antiquarian Booksellers \u2013 dealing in out-of-print and antiquarian books, at 196 North Terrace Booked at North Adelaide \u2013 new titles and designer stationery, at North Adelaide Shopping Village, 81 O\u2019Connell Street Matilda Bookshop \u2013 specialising in new release fiction and lifestyle titles, plus a dedicated children\u2019s room, at 1/8 Mount Barker Road, Stirling Canberra Beyond Q Weston Arcade, 11 Brierly Street, Weston Creek Boasting several kilometres of bookshelves, Beyond Q stocks secondhand and antiquarian books (if you have books to sell, it offers shop credit in the cafe or bookshop in return). Music is central here, too, with gigs every weekend, ranging from classical guitar to jazz bands to piano recitals and the blues. Gigs are free, although donations are welcome, and refreshments are BYO with a corkage fee of $5 for wine. But wait, there\u2019s more Paperchain Bookstore \u2013 established in 1982 and a favourite of local and visiting authors alike, at 34 Franklin Street, Manuka Muse \u2013 restaurant fused with new and secondhand bookstore running a vibrant literary events program, at East Hotel, 69 Canberra Avenue, Kingston Perth Boffins Books 88 William Street, Perth Bang in the middle of Perth\u2019s CBD, Boffins Books has won the Australian Book Industry Association\u2019s award for best specialist bookseller six years running. It was, in fact, founded in 1989 as a technical-title bookshop, stocking everything from books on tech to racehorse training. It has since expanded to fiction, current affairs and kids\u2019 books as well, but Boffins still shines through its knowledgeable staff and special order service. Via the latter, it is able to track down rare titles that might otherwise be hard to find \u2013 meaning you can finally get hold of that Jewish-Japanese cookbook you\u2019ve always wanted. But wait, there\u2019s more Planet Books \u2013 for all things \u201cslightly left wing, quirky and unique\u201d, found at 638 Beaufort Street, Mount Lawley, and 192 William Street, Northbridge Crow Books \u2013 for books both mainstream and hard-to-find, at 900 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park White Dwarf Books \u2013 for all things science fiction, fantasy and paranormal, at shop 1, Albert Facey House, 469 Wellington Street The Lane Bookshop \u2013 solid all-rounder with cafe adjacent, at 52c Old Theatre Lane, off Bay View Terrace, Claremont Hobart Fullers Bookshop 131 Collins Street, Hobart Established in 1920 by WE Fuller in Hobart, Fullers today focuses not only on books but on fostering community. Clubs nurtured by the shop include the Shakespeare group, the philosophy group and the Fullers reading group, which has run for two decades. There is also the Fullers Ferrets \u2013 a club not for furry small animals but for kids. If that all seems a bit too hectic, then visit Fullers\u2019 Afterword Cafe instead. Windows offer stellar views of Mount Wellington and there\u2019s even a \u201cpoet\u2019s breakfast\u201d of muesli, preserved fruits and Tasmanian honey. But wait, there\u2019s more The Hobart Bookshop \u2013 close to the wharf and right in the heart of Salamanca market, at 22 Salamanca Square Cracked and Spineless \u2013 formerly The Imperial Bookshop but renamed in 2013, stocks new and secondhand books at Shop 9, 138 Collins Street State Bookstore \u2013 a boutique bookstore specialising in art, architecture, travel and film, adjacent to the State Cinema at 377 Elizabeth Street, North Hobart UPDATE: Thank you to all the readers who have been writing in and commenting below, telling us all about your favourite independent bookshops.

But rich Australians who failed to declare \u201clifestyle assets\u201d would not face robodebts similar to those levied on hundreds of thousands of Centrelink recipients, the ATO said. It expected insurance companies to hand over information about assets owned by about 350,000 Australians, covering the years between 2015 and the current tax year, to add to an existing database covering 2013-14 and 2014-15. \u201cIf a taxpayer is reporting a taxable income of $70,000 to us but we know they own a $3m yacht then this is likely to raise some red flags,\u201d a deputy commissioner, Deborah Jenkins, said. ATO compliance officers would use the information to figure out whether people had been under-declaring their income or had failed to declare capital gains on the sale of assets such as fine art. It would also be used to help detect when people claimed GST for business purposes on assets that were used for personal purposes, and when rich Australians bought high-priced toys through their self-managed super funds and pretended they were investments. But while people living on Newstart and other Centrelink benefits were hit with automated debts for alleged overpayment that the government has admitted were illegal, the ATO said the insurance data would not automatically trigger tax bills. \u201cTaxpayers selected for compliance activities are identified through other methodologies,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe data is made available to our compliance teams to support their risk profiling of the selected taxpayers.

      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco (BAT) and three other e-cigarette firms have been banned by the UK advertising watchdog from promoting their vaping products on public Instagram pages in a ruling described as \u201ca huge step forward\u201d by health campaigners. The landmark ruling against the FTSE 100 tobacco giant and maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson &amp; Hedges, puts the spotlight on tactics used to market increasingly controversial vaping and e-cigarette products to young people. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) rules ban the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, however companies are allowed to put factual information about their products on their own websites. BAT, one of four companies to receive bans from the ASA for using Facebook-owned Instagram to promote vaping, had argued its Vype Instagram account was equivalent to a company-owned site. The ASA rejected this claim, adding that BAT\u2019s celebrity-driven ads \u201cclearly went beyond the provision of factual information and was promotional in nature\u201d. The ruling followed complaints from Action on Smoking and Health, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and Stop (Stopping Tobacco Organisations and Products) that Instagram posts from BAT, Ama Vape Lab, Attitude Vapes and Mylo Vapes broke advertising rules. The complaints focused on Instagram posts including seven early this year by BAT for its e-cigarette brand Vype, three of which featured captioned pictures of singer Lily Allen. Other posts promoting Vype congratulated Rami Malek on his Bafta best actor award for Bohemian Rhapsody and featured a picture of model Olivia Jade Attwood smoking an e-cigarette. \u201cThe ASA\u2019s ruling is a huge step forward in preventing tobacco companies from using social media to advertise to young people in the UK and around the world,\u201d said Mark Hurley, director of international communications at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, one of three campaigning groups to lodge a complaint with the ASA. \u201cWhile the ASA ruling is great news, urgent policy change is needed from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to prevent BAT and other tobacco companies from using social media to advertise their harmful products to young people around the world.\u201d Instagram has more than 20 million monthly users in the UK, almost 7 million of whom are aged between 12 and 24 years old and another 6 million are between 25 and 34 years old, according to research firm eMarketer. The ASA\u2019s ruling comes as the issue of vaping among younger people, and the health concerns emerging attributed to e-cigarettes, loads increasing pressure on the makers and marketers. In the US there have been more than 2,300 incidences of vaping-related lung injury, including 47 deaths. Late last year, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and petrol stations across the US to curb the huge rise in vaping among teenagers. \u201cThis is a major step forward in stopping the tobacco industry from promoting its new addictive products to children and teenagers,\u201d said Professor Anna Gilmore, director of the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath. But given that cigarette sales are falling and tobacco companies are desperate to recruit young people into using these new products, ongoing vigilance is essential.\u201d In May, Tobacco-Free Kids and more than 125 organisations from 48 countries called on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to immediately prohibit influencer marketing of tobacco and e-cigarettes on their platforms. \u201cWe do not allow adverts that promote the sale or use of tobacco or electronic cigarettes,\u201d said a spokesman for Facebook. \u201cEarlier this year we updated our policy to restrict organic content that depicts the sale or purchase of tobacco products to over 18s.
