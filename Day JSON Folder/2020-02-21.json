      "body": "<p>Nearly 20 years ago, in pursuit of a different sort of life, I spent six months commuting between Brisbane and Robbins Island, a remote chunk of privately owned land just off the far north-west coast of Tasmania. My job at the time was identifying and counting birds as part of an environmental impact assessment for a proposed windfarm.</p> <p>The uninhabited island is a tough place to get around, accessible only by four-wheel-drive across the mudflats, at low tide. But its wild west coast is a haven for many thousands of migratory shorebirds, around 25 species of which perform marathon, nearly non-stop flights from the Siberian tundra, where they breed, all the way to Australia and back, every year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/02/to-the-moon-and-back-with-the-eastern-curlew\">To the moon and back with the eastern curlew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Going through my notes from December 2002, a few numbers jump out: over 600 curlew sandpipers; 100 great knots; 180 grey plovers; more than 3,000 red-necked stints. One month later, these birds were joined by over 240 bar-tailed godwits. The numbers were impressive, but fairly typical at the time.</p> <p>Now the windfarm proposal is back on, and Andrew Darby \u2013 a Hobart-based journalist and the author of a new book, Flight Lines \u2013 has been helping survey birds on the island again. In 2015\u20132016, the curlew sandpiper, great knot and the local subspecies of bar-tailed godwit were all listed as critically endangered. Last year\u2019s counts turned up just one grey plover.</p> <p>Wind turbines are not the cause of the birds\u2019 decline.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 20 years ago, in pursuit of a different sort of life, I spent six months commuting between Brisbane and Robbins Island, a remote chunk of privately owned land just off the far north-west coast of Tasmania. My job at the time was identifying and counting birds as part of an environmental impact assessment for a proposed windfarm. The uninhabited island is a tough place to get around, accessible only by four-wheel-drive across the mudflats, at low tide. But its wild west coast is a haven for many thousands of migratory shorebirds, around 25 species of which perform marathon, nearly non-stop flights from the Siberian tundra, where they breed, all the way to Australia and back, every year. Going through my notes from December 2002, a few numbers jump out: over 600 curlew sandpipers; 100 great knots; 180 grey plovers; more than 3,000 red-necked stints. One month later, these birds were joined by over 240 bar-tailed godwits. The numbers were impressive, but fairly typical at the time. Now the windfarm proposal is back on, and Andrew Darby \u2013 a Hobart-based journalist and the author of a new book, Flight Lines \u2013 has been helping survey birds on the island again. In 2015\u20132016, the curlew sandpiper, great knot and the local subspecies of bar-tailed godwit were all listed as critically endangered. Last year\u2019s counts turned up just one grey plover. Wind turbines are not the cause of the birds\u2019 decline. The overwhelming threat is habitat destruction, particularly the mudflats of the Yellow Sea in China \u2013 a critical layover where the exhausted birds replenish themselves \u2013 and around the Australian coastline, including Toondah harbour in south-east Queensland. It all sounds familiarly grim. And yet Flight Lines, which was written either side of a life-threatening diagnosis of lung cancer in 2018, is far from it. In dark times, Darby looked for inspiration in the resilience of shorebirds, in particular the stories of two satellite-tagged female grey plovers named CYA and CYB. Until recently, Darby was no more interested in birds than the average person and shorebirds existed on the periphery of his consciousness \u2013 until he learned about their ultra-marathon travel schedule. \u201cThey are the birds \u2018out there\u2019, on the edge of the tideline, not really very noticeable creatures, and yet they have such extraordinary lives,\u201d he says.

That interested Darby: \u201cIn life, there are many surprises to be found among the overlooked,\u201d he writes. Like Harry Saddler\u2019s surprise hit from 2018, The Eastern Curlew (which follows the journey of another long-distance migrant), Flight Lines takes what appears to be a niche topic and turns it into an immense, heroic and surprisingly uplifting narrative of endurance and survival, with an obvious parallel to his own experience. But whereas Saddler\u2019s account is intimate and personal, Darby\u2019s book, which was nearly curtailed by his illness, directly engages with, and celebrates, citizen science.

      "body": "<p>Hang up some bunting and buy in a cake: Intelligence is a special occasion. An otherwise smalltime British comedy is made noteworthy by the presence not just of a former Friends star, but an ex-Friend who hasn\u2019t done much TV since Central Perk shut. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/19/what-do-female-film-makers-have-to-say-about-male-stories-barbican-her-lens-his-story\">David Schwimmer</a> is back in sitcom, and he\u2019s doing it on little old Sky One.</p> <p>We\u2019re at GCHQ in Cheltenham, where the finest exponents of Britain\u2019s fightback against cyber-terrorism turn out to be erratic oddballs. When a transatlantic liaison programme causes the arrival from the NSA of sharp-suited American go-getter Jerry (Schwimmer), it\u2019s great news for daffy pillock Joseph (writer/star Nick Mohammed) but not so good for the department\u2019s relatively normal, and therefore perennially frustrated, manager Christine (Sylvestra Le Touzel). Jerry immediately causes chaos by giving unbidden motivational speeches, spraying plants with glue to stop them wilting, refusing to discuss his professional past and generally acting like he\u2019s in charge.</p> <p>If that sounds like a standard workplace sitcom, it is. Yet Schwimmer\u2019s participation demands a big part, and it is this tension that makes Intelligence fall to pieces. Jerry is, if you stand a long way away and squint, a classic delusional leader \u2013 an infuriating buffoon whose bravado keeps cracking to reveal the idiot within. But that description could apply to many different characters, and a good sitcom picks one then refines it. Its lead can\u2019t be, as Schwimmer is here, an umbrella creation who exhibits whatever nightmare-colleague characteristic the script feels like in that moment. Is Jerry dastardly or charming or aggressive or lecherous or clumsy or cunning or macho or gullible? At various points he is all of the above. There is no discernible human under his tangle of eccentricities.</p> <p>Still, that\u2019s fine isn\u2019t it? No need to overanalyse \u2013 it\u2019s a silly comedy! Think of it as a live-action cartoon! Well, no because the comedies people love, including animated ones, do the hard work Intelligence doesn\u2019t. However broad they seem, they\u2019re not jokes tossed into a vacuum: they have structure, and characters whose every utterance is something that specific person \u2013 who feels drawn from life rather than other TV shows \u2013 would say. Either that, or big visual set pieces and holes blown in the fourth wall stop those things mattering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"743f4fcb13a441677714535e641518113fc887aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/743f4fcb13a441677714535e641518113fc887aa/0_447_5439_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Only five characters, and three are faintly drawn ...

Intelligence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photographer - Justin Downing/SKY TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Intelligence, on the other hand, is a conventional, single-location sitcom that doesn\u2019t have funny bones, because it doesn\u2019t have bones at all.

      "bodyText": "Hang up some bunting and buy in a cake: Intelligence is a special occasion. An otherwise smalltime British comedy is made noteworthy by the presence not just of a former Friends star, but an ex-Friend who hasn\u2019t done much TV since Central Perk shut. David Schwimmer is back in sitcom, and he\u2019s doing it on little old Sky One. We\u2019re at GCHQ in Cheltenham, where the finest exponents of Britain\u2019s fightback against cyber-terrorism turn out to be erratic oddballs. When a transatlantic liaison programme causes the arrival from the NSA of sharp-suited American go-getter Jerry (Schwimmer), it\u2019s great news for daffy pillock Joseph (writer/star Nick Mohammed) but not so good for the department\u2019s relatively normal, and therefore perennially frustrated, manager Christine (Sylvestra Le Touzel). Jerry immediately causes chaos by giving unbidden motivational speeches, spraying plants with glue to stop them wilting, refusing to discuss his professional past and generally acting like he\u2019s in charge. If that sounds like a standard workplace sitcom, it is. Yet Schwimmer\u2019s participation demands a big part, and it is this tension that makes Intelligence fall to pieces. Jerry is, if you stand a long way away and squint, a classic delusional leader \u2013 an infuriating buffoon whose bravado keeps cracking to reveal the idiot within. But that description could apply to many different characters, and a good sitcom picks one then refines it. Its lead can\u2019t be, as Schwimmer is here, an umbrella creation who exhibits whatever nightmare-colleague characteristic the script feels like in that moment. Is Jerry dastardly or charming or aggressive or lecherous or clumsy or cunning or macho or gullible? At various points he is all of the above. There is no discernible human under his tangle of eccentricities. Still, that\u2019s fine isn\u2019t it? No need to overanalyse \u2013 it\u2019s a silly comedy! Think of it as a live-action cartoon! Well, no because the comedies people love, including animated ones, do the hard work Intelligence doesn\u2019t. However broad they seem, they\u2019re not jokes tossed into a vacuum: they have structure, and characters whose every utterance is something that specific person \u2013 who feels drawn from life rather than other TV shows \u2013 would say. Either that, or big visual set pieces and holes blown in the fourth wall stop those things mattering. Intelligence, on the other hand, is a conventional, single-location sitcom that doesn\u2019t have funny bones, because it doesn\u2019t have bones at all. There are only five main characters, but three are far too faintly drawn \u2013 the worst example being Gana Bayarsaikhan as genius hacker Tova, who ends up as a taciturn, exoticised presence for her colleagues to occasionally wonder at or lust after. Vague scripting has even more discomfiting results when Jerry\u2019s approach to counter-terror profiling proves to be bluntly racist but, because Intelligence is a show where nothing matters, it\u2019s treated as just one more of his wacky quirks. In fairness, Intelligence does settle down a little by the fourth episode (all six are available as a streaming box set \u2013 Sky has already commissioned a second run), with Schwimmer and Mohammed forming a brash-fool/meek-fool partnership.

Either way, Schwimmer\u2019s talents are wasted.

He comes in for George Furbank, who was described as \u201cnot quite right\u201d by Jones owing to a long-standing groin/hip problem, with Elliot Daly returning to full-back. Furbank, however, has been retained by England as a non-playing reserve, suggesting he has been dropped after two inauspicious appearances.</p> <p>\u201cWe train [Jonathan] at winger a lot because that\u2019s always been one of the positions he needs to cover,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our best defenders in space, competent under the high ball and has great running skills. With the resources we have available he\u2019s the best guy for that spot.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the amount of possession we are going to get, 40% is going to be from structured, where people have set positions, and 60% or more is going to be from unstructured, where they don\u2019t have set positions.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has rolled the dice by picking Jonathan Joseph on the wing and thrusting Manu Tuilagi straight back into his side against Ireland, and the coach believes England are primed to rediscover their World Cup edge in Sunday\u2019s do-or-die match. Jones has recently faced criticism for moving Tom Curry from blindside flanker to No 8 and with Joseph starting a Test on the wing for the first time, the flanker Ben Earl potentially providing backline cover from the bench and five locks included in the match-day 23, he has raised eyebrows once again with a high-risk selection strategy. Joseph covered wing during the World Cup and played the last 11 minutes of the final defeat by South Africa there, but has never started for England in that position in his previous 49 Tests. He comes in for George Furbank, who was described as \u201cnot quite right\u201d by Jones owing to a long-standing groin/hip problem, with Elliot Daly returning to full-back. Furbank, however, has been retained by England as a non-playing reserve, suggesting he has been dropped after two inauspicious appearances. \u201cWe train [Jonathan] at winger a lot because that\u2019s always been one of the positions he needs to cover,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our best defenders in space, competent under the high ball and has great running skills. With the resources we have available he\u2019s the best guy for that spot. \u201cIf you look at the amount of possession we are going to get, 40% is going to be from structured, where people have set positions, and 60% or more is going to be from unstructured, where they don\u2019t have set positions. We are looking at the majority of the possession, so there are no set positions and therefore we look at picking the best players.\u201d Tuilagi\u2019s return has been welcomed by Jones given the absence of both Vunipola brothers after Mako withdrew owing to family reasons.

I don\u2019t want to be a striker who spends 90 minutes in the box waiting for the ball. I don\u2019t like just getting the ball 10 times during a game. It\u2019s not enough for me; I find those games difficult.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you have to be there waiting for the ball and if you get it once in the 90 minutes you have to be ready.

Borussia Dortmund said: \u2018No, that\u2019s that.\u2019 That was the first time I was thinking about the move because if you get a phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson, for a young player it was something amazing. That was a special day for me.\u201d Speculation about joining Madrid has died down. Lewandowski is settled at Bayern but he is still looking to add extra layers to his game. \u201cI want to play for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel 31 years old and everything I am doing now is working to keep me in top for the next five, six years. I don\u2019t want to be a striker who spends 90 minutes in the box waiting for the ball. I don\u2019t like just getting the ball 10 times during a game. It\u2019s not enough for me; I find those games difficult. \u201cSometimes you have to be there waiting for the ball and if you get it once in the 90 minutes you have to be ready. But I say: \u2018I want to be part of the team, of the game, I want to move and pass and not just wait for the ball.\u2019 That\u2019s why I am always looking for space to get the ball and find my teammates. I can work on everything still. But one thing? Maybe to shoot from distance.\u201d",

As Dele Alli hurled his water bottle to the ground in fury at being substituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/tottenham-rb-leipzig-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against RB Leipzig on Wednesday night</a>, as first right boot and then left boot were flung off, Mourinho might have been tempted to conclude that his attempts at motivating his star playmaker had not met with unreserved success.</p> \n<p>It was Alli, after all, whom Mourinho had singled out during his first press conference in November as one of his most important projects. \u201cAre you Dele or Dele\u2019s brother?\u201d he asked during their first conversation. \u201cOK. Play like Dele. The real Dele.\u201d Now, in the aftermath of a first-leg Champions League defeat, the tone would be slightly different.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/21/jose-mourinho-finishing-in-top-four-with-spurs-would-be-my-greatest-achievement\">Mourinho: top-four finish with Spurs would be one of my best achievements</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI think he was angry with his performance, not with me,\u201d Mourinho said of Alli\u2019s outburst. \u201cI think he understands why I took him off. And our performance improved.\u201d Ouch. Factually, of course, there was very little to dispute. Alli had been poor all evening: a pale imitation of his very best, with no shots on goal and only 28 touches, the same as his goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, and the substitute Tanguy Ndombele, who replaced Alli in the 64th minute. Only five of those touches came in the final third. Only two came in the Leipzig penalty area.</p> \n<p>Even so, publicly flannelling one of your key players before a crucial game against your local rivals: let\u2019s optimistically file that one under \u201cBold moves\u201d.</p> \n<p>And as Tottenham shape up for a Saturday lunchtime fixture at Chelsea that could be a decisive milestone in the race for Champions League qualification, one senses this was a gamble with quite a bit riding on it. Chelsea have historically been one of Alli\u2019s favourite teams to play against. He has six goals against them in eight appearances, the most of any opponent. Since Mourinho\u2019s arrival, moreover his output has risen sharply with more goals (six in all competitions), more expected goals (0.40 per 90 minutes) and more expected assists (0.22 per 90 minutes, both a significant increase on his last 12 months under Mauricio Pochettino).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"75026506-6854-4bf4-bb61-7fd42abb1d88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qqv38l7yWM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Under normal circumstances this would be a fixture to relish. But the Leipzig game, along with other recent games against high-quality opposition, offered something of a corrective. One could see Alli\u2019s exasperation growing as he was forced into chasing a succession of long balls into the channels, frozen out of the buildup, feeding off scraps.</p> \n<p>Mourinho has said he sees Alli primarily as a No 10 playing off the striker, rather than as a midfielder, but for a player who likes to feel involved in play nights like these can prove especially frustrating.</p> \n<p>Partly, of course, this is a function of circumstances: with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/13/harry-kane-injury-euro-2020-jose-mourinho-tottenham-england\" title=\"\">Harry Kane</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/son-heung-min-out-for-weeks-after-fracturing-arm-in-aston-villa-clash-football\" title=\"\">Son Heung-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/son-heung-min-out-for-weeks-after-fracturing-arm-in-aston-villa-clash-football\" title=\"\">min </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/son-heung-min-out-for-weeks-after-fracturing-arm-in-aston-villa-clash-football\" title=\"\">injured</a>, with Christian Eriksen gone, Alli is the only remaining member of the attacking quartet that for a couple of seasons was one of the most lethal front fours in Europe.</p> \n<p>Paradoxically the scarcity of options up front has simultaneously piled extra pressure on him to produce while also starving him of the supply chain that gives him the best chance of doing so. But to a large extent, this is also a product of deliberate choices.</p> \n<p>Mourinho\u2019s defence-first strategy in big games has condemned one of their most creative players to long periods at the periphery. His insistence that Alli play primarily in the final third has raised his goal output while arguably diminishing his overall influence. And his decision to criticise Alli publicly risks fracturing the confidence of a player who, for all the brash confidence of his public persona, is a good deal more introspective than many give him credit for.</p> \n<p>One could equally argue, of course, that Alli is the sort of player who requires the occasional rocket. That was certainly the view of Pochettino, who while lionising Alli in public often felt the need to point out his shortcomings in private. And the brainless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/it-wasnt-funny-tottenhams-dele-alli-apologises-over-coronavirus-video\" title=\"\">coronavirus joke</a> he posted to his Snapchat a couple of weeks ago was hardly the act of a player ready to take on greater responsibility. Alli will be 24 in a couple of months and should theoretically be entering his peak years. Instead he is still trying to sustain the jet-propelled promise of his early career, his place in England\u2019s Euro 2020 squad not secure.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/21/chelsea-v-tottenham-match-preview\">Chelsea v Tottenham: match preview</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Perhaps it was this essential tension that found its explosive outlet on Wednesday night. Those who interpreted Alli\u2019s reaction to being substituted purely as an expression of brattish petulance are perhaps guilty of ignoring what came next. After sitting down he buried his head in his hands and then pulled his shirt over his face, blind wrath giving way to quiet devastation. It was in many ways a crushingly human moment, the point at which the dreams and unfettered ambition of youth seemed to collide head-on with the severe reality of playing up front in a team with 37% possession.</p> \n<p>Alli\u2019s mercurial talents have always been as much curse as gift. And there is perhaps a broader question: whether players are ultimately responsible for their performances and output or whether they are inextricably bound by circumstances: the team around them, the culture and ambience of the club, the tactics and strategy being pursued. Put more simply: does Mourinho have anything more to offer Alli than mind games? Or is he, to all purposes, on his own?</p>",

Alli had been poor all evening: a pale imitation of his very best, with no shots on goal and only 28 touches, the same as his goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, and the substitute Tanguy Ndombele, who replaced Alli in the 64th minute. Only five of those touches came in the final third. Only two came in the Leipzig penalty area. Even so, publicly flannelling one of your key players before a crucial game against your local rivals: let\u2019s optimistically file that one under \u201cBold moves\u201d. And as Tottenham shape up for a Saturday lunchtime fixture at Chelsea that could be a decisive milestone in the race for Champions League qualification, one senses this was a gamble with quite a bit riding on it. Chelsea have historically been one of Alli\u2019s favourite teams to play against. He has six goals against them in eight appearances, the most of any opponent. Since Mourinho\u2019s arrival, moreover his output has risen sharply with more goals (six in all competitions), more expected goals (0.40 per 90 minutes) and more expected assists (0.22 per 90 minutes, both a significant increase on his last 12 months under Mauricio Pochettino). Under normal circumstances this would be a fixture to relish. But the Leipzig game, along with other recent games against high-quality opposition, offered something of a corrective. One could see Alli\u2019s exasperation growing as he was forced into chasing a succession of long balls into the channels, frozen out of the buildup, feeding off scraps. Mourinho has said he sees Alli primarily as a No 10 playing off the striker, rather than as a midfielder, but for a player who likes to feel involved in play nights like these can prove especially frustrating. Partly, of course, this is a function of circumstances: with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min injured, with Christian Eriksen gone, Alli is the only remaining member of the attacking quartet that for a couple of seasons was one of the most lethal front fours in Europe. Paradoxically the scarcity of options up front has simultaneously piled extra pressure on him to produce while also starving him of the supply chain that gives him the best chance of doing so. But to a large extent, this is also a product of deliberate choices. Mourinho\u2019s defence-first strategy in big games has condemned one of their most creative players to long periods at the periphery. His insistence that Alli play primarily in the final third has raised his goal output while arguably diminishing his overall influence. And his decision to criticise Alli publicly risks fracturing the confidence of a player who, for all the brash confidence of his public persona, is a good deal more introspective than many give him credit for. One could equally argue, of course, that Alli is the sort of player who requires the occasional rocket. That was certainly the view of Pochettino, who while lionising Alli in public often felt the need to point out his shortcomings in private. And the brainless coronavirus joke he posted to his Snapchat a couple of weeks ago was hardly the act of a player ready to take on greater responsibility. Alli will be 24 in a couple of months and should theoretically be entering his peak years. Instead he is still trying to sustain the jet-propelled promise of his early career, his place in England\u2019s Euro 2020 squad not secure. Perhaps it was this essential tension that found its explosive outlet on Wednesday night. Those who interpreted Alli\u2019s reaction to being substituted purely as an expression of brattish petulance are perhaps guilty of ignoring what came next. After sitting down he buried his head in his hands and then pulled his shirt over his face, blind wrath giving way to quiet devastation. It was in many ways a crushingly human moment, the point at which the dreams and unfettered ambition of youth seemed to collide head-on with the severe reality of playing up front in a team with 37% possession. Alli\u2019s mercurial talents have always been as much curse as gift. And there is perhaps a broader question: whether players are ultimately responsible for their performances and output or whether they are inextricably bound by circumstances: the team around them, the culture and ambience of the club, the tactics and strategy being pursued. Put more simply: does Mourinho have anything more to offer Alli than mind games? Or is he, to all purposes, on his own?",

The screen over the catwalk projected a virtual audience made of different Donatella Versaces \u2013 the high priestess of the brand. This time, however, there was a difference.

      "bodyText": "In recent seasons, the Versace womenswear show has been an all-out display and celebration of femininity \u2013 with Jennifer Lopez and supermodels populating the catwalk, breaking the internet in the process. The autumn/winter 2020 show, on Friday evening in Milan, seemed to continue on a theme. The screen over the catwalk projected a virtual audience made of different Donatella Versaces \u2013 the high priestess of the brand. This time, however, there was a difference. Once the screen faded to black, the show began \u2013 and it introduced men. This was the first time the brand has featured an equal number of men and women on the catwalk, moving towards the idea of dressing beyond gender. In theory, anyway. There was some crossover in design \u2013 suiting for both men and women, and some more streetwear-influenced pieces including wide-leg trousers and bomber jackets that typically feature across the wardrobes of men and women.

With members\u2019 ballots due to start arriving on Monday, Long-Bailey used a speech in Peterborough to argue that a promise to build at least 100,000 local authority homes for social rent per year would help \u201clay the foundations of aspirational socialism\u201d. She said: \u201cSo if you want millions of people to realise their dream of a secure, quality home in their community that doesn\u2019t cost the earth and you want Labour to proudly argue for a council house building boom, then I\u2019m your woman.\u201d A press release about the speech noted that while Long-Bailey had backed this idea, it was not included in a list of 10 pledges released by Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 widely seen as the favourite to win the contest. A spokesman for Starmer said he had \u201cset out his commitment to a new generation of council and social homes in every community\u201d, and that he had been nominated for leader by the Labour Housing Group, the affiliated party organisation focusing on the subject. The challenge to Starmer and the third candidate, Lisa Nandy, highlights what some in Labour argue is the start of a more personal approach to the contest from Long-Bailey\u2019s camp, and more particularly from some of her allies on the left of the party. In recent days, Starmer has faced a series of direct attacks from Long-Bailey\u2019s backers. A social media video by a Corbynite news website, Novara Media, accused Starmer of coming from a \u201cshifty, evasive\u201d strain of Labour politics, and of stoking \u201crightwing moral panics\u201d as director of public prosecutions.

On Friday, Momentum launched an appeal for \u00a345 donations from supporters to finance \u201ca laser-guided viral video ad\u201d to send to every Labour member, in an attempt counter a mass mailshot from Starmer.

Yvonne took the key. And they barely spoke for 12 years.</p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t have parents. That\u2019s how I feel\u2019</h2> <p>The armageddon refers to his mum\u2019s strong Jehovah\u2019s Witness beliefs about the sinfulness of homosexuality. It had been drilled into him from childhood \u2013 when he\u2019d been banned from celebrating birthdays or Christmas, banned from having friends outside the faith and sent door to door in Toowoomba to preach biblical messages: men who lie with men shan\u2019t inherit God\u2019s kingdom. \u201cI was lonely and depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cI prayed constantly to God to ease those crushing feelings. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The hiatus ended with the 2017 Australian reality TV show Bride and Prejudice<em>,</em> in which<a href=\"https://youtu.be/nosfH9c7Ulg?t=570\"> a newly hopeful Chris revealed to his parents</a> he had met the love of his life, Grant. On national TV, he asked if they would attend the wedding, which would happen in Grant\u2019s native Florida. Australian marriage equality had not yet been achieved.</p> <p>In possibly one of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NTDjAa_aV0\">most chilling pieces of Australian TV ever recorded</a>, his parents refused to attend his wedding. When a calm Chris tries reasoning with them, asking if they\u2019ll at least meet his fianc\u00e9 Grant, his mum says: \u201cNo we really don\u2019t want any part of that. And we\u2019d like you to respect that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nosfH9c7Ulg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nosfH9c7Ulg?start=570&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=570\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The camera pans in on Chris in the immediate aftermath of their disowning. Fighting back tears he eventually says: \u201cI don\u2019t have parents. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p> <p>The fallout was seismic. The clip of their refusal went viral. To this day, three years on, Chris, now 42, receives messages about it, 99% of which are supportive of him.</p> <p>But his parents received different messages. \u201cThey had a listed number,\u201d Chris says. \u201cPeople found them and were leaving death threats.\u201d He started reading comments below articles about the episode. \u201cI remember one said about my mum, \u2018this has to be one of the most hated parents in Australia.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Chris, sadly, isn\u2019t alone in his story of parental rejection.</p> <h2>The facade of equality</h2> <p>At the time I interviewed him,<a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/11/29/being-gay-itaberli-lozano-mother-sentenced-killing-stabbing-own-son-hired-hitmen-brazil/\"> a Brazilian mother who killed her teenage son for being gay</a> is sentenced to 25 years in prison. Tatiana Ferreira Lozano Pereira hired two hitmen who beat, but refused to kill her son, so she stabbed him to death herself with a kitchen knife. She and her husband then took his body to a cane field and set it on fire. His remains were found a week later.</p> <p>Even in countries with same-sex marriage, the facade of equality is exploded. At the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.akt.org.uk/news/akt-yougov\">YouGov polling </a>for British charity the Albert Kennedy Trust found that a quarter of adults would not be proud if their child came out. One in 10 would feel uncomfortable living at home with their child if they came out as LGBT.</p> <p>Celebrity stories of heartbreaking parental rejection are also emerging.</p> <p>In November, the American author and producer Robyn Crawford released a book confirming she had had a romantic relationship with Whitney Houston \u2013 but had to abandon it out of fear of the repercussions from Houston\u2019s mother.</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GQMfZpfp288\">Asked by Oprah Winfrey</a> if it would have bothered her if her daughter was gay, Cissy Houston said \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Shocked, Winfrey clarifies: you would not have liked that?</p> <p>\u201cNot at all\u201d is Cissy\u2019s retort, fired back barely before the question has concluded.</p> <p>Actor Miriam Margolyes told the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly<em> </em>of her own experiences in 2018: \u201cFor my deeply conventional parents to have a lesbian daughter would\u2019ve been a nightmare ...

Chris refused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think that was a real arsehole move. The woman was dying. I probably could have done that. I feel bad about that.\u201d</p> <p>Yvonne died days later, 10 minutes before her son arrived on a second trip back to the family\u2019s Sunshine Coast home from Sydney, where he now lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She found the community she craved.

I felt completely alone.\u201d The next day Yvonne requested her son meet her at a cafe. Rather than the hug, the reassurance he needed, she said words that burn into Chris to this day. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen a very difficult life Chris,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be very lonely. You\u2019ll have no friends. And your health is at risk.\u201d And with that, she requested he return to her the key to the family home. As he removed the key from its keyring and slid it across the table, in disbelief, Chris said: \u201cOne day, on your deathbed, your one regret will be you disowned the son who does all the right things, awaiting an armageddon that never came.\u201d That was in 2004. Yvonne took the key. And they barely spoke for 12 years. \u2018I don\u2019t have parents. That\u2019s how I feel\u2019 The armageddon refers to his mum\u2019s strong Jehovah\u2019s Witness beliefs about the sinfulness of homosexuality. It had been drilled into him from childhood \u2013 when he\u2019d been banned from celebrating birthdays or Christmas, banned from having friends outside the faith and sent door to door in Toowoomba to preach biblical messages: men who lie with men shan\u2019t inherit God\u2019s kingdom. \u201cI was lonely and depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cI prayed constantly to God to ease those crushing feelings. He didn\u2019t.\u201d The hiatus ended with the 2017 Australian reality TV show Bride and Prejudice, in which a newly hopeful Chris revealed to his parents he had met the love of his life, Grant. On national TV, he asked if they would attend the wedding, which would happen in Grant\u2019s native Florida. Australian marriage equality had not yet been achieved. In possibly one of the most chilling pieces of Australian TV ever recorded, his parents refused to attend his wedding. When a calm Chris tries reasoning with them, asking if they\u2019ll at least meet his fianc\u00e9 Grant, his mum says: \u201cNo we really don\u2019t want any part of that. And we\u2019d like you to respect that.\u201d The camera pans in on Chris in the immediate aftermath of their disowning. Fighting back tears he eventually says: \u201cI don\u2019t have parents. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d The fallout was seismic. The clip of their refusal went viral. To this day, three years on, Chris, now 42, receives messages about it, 99% of which are supportive of him. But his parents received different messages. \u201cThey had a listed number,\u201d Chris says. \u201cPeople found them and were leaving death threats.\u201d He started reading comments below articles about the episode. \u201cI remember one said about my mum, \u2018this has to be one of the most hated parents in Australia.\u2019\u201d Chris, sadly, isn\u2019t alone in his story of parental rejection. The facade of equality At the time I interviewed him, a Brazilian mother who killed her teenage son for being gay is sentenced to 25 years in prison. Tatiana Ferreira Lozano Pereira hired two hitmen who beat, but refused to kill her son, so she stabbed him to death herself with a kitchen knife. She and her husband then took his body to a cane field and set it on fire. His remains were found a week later. Even in countries with same-sex marriage, the facade of equality is exploded. At the end of last year, YouGov polling for British charity the Albert Kennedy Trust found that a quarter of adults would not be proud if their child came out. One in 10 would feel uncomfortable living at home with their child if they came out as LGBT. Celebrity stories of heartbreaking parental rejection are also emerging. In November, the American author and producer Robyn Crawford released a book confirming she had had a romantic relationship with Whitney Houston \u2013 but had to abandon it out of fear of the repercussions from Houston\u2019s mother. Asked by Oprah Winfrey if it would have bothered her if her daughter was gay, Cissy Houston said \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Shocked, Winfrey clarifies: you would not have liked that? \u201cNot at all\u201d is Cissy\u2019s retort, fired back barely before the question has concluded. Actor Miriam Margolyes told the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly of her own experiences in 2018: \u201cFor my deeply conventional parents to have a lesbian daughter would\u2019ve been a nightmare ... I told my mother and it totally upset her. She told my father and they were horrified and appalled.\u201d \u201cI agonised over it because my natural way was to tell her everything. I regret that I told her because she was somebody who couldn\u2019t receive that news ... three days later, she had a stroke. I think that\u2019s why she had the stroke and that coloured the whole of our lives until she died seven years later.\u201d Miriam cared for her mother until her death. The filial ties, even under the circumstances of rejection, remain strong. \u2018A big step forward\u2019 Such was the case with Chris, whose mother Yvonne was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year. They hadn\u2019t spoken since 2017\u2019s Bride and Prejudice. \u201cI was still resentful,\u201d Chris admits. \u201cBut I went to Queensland to see her.\u201d Once there, Yvonne invited him to take any family photos he wanted. \u201cThose photos suddenly stop when I\u2019m 18.\u201d His bedridden mother asked him for a hug, telling him she loved him. Chris refused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think that was a real arsehole move. The woman was dying. I probably could have done that. I feel bad about that.\u201d Yvonne died days later, 10 minutes before her son arrived on a second trip back to the family\u2019s Sunshine Coast home from Sydney, where he now lives. Today, Chris is keen to convey the complexity of the woman dubbed Australia\u2019s most hated parent. Yvonne grew up in a single parent family and her mother had a series of partners. One of those partners abused Yvonne, then 15. \u201cMy grandmother sent her to a convent,\u201d Chris says. \u201cTo protect her by getting her away from him.\u201d Some \u201cwild child\u201d teenage years followed, culminating in a pregnancy aged 17. \u201cShe even worked in Brisbane\u2019s gay bar,\u201d Chris says. \u201cShe found the Jehovah\u2019s Witness Church because her life was out of control.\u201d \u201cShe found the community she craved. Just as I found mine.\u201d Since Yvonne\u2019s death in August, something surprising has happened. \u201cStrangely it\u2019s brought our family closer together,\u201d Chris says. \u201cMum was such a matriarch \u2013 it was her way or the highway.\u201d \u201cWhen she was sick, I was up there for two weeks, and me and dad sat there every night drinking and just talking. We\u2019d never done that.\u201d Chris, who has remained stoic throughout the interview, has paused. As I look up, I see tears flowing down his face and he\u2019s almost too choked to get the next words out. Then he does. \u201cAt her funeral, they listed her immediate family and they included my husband, Grant.\u201d \u201cThen dad gave Grant a big hug,\u201d he says, taking a deep breath, \u201cand he said: \u2018Grant, thanks for looking after my son.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt was such a big step forward.\u201d Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78",

Exuberant, bright, energetic, in his own culture he is special. A healer, a hunter, speaking three languages, he was born with a memory of the ancestors. \u201cHistory,\u201d he says, \u201cin my blood it runs.\u201d</p> <p>But history runs into him, too, at a transitional point in his life as he negotiates two worlds. Not only has he inherited an ancient history but also a recent history; grandparents and great grandparents being removed under the assimilation policy, generational trauma, pain. At 10 he was becoming aware of how that sat alongside the richness of the culture his grandmother was teaching him at home. </p> <p>In the film he stands on top of that ridge and looks down at the big houses on the other side. He sees the disparity. \u201cHow come those people have got clean houses and not us? They got a good front, good neighbours. I wish I had one of those houses.\u201d</p> <p>At a mainstream Australian school, Dujuan is set up to fail from the moment he walks through the door. He is expected to learn in another language with a curriculum that holds no relevance or meaning for him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dujuan\u2019s story is unique but it also is not \u2013 it is a reality for so many first nations children in the Northern Territory.</p> <footer> <cite>Maya Newell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is disengaged, bored, doesn\u2019t want to be there. So he isn\u2019t; truanting, running away, running wild, determined \u201cto be free\u201d; going out at late at night with older boys, while his mother and grandmother drive around looking for him. His mother, Megan, receives a letter warning her that her welfare payments could be cut off if her children are not at school. In spite of his obvious intelligence, his school report brings only Es, making him think there is something wrong with him, a problem.</p> <p>At 10 his rebellion and high spirits are still innocent, but he stands before a dangerous path. He is old enough to go to juvenile detention, the precursor to a life in and out of prison; to becoming just another statistic, another wasted life (100% of the inmates in Alice Springs\u2019 juvenile detention centres are Indigenous). Footage of what happened to Dylan Voller at the Don Dale Detention Centre is on television, but he still ignores the last chance his headmistress at school has given him and is expelled. As his spark dims, the only time he is that joyful child again is when the family are out on country at Sandy Bore.</p> <p>But Dujuan is lucky. His mother and grandmothers are prepared to fight for him and his future \u2013 and the future of all Aboriginal children \u2013 before another generation is lost. His own grandmothers are among the grandparents and families leading the charge of a new network of first nations educators from 15 nations \u2013 with their own languages \u2013 across the territory, designing their own education system, in which children are taught on country two days a week. Some of them, such as native title holder and elder Felicity Hayes, are western-trained teachers, Arrernte translators and educators, others are cultural professors of their own languages and culture. \u201cEducation that is hidden, silenced and undervalued in our western centric schooling system,\u201d Newell says.</p> <p> \u201cDujuan\u2019s story is unique but it also is not \u2013 it is a reality for so many first nations children in the territory,\u201d Newell says. \u201cWe have got children who are confident in their first language, they know their country, they know their songlines, they are supported by loving, caring families. And often when they enter the education system they are told that they are failures at school. So we felt that there was a story about how we measure success and how the Australian school system privileges only western world views, and that is seen so much here in the territory.\u201d </p> <p> William Tilmouth, former chair of Atsic, was a stolen child who grew up on a mission at Crokers Island. He was CEO of Tangentyere Council, which included Larapinta Valley town camp when it was known \u201cduring the intervention as the murder capital of the world because of the alcoholism, violence and murder rate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn the advice of an old man who said the best way to teach kids is to sit them down with grandparents and learn together, we ran programs in the town camp. And what we noticed when we started was that the violence dropped, the alcoholism dropped, the participation in the centre increased dramatically. People were turning up when they weren\u2019t supposed to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0e838f8d36ccb351a906cdcaf069ba5f55bb0d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0e838f8d36ccb351a906cdcaf069ba5f55bb0d4/0_0_3456_5184/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dujuan Hoosan\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the documentary In My Blood It Runs, Dujuan Hoosan stands on top of a ridge and sees big houses on the other side. \u2018How come those people have got clean houses and not us?\u2019 he asks. \u2018They got a good front, good neighbours. I wish I had one of those houses.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhett Hammerton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He teamed up with Jane Vadiveloo, who has spent decades leading reform in the territory, and founded Children\u2019s Ground, a place of teaching children in their own language and culture.</p> <p>\u201cWe absolutely believe that this is the structure that holds the solutions because it comes from 65,000 years and more,\u201d Vadiveloo says. \u201cAnd all the systems exist, education systems, health systems, all of them still exist but they are not understood and seen by the mainstream. Our kids need to be in an education system where they are going to succeed and be confident. What Aboriginal child is going to thrive in an environment that doesn\u2019t recognise their identity and culture? Or their history? Somehow there is an assumption that Aboriginal children have a deficit and you need to fix it.\u201d</p> <p> As elder and Dujuan\u2019s grandmother Margaret Turner says: \u201cThey are always telling us to make our kids ready for school, but when are they going to make schools ready for our children?\u201d </p> <p>Vadiveloo believes Aboriginal children don\u2019t feel emotionally or culturally safe at mainstream school, something she learned from working in prisons and talking to the inmates. \u201cThey failed school because they were sitting in an environment with a whole lot of trauma in their head with someone who doesn\u2019t understand them. They are getting told they are good at being a run-amok and so that is what they become.\u201d</p> <p>As the recent Close the Gap report \u2013 and every Close the Gap report \u2013 shows, these are some of the most disadvantaged people in the country; infant mortality, health issues, poverty, chronic unemployment, a close family member in prison. One young mother tells Guardian Australia they just can\u2019t get jobs in Alice Springs. But they all say their children are beautiful; full of joy and potential.</p> <p>In the 25-year Children\u2019s Ground plan, elders lead the organisation and the Arrernte curriculum, including learning on country and inter-generational teaching. There are also trained western teachers. \u201cIn order to survive in this country for the amount of time we have,\u201d Tilmouth says, \u201cwe had some education system there. And the grandfather was never far from the grandchild because the grandparents have direct responsibility for the wellbeing of that child.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our kids need to be in an education system where they are going to succeed and be confident.</p> <footer> <cite>Jane Vadiveloo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the staffroom of Children\u2019s Grounds in Alice Springs, it is clear from a whiteboard and what is on the walls that this place is child-centred. \u201cIt is around communities, families and the child. The child is at the centre,\u201d Tilmouth says. \u201cEverything satellites around that child; being on country, doing and exploring, and then as you come in you have got the social, your body, your culture, your learning mind.\u201d</p> <p>The program is ambitious. \u201cOur goal and agenda is for reform of policy and practise nationally,\u201d Vadiveloo says. \u201cWe are supporting a national network of first nations educators across 15 different nations. And we will be working with government to recognise Aboriginal education systems.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment there are only the funds for early childhood education. Tilmouth would like to take it through primary, high school and university. \u201cFrom birth to 25, we are not here for the short term.\u201d Too many children drop out of high school, if they even get there in the first place. Not finishing high school is the norm here.</p> <p>Vadiveloo believes that \u201cif somebody gave us $20m we would have early childhood and primary and secondary right now<strong>. </strong>We would have kids who are currently not in school coming back into education, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d<strong> </strong>Tilmouth shakes his shaggy head. \u201cThe amount of money they spend on jails and prisons and out-of-home care, it is massive, but they don\u2019t spend money on prevention.\u201d </p> <p>Vadiveloo says Aboriginal children are committing suicide because they are being forced to live in two worlds.</p> <p>\u201cWe are saying it is not two worlds, it is a single world where Aboriginal children have the right to be Aboriginal children, and enjoy the global opportunities around them. They will have the opportunity to learn and grow and be educated in their first language and culture. But families want their kids to learn English, numeracy, literacy, music, art, digital technologies \u2013 like any parent. And the outcome will be economic independence, but absolutely secure in their identity and their rights.\u201d</p> <p>Since he co-founded the program, it has grown organically, Tilmouth says. \u201cOnce the resources become available, we will fill the need as needed and follow the aspirations of people where they want to take their lives.\u201d Ultimately, he says, \u201cit is about taking the chains off to realise their aspirations and take their place in Australian society, as it should be\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all aspire to the same things, no matter what culture you are in: to have a healthy life, have a nice house, have a job, dad\u2019s working, mum\u2019s working. Whatever people aspire to, it is the same thing.\u201d</p>",

I felt like a problem.\u201d But this is not how he feels when he\u2019s on country. \u201cI feel strong when I am learning my culture from my elders and my land.\u201d In My Blood It Runs first captured this strength back when the Arrernte/Garrwa boy was 10 years old in Hidden Valley town camp. Exuberant, bright, energetic, in his own culture he is special. A healer, a hunter, speaking three languages, he was born with a memory of the ancestors. \u201cHistory,\u201d he says, \u201cin my blood it runs.\u201d But history runs into him, too, at a transitional point in his life as he negotiates two worlds. Not only has he inherited an ancient history but also a recent history; grandparents and great grandparents being removed under the assimilation policy, generational trauma, pain. At 10 he was becoming aware of how that sat alongside the richness of the culture his grandmother was teaching him at home. In the film he stands on top of that ridge and looks down at the big houses on the other side. He sees the disparity. \u201cHow come those people have got clean houses and not us? They got a good front, good neighbours. I wish I had one of those houses.\u201d At a mainstream Australian school, Dujuan is set up to fail from the moment he walks through the door. He is expected to learn in another language with a curriculum that holds no relevance or meaning for him. He is disengaged, bored, doesn\u2019t want to be there. So he isn\u2019t; truanting, running away, running wild, determined \u201cto be free\u201d; going out at late at night with older boys, while his mother and grandmother drive around looking for him. His mother, Megan, receives a letter warning her that her welfare payments could be cut off if her children are not at school. In spite of his obvious intelligence, his school report brings only Es, making him think there is something wrong with him, a problem. At 10 his rebellion and high spirits are still innocent, but he stands before a dangerous path. He is old enough to go to juvenile detention, the precursor to a life in and out of prison; to becoming just another statistic, another wasted life (100% of the inmates in Alice Springs\u2019 juvenile detention centres are Indigenous). Footage of what happened to Dylan Voller at the Don Dale Detention Centre is on television, but he still ignores the last chance his headmistress at school has given him and is expelled. As his spark dims, the only time he is that joyful child again is when the family are out on country at Sandy Bore. But Dujuan is lucky. His mother and grandmothers are prepared to fight for him and his future \u2013 and the future of all Aboriginal children \u2013 before another generation is lost. His own grandmothers are among the grandparents and families leading the charge of a new network of first nations educators from 15 nations \u2013 with their own languages \u2013 across the territory, designing their own education system, in which children are taught on country two days a week. Some of them, such as native title holder and elder Felicity Hayes, are western-trained teachers, Arrernte translators and educators, others are cultural professors of their own languages and culture. \u201cEducation that is hidden, silenced and undervalued in our western centric schooling system,\u201d Newell says. \u201cDujuan\u2019s story is unique but it also is not \u2013 it is a reality for so many first nations children in the territory,\u201d Newell says. \u201cWe have got children who are confident in their first language, they know their country, they know their songlines, they are supported by loving, caring families. And often when they enter the education system they are told that they are failures at school. So we felt that there was a story about how we measure success and how the Australian school system privileges only western world views, and that is seen so much here in the territory.\u201d William Tilmouth, former chair of Atsic, was a stolen child who grew up on a mission at Crokers Island. He was CEO of Tangentyere Council, which included Larapinta Valley town camp when it was known \u201cduring the intervention as the murder capital of the world because of the alcoholism, violence and murder rate\u201d. \u201cOn the advice of an old man who said the best way to teach kids is to sit them down with grandparents and learn together, we ran programs in the town camp. And what we noticed when we started was that the violence dropped, the alcoholism dropped, the participation in the centre increased dramatically. People were turning up when they weren\u2019t supposed to.\u201d He teamed up with Jane Vadiveloo, who has spent decades leading reform in the territory, and founded Children\u2019s Ground, a place of teaching children in their own language and culture. \u201cWe absolutely believe that this is the structure that holds the solutions because it comes from 65,000 years and more,\u201d Vadiveloo says. \u201cAnd all the systems exist, education systems, health systems, all of them still exist but they are not understood and seen by the mainstream. Our kids need to be in an education system where they are going to succeed and be confident. What Aboriginal child is going to thrive in an environment that doesn\u2019t recognise their identity and culture? Or their history? Somehow there is an assumption that Aboriginal children have a deficit and you need to fix it.\u201d As elder and Dujuan\u2019s grandmother Margaret Turner says: \u201cThey are always telling us to make our kids ready for school, but when are they going to make schools ready for our children?\u201d Vadiveloo believes Aboriginal children don\u2019t feel emotionally or culturally safe at mainstream school, something she learned from working in prisons and talking to the inmates. \u201cThey failed school because they were sitting in an environment with a whole lot of trauma in their head with someone who doesn\u2019t understand them. They are getting told they are good at being a run-amok and so that is what they become.\u201d As the recent Close the Gap report \u2013 and every Close the Gap report \u2013 shows, these are some of the most disadvantaged people in the country; infant mortality, health issues, poverty, chronic unemployment, a close family member in prison. One young mother tells Guardian Australia they just can\u2019t get jobs in Alice Springs. But they all say their children are beautiful; full of joy and potential. In the 25-year Children\u2019s Ground plan, elders lead the organisation and the Arrernte curriculum, including learning on country and inter-generational teaching. There are also trained western teachers. \u201cIn order to survive in this country for the amount of time we have,\u201d Tilmouth says, \u201cwe had some education system there. And the grandfather was never far from the grandchild because the grandparents have direct responsibility for the wellbeing of that child.\u201d In the staffroom of Children\u2019s Grounds in Alice Springs, it is clear from a whiteboard and what is on the walls that this place is child-centred. \u201cIt is around communities, families and the child. The child is at the centre,\u201d Tilmouth says. \u201cEverything satellites around that child; being on country, doing and exploring, and then as you come in you have got the social, your body, your culture, your learning mind.\u201d The program is ambitious. \u201cOur goal and agenda is for reform of policy and practise nationally,\u201d Vadiveloo says. \u201cWe are supporting a national network of first nations educators across 15 different nations. And we will be working with government to recognise Aboriginal education systems.\u201d At the moment there are only the funds for early childhood education. Tilmouth would like to take it through primary, high school and university. \u201cFrom birth to 25, we are not here for the short term.\u201d Too many children drop out of high school, if they even get there in the first place. Not finishing high school is the norm here. Vadiveloo believes that \u201cif somebody gave us $20m we would have early childhood and primary and secondary right now. We would have kids who are currently not in school coming back into education, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Tilmouth shakes his shaggy head. \u201cThe amount of money they spend on jails and prisons and out-of-home care, it is massive, but they don\u2019t spend money on prevention.\u201d Vadiveloo says Aboriginal children are committing suicide because they are being forced to live in two worlds. \u201cWe are saying it is not two worlds, it is a single world where Aboriginal children have the right to be Aboriginal children, and enjoy the global opportunities around them. They will have the opportunity to learn and grow and be educated in their first language and culture. But families want their kids to learn English, numeracy, literacy, music, art, digital technologies \u2013 like any parent. And the outcome will be economic independence, but absolutely secure in their identity and their rights.\u201d Since he co-founded the program, it has grown organically, Tilmouth says. \u201cOnce the resources become available, we will fill the need as needed and follow the aspirations of people where they want to take their lives.\u201d Ultimately, he says, \u201cit is about taking the chains off to realise their aspirations and take their place in Australian society, as it should be\u201d. \u201cWe all aspire to the same things, no matter what culture you are in: to have a healthy life, have a nice house, have a job, dad\u2019s working, mum\u2019s working. Whatever people aspire to, it is the same thing.\u201d",

This seems a strange kind of dissonance.</p> <p>The election result last May tells us most voters prioritised their immediate economic security over climate action, which leads me to an obvious conclusion: climate action will not happen in Australia unless the debate shifts, and shifts compellingly, to an economic frame.

I think a number of progressive people who are now fully sold on the need for climate action fail to grasp something that is now pretty obvious. The truth is many voters remain unpersuaded. Australians report they are worried about climate change. Poll after poll tells us Australians are becoming more anxious about a lack of action. But a majority are not voting for climate action. They are prioritising other things. This seems a strange kind of dissonance. The election result last May tells us most voters prioritised their immediate economic security over climate action, which leads me to an obvious conclusion: climate action will not happen in Australia unless the debate shifts, and shifts compellingly, to an economic frame. Logically, that process starts with mapping out how decarbonisation intersects with future job prospects; it starts with answering a basic question \u2013 what options does this transformation give me? The climate debate in Australia has of course touched on these themes, but there has been no cut through narration by either of the major parties, largely because nobody in major party politics has the guts to say the safety of the planet means fossil fuels are on the way out, and because the whole system has been obsessed with either targets and mechanisms, or with gothic intrigue, like whether the latent communist Malcolm Turnbull has somehow snuck back in to lead the Liberal party, or whether Anthony Albanese looked sideways at a coalminer. So targets are really important. Policy mechanisms also remain critically important. But nothing lasts if voters fear the future. So here is my question: who in politics has the guts to navigate Australia out of climate change Groundhog Day by being honest about what this transition actually means?",

      "bodyText": "The Great Barrier Reef could be about to experience its most widespread outbreak of mass coral bleaching ever seen, according to an analysis from the US government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But the analysis, seen by Guardian Australia, says while bleaching could hit the entire length of the world heritage-listed reef, the impacts may not be as intense as previous major outbreaks. Pockets of bleaching are being seen in areas including Lizard Island, north of Cooktown, and more than 1,100 kilometres south-east at Heron Island, off Gladstone. On Thursday, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, conservationists and scientists warned that heat stress was building along most of the 2,300-kilometre reef along Queensland\u2019s north coast. Temperatures would need to drop from current levels over the next two weeks if the reef was to avoid a third mass bleaching event in five years. Dr William Skirving, of Noaa\u2019s Coral Reef Watch, prepared a briefing on the \u201cstatus of heat stress on the GBR\u201d on 19 February. The agency\u2019s observations and model forecasts suggested that \u201c2020 is likely to be the most extensive coral bleaching event that we have seen so far\u201d on the reef. He told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe are pretty confident that it\u2019s likely there will be bleaching right up and down the reef and you will find very few reefs that don\u2019t have some bleaching.\u201d While bleaching would be extensive, the intensity of the heat may not reach previous major bleaching events, Skirving said. In 2016 and 2017, back-to-back bleaching killed about half the reef\u2019s corals. He said: \u201cI\u2019m expecting a bit of mortality but I don\u2019t think this will get to the levels where we have seen large-scale mortality.\u201d Corals bleach if they sit in unusually warm waters for long periods. The algae that provides food and the coral\u2019s colour separate from the animal, leaving behind a visible white skeleton. Severe bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. Extreme heat can also kill corals almost immediately. Skirving\u2019s analysis identified a key period from 26 February to 4 March when widespread bleaching was likely to hit. During this time, tides would be weak, meaning there was less mixing of the waters that help dissipate heat through the water column. At the same time, the unusually high ocean temperatures would remain. He said: \u201cWe will see temperatures rocket through through that period. But if it does get really bad is yet to be seen \u2013 it depends on rain and wind \u2013 and neither of those can be precisely predicted.\u201d His analysis said only a significant weather event \u201csuch as a cyclone\u201d during that eight-day period would save the reef from widespread bleaching. The world\u2019s oceans have taken up about 93% of the extra energy caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to the UN\u2019s climate science panel. According to the panel, it had high confidence that tropical coral reefs \u201care projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2\u00b0C [of global warming], with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.\u201d Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a marine biologist at the University of Queensland, whose early work helped to explain the link between coral bleaching and climate change, said in the past two weeks, \u201cthe risk factors for major bleaching events, like elevated water temperatures\u201d had \u201cincreased dramatically\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Many of us dream of moving into a heritage building. But Olive Ryan didn\u2019t \u2013 even before she saw the ghosts. Monte Cristo Homestead, the huge Victorian house built by pastoralist Christopher Crawley in 1884, had fallen into disrepair when Olive\u2019s husband Reginald fell in love with it during a trip to Junee, New South Wales, in the mid-1950s. But it took him eight years to convince the owners to sell. \u201cAll the time we waited,\u201d says Olive. \u201cI used to hope it would fall down \u2013 but, 57 years later, I\u2019m still here.\u201d With three daughters in tow \u2013 and Olive five months pregnant with a fourth \u2013 the Ryans camped in the ruined dining room, sleeping on blow-up beds and eating at a picnic table. \u201cThe wind used to howl down the staircase,\u201d the now 89-year-old remembers. \u201cAnd the bats used to fly in.\u201d When, soon after their arrival, they returned late from town, Reginald stopped the car suddenly on the drive. \u201cIt looked like there was a light coming out of every window, even though there wasn\u2019t a pane of glass in the place. I said to my husband, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go up there!\u2019\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where we are living now.\u2019 \u201cAnd by the time we got up there, all the lights had gone out!\u201d Today, the homestead is beautifully restored, decked out with high-quality period furniture. Olive\u2019s son Lawrence, who manages Monte Cristo, says the old building requires constant attention. He operates a bed and breakfast there, and runs ghost tours for visitors. \u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of being in a place like this. You get to share it with world.\u201d As for Olive, the occasional spook doesn\u2019t bother her now. Lawrence says: \u201c\u2018Oh, yes. Mum still sees things in here or hears a name called out. But she chooses not to believe because she has to be here by herself sometimes. And she reckons that\u2019s better than having to think about it too much.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just carry on until I kick the bucket,\u201d Olive says. The high life Victorian Trades Hall in Melbourne contains its share of spectres but Matt Kunkel, who lives in a two-bedroom cottage on its roof, has never seen the woman said to haunt the corridor below his house (though he adds, \u2018\u2018My cat does often just stare off into space at things.\u201d) After winning the eight-hour day, the Victorian union movement constructed a wooden Trades Hall and Literary Institute in 1859. The stone edifice dates from 1875, with the \u201cworkers\u2019 parliament\u201d deliberately designed to rival other Melbourne landmarks such as the Town Hall or the State Library. The building always employed a caretaker, a role that the old Watchmen, Caretakers and Cleaners Union defined to allow sleeping (as distinct, Kunkel explains, from the nocturnal vigilance expected from a watchman). Such roles were once common: Trades Hall folklore maintains that previous caretakers used their laundry on the roof to signal relatives working in the same role at the Eastern Hill Fire Station. Marcella Pearce, who wrote of life in the building after her father Joe Bell took the job in 1930, exulted the federation-style cottage as a \u201cpenthouse in the sky\u201d. Kunkel doesn\u2019t go quite that far \u2013 the old structure swelters in summer and stays frigid in winter \u2013 but acknowledges the location can\u2019t be faulted. \u201cI\u2019m living a pretty charmed life.\u201d \u2018My underground home is like a castle\u2019 Some 1,500km away, opal miner John Dunstan feels similarly about his unusual Coober Pedy domicile. \u201cMy underground home is like a castle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s got 50,000 tumble bricks inside. The doorways are all arched. Beautiful! And it stays the same temperature all year round.\u201d Dunstan followed his father into the opal fields of South Australia where he has searched for gems for 54 years. Like most Coober Pedy locals, he lives in a dugout cut from the side of a mountain. \u201cIt goes way back to 1915 when the first miners came here. They were living in tents and little shanties and they found the summers here were way too hot for them. They knew it was nice and cool in the mines. So some of them dug an entrance so they could live there.\u201d Coober Pedy\u2019s underground structures include pubs, churches, motels, bookstores and, of course, homes. Dunstan swears he couldn\u2019t live any other way. \u201cWhen I leave Coober Pedy to go away for a break I feel like a fish out of water because every little street noise here wakes you: cars and bloody sirens and even the birds. In the dugout there\u2019s no sound. Beautiful! It\u2019s dark; it\u2019s cool and quiet. Once you get used to living in an underground house, you would never want to swap.\u201d Cold comforts Tom Dacy also occupies a historic home designed for extreme temperatures. Digital communications at Mawson Station might have eased the isolation of 14-month stint in Antarctica but access to Facebook can\u2019t temper the ferocious weather. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of times throughout the year when the wind has been blowing 100 knots outside and the blizzard is so bad you can\u2019t see that there is no visibility at all,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you\u2019re confined to the one building or to buildings nearby.\u201d Established in 1954, Mawson was added to the commonwealth heritage list in 2004 as the oldest continually occupied station of the Antarctic circle. Dacy, employed as Mawson\u2019s mechanical supervisor, says history is never far away. \u201cWe still see some of the old dog sleds that the guys used to sled up and down the coast.\u201d He describes his own quarters as \u201cjust like any sort of room you\u2019d have in your own house\u201d \u2013 except, of course, for the wonders that surround it. He lists some of them. \u201cBeing able to see emperor penguins up close and personal: they\u2019re just such big, majestic birds. During the middle of winter, the sun goes down for about three weeks and we\u2019re in darkness, with just a bit of twilight. The sunsets in winter, which just look like the whole sky is on fire. And then the aurora lights over the top of the station, flickering and floating like waves.\u201d Not quite ghosts but magical all the same.",

      "bodyText": "With the coronavirus outbreak in China affecting the import and export trade, Australian retailers and suppliers are concerned that consumers will soon start experiencing shortages of products ranging from iPhones to batteries. There are widespread factory shutdowns in China as millions of people remain in lockdown and subject to strict travel restrictions and quarantine measures. While some retailers say it is too soon to see a noticeable impact on stock, with many shipyard and factory workers taking time off for lunar new year anyway, they are preparing for shortages in coming weeks. China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, with major exports including clothing, toys and electronics. Items like blinds and plantation shutters are also in short supply at some companies, with consumers waiting an extra four weeks on orders. Travel Qantas on Thursday announced a major reduction in services, cutting flights to Asia by 16% for at least three months, with flights to Shanghai suspended and those to Hong Kong and Singapore reduced. Its low-cost brand, Jetstar, will likewise reduce its Asia flights by 14% until the end of May, impacting routes to Japan, Thailand and mainland China. Retail Vicinity Centres, landlord for shopping centres throughout the country including DFO Brisbane, the Strand Arcade in Sydney and Chadstone in Melbourne, has downgraded its earning forecast. CEO Grant Kelley said: \u201cAt Vicinity, we have seen a material decline in foot traffic at some of our key centres since late January 2020, particularly where there is a high proportion of international visitors, which in turn is impacting sales. As a result, we are forecasting modest reductions in percentage rent, ancillary income and hotel bookings.\u201d A spokeswoman for supermarket giant Coles said stores were working with suppliers and transport partners to minimise the impact on product availability. But logistics remain challenging, especially through some major ports in Shanghai and Tianjin. \u201cLike most retailers, we have been impacted by the extension of Chinese New Year, which saw factories closed for longer than planned and delays in production due to staff requiring government permits to return to work,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cProducts such as antibacterial hand washes and hand sanitiser products are already low in stock and there are shortages forecast for non-food items like stationery, clothing, and electrical goods.\u201d Coles had also experienced delays in refrigeration equipment being shipped out of China for store renewals. Meat that Coles would usually sell to the Chinese market has been diverted to the other Asian countries that they export to, of which there are around 40. A Woolworths spokesman said there had not been any disruptions to supply or procurement at this stage. A spokeswoman for clothing and stationery brand Cotton On Group, Australia\u2019s largest global retailer, refused to comment. Smartphones Apple said there would be a shortage of products, including iPhones, due to factory closures in China. \u201cWorldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cWhile our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province \u2013 and while all of these facilities have reopened \u2013 they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. \u201cThe health and wellbeing of every person who helps make these products possible is our paramount priority, and we are working in close consultation with our suppliers and public health experts as this continues. These iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide.\u201d Hospitality Australian Retail Association head of public affairs Yale Stephens said while he had not received any reports of supply chain disruptions, the industry was suffering from reduced patronage. \u201cWe are only a month in so whether [supplies chains] change depends how long this crisis goes for and how badly it affects Chinese companies selling to Australian retailers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the hospitality trade is being particularly severely hit, particularly Chinese restaurants, so we are just encouraging people to support those businesses. \u201cThere are livelihoods at stake here: those of the hardworking mums and dads who\u2019ve put everything on the line to open a business, and those of the staff they employ whose jobs are in real danger of being lost. \u201cIf we lose iconic local retailers, or tourist operators offering unique experiences, or loved restaurants and cafes that are forced to close, we won\u2019t get them back \u2013 and that compounds the potential loss here.\u201d Seafood Mark Boulter, executive officer of Safe Sustainable Seafood Australia, said he was not aware of any seafood import shortages to date, but said if the coronavirus event continued for months it would impact on imports from China. \u201cWe are currently organising a round of member meetings and this question will be on the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are currently highly aware of is the impact this situation is having on the domestic seafood sector, both those who are export focused mostly to China and the sectors of the domestic trade that are focused on Asian communities\u2019 desirable species, such as live mud crabs and rock lobsters, and raw prawns.\u201d He said a combination of a low-key summer due to the bushfires and subdued Lunar New Year festivities due to the virus had depressed the demand for seafood over the past few months. \u201cWe have not yet been able to determine the extent of this with our members,\u201d he said. Electronics Gerry Harvey, chief executive of the electrical and household goods retail chain Harvey Norman, refused to comment on whether electronics supplies had been affected. Sony Australia said it was difficult to assess the impact that the health crisis would have on its business. \u201cWe will continue to gather information, and assess the situation closely, taking action to minimise impact wherever possible,\u201d a spokesperson said. Stationery and electronics goods supplier Officeworks would not comment. A Kmart group spokeswoman said so far, supply chain disruptions had been minimal. \u201cOur absolute priority remains ensuring our team are safe and as a precaution, we have suspended all business travel in and out of China and Hong Kong until further notice,\u201d she said. Guardian Australia has also contacted JB Hi-Fi for comment. Medical While products such as hand sanitiser and face masks are in short supply, this is due to significant consumer demand rather than any interruption to supply chains. However, masks are not essential to protect against the virus, which is so far well contained in Australia. On Tuesday evening the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, met with health officials. He said that said apart from sporadic mask shortages there had been no reports of supplies of pharmaceuticals and devices to hospitals being disrupted. Pharmaceutical companies GSK, Janssen, and Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical said there had been no supply impacts as a result of the virus and subsequent business closures in China. A GSK spokeswoman said it was an evolving situation. \u201cWe have supply chain planning in place for our products, which includes measures to secure reliable supply, such as holding strategic stock and dual sourcing,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time, we have adequate stock in place, however this is an evolving situation which we will keep under review.\u201d In a statement, drug company Astra Zeneca said it was working closely with global health authorities. \u201cWe have in place contingency plans to support our operations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn order to protect employees, we have taken a decision at this time to restrict all non-business critical travel to and from China, including Hong Kong.\u201d Medical device and pharmaceutical company Bayer said it was in regular contact with suppliers in China. \u201cCurrently we do not have an impact on production and market supply,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Industrial The world\u2019s biggest miner, BHP, warned demand for resources could be affected. A BHP investor report issued on Tuesday said the disease outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics were key uncertainties for the sector. \u201cIf the viral outbreak is not demonstrably well contained within the March quarter, we expect to revise our expectations for economic and commodity demand growth downwards,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis caveat applies, to varying degrees, across our portfolio and we will continue to monitor. In this regard, we highlight the distinction between a permanent loss of demand in oil due to foregone transport services; and temporary demand losses with the opportunity to be reclaimed, as in steel and copper end-use. We anticipate a net demand loss due to the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in the near term.\u201d With battery cell shortages also predicted, Guardian Australia has contacted Battery Specialties Australia, which supplies household, industrial, automotive and solar batteries, and Solar Juice, a wholesaler of solar panels and components. Solar Juice co-founder and head of supply, Rami Fedda, said in a message on LinkedIn that he was working with two large manufacturers unable book a vessel until later in February or early March. Stock that was ready for shipment prior to Chinese New Year won\u2019t get to the Solar Juice warehouse until March, while the company would be lucky to receive any new stock before April, he said. The next gap in the market could be raw material, where even non-Chinese manufacturers have been warning of delays. \u201cMy best guess if there is an impact it will happen around May for non-Chinese panels.\u201d",

We push responsibility back on women to look after their own safety.</p> <footer> <cite>Angela Lynch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Women\u2019s Legal Service has for several years been calling for a broad review of the police and legal system in relation to victims of domestic and sexual violence. Lynch said the group had also recently called for an audit to better understand the underlying attitudes of frontline police.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a failure in our system to recognise coercive and controlling tactics, especially in the family court system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe push responsibility back on women to look after their own safety. They\u2019re frightened, and it\u2019s a complex system.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch said about 40% of calls to the women\u2019s legal service went unanswered due to resourcing constraints. \u201cNot Now, Not Ever provided a direction for government and a pathway forward, but it\u2019s five years old now and the world changes quickly. It\u2019s quite clear we must use these tragic circumstances as the catalyst for change. We need another taskforce. We need another 140 recommendations. We can\u2019t think what we have already done is enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe have one woman being killed every week in Australia. The situation is still dire for many women.\u201d</p>",

What needs to change? In Queensland the watershed moment for protecting women from domestic abuse was supposed to be the 2015 Not Now, Not Ever report, a document which made 140 recommendations that were all adopted by the government. The state has integrated specialist teams that take on high-risk domestic violence cases, including one in Brisbane. It is unclear whether Clarke was treated as a high-risk victim. Lynch said that program, like all domestic violence services, was reliant on resourcing and that all were \u201cunder enormous stress in relation to their ability to respond\u201d. The Women\u2019s Legal Service has for several years been calling for a broad review of the police and legal system in relation to victims of domestic and sexual violence. Lynch said the group had also recently called for an audit to better understand the underlying attitudes of frontline police. \u201cThere is a failure in our system to recognise coercive and controlling tactics, especially in the family court system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe push responsibility back on women to look after their own safety. They\u2019re frightened, and it\u2019s a complex system.\u201d Lynch said about 40% of calls to the women\u2019s legal service went unanswered due to resourcing constraints. \u201cNot Now, Not Ever provided a direction for government and a pathway forward, but it\u2019s five years old now and the world changes quickly. It\u2019s quite clear we must use these tragic circumstances as the catalyst for change. We need another taskforce. We need another 140 recommendations. We can\u2019t think what we have already done is enough. \u201cWe have one woman being killed every week in Australia. The situation is still dire for many women.\u201d",

Mangroves, like other trees, employ a system of water transport: it is thought evaporation of moisture from their leaves produces a negative pressure in their water-conducting tissues that helps to draw water into their roots and up their trunks. This transport relies on surface tension, the fact that water molecules like to interact with the walls of the tissues, and that water molecules exert a \u201ctug\u201d on each other. Salty water can damage most plants, but mangroves can thrive in salty conditions because they have adaptations including cell membranes that prevent salts from passing through in an uncontrolled manner, as well as cell walls that contain a waxy substance.

I wanted to get him home. But it became evident that if he did recover he would have no quality of life.\u201d On 10 December 2016, 16-year-old Finlay finally did leave Sydney\u2019s Westmead hospital. \u201cI said to Fin \u2018I\u2019m taking you home today\u2019,\u201d Browne said. \u201cHe said \u2018yes Mum\u2019. He died that day with his siblings, myself and my husband all there with him.\u201d Browne, who is a nurse, recounted the tragic lead-up to her son\u2019s death at this week\u2019s hearings, which are examining the experiences of people with cognitive disability in the healthcare system. Opening the session, chair Ronald Sackville said the neglect and abuse experienced by those living with cognitive disabilities should \u201cshock the conscience of all Australians\u201d. He added that the commission would hear about the huge gulf in life expectancy between people with an intellectual disability and the general population. Those in NSW with an intellectual disability lived to an median age of 54, compared with 81 for the general population. Browne told of the dismissive treatment that Finlay, who lived with Down syndrome, had faced as he battled the serious bowel obstruction that would eventually take his life. When she arrived at the emergency department at Bathurst hospital, Browne immediately became anxious about the treatment Finlay was going to receive. \u201cI was holding him up and he collapsed onto the ground into a prone position on his stomach,\u201d Browne said. \u201cThe triage nurse, when I looked up, rolled her eyes, and I thought, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019re not going to get the help we need.\u2019\u201d Once Finlay was admitted, a CT scan had revealed an intestinal obstruction. Finlay was taken into theatre and Browne said she was led to believe her son would be airlifted to Westmead that night. But he wasn\u2019t. Browne was worried about a \u201cdistinct lack of urgency\u201d. Finlay arrived at Westmead the next morning. He would spend the next 71 days there; 65 of them in paediatric intensive care. Choking back tears, Browne told the commission how, as Finlay became sicker, \u201chis ability to make himself heard improved\u201d. \u201cFinlay fought on for 71 more days,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one expected that.\u201d Browne is now fighting for a coronial inquest into Finlay\u2019s death and is awaiting the outcome. Toowoomba woman Toni Mitchell recalled that her difficulties navigating the health system as the mother of a child with disabilities began before her child was even born. When she had an ultrasound in 2000, she was told that her baby had a heart condition and she would probably miscarry in the next few weeks. She was also told \u201cit\u2019s highly likely your son has Down\u2019s syndrome\u201d. Mitchell added: \u201c\u2026 I was still crying. And he finally turned around. He said, \u2018So here\u2019s your appointment for a termination.\u2019 Gave me a piece of paper and walked out. Everybody else walked out. \u201cAnd that was our introduction to it. And it set the whole tone for Joshy\u2019s life. Because in that moment they completely disallowed his life. They said he wasn\u2019t worth living.\u201d Mitchell told the hearing she threw the paper in the bin. Joshua joined his mother at the royal commission this week. Prof Julian Trollor from UNSW told the commission he estimated that about 400 Australians die annually from a potentially avoidable death. UNSW research found 38% of deaths of those with a cognitive disability were from potentially avoidable causes, twice as likely as in the general population. \u201cI know the commissioners have heard quite significant stories and understood them and their impact on people with disability and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cOf every one person who has a tragic outcome of death that the commission will hear, there are many more nationally.\u201d The healthcare system was not equipped to adequately care for people with cognitive disabilities, Trollor said. \u201cThis lack of preparedness manifests on every level \u2013 primary, specialist and acute care settings \u2013 and in services across the lifespan, from childhood to later life,\u201d he said. The commission also heard from Kim Creevey, whose son died in 2015, and Sydney woman and advocate Kylie Scott, who gave evidence about how how doctors should communicate with people with intellectual disability. Scott said it helped her when doctors asked short questions in plain English, spoke clearly, were patient and helped build trust with their patients. Scott also drew attention to the need to assess the mental health and wellbeing of people with Down\u2019s syndrome and for doctors to be across current research. \u201cI want to speak up for people who can\u2019t speak up,\u201d she told the commission. \u201cWe all need to be understood and supported.\u201d Creevey told the commission that a paediatrician had questioned her about the cost of keeping her son alive.

Angered by the loss of their friend, other celebrities have been emboldened to speak up. Laura Whitmore, a friend of Flack who replaced her as Love Island host, filmed a paparazzo who was trying to photograph her with her boyfriend, and posted it to her Twitter feed. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture that has got out of hand, and it\u2019s only by showing it that we can change it,\u201d she explained. \u201cMany in the public eye are scared to speak about their own experiences with the press, because we are \u2018lucky\u2019 to be in the public eye,\u201d Chloe Madeley, a TV presenter and reality TV regular, wrote on Instagram. \u201cEveryone has been warned and intimidated into a corner, and tragedies like this are the result of it.\u201d The celebrity backlash has found support from the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, which has again called for the voluntary regulator Ipso to be replaced, saying: \u201cHad an independent regulator existed the cruel and distressing coverage Caroline Flack endured would at the very least have been properly sanctioned and remedied.\u201d Tempting as it may be to damn the tabloids and gossip sites out of hand, however, celebrity agents, managers and tabloid journalists who spoke to the Guardian described a more complicated picture.

But CTPHQ insisted that the processes in place for handling advice and referrals were designed to protect the public as well as individuals at risk of harm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/prevent-environment-animal-activists-referred-extremism\">Environment and animal rights activists being referred to Prevent programme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rosalind Comyn, Liberty\u2019s policy and campaigns officer, said: \u201cThe Prevent strategy is designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to monitor and report on people in their care. The revelation that those workers could be unwittingly handing children to the police, not knowing the consequences of simply raising a query, reinforces concerns about how Prevent is eroding what should be trusted relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s definition of extremism is so staggeringly broad, it can be used to demonise thousands of people based on what they are perceived to think or believe \u2013 adding to the confusion and pressure public workers face. If you are a Muslim, or person of colour, the perils of Prevent are all too familiar, and it has only served to create further discrimination and division in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>The disclosures come with the independent review of Prevent, a commitment to which was written into legislation, mired in crisis. The review\u2019s chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/19/lord-carlile-prevent-review-legal-challenge\">Lord Carlile, was forced to step down nine weeks ago</a> over allegations regarding his lack of impartiality and the government is yet to appoint a replacement.</p> <p>The strategy has faced renewed scrutiny following revelations in the Guardian that counter-terrorism policing had produced documents used as Prevent resources, which featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/xr-extinction-rebellion-listed-extremist-ideology-police-prevent-scheme-guidance\">nonviolent groups like Extinction Rebellion alongside far-right extremists</a> such as the banned terror group National Action. Some documents have been withdrawn, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/terrorism-police-assessed-extinction-rebellion-earlier-than-thought\">others are to be amended</a>.</p> <p>Dr Rob Faure Walker, a former secondary-school teacher who completed a PhD investigating the impact of counter-extremism discourses in educational settings, said: \u201cPrevent teams do not know the children referred to them, so to learn that the consent of the teacher who does know the child might not be sought is a further indication that Prevent is not designed in the best interests of children.</p> <p>\u201cThis confirms that efforts to brand Prevent as safeguarding are a cynical move to hide the imposition of surveillance on our most important civic institutions.\u201d</p> <p>Walker, who is currently working on a project called Corridors of Power at Soas University of London, which aims to bring expert briefings to parliament on a range of policy issues, said: \u201cThe tragedy of Prevent is that casting teachers and doctors as informants prevents their students and patients from having the conversations that could otherwise act as a pressure release for legitimate grievances.</p> <p>\u201cWhen previously working as a teacher, I always found that children who aired hateful views in class could find legitimate political responses to their frustrations by talking about them.\u201d</p> <p>Liberty criticised CTPHQ for redacting large swathes of the document, which is titled Policy for Prevent Practitioners, including two of the five \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d for Prevent, arguing that objectives for a significant policy like Prevent should always be made public. The Guardian asked officials at CTPHQ to reconsider removing the redactions on the listed objectives, but they declined.</p> <p>The national coordinator for Prevent, Ch Supt Nik Adams, said: \u201cThe Policy for Prevent Practitioners is a restricted document that describes our procedures for handling sensitive information and managing risk.</p> <p>\u201cTo release this document without redactions would be to directly instruct radicalisers and terrorists in how to circumvent policies that we have put in place to manage the intelligence we use to protect vulnerable people from radicalisation, and would thus increase the risk we all face from terrorism.</p> <p>\u201cSurely most people would agree that we must try to make it harder for terrorists to cause harm to this country, not easier.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/26/priti-patel-radicalised-youth-plan-so-flawed-its-mad\">Priti Patel\u2019s plan to tackle radicalised youth is so flawed it\u2019s mad, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cWhen Prevent partners call the police for advice on someone showing signs of vulnerability to radicalisation, it becomes the police\u2019s legal responsibility to make a decision on whether that person is at risk and worthy of a referral.</p> <p>\u201cIf we listen to the circumstances and decide that a referral is inappropriate, then no further action would be taken. But if we believe there to be a risk to someone\u2019s safety, then we would be obligated to take appropriate action to protect the person in question \u2013 just like we would for any other form of grooming.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, if someone called the police with concerns that a child was being groomed for sexual abuse, we would never disregard that child\u2019s safety just because we were asked to. Extremist grooming of child causes significant harm and is no different.\u201d</p> <p>The document does reveal more about the database used by police forces to store the details of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/06/counter-terror-police-are-running-secret-prevent-database\">people who have been referred to Prevent</a>. The Police Case Management Tracker (PCMT) replaced all recording by local authorities on spreadsheets with a national IT system in July 2018, the document says.</p> <p>Information recorded on the database includes \u201cbiographical information, nature of vulnerability, and counter-terror/domestic extremism risks\u201d as well as \u201cany intervention or action by police or a partner\u201d, the guidance reveals.</p> <p>The stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold.</p> <p>Each Prevent referral is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed.</p>",

Counter-terrorism policing headquarters (CTPHQ), which composed the document, confirmed that it does not seek approval or consent to refer an individual, which could include school pupils or medical patients, to Prevent from those who contact them for advice. Critics of Prevent said the revelations provide further evidence that the strategy is for monitoring potential extremists rather than safeguarding vulnerable people from radicalisation. But CTPHQ insisted that the processes in place for handling advice and referrals were designed to protect the public as well as individuals at risk of harm. Rosalind Comyn, Liberty\u2019s policy and campaigns officer, said: \u201cThe Prevent strategy is designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to monitor and report on people in their care. The revelation that those workers could be unwittingly handing children to the police, not knowing the consequences of simply raising a query, reinforces concerns about how Prevent is eroding what should be trusted relationships. \u201cThe government\u2019s definition of extremism is so staggeringly broad, it can be used to demonise thousands of people based on what they are perceived to think or believe \u2013 adding to the confusion and pressure public workers face. If you are a Muslim, or person of colour, the perils of Prevent are all too familiar, and it has only served to create further discrimination and division in our communities.\u201d The disclosures come with the independent review of Prevent, a commitment to which was written into legislation, mired in crisis. The review\u2019s chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down nine weeks ago over allegations regarding his lack of impartiality and the government is yet to appoint a replacement. The strategy has faced renewed scrutiny following revelations in the Guardian that counter-terrorism policing had produced documents used as Prevent resources, which featured nonviolent groups like Extinction Rebellion alongside far-right extremists such as the banned terror group National Action. Some documents have been withdrawn, while others are to be amended. Dr Rob Faure Walker, a former secondary-school teacher who completed a PhD investigating the impact of counter-extremism discourses in educational settings, said: \u201cPrevent teams do not know the children referred to them, so to learn that the consent of the teacher who does know the child might not be sought is a further indication that Prevent is not designed in the best interests of children. \u201cThis confirms that efforts to brand Prevent as safeguarding are a cynical move to hide the imposition of surveillance on our most important civic institutions.\u201d Walker, who is currently working on a project called Corridors of Power at Soas University of London, which aims to bring expert briefings to parliament on a range of policy issues, said: \u201cThe tragedy of Prevent is that casting teachers and doctors as informants prevents their students and patients from having the conversations that could otherwise act as a pressure release for legitimate grievances. \u201cWhen previously working as a teacher, I always found that children who aired hateful views in class could find legitimate political responses to their frustrations by talking about them.\u201d Liberty criticised CTPHQ for redacting large swathes of the document, which is titled Policy for Prevent Practitioners, including two of the five \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d for Prevent, arguing that objectives for a significant policy like Prevent should always be made public. The Guardian asked officials at CTPHQ to reconsider removing the redactions on the listed objectives, but they declined. The national coordinator for Prevent, Ch Supt Nik Adams, said: \u201cThe Policy for Prevent Practitioners is a restricted document that describes our procedures for handling sensitive information and managing risk. \u201cTo release this document without redactions would be to directly instruct radicalisers and terrorists in how to circumvent policies that we have put in place to manage the intelligence we use to protect vulnerable people from radicalisation, and would thus increase the risk we all face from terrorism. \u201cSurely most people would agree that we must try to make it harder for terrorists to cause harm to this country, not easier.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen Prevent partners call the police for advice on someone showing signs of vulnerability to radicalisation, it becomes the police\u2019s legal responsibility to make a decision on whether that person is at risk and worthy of a referral. \u201cIf we listen to the circumstances and decide that a referral is inappropriate, then no further action would be taken. But if we believe there to be a risk to someone\u2019s safety, then we would be obligated to take appropriate action to protect the person in question \u2013 just like we would for any other form of grooming. \u201cFor example, if someone called the police with concerns that a child was being groomed for sexual abuse, we would never disregard that child\u2019s safety just because we were asked to. Extremist grooming of child causes significant harm and is no different.\u201d The document does reveal more about the database used by police forces to store the details of people who have been referred to Prevent. The Police Case Management Tracker (PCMT) replaced all recording by local authorities on spreadsheets with a national IT system in July 2018, the document says. Information recorded on the database includes \u201cbiographical information, nature of vulnerability, and counter-terror/domestic extremism risks\u201d as well as \u201cany intervention or action by police or a partner\u201d, the guidance reveals. The stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold. Each Prevent referral is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed.",

It is full of interesting and original thoughts, reflecting on racing\u2019s relationhip with its horses and <a href=\"https://www.britishhorseracing.com/regulation/horse-welfare-board/\">can be downloaded here</a>.</p> \n<p>At one point, under the heading \u201cThe importance of language\u201d, the Board muses: \u201cWe may inadvertently be using language or phrases ... which reinforce the impression of an underlying welfare \u2018problem\u2019. For example, it is common for people in the sport to say of a horse before a race, \u2018I just hope he comes home safe.\u2019 While this is undoubtedly an expression of how much that horse matters to the person in question, does it reinforce the perception of a high risk to horses when racing, when in fact it is fare more likely that the horse <em>will </em>return safely?\u201d</p> \n<p>Stiff upper lip for the good of racing, appears to be the message. Well, this is England. But it\u2019s an interesting idea, that the casual use of language by fans and insiders can harm racing\u2019s cause. Another example of this, I suggest, is the constant reference to \u201cthe whip\u201d.</p> \n<p>The broader public with no investment in the sport is naturally bound to be, at the very least, suspicious of the idea of animals being hit with something called a whip. The sport insists the item has been remodelled so as to avoid hurting the horse, so that it is merely a method of communicating urgency; in that case, why not refer to it as \u2018the Procush\u2019, the only make which is permitted under the rules of British racing?</p> \n<p>Racing would be accused of being evasive, but such a change would be valid.

      "bodyText": "The three-day ban handed to Brian Hughes this week has been suspended and it appears unlikely that the title-race leader will have to serve it after all. Hughes was punished by the stewards at Carlisle after weighing in 5lb light but protested at the time that he had done nothing wrong to earn a ban that would undermine his chance of becoming champion jockey for the first time. A statement from the British Horseracing Authority on Friday said the punishments issued \u201chave been temporarily stayed pending further investigation into the exact cause of the underweight\u201d. Officials declined further comment on the unusual step. Their intervention was welcomed by Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, who had submitted an appeal on Hughes\u2019s behalf within two hours of the race on Monday evening. \u201cIn our view, its clearly not a strict liability rule and the evidence in this case supports the conclusion that Brian was not at fault and should not be sanctioned,\u201d Struthers said. \u201cWe will await the outcome of the BHA investigation.\u201d Hughes rode his 130th winner of the season at Newcastle on Friday and is rated a 1-7 shot on Betfair to become champion when the season ends in April. But his rival, Richard Johnson, hopes to be back in action within the next fortnight after breaking his arm in January and told the Racing Post this week that he still feels he has a chance. \u201cIf I was more than 30 winners behind I\u2019d feel the title was gone,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I can still beat Brian but if he got a suspension, or missed a week for whatever reason, all of a sudden it gets a lot closer.\u201d Gordon Elliott endured a mixed Friday, as he had to break the news that Glenloe will miss next month\u2019s Cheltenham Festival, having suffered an unspecified setback. The horse had been favourite for the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase. However, Elliott was evidently happier with Tiger Roll, who made a flying trip to Cheltenham for a school over the cross-country fences. Is it time for racing to call the whip by another name? A serious, substantial piece of work is the strategic plan published on Thursday by the newly created Horse Welfare Board. It is full of interesting and original thoughts, reflecting on racing\u2019s relationhip with its horses and can be downloaded here. At one point, under the heading \u201cThe importance of language\u201d, the Board muses: \u201cWe may inadvertently be using language or phrases ... which reinforce the impression of an underlying welfare \u2018problem\u2019. For example, it is common for people in the sport to say of a horse before a race, \u2018I just hope he comes home safe.\u2019 While this is undoubtedly an expression of how much that horse matters to the person in question, does it reinforce the perception of a high risk to horses when racing, when in fact it is fare more likely that the horse will return safely?\u201d Stiff upper lip for the good of racing, appears to be the message. Well, this is England. But it\u2019s an interesting idea, that the casual use of language by fans and insiders can harm racing\u2019s cause. Another example of this, I suggest, is the constant reference to \u201cthe whip\u201d. The broader public with no investment in the sport is naturally bound to be, at the very least, suspicious of the idea of animals being hit with something called a whip. The sport insists the item has been remodelled so as to avoid hurting the horse, so that it is merely a method of communicating urgency; in that case, why not refer to it as \u2018the Procush\u2019, the only make which is permitted under the rules of British racing? Racing would be accused of being evasive, but such a change would be valid. As much as I enjoy old racing footage, the implements jockeys used to wield in the 70s look scary to modern eyes and the way they were used could be called aggressive in some cases. Those were whips. The modern item and its use are easily different enough to warrant a different label, underlining the changes made, and it ought to have the gradual effect, over time, of calling racing\u2019s efforts in this area to the attention of agnostics - and, importantly, policy-makers. I\u2019m hardly the first to make the point. M\u2019colleage Dave Yates at the Mirror has been hot on it for some time, so I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t seem to have been debated by the HWB, but there is still time. Another idea that hasn\u2019t yet grabbed the HWB is extending whip punishments to include the trainer and the owner who employed the jockey that broke the rules. As I\u2019ve said before, heaping more punishment on the jockeys is neither sophisticated nor fair.

      "body": "<p>My mother, Sally Jones, who has died aged 84, dedicated her working life to nursing - and to the nursing profession \u2013 and was a campaigner for tolerance and equality.</p> <p>Sally was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to Nancy (nee Stewart) and Frank Gomersall, a group captain in the Royal Air Force. During the second world war Sally was evacuated from London to Wales. On return she was in the first cohort to sit GCE O-levels in 1951.</p> <p>When she left Chiswick grammar school, London, aged 16, Sally trained as a state registered nurse at University College hospital in London. There she met a patient, Denis Megan, an RAF mechanic, who was suffering from tuberculosis at a time when recovery was rare. They married in 1957. He died in 1962, by which time she had three children. She returned to full-time nursing, at Queen Mary\u2019s Roehampton, on the plastic surgery ward and Thalidomide children\u2019s ward.</p> <p>In 1965 Sally moved her young family to Basingstoke, where she became a ward sister at the district general hospital. In 1971 she moved from nursing at the hospital into clinical teaching, and in 1977 she became a regional officer at the Royal College of Nursing, the same year the RCN was formally registered as a trade union.</p> <p>Bestowing an early sense of maturity and independence in her children, Sally devoted her life, regularly working a 70-hour week, to the needs of nurses, representing this predominantly female profession in disputes with mostly male management. Her fierce, firm and forceful reputation preceded her in these negotiations.</p> <p>During a three-month sabbatical in 1985, Sally established strong links between the RCN and nurses in Lesotho, raising funds for horses to take the nurses toremote locations in the Children of Lesotho Immunisation Program. She was also active in the Send a Nurse to Africa (Santa) campaign, raising significant funds.</p> <p>Sally eventually rose to the position of deputy general secretary at the RCN in 1990, initially to Trevor Clay and latterly to Christine Hancock, retiring at the age of 60.</p> <p>After retirement, Sally divided her time between the UK and family in South Africa, where she celebrated the transition from apartheid to free elections in 1994.</p> <p>Sally was an active member of the Labour party, a committed CND member and an avid supporter of the Women\u2019s Peace Camp at Greenham Common. She was a Labour councillor for Basingstoke and Deane borough from 1997 to 2002, and served on its planning committee. Her social conscience was felt by everyone who met her.</p> <p>After a brief second marriage in the 1970s, she kept her married name. She is survived by her three children, David, Barbara and me, and by seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My mother, Sally Jones, who has died aged 84, dedicated her working life to nursing - and to the nursing profession \u2013 and was a campaigner for tolerance and equality. Sally was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to Nancy (nee Stewart) and Frank Gomersall, a group captain in the Royal Air Force. During the second world war Sally was evacuated from London to Wales. On return she was in the first cohort to sit GCE O-levels in 1951. When she left Chiswick grammar school, London, aged 16, Sally trained as a state registered nurse at University College hospital in London. There she met a patient, Denis Megan, an RAF mechanic, who was suffering from tuberculosis at a time when recovery was rare. They married in 1957. He died in 1962, by which time she had three children. She returned to full-time nursing, at Queen Mary\u2019s Roehampton, on the plastic surgery ward and Thalidomide children\u2019s ward. In 1965 Sally moved her young family to Basingstoke, where she became a ward sister at the district general hospital. In 1971 she moved from nursing at the hospital into clinical teaching, and in 1977 she became a regional officer at the Royal College of Nursing, the same year the RCN was formally registered as a trade union. Bestowing an early sense of maturity and independence in her children, Sally devoted her life, regularly working a 70-hour week, to the needs of nurses, representing this predominantly female profession in disputes with mostly male management. Her fierce, firm and forceful reputation preceded her in these negotiations. During a three-month sabbatical in 1985, Sally established strong links between the RCN and nurses in Lesotho, raising funds for horses to take the nurses toremote locations in the Children of Lesotho Immunisation Program. She was also active in the Send a Nurse to Africa (Santa) campaign, raising significant funds. Sally eventually rose to the position of deputy general secretary at the RCN in 1990, initially to Trevor Clay and latterly to Christine Hancock, retiring at the age of 60. After retirement, Sally divided her time between the UK and family in South Africa, where she celebrated the transition from apartheid to free elections in 1994. Sally was an active member of the Labour party, a committed CND member and an avid supporter of the Women\u2019s Peace Camp at Greenham Common. She was a Labour councillor for Basingstoke and Deane borough from 1997 to 2002, and served on its planning committee. Her social conscience was felt by everyone who met her. After a brief second marriage in the 1970s, she kept her married name. She is survived by her three children, David, Barbara and me, and by seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.",

Nine people with an immigrant background were murdered on Thursday in the western German city by Tobias Rathjen, a 43-year-old who had posted a racist video and manifesto on the internet before carrying out the killings. On Thursday night thousands of people took to the streets in 50 cities across Germany to mourn the victims of the attack at candle-lit vigils, and take a stance against the far right. Some chanted \u201cNazis out\u201d and \u201cNever again\u201d. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced he would be increasing police protection at mosques and other locations considered vulnerable to attack by rightwing extremists, declaring, ahead of a meeting with representatives of the Turkish and Kurdish communities, that \u201cthe bloodstains of rightwing extremism are trailing across Germany\u201d. As more details emerged of the nine victims, Seehofer warned Germans to brace themselves for a \u201cspiral of rightwing violence\u201d. Among measures he said he wanted to introduce immediately were psychological profiles to be carried out on those applying for weapons permits, after it was revealed that Rathjen had easily obtained his murder weapons, and had had his permit renewed. On Friday, the father of the only female victim spoke of his incredulity at the loss of his daughter, who was five months pregnant. Mercedes Kierpacz, 34, worked at a kiosk next to the Arena Bar, the second target attacked by Rathjen. She was shot dead as she entered the bar to order food, her father, Filip Goman told the German newspaper Bild. \u201cHe gunned her down, just like that,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychologically, morally, I am dead.

Shedding her usual professorial demeanor, the leftwing Massachusetts senator tore into billionaire businessman Mike Bloomberg as he struggled to shake off numerous scandals this week. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians\u2019,\u201d Warren said at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/19/elizabeth-warren-mike-bloomberg-democratic-debate\">beginning of Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas</a>. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump, I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Warren saw her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/elizabeth-warren-strong-debate-performance-inspires-best-fundraising-day-campaign-democrats\">best day</a> of fundraising yet following the debate, and will be hoping to see the same kind of boost rival Amy Klobuchar got at the ballot box following her strong debate performance in New Hampshire.

Will the Democratic establishment now unite behind a centrist who could block Bernie Sanders\u2019 progress? If so, they need to get their act together fast.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been another wild week in American politics, with a Democratic debate shaking up the field again and Donald Trump tangling with the justice system in multiple dramatic ways. But who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down as Nevada gets ready to vote in the primary race on Saturday? The best week: Elizabeth Warren It feels like each Democratic candidate is being given a chance to shine, and this week it was Elizabeth Warren\u2019s. Shedding her usual professorial demeanor, the leftwing Massachusetts senator tore into billionaire businessman Mike Bloomberg as he struggled to shake off numerous scandals this week. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians\u2019,\u201d Warren said at the beginning of Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump, I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Warren saw her best day of fundraising yet following the debate, and will be hoping to see the same kind of boost rival Amy Klobuchar got at the ballot box following her strong debate performance in New Hampshire. The Massachusetts liberal is neck and neck with Pete Buttigieg for third place in Nevada on Saturday \u2013 if she can overtake Joe Biden and reach second she may give her campaign a new jolt of energy. A good week: Bernie Sanders The leftwing Vermont senator is now firmly in pole position, with a 14-point lead going into Nevada and an 11-point lead over the rest of the Democratic field nationally. Will the Democratic establishment now unite behind a centrist who could block Bernie Sanders\u2019 progress? If so, they need to get their act together fast. If Sanders wins, will Democratic elites fall in behind a man who has never joined their party and whom many see as a cuckoo in the nest? Maybe they\u2019ll be forced to \u2013 polling shows Democratic voters aren\u2019t worried about Sanders in the way the party\u2019s bigwigs seem to be. Could this unapologetic socialist beat Trump? That\u2019s the great unknown. But as Sanders is fond of pointing out, he consistently polls ahead of the president nationally and in some swing states. Sanders backer congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested this week he could end up compromising on his sweeping healthcare proposals \u2013 perhaps baby steps towards an eventual rapprochement between Sanders and the party hierarchy. Not a great week: Roger Stone Well, he didn\u2019t get nine years in jail \u2026 but Trump\u2019s longtime friend and aide will not have been delighted with his 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Roger Stone remains free while he appeals against the sentence, and Trump \u2013 who was criticised by his own attorney general for interfering with the case \u2013 said on Thursday he wanted to see that process \u201cplayed out\u201d before getting involved formally. \u201cI would love to see Roger exonerated,\u201d Trump said, leaving open the possibility of a pardon if his friend is not. Trump showed again this week how willing he is to use that power, issuing several pardons and commutations to people found guilty of public corruption \u2013 and perhaps paving the way for an eventual more controversial one for Stone. A bad week: Mike Bloomberg Political junkies were openly slavering at the prospect of the former New York mayor joining the Democratic field on the debate stage for the first time this week \u2013 something only possible because the party changed its rules on qualification. Yet it came after the unearthing of controversy after controversy about Mike Bloomberg \u2013 from his alleged sexist and misogynistic remarks as a boss, to anti-trans, anti-black and anti-Latino remarks and continued ill feeling about the discriminatory impact of his policing policy.

Sanders even managed to point out that Bloomberg, like him, had had heart problems. \u201cWe both have two stents!\u201d the socialist senator exclaimed memorably. A could-be-better week: Stephen Miller and his wife The level of partisanship in the US being what it is, the New York Times including the wedding of Trump\u2019s controversial immigration adviser to Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary in its soft-focus high-society nuptials column was never going to pass without comment. The two \u201cboth work in the Trump White House\u201d, the article noted benignly, although a link to a piece about \u201cThe White Nationalist Websites Cited by Stephen Miller\u201d did sort of give the game away.

      "body": "<p>At dawn, Dr Mostafa, a psychologist, went to pray at the Imamzadeh Saleh shrine in north Tehran before taking the short walk to be the first in line at the polling booth. So determined was he to do his religious duty and show his support for the supreme leader, that he voted in Friday\u2019s parliamentary elections as soon as the polling booth opened at 8am. \u201cWe all have a duty to vote, if we want to be responsible citizens,\u201d said Mostafa, who claims to have worked for the Iranian delegation in the Hague. Saying he had voted for the Conservatives, he added that he believed the US was \u201ca liar\u201d, insisting: \u201cThe parliament should never have believed American promises.\u201d</p> <p>But such enthusiasm for the parliamentary elections is likely to be the exception. By mid-afternoon there was just a smattering of people queuing to vote by the same mosque, while the nearby Tajrish bazaar was, in contrast, teeming. The mosque itself, too, seemed more attractive to mid-afternoon visitors than the chance to vote.</p> <p>Some people recalled the queue at the same polling booth in the equivalent election five years ago snaking back half a kilometre.</p> <p>Drawing conclusions about turnout from visiting a handful of polling stations is dangerous, and Tehran, along with Iran\u2019s other big cities, may not be representative of the national mood. But the early signs on a chilly but sunny day were that huge numbers had decided to ignore Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s urgent call to send America a message and to show their support for the regime by turning out to vote.</p> <p>At 3pm, the head of National Election Headquarters, Jamal Orfi, said around 11m votes had been cast up until then. This constitutes slightly less than 20% of all eligible voters. The Iranian authorities extended polling by two hours in a probable sign that they needed more time to urge people to vote to boost the flagging turn out. </p> <p>Late on Friday, the government said it would delay announcing an initial turnout estimate until Saturday, after twice postponing the closure of the polling stations.</p> <p>Official state TV claimed the polling stations were being kept open due to the high turnout across the country, but official figures earlier in the day suggested a relatively low turnout.</p> <p>In Tehran the provincial governor said 9.6 million people were entitled to vote, but by noon only 700,000 had done so. Iranian journalists at polling stations claimed it could be a record low turnout. On Twitter shots of deserted polling stations proliferated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd55b38e96d433389b490784f2b8015784bf1c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd55b38e96d433389b490784f2b8015784bf1c90/0_122_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei casting his ballot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei casting his ballot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iran\u2019S Supreme Leader Office Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those standing patiently in line at the polling station in Narmak district in east Tehran seemed determined to show their loyalty to the regime, and to punish the reformists for thinking a deal with the US was worth anything.</p> <p>Around 40 men, predominantly conservatives, were waiting in line to vote at the entrance of the mosque. The women, in a much shorter queue, no more than a dozen, voted in a nursery school around the back. On the walls in alphabetical order a bewildering array of names were listed on posters, including many who had no chance of winning.</p> <p>In Tehran more than 1,453 candidates have qualified for the seats reserved for the capital. Many voters brought handwritten notes with the names of their preferred candidates. Others brought coloured printed cards supporting the conservative list. For some it took as long as five minutes to write down the names and number of the candidates on their ballot form.</p> <p>Habbibollah Azizi, a 65-year-old teacher, said: \u201cWe are voting today for justice and the independence of our country. Before the revolution this country was the puppet of the US embassy, but now we have stood up to the bullying and arrogance, and we are a proud nation.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal agreed under the administration of Barack Obama, and the killing in January of Iran\u2019s top general, he added: \u201cThe nuclear deal was a lesson for us that the big economic powers cannot be trusted and we should never face in their direction. We stood alone in the Iran-Iraq war because that was a global war again. In killing martyr Qassem Suleimani, Donald Trump has made a great mistake \u2013 through his actions he has put US troops in great danger for ever more.\u201d</p> <p>Nasrin Sameei, 20, said she was voting for two reasons: to support the supreme leader and because of Suleimani\u2019s killing. \u201cI know that even if my vote only has a tiny impact, it matters that I come \u2013 we have to show that we are a strong country,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mohammed, a telecommunication engineer, added: \u201cThe reformists were too optimistic about the war and Donald Trump. The western media is involved in a soft war to weaken us. Our country is like a child, like a son or daughter that we must cherish and help to grow stronger. There have been so many gaps between what the reformists promise and do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4a145e1c3af9562219ba8f559cbe8b2ff7d403a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a145e1c3af9562219ba8f559cbe8b2ff7d403a/0_226_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voters check the dizzying list of the candidates at a polling station in Tehran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters check the dizzying list of the candidates at a polling station in Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vahid Salemi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stepping away from the loyalist polling booths to the tree-lined Sa\u2019ad Abad Complex in north Tehran is to enter a different country, and mindset.</p> <p>Walking in the park with her husband and mother, a woman who gave her name as Mina said: \u201cThere is no \u2018we\u2019 in Iran. There is just \u2018they\u2019, the government, the 95%. We don\u2019t exist as a voice. Why should we participate in an election for which nothing will change?\u201d</p> <p>Bijan, a 54-year-old restauranter from Neyshabur, says he comes to the park to soothe his anger about politics. \u201cBut every step I make I get more disappointed because our fathers made a huge mistake by starting the revolution of 1979. Why should we vote? I voted during the period of [former president] Khatami, but it seemed for no purpose. The mullahs may wear soft sandals, but they use them to suppress and kick us.\u201d</p> <p>Mariam, 35, a fitness instructor, said: \u201cWe have lost our freedom of expression, thought and voice. Five years ago with the money I earned I could afford two holidays abroad and now it is none.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about her view on the reformists, she answered: \u201cExcuse me? What are they reforming? If you protest in this country you are shot, and they will not even tell you how many they have killed.\u201d</p> <p>It seems in Tehran there are two societies, and only one of them thinks today is election day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the nation was bracing itself for another hit to its sanctions-ravaged economy as the global anti-terror finance watchdog blacklisted Iran on Friday.</p> <p>The Paris based Financial Action Task Force took the step following pressure from the US that Iran was failing to meet its promised commitments to make the economy less exposed to money laundering.</p> <p>The move now has the backing of European countries. Iran was required last October to sign by February the Convention on the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and the Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo). Iranian politicians have been split over the wisdom of the move but hardliner-run political bodies have rejected the move as western political interference.</p> <p>In practical terms blacklisting will mean even fewer firms will want to trade with Iran, and it will be difficult for any Iranians including embassies to hold bank accounts abroad.</p> <p>Although the governor of Iran\u2019s central bank, Abdolnaser Hemmati, shrugged off the threat to the economy, rumours in Iran that FATF blacklisting was imminent led to a sharp fall in the rial\u2019s value earlier this week.</p> <p>Almost all western banks have already shut down their links with Iran due to the threat of US sanctions, and the US has imposed an effective ban on Iranian oil exports, the revenue lifeblood for the economy.</p>",

But the early signs on a chilly but sunny day were that huge numbers had decided to ignore Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s urgent call to send America a message and to show their support for the regime by turning out to vote. At 3pm, the head of National Election Headquarters, Jamal Orfi, said around 11m votes had been cast up until then. This constitutes slightly less than 20% of all eligible voters. The Iranian authorities extended polling by two hours in a probable sign that they needed more time to urge people to vote to boost the flagging turn out. Late on Friday, the government said it would delay announcing an initial turnout estimate until Saturday, after twice postponing the closure of the polling stations. Official state TV claimed the polling stations were being kept open due to the high turnout across the country, but official figures earlier in the day suggested a relatively low turnout. In Tehran the provincial governor said 9.6 million people were entitled to vote, but by noon only 700,000 had done so. Iranian journalists at polling stations claimed it could be a record low turnout. On Twitter shots of deserted polling stations proliferated. Those standing patiently in line at the polling station in Narmak district in east Tehran seemed determined to show their loyalty to the regime, and to punish the reformists for thinking a deal with the US was worth anything. Around 40 men, predominantly conservatives, were waiting in line to vote at the entrance of the mosque. The women, in a much shorter queue, no more than a dozen, voted in a nursery school around the back. On the walls in alphabetical order a bewildering array of names were listed on posters, including many who had no chance of winning. In Tehran more than 1,453 candidates have qualified for the seats reserved for the capital. Many voters brought handwritten notes with the names of their preferred candidates. Others brought coloured printed cards supporting the conservative list. For some it took as long as five minutes to write down the names and number of the candidates on their ballot form. Habbibollah Azizi, a 65-year-old teacher, said: \u201cWe are voting today for justice and the independence of our country. Before the revolution this country was the puppet of the US embassy, but now we have stood up to the bullying and arrogance, and we are a proud nation.\u201d Referring to Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal agreed under the administration of Barack Obama, and the killing in January of Iran\u2019s top general, he added: \u201cThe nuclear deal was a lesson for us that the big economic powers cannot be trusted and we should never face in their direction. We stood alone in the Iran-Iraq war because that was a global war again. In killing martyr Qassem Suleimani, Donald Trump has made a great mistake \u2013 through his actions he has put US troops in great danger for ever more.\u201d Nasrin Sameei, 20, said she was voting for two reasons: to support the supreme leader and because of Suleimani\u2019s killing. \u201cI know that even if my vote only has a tiny impact, it matters that I come \u2013 we have to show that we are a strong country,\u201d she said. Mohammed, a telecommunication engineer, added: \u201cThe reformists were too optimistic about the war and Donald Trump. The western media is involved in a soft war to weaken us. Our country is like a child, like a son or daughter that we must cherish and help to grow stronger. There have been so many gaps between what the reformists promise and do.\u201d Stepping away from the loyalist polling booths to the tree-lined Sa\u2019ad Abad Complex in north Tehran is to enter a different country, and mindset. Walking in the park with her husband and mother, a woman who gave her name as Mina said: \u201cThere is no \u2018we\u2019 in Iran. There is just \u2018they\u2019, the government, the 95%. We don\u2019t exist as a voice. Why should we participate in an election for which nothing will change?\u201d Bijan, a 54-year-old restauranter from Neyshabur, says he comes to the park to soothe his anger about politics. \u201cBut every step I make I get more disappointed because our fathers made a huge mistake by starting the revolution of 1979. Why should we vote? I voted during the period of [former president] Khatami, but it seemed for no purpose. The mullahs may wear soft sandals, but they use them to suppress and kick us.\u201d Mariam, 35, a fitness instructor, said: \u201cWe have lost our freedom of expression, thought and voice. Five years ago with the money I earned I could afford two holidays abroad and now it is none.\u201d Asked about her view on the reformists, she answered: \u201cExcuse me? What are they reforming? If you protest in this country you are shot, and they will not even tell you how many they have killed.\u201d It seems in Tehran there are two societies, and only one of them thinks today is election day. Meanwhile, the nation was bracing itself for another hit to its sanctions-ravaged economy as the global anti-terror finance watchdog blacklisted Iran on Friday. The Paris based Financial Action Task Force took the step following pressure from the US that Iran was failing to meet its promised commitments to make the economy less exposed to money laundering. The move now has the backing of European countries. Iran was required last October to sign by February the Convention on the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and the Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo). Iranian politicians have been split over the wisdom of the move but hardliner-run political bodies have rejected the move as western political interference. In practical terms blacklisting will mean even fewer firms will want to trade with Iran, and it will be difficult for any Iranians including embassies to hold bank accounts abroad. Although the governor of Iran\u2019s central bank, Abdolnaser Hemmati, shrugged off the threat to the economy, rumours in Iran that FATF blacklisting was imminent led to a sharp fall in the rial\u2019s value earlier this week. Almost all western banks have already shut down their links with Iran due to the threat of US sanctions, and the US has imposed an effective ban on Iranian oil exports, the revenue lifeblood for the economy.",

Local councils must be given powers to regulate this, so local housing needs are not squeezed out,\u201d she tweeted on Friday. Airbnb said the Guardian\u2019s data was flawed and that some listings were for hotel rooms, single rooms in homes, and unusual properties such as caravans, meaning their rental did not affect housing stock. Patrick Robinson, the company\u2019s director of public policy, said: \u201cAirbnb is a good partner to cities and we were the first platform to limit how often hosts in London can share their homes.

Between May 2019 and January 2020, the number of active UK listings on the website increased by 14% to 257,000. The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) warned on Friday that renters were finding it harder to access long-term homes to rent because taxation changes are driving landlords to move into the holiday lettings market. Last month, research from ARLA Propertymark found that nearly half a million UK properties could be left unavailable for longer-term rent as more landlords exit the market in favour of short-term lettings. Many landlords blame the government for restricting mortgage interest relief to the basic rate of income tax, claiming they will be significantly worse off or even unable to make a profit on their lettings. The change does not apply to short-term lets, encouraging more landlords to move into that market, according to the RLA. Anyone buying a second home or buy-to-let property has also been hit with a 3% stamp duty surcharge since April 2016 under changes introduced by George Osborne as chancellor. David Smith, the RLA\u2019s policy director, said: \u201cGovernment policy is actively encouraging the growth of holiday homes at the expense of long-term homes to rent, which many families need. This is completely counterproductive, making renting more expensive and undermining efforts to help tenants save for a house of their own. \u201cThe chancellor must use his budget to give tenants a better deal by supporting good landlords to provide the homes to rent that they want to live in.\u201d",

PJ Masks are children\u2019s TV characters. The question had been about HS2. Pressed for more detail, the \u201cmaverick\u201d replied: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a rhyme.\u201d</p> <p>It was no more or less sophisticated than the two fingers it represented; meaningless and silly, it was intended, one assumes, to put the journalists in their place. \u201cI have not authorised this conversation, therefore this conversation is null, void, a string of noises disguised as words.\u201d</p> <p>You can actually \u2013 I believe \u2013 track his thought process. Some days before, a reporter from ITV caught Cummings exiting a restaurant, just as the UK exited the EU. He asked a series of admittedly banal questions: \u201cHow do you plan to bring the country back together?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard to this moment, does the real work begin now?\u201d And Cummings\u2019s reply, couched in irritable hectoring, like a horrible headteacher, was: \u201cAre you going to walk along asking inane questions? Is that your best move?\u201d Since then, he has been studiedly inane in his interactions. \u201cTwo can play at that game,\u201d must be his reasoning, though an eager public awaits his 10,000-word blog on the subject.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1227173084639133696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dominic Cummings says &quot;we need PJ Masks on the job&quot; <br><br>Asked for his response to the government&#39;s decision to go ahead with HS2, the PM&#39;s senior adviser channels the crime-fighting superheroes and says: &quot;The night time is the right time to fight crime&quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/62QwKDsUwN\">https://t.co/62QwKDsUwN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2nw0PAZiV7\">pic.twitter.com/2nw0PAZiV7</a></p>&mdash; BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1227173084639133696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So is doorstepping Cummings a fruitful exercise, if these are its ground rules?

      "bodyText": "Things came to a head on Dominic Cummings\u2019s doorstep on 11 February. \u201cThe night-time is the right time to fight crime,\u201d he told waiting reporters, before going on to recommend PJ Masks for jobs in the cabinet. PJ Masks are children\u2019s TV characters. The question had been about HS2. Pressed for more detail, the \u201cmaverick\u201d replied: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a rhyme.\u201d It was no more or less sophisticated than the two fingers it represented; meaningless and silly, it was intended, one assumes, to put the journalists in their place. \u201cI have not authorised this conversation, therefore this conversation is null, void, a string of noises disguised as words.\u201d You can actually \u2013 I believe \u2013 track his thought process. Some days before, a reporter from ITV caught Cummings exiting a restaurant, just as the UK exited the EU. He asked a series of admittedly banal questions: \u201cHow do you plan to bring the country back together?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard to this moment, does the real work begin now?\u201d And Cummings\u2019s reply, couched in irritable hectoring, like a horrible headteacher, was: \u201cAre you going to walk along asking inane questions? Is that your best move?\u201d Since then, he has been studiedly inane in his interactions. \u201cTwo can play at that game,\u201d must be his reasoning, though an eager public awaits his 10,000-word blog on the subject. So is doorstepping Cummings a fruitful exercise, if these are its ground rules? Or does it merely underscore his immense power, the absolute carelessness for reputation and respectability it has brought with it, and fill the airwaves with the swill of his disregard? Are these journalists just making us all depressed, or are they performing the valuable service of holding him to account? They certainly think the latter. None of these reporters or camera people wanted to be identified or quoted, which I understood. You\u2019ll just have to accept that they said what I say they did. I realise this is unfamiliar in a low-trust environment, but there it is. They\u2019re not there every day \u2013 on Monday 17, it was just me, hiding behind a tree. On Tuesday, the pack arrives, though there aren\u2019t as many of them as you might suppose: one solitary photographer, a camera person with a producer, and a journalist whose pay grade this gig is unfathomably below. To be standing outside a big-boned north London house at 7.20 in the morning, this person\u2019s crusade must, on some level, be personal: a battle against the unaccountability of modern politics everywhere.

When does he appear in parliament to explain himself?\u201d The photographer attached to him is a freelancer, working constantly, for newspapers and news agencies, five years out of university, in what I suggest might be his dream job. \u201cWell, yes, until you have to start doing it.

I\u2019ll leave you with a spiffing Robert Lewandowski interview: Essential weekend reading: Saturday\u2019s Premier League action Chelsea v Tottenham, 12.30pm (GMT) Burnley v Bournemouth Crystal Palace v Newcastle Sheffield United v Brighton Southampton v Aston Villa Leicester v Man City Sunday Manchester United v Watford, 2pm Wolves v Norwich City, 2pm Arsenal v Everton, 4.30pm Monday Liverpool v West Ham, 8pm Storm Ciara Dennis Ellen is moving in and one fixture has already bitten the dust. St Mirren\u2019s Scottish Premiership meeting with Hearts on Friday has been postponed after heavy rain. After an inspection in Paisley at 3.30pm, the referee Alan Muir decided the match would not go ahead. There will also be Saturday morning inspections before Partick Thistle v Dunfermline in the Championship and Stirling v Stenhousemuir in League Two, and doubtless elsewhere in the coming days, too. Who is gonna snaffle fifth place? According to this, Chris Wilder and Sheffield United will be traipsing round Europe next season: Some light reading as the weekend nears: \u201cI took my girlfriend to Luton away on Boxing Day \u2013 that was her Christmas present,\u201d says Charlie Cooper, outlining his fondness for Fulham before conversation belatedly moves to fishing and filming the third and final series of the Bafta-winning mockumentary This Country. \u201cYou look into people\u2019s back gardens [upon entry into Kenilworth Road]; it\u2019s so strange but I do love it and it\u2019s so English. The way we support, it is that island mentality. I\u2019ve been to Ajax, games in France, Germany, and places like Dortmund are amazing, and the ultras \u2026 but it\u2019s not the same. When Crystal Palace did that whole ultras bit, it was sort of laughable. It\u2019s just not what we do.\u201d BREAKING! Breaking transfer news ... Sunderland have signed former Ipswich defender Tommy Smith on a short-term deal until the end of the season. The 29-year-old last played for Colorado Rapids and joins Phil Parkinson\u2019s side to provide defensive cover following an injury to on-loan Bristol City defender Bailey Wright, who suffered ankle ligament damager last weekend. \u201cI am delighted to be a part of it and hopefully I can help push the team up towards the Championship,\u201d Smith said. Get your hands on the big-match preview: Burnley will return to home comforts against Bournemouth on Saturday, after Sean Dyche revealed how the Southampton matchday programme inspired his players to victory on the road at St Mary\u2019s last weekend. Matej Vydra scored the winning goal in filthy conditions. Dyche said his squad thrived on \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d, which pinpointed left-back Charlie Taylor as a weakness and highlighted that only Sheffield United have played more long balls per game. \u201cAnd they are definitely not long ball,\u201d Dyche said. I told the lads: \u2018There you go, that\u2019s what they think of you.\u2019 They read it, disparaging remarks about Charlie Taylor of all people. I think his form\u2019s probably worth mentioning with the national side \u2013 not just yet \u2013 but I think he\u2019s one they\u2019ll be keeping a background check on. It\u2019s always lovely when they give you that little edge; I love that. It was the usual: \u2018They only do this, they only do that.\u2019 It\u2019s like fuel \u2013 you beauty!\u201d Fulham can up the ante on Leeds with victory at Derby this evening. Scott Parker\u2019s side sit third in the Championship, three points behind Leeds and seven off the summit but will be desperate to see a reaction from his team, who lost 3-0 to bottom club Barnsley last time out. \u201cIt confirms the league we play in can be so unpredictable and also confirms that there are no easy games,\u201d said Derby\u2019s manager, Phillip Cocu. \u201cThey play good football, they like to have the ball, they dominate, play out from the back, have good players, not only the first 11 but I think if you look at their squad they have good options. That is why they are fighting for promotion, but we have confidence at home.\u201d Roll up, roll up! Get yer match previews: A news line out of the Championship: Barnsley have been fined \u00a320,000 and ordered to implement an action plan following sectarian abuse directed at Stoke City midfielder James McClean. The player reported chants to the referee Jeremy Simpson when the clubs met at Oakwell on 9 November. The FA said: \u201cBarnsley FC admitted failing to ensure that its spectators, and all persons purporting to be its supporters or followers, conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using abusive and/or insulting words which included a reference, whether express or implied, to nationality and/or religion and/or beliefs while attending the fixture.\u201d What reception is Mourinho expecting at Stamford Bridge? \u201cThe usual,\u201d he says, smiling. Mourinho has also played down the significance of duelling with his former player, Frank Lampard, on the touchline. \u201cSeeing him is always nice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I meet him in the street, if I meet him in a restaurant, if I meet him in a corridor of a football stadium even as an opponent is always nice but [it is] not special to play his team. It is not [myself] against him. It is my team against his team. Nothing special.\u201d It is time for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to have his say, and he reckons, believe it or not, that getting Tottenham in the top four would rank as his best managerial achievement. \u201cIn these circumstances, yes,\u201d said the Portuguese. \u201cIf we manage to finish fourth without Harry and Sonny it will be something incredible, an incredible achievement for the boys so we have to give everything.\u201d West Ham will again be without Andriy Yarmolenko on Monday. David Moyes has said that the Ukraine winger, who has been bogged down by a thigh injury, has not been able to train fully. \u201cHe\u2019s done a little bit of training and joined us a little bit during the week, but not really the main sessions. He\u2019s probably still a bit off from joining in,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we came away from the Manchester City game with injuries. Apart from the Ryan Fredericks injury, everybody else is fine.\u201d Ancelotti has been trumpeting Jordan Pickford\u2019s ability, after the England goalkeeper made an error against Crystal Palace last time out. \u201cTo be England\u2019s number one is a responsibility,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cHe deserves it as I think he is the best keeper that England has. I am not afraid about the critics. Unfortunately you can make a mistake but after that you need to have the personality to move on quickly, and he did. For this reason, not just his quality, he is the goalkeeper of the national team.\u201d Ancelotti reckons Andr\u00e9 Gomes is \u201cready to play\u201d against Arsenal on Sunday \u2013just 112 days after suffering a fractured dislocation to his ankle. \u201cHe trained well, properly, with confidence and without problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the game we are going to talk together and decide if he can start or if he goes on the bench.\u201d Meanwhile Ancelotti also confirmed that Theo Walcott is a doubt to face his former club, but Brazilian forward Bernard is ready to rumble. Thanks, Dave. Indeed, but we will endeavour to move on. Now, let\u2019s touch base with Carlo Ancelotti on all things Everton, including Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019 return and his thoughts on Tom Davies\u2019 get-up in New York during the winter break. \u201cI said to them: \u2018next time I want to come with you.\u2019 It could be good. I am old style but sometimes it is good to know a new style of dress, no?\u201d It\u2019s back to Ben, who probably won\u2019t be using the term \u201cpark the bus\u201d after a recent injustice. A harsher fine than the time I left my car next to a shop closed for Christmas whilst picking up a parcel from the post office. A few more Opta stats to delight friends and family with ahead of this weekend\u2019s Premier League games. Raise eyebrows or mutter \u201cfancy that\u201d at your leisure: Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 23 home Premier League games against Everton (W19 D4) since a 2-1 defeat in January 1996 at Highbury under Bruce Rioch. Everton\u2019s Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored 11 Premier League goals this season; the last English player to score more in a single campaign for the Toffees was Kevin Campbell in 1999-00 (12). Norwich\u2019s Emiliano Buend\u00eda has created 69 goalscoring opportunities for his teammates in the Premier League this season, with only Kevin de Bruyne creating more in the competition. Watford manager Nigel Pearson is looking to become the fourth English manager to complete a Premier League double over Man Utd, after Glenn Hoddle (1993-94, Chelsea), Alan Curbishley (2006-07, West Ham) and Garry Monk (2014-15, Swansea City). Leicester\u2019s Brendan Rodgers has never beaten Man City manager Pep Guardiola in any of his previous four meetings (D2 L2) \u2013 he\u2019s only faced Jos\u00e9 Mourinho more often without winning in his managerial career (six games). The table never lies. Kenny Dalglish trotted that one out time after time and so have many other managers down the years. But are they being too glib? Louise Taylor suggests they may be ... Name the player who has scored nine goals in Europe but just three in the Premier League this season ... Yep, it\u2019s Diogo Jota, who bagged a hat-trick in Wolves\u2019 4-0 romp against Espanyol on Thursday night. That took his tally in the main stage of the Europa League to six while he also netted thee times in the qualifying stage. \u201cWhen we talk about the Premier League, we are talking about the best league in the world, the most competitive one, so we have to realise it\u2019s not easy to score goals,\u201d said the 23-year-old. His three Premier League goals have all come on the road although he hasn\u2019t gone to the extreme lengths of Liverpool\u2019s Roberto Firmino whose 10 goals for the Reds in all competitions this term were all netted away from home. Jota has two hat-tricks at Molineux in the Europa League this season. Leicester will again be without Wilfred Ndidi for the Saturday\u2019s home game with Manchester City. Here\u2019s Brendan Rodgers: \u201cHe\u2019s still in a process to try and get fit, so we\u2019ll see how he is next week. There\u2019s no timeline on it, we just have to see how he progresses. He\u2019s virtually weight-bearing and he\u2019s doing his work inside, and then you have to progress that to going outside and then it\u2019s when can he join the team. There\u2019s a different intensity when training with the team and then of course there\u2019s another intensity to play. So we just want to make sure he\u2019s absolutely right. He\u2019s such an important player for us, but it\u2019s his well-being as well.We want to ensure, not just the short-term but the long-term as well, that he\u2019s right and can come back into the team with no recurrence.\u201d With Hamza Choudhury suspended and Papy Mendy (knee) injured, Leicester\u2019s defence will likely be somewhat anxious about the lack of a defensive shield when City\u2019s forward players run at them. A couple of Opta stats on the Chelsea v Tottenham clash which kicks off the weekend Premier League action (Saturday 12.30 GMT). Tottenham have won just one of their last 33 away games against Chelsea in all competitions (D11 L21), a 3-1 win in April 2018 in a Premier League fixture. Chelsea boss Frank Lampard \u2013 who made 140 Premier League appearances under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 beat him in their first league managerial meeting back in December 2019. Only one manager has ever won his first two league games against Mourinho \u2013 Boavista\u2019s Jaime Pacheco in September 2001. Thanks Ben. Dave Tindall will steer the ship for a little while. So, positive news for Palace in terms of Hodgson, but how are they shaping up for Saturday\u2019s date with Newcastle at Selhurst Park? \u201cIf all goes well tomorrow, we will have 16 senior outfield players and two goalkeepers available,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the first time in a while. [James] Tomkins is added to the injury list we had. Cenk Tosun is now back fit again. Unfortunately we\u2019ve had a few ill players as well, so we might need to monitor that.\u201d Crystal Palace have offered Roy Hodgson a new contract, the 72-year-old manager has confirmed. The former England boss\u2019 current contract runs until the summer. \u201cRoy said himself in the press the other day that he is very relaxed about the whole thing,\u201d said Paalce chairman Steve Parish. \u201cWe are very relaxed about it, I think we will get that done in the fullness of time.\u201d Lampard on Mourinho. \u201cI have got huge respect for him, but I am not considering so much the personal battle between me and him,\u201d says the Chelsea manager about his old boss. \u201cIt changes [his relationship with Mourinho. I wished him well when he got the job and he wished me well. We are amicable but we want to win.\u201d More from Chelsea HQ, with Lampard providing an update on how he views his goalkeeping conundrum. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a final decision, the keepers need to train,\u201d he says of Kepa and Caballero. \u201cWe all want the best. I am paid to make decisions. It has been a decision to make on form with the goalkeeping situation.\u201d Right, all the big hitters are coming out to play. Frank Lampard says N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is not fit for Chelsea\u2019s showdown with Spurs \u2013 the midfielder is expected to miss three weeks of action \u2013 and nor is Christian Pulisic. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will, however, be back in the fold against Tottenham. Tammy Abraham is also set to play a part after training the last couple of days. \u201cThere\u2019s competition in that [forward] area. Olivier [Giroud] is fit. Michy [Batshuayi] is there.\u201d More from Guardiola, wearing a City hoodie straight out of the club shop. \u201cI\u2019m completely sure about the commitment of our players, because it is not about yesterday or today, but many, many years. At the end of the season nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t have any doubts.\u201d Manchester City try to shutdown a journalist asking Guardiola about the implications of the FFP noise, but eventually gets his question away. \u201cI cannot change what people think. I know how hard we work and I\u2019m so proud what we have done, all these years together.\u201d A wonderfully grouchy Pep Guardiola speaks \u2013 and gives his verdict on Sterling\u2019s gushing words about Real Madrid. \u201cThe players are free to talk and say what they believe and think,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not here to tell them what to say. He makes an interview with Madrid and speaks about Madrid \u2013 that\u2019s normal.\u201d A hammer blow for West Ham? Ryan Fredericks will see a specialist after suffering ligament damage to his right shoulder. The full-back collided with Rodri at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. Jarrod Bowen could be promoted to David Moyes\u2019s starting lineup against Liverpool on Monday. \u201cThere is a tough run of games but the pressure is not on us at Anfield as no-one expects us to get anything from the game,\u201d said Bowen, a \u00a322m January signing. \u201cSo we can use that to our advantage before going into the final run when we play a lot of teams in the bottom half and we expect to pick up points and get ourselves out of this position.\u201d A bit of breaking news regarding the Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who will miss three weeks\u2019 of action owing to a hamstring injury, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has confirmed. \u201cCould have been worse,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe will be out I think for three weeks or so. Not cool but we were still lucky.\u201d As for the 1-0 defeat to Atl\u00e9tico in midweek, he says: \u201cThe difference in feeling is massive \u2013 sunshine to [the] hardest rain \u2013 that\u2019s how it felt to lose.\u201d A nugget of Championship news while we wait for Herr Klopp and co. The Wigan manager Paul Cook will serve a one-match touchline ban against Millwall on Saturday after being charged with improper conduct by the Football Association. Cook admitted using \u201cabusive and/or insulting words towards the match referee in the tunnel area at full time\u201d, as well as in the match officials\u2019 dressing room, against Middlesbrough, a 2-2 draw during which Chey Dunkley was sent off earlier this month. The FA have also fined Cook \u00a34,000. Norwich team news: Ben Godfrey is available again following a knee injury and suspension. Sam Byram will miss the rest of the season after surgery, while Christoph Zimmermann and Onel Hern\u00e1ndez are major doubts owing to hamstring and knee complaints respectively. Timm Klose is close to a first-team return. Get yer Farke fix! \u201cWe\u2019re not raising the white flag and already focusing on the Championship,\u201d insists the Norwich manager. \u201cWe\u2019re not tempted to just talk about next season. We\u2019re focused on what we have to do now. Wolves play a really good role in the Premier League and have clean sheets in the last three games. It\u2019s a huge task, but we have to be good in our topics. Performance-wise, we\u2019re definitely on the right path. Losing 1-0 to Liverpool isn\u2019t the end of the world, it\u2019s actually got a lot of positives. The away games in recent weeks have also been good. If we can do this again, we have the chance to stay in this league.\u201d Farke life! Norwich City\u2019s sporting director Stuart Webber this week confirmed the club received no concrete bids for Max Aarons, Ben Godfrey or Todd Cantwell. \u201cWe were pretty clear within our office that we wouldn\u2019t sell any player in the transfer window,\u201d Farke says. Webber was not best pleased with some of the noise surrounding Norwich\u2019s young pups. \u201cIf Tottenham or Arsenal or whoever want them they will come and get them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to mess around. Manchester United wanted Dan James. They went and got him [last summer]. They\u2019ve got that much power and money to do it. If Manchester United want one of our players they can afford them and attract them.\u201d We\u2019ll be hearing from a flurry of managers shortly, including J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Carlo Ancelotti but first, here\u2019s Daniel Farke, ahead of Norwich\u2019s trip to Wolves on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019ll take six or seven wins for safety, we know we need to come as close to 40 points as possible,\u201d Farke says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we pray for other teams to draw or get beat, it\u2019s in our hands. We need to win more points, so we need to concentrate on our games.\u201d Norwich haven\u2019t won on the road in the Premier League since November. Shokdran Mustafi is very much back in business \u2013 but the defender insists he never felt his Arsenal career was done and dusted. \u201cIf you think things are over for you, then you should retire,\u201d Mustafi said after another respectable showing in Thursday night\u2019s 1-0 win at Olympiakos. \u201cThat\u2019s not like you should think as a professional. You always get the opportunities and a team has more than 20 players for a reason. The main thing for me was to be professional because as long as you stay professional, you have no fault for anything. Stay professional, wait until you get your next opportunity and then obviously you have to take it.\u201d Roll up, roll up! Get yer match-preview fix: Let\u2019s have a quick Rooney love-in. If Rooney features for Derby against Fulham this evening, it will be his 500th appearance in English league football. Rooney\u2019s first league goal was the winner against Arsenal for Everton. At the time, he was the youngest ever player to score in the Premier League (16 years 360 days). And here\u2019s one more stat, courtesy of Opta: in his 476th league appearance, Rooney scored his last-ever Premier League goal. His strike v Swansea on 18 December 2017 means only Alan Shearer (260) has scored more goals in the competition than Rooney (208). Lewes FC have been crunching the numbers since highlighting the disparity between men and women\u2019s prize money in the FA Cup \u2013 and the results are in! The \u00a32,000 earned by each of the 16 victorious women\u2019s teams in the fourth round was dwarfed by the \u00a3180,000 each successful men\u2019s team pocketed. Last season Manchester City\u2019s men\u2019s team received \u00a33.6m for winning the final, whereas their women\u2019s team collected \u00a325,000 for doing likewise in a Wembley final watched by 43,264 fans. In 2017 Lewes became the first club to pay their women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams equally. Steven Gerrard has showered Ianis Hagi in superlatives after he scored twice to secure an extraordinary Europa League win in front of his father, Gheorghe, at Ibrox. Hagi was mustard at the European Under-21 Championship in Italy and San Marino last summer, earning a move to Genk, who loaned the Romanian to Rangers last month. The Daily Record described Rangers\u2019 win as the \u2018Daddy Of All Comebacks\u2019. \u201cIanis is an outstanding talent and that stage was made for him,\u201d said Gerrard. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talent, it\u2019s fight. He wants to win. It was him who provided the magic and spark to get us back into the game. The first goal is outstanding \u2013 to cut in on his left foot, which I think is his weak one.\u201d Down in League One, a blow for Ipswich Town. Paul Lambert has confirmed the striker James Norwood will be sidelined until April after undergoing thigh surgery. Norwood, the club\u2019s joint-top scorer, has scored 11 goals this season since sealing a summer move from Tranmere Rovers, where he scored 55 goals in two seasons to help the club win back-to-back promotion from the National League to League One. \u201cIt\u2019s a blow for us and for James,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cIt has been niggling away at him for a while. He\u2019ll be back before the end of the season.\u201d Who is looking forward to Southampton v Aston Villa? We need to talk about Martin Braithwaite. The 28-year-old spent a forgettable two years on Teeside with Middlesbrough, scoring eight goals in 36 appearances after a \u00a39m move from Toulouse, but this week he became Barcelona\u2019s latest signing. As Lionel Messi says, weird things are happening in Catalonia: Only a smattering of days ago, Raheem Sterling\u2019s agent said his client was solely focused on all things Manchester City, but the man himself has opened the door to a future switch to Real Madrid. In an interview with Spanish outlet AS, the 25-year-old was asked whether he would, one day, fancy a move to Madrid: \u201cHow do I answer that one? Is the camera live or is it just taking pictures? No one knows what the future will hold. I am a player and I am always open to challenges but right now my challenge is at City and I\u2019m really happy. I have a contract with City now and I have to respect this. Real Madrid are a fantastic club. When you see the white shirt you know exactly what the club stands for, it\u2019s massive.\u201d Asked about speculation linking him with a move to the Bernab\u00e9u, Sterling said: \u201cIt\u2019s something that you see all the time, but I\u2019m a City player and I\u2019m enjoying it at the moment, even if things haven\u2019t gone quite planned in the league. We now have a massive opportunity in the Champions League.\u201d City play Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, with the first leg at the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday and the return game at Etihad Stadium on 17 March. Sterling is facing a race to be fit in time for the tie after suffering a hamstring injury against Tottenham at the beginning of February. Bury AFC will begin life in the 10th tier of the English pyramid: Own up, how many times have you replayed R\u00faben Neves\u2019s delicious and, frankly, preposterous volley last night? Neves does not score that many goals but when he does they tend to be spectacular. Adama Traor\u00e9 ran at D\u00eddac Vil\u00e0 and crossed towards the far post but Victor G\u00f3mez could not have suspected what was to follow as he headed away. Neves got in front of his man, chested the ball gently down and unleashed such an aesthetically-pleasing volley that many Wolves fans were on their feet celebrating even before the ball reached the back of the net. If Monk v Clotet round two does not steal the show at St Andrew\u2019s, then ludicrously good 16-year-old Jude Bellingham probably will: Technically, he is a first-year scholar earning \u00a3145 a week, unable to sign a professional contract until he turns 17 in June. Those who work with Bellingham highlight his work ethic and notably the physical strides he has made over the past months \u2013 his manager revealed Bellingham had grown 2.4cm since August \u2013 and there is a sense he will end up as a No 8, though he has thrived on both flanks. New balls please. Phwoar, just listen to this. The Premier League are set to give Nike\u2019s latest hot prospect \u2018Tunnel Vision Merlin\u2019 a debut this weekend at Stamford Bridge, for Chelsea\u2019s showdown with Tottenham. As if the fare was not exhilarating enough already, the league have laid on a real treat with news that Merlin, which frankly sounds like a club mascot, will be given its first runout. Nike say the \u2018tunnel-vision\u2019 aspect \u201chighlights the balance of clarity and disorder with bright orange circles amid a flurry of graphics\u201d. Cute. Oh, and one of the panels features the Premier League trophy, as if the teams needed reminding. The Championship is hotting up, with Wayne Rooney\u2019s Derby\u2122 taking on Fulham on Friday evening before a whole host of intriguing ties on Saturday afternoon, notably promotion-chasing Brentford against in-form Blackburn, who are lurking just outside the play-off places under Tony Mowbray, who will celebrate three years in charge this weekend. Elsewhere, Leeds host Reading and Garry Monk returns to Birmingham with Sheffield Wednesday, inevitably stirring memories of his stinging verbal attack on former assistant Pep Clotet before the sides met in November, when Monk refused to shake hands with the Spaniard. I don\u2019t speak with him. I think what\u2019s most important to me when I\u2019m assembling a staff around me is to give them opportunity. You show them complete trust and you hope they repay that trust with hard work and loyalty. Sadly not everyone has those values in their character. Some choose to pursue their own opportunities in the worst possible way. I think the most important thing for me is you live and you learn. I didn\u2019t listen to a lot of people in football circles who warned me about the type of character he is. It was an error in judgment by me, but it\u2019s an error I won\u2019t make in the future.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been bigging up Anthony Martial after the Frenchman\u2019s star turn in Brugge, backing the Manchester United forward to break the hallowed 20-goal barrier. \u201cI think Anthony can step up, get a few more and get to the 20 mark,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. Definitely. He\u2019s got quality of course, he\u2019s a very good finisher. He takes his chances really well. There\u2019s good technique in his finishing. He\u2019s good receiving the ball at times and dropping off. He can play almost like a false nine as well. Sometimes I\u2019d like him to be stronger physically.\u201d Now then, could Olivier Giroud return to haunt Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? Will Emi Buend\u00eda come up trumps for Norwich? And does Isma\u00efla Sarr hold the key to Watford\u2019s survival hopes? Roll up, roll up! Get yer rumours: Steve Bruce has welcomed the walking wounded back into the fold at Newcastle United this week and says Jonjo Shelvey, Emil Krafth and Big Andy Carroll are not too far away from action either. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had 18 or 19 players training for weeks so it\u2019s a welcome boost,\u201d he said. \u201cDwight Gayle has trained all week and puts himself in contention, so does Yoshi Muto. Christian Atsu is sick and we\u2019ve got a slight doubt about Joelinton, who has a bit of a sore thigh, but we expect him to be OK.\u201d Eddie Howe is also an early bird, and there\u2019s a mini-boost for Bournemouth in the sense that David Brooks is edging back to fitness, though this weekend\u2019s trip to Burnley still comes too soon for the Wales winger. \u201cNo one will return [from injury] for this game but there is a group of four who are making good progress,\u201d said Howe, who remains without Charlie Daniels and Arnaut Danjuma. \u201cDavid has had his best week in terms of his recovery, but there is still a way to go.\u201d We are in for a blockbuster. Not only will we chew over every last word from the Arsenal, Wolves and Rangers camps following a jolly good night\u2019s work in the Europa League, and doubtless a healthy dosing of Manchester United reaction after their outing to Brugge, but there is also the small fry of Chelsea v Tottenham, aka Lampard v Mourinho, and Leicester v Manchester City to look forward to. And that\u2019s before we get stuck into the chaos of the Championship and beyond, namely Middlesbrough\u2019s Barcelona\u2019s Martin Braithwaite and Fulham\u2019s trip to Derby tonight. Saturday\u2019s Premier League action Chelsea v Tottenham, 12.30pm (GMT) Burnley v Bournemouth Crystal Palace v Newcastle Sheffield United v Brighton Southampton v Aston Villa Leicester v Man City Sunday Manchester United v Watford, 2pm Wolves v Norwich City, 2pm Arsenal v Everton, 4.30pm Monday Liverpool v West Ham, 8pm",

Onward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar/Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Once upon a time, Pixar made inventive, original family stories, but in recent years they\u2019ve leant heavily on sequels such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/toy-story-4-review-new-characters-same-old-story-pixar\">Toy Story 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/11/incredibles-2-review-brad-bird-holly-hunter-disney-pixar-animation\">Incredibles 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres\">Finding Dory</a>. Has the magic gone? As their first original story since 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a>, Onward asks a similar question \u2013 and provides a very satisfactory answer. Its setting is a realm of mythical creatures who live much as modern-day humans do \u2013 less Middle-earth than 1970s fantasy art come to life. The magic has pretty much gone. The unicorns forage through suburban rubbish bins, and even though he could gallop at 70mph, the centaur cop drives a car \u2013 impractical as that may be.</p> <p>Onward indicates early on that it is going to be a quest movie. It even signposts how it is not taking the straightforward route but the \u201cpath of peril\u201d. As with the best of Pixar\u2019s output, the journey is as much inward as outward (or onward). Our heroes are two blue-skinned elves: weedy, insecure Ian (voiced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-holland\">Tom Holland</a>) and his slow-witted elder brother Barley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-pratt\">Chris Pratt</a>, channelling Jack Black), whose encyclopedic knowledge of arcane magical lore might just come in handy. Their father died before Ian was born (mum is now dating the centaur cop), but he left the brothers an odd gift to open on Ian\u2019s 16th birthday: a spell to bring him back for a day. As anyone who has seen the trailer will know, the spell only half-works: the bottom half. All the brothers end up with is their father\u2019s feet and legs. How to materialise the rest of him before sunset? Quest time!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020b757a10565cde13c69103bd42f970184d198e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020b757a10565cde13c69103bd42f970184d198e/423_0_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Onward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quietly moving ... Onward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus, they hit the road in Barley\u2019s souped-up van, in a race against time to find the thing they need\u2013 dragging dad\u2019s legs behind them like a clumsy pet. The legs thing is initially off-putting (best not to think too hard about the anatomy) but half-dad provides some novel comic relief, especially when the brothers fashion a makeshift top half for him. There are surprises and delights along the way: some surreally comical, some modestly spectacular, others that could have been cadged from an old Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. But Onward reveals itself to be more than a straightforward boys\u2019 adventure.</p> <p>The story slyly strays into matters of male relationships \u2013 fraternal as much as paternal. The brothers\u2019 characters deepen considerably as they discover and reveal strengths and vulnerabilities. Amid the inevitable climactic action, the reunion with the father is resolved in a way that is delicate, unexpected and quietly moving. Rather than offering trite homilies, Onward feels sincere and specific, and all the better for it. (Writer-director <a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/press/press-screenings/detail.html?film_id=202012642\">Dan Scanlon</a> lost his father when he was a year old, and has no memory of him.)</p> <p>You could argue that there\u2019s little here for girls and women \u2013 although there are supporting roles for the boys\u2019 mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Octavia Spencer\u2019s crisis-stricken manticore (a winged lion/dragon/scorpion creature).

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, Pixar made inventive, original family stories, but in recent years they\u2019ve leant heavily on sequels such as Toy Story 4, Incredibles 2 and Finding Dory. Has the magic gone? As their first original story since 2017\u2019s Coco, Onward asks a similar question \u2013 and provides a very satisfactory answer. Its setting is a realm of mythical creatures who live much as modern-day humans do \u2013 less Middle-earth than 1970s fantasy art come to life. The magic has pretty much gone. The unicorns forage through suburban rubbish bins, and even though he could gallop at 70mph, the centaur cop drives a car \u2013 impractical as that may be. Onward indicates early on that it is going to be a quest movie. It even signposts how it is not taking the straightforward route but the \u201cpath of peril\u201d. As with the best of Pixar\u2019s output, the journey is as much inward as outward (or onward). Our heroes are two blue-skinned elves: weedy, insecure Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and his slow-witted elder brother Barley (Chris Pratt, channelling Jack Black), whose encyclopedic knowledge of arcane magical lore might just come in handy. Their father died before Ian was born (mum is now dating the centaur cop), but he left the brothers an odd gift to open on Ian\u2019s 16th birthday: a spell to bring him back for a day. As anyone who has seen the trailer will know, the spell only half-works: the bottom half. All the brothers end up with is their father\u2019s feet and legs. How to materialise the rest of him before sunset? Quest time! Thus, they hit the road in Barley\u2019s souped-up van, in a race against time to find the thing they need\u2013 dragging dad\u2019s legs behind them like a clumsy pet. The legs thing is initially off-putting (best not to think too hard about the anatomy) but half-dad provides some novel comic relief, especially when the brothers fashion a makeshift top half for him. There are surprises and delights along the way: some surreally comical, some modestly spectacular, others that could have been cadged from an old Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. But Onward reveals itself to be more than a straightforward boys\u2019 adventure. The story slyly strays into matters of male relationships \u2013 fraternal as much as paternal. The brothers\u2019 characters deepen considerably as they discover and reveal strengths and vulnerabilities. Amid the inevitable climactic action, the reunion with the father is resolved in a way that is delicate, unexpected and quietly moving. Rather than offering trite homilies, Onward feels sincere and specific, and all the better for it. (Writer-director Dan Scanlon lost his father when he was a year old, and has no memory of him.) You could argue that there\u2019s little here for girls and women \u2013 although there are supporting roles for the boys\u2019 mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Octavia Spencer\u2019s crisis-stricken manticore (a winged lion/dragon/scorpion creature). But while these kinds of relationships are often dealt with in female-led fairytales, for male characters this is still relatively under-explored territory. Beneath the bro-friendly, fantasy-art trappings, Onward finds a little bit of that old Pixar magic. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2020. An earlier version described Onward as \u201cFrozen for boys\u201d, both in the headline and the text. The headline was amended and the phrase removed from the review.",

The JP Morgan report on the economic risks of human-caused global heating said climate policy had to change or else the world faced irreversible consequences. The study implicitly condemns the US bank\u2019s own investment strategy and highlights growing concerns among major Wall Street institutions about the financial and reputational risks of continued funding of carbon-intensive industries, such as oil and gas. JP Morgan has provided $75bn (\u00a361bn) in financial services to the companies most aggressively expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration since the Paris agreement, according to analysis compiled for the Guardian last year. Its report was obtained by Rupert Read, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson and philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia, and has been seen by the Guardian. The research by JP Morgan economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray says the climate crisis will impact the world economy, human health, water stress, migration and the survival of other species on Earth. \u201cWe cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened,\u201d notes the paper, which is dated 14 January. Drawing on extensive academic literature and forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the paper notes that global heating is on course to hit 3.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. It says most estimates of the likely economic and health costs are far too small because they fail to account for the loss of wealth, the discount rate and the possibility of increased natural disasters.

If Ms Braverman uses her powers to politicise her role, rather than acting as the defender of the law and the advocate for legal judgment, if necessary against government wishes, the country will have taken a further giant step towards authoritarian rule, untrammelled by the crucial counterweight of independent legal judgment. It will be the supreme irony if the Conservatives\u2019 continual electoral warnings about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s wish to create the all-powerful state finished up with the Boris Johnson government doing precisely that. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 Suella Braverman obviously has a sense of humour, writing last month for ConservativeHome that \u201celected decision-makers\u201d needed to \u201ctake back control\u201d from \u201cunelected, unaccountable judges\u201d. What are her views on unelected, unaccountable chief advisers to the prime minister? Phil Curley Washingborough, Lincolnshire \u2022 The new attorney general believes the judiciary needs to be restrained as it has usurped the role of parliament based on two recent cases (Report, 14 February). In the first, the courts compelled the executive to consult parliament on the exercise of article 50 and in the second, they refused to allow the executive to prorogue parliament in order to prevent it debating issues of critical national importance.

Whenever boxing pits two fighters of immense ego and will against each other something elusive and mysterious rises up. In this rematch, the most unquantifiable facet is the Detroit connection between Fury and his new trainers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZB5uNr73rU\" title=\"\">Javan </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZB5uNr73rU\" title=\"\">\u2018SugarHill</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZB5uNr73rU\" title=\"\">\u2019 Steward</a> and Lee.</p> \n<p>As they get ready for work on a Tuesday morning the minds of all three men drift back to Detroit and the Kronk gym, where they first hung out together 10 years ago. The Kronk was run by Emanuel Steward, who helped 40 boxers become world champions. One of those was Lee, the Irish middleweight who won the WBO world title in 2014. SugarHill, Emanuel\u2019s nephew, also worked in his great friend Lee\u2019s corner. Fury had flown to Detroit on a whim four years earlier to sample the Kronk\u2019s gritty magic. The bond between this trio, now plotting a way to overcome Wilder\u2019s murderous punching, was forged in the Kronk.</p> \n<p>\u201cEmanuel asked my dad a year before if I would go to Detroit and train with him,\u201d Fury remembers as SugarHill wraps his massive hands. Fury looks animated as the memories tumble through him. \u201cBut my wife was pregnant and it wasn\u2019t the right time. Then I had another fight and thought: \u2018If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll never know.\u2019 If I didn\u2019t go to Detroit that time, I knew my life would never turn out the way it was meant to do. So, aged 21, I jumped on a plane to Detroit. I didn\u2019t let anyone know I was coming. I flew into Detroit airport, first and only time I\u2019ve been there, and I got a yellow cab and said: \u2018Can you take me to the Kronk gym?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>SugarHill cocks a surprised brow. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d he asks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/boxing-quiz-tyson-fury-deontay-wilder-rematches\">Boxing quiz: Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury and the history of rematches</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe taxi driver finally found the Kronk and I said: \u2018Give me five minutes,\u2019\u201d Fury remembers. \u201cI was going in to see if I was welcome. If I wasn\u2019t I was going straight home. I walked in. SugarHill\u2019s in the ring and I said: \u2018Is Emanuel around?\u2019 Sugar said: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 I told him: \u2018I\u2019m Tyson Fury, the next heavyweight champion of the world.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>That brashness surprised SugarHill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think,\u201d the trainer admits. \u201cHe had hopes of being a world champion and he\u2019s this huge guy with a strange English accent. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I wanted to watch him box to see if he could live up to everything he said.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fury flexes his wrapped left hand, appreciating Sugar\u2019s work with the tape and gauze. \u201cI\u2019ve always been an outspoken, controversial character,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the shy type. I suppose they weren\u2019t used to seeing this because Americans look at the British as reserved. But I was louder than any American in the Kronk. They thought: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve not seen this before, but we\u2019ll roll with it.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Emanuel Steward welcomed Fury into his home. He\u2019d done the same a few years earlier when he asked Lee to move from Limerick to Detroit so he could train him at the Kronk. \u201cManny didn\u2019t know me,\u201d Lee chips in from the apron of the ring. \u201cI could\u2019ve been a murderer but he made me feel at home. Manny gave me the bedroom next door to his.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33f56eeeb86903a8fbc31cc102600ae1868b27c2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33f56eeeb86903a8fbc31cc102600ae1868b27c2/0_222_2583_1550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury takes a hit during his heavyweight bout against Otto Wallin in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyson Fury takes a hit during his heavyweight bout against Otto Wallin in September.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fury nods. \u201cIt was the same with me. Andy was away when I arrived and straight from the start Manny insisted I stay with him. He said I could stay in Andy\u2019s room. He was a very welcoming old man. Even though I hadn\u2019t met him before, I felt like I knew him 25 years. I\u2019d never had my hands wrapped before fights. Manny took half an hour wrapping these hands every day \u2013 just like Sugar\u2019s doing it.\u201d</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve sat in the dressing room before a fight with Lee and <a href=\"https://www.boxingnewsonline.net/paddy-donovan-andy-lee-donald-mcrae/\" title=\"\">watched him wrap the hands of his brilliant prot</a><a href=\"https://www.boxingnewsonline.net/paddy-donovan-andy-lee-donald-mcrae/\" title=\"\">eg</a><a href=\"https://www.boxingnewsonline.net/paddy-donovan-andy-lee-donald-mcrae/\" title=\"\">e</a>, Paddy Donovan, and there is something hypnotic about the Kronk way. It\u2019s just as easy to get caught up in Fury\u2019s memories of Detroit. \u201cEmanuel used to take me, Sugar and Andy to this special place. It was all boarded up on the outside. But when we went in it was a restaurant and bar full of former Motown singers, and people who didn\u2019t quite make it to Motown. Everybody was singing and it was unbelievable. Best singers I\u2019ve ever heard.</p> \n<p>\u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll sing a song.\u2019 I took the mic and sang Eric Clapton\u2019s Wonderful Tonight. Everyone fell in love with me. I was only a young kid but I was happy getting up in front of this crowd and singing. It felt very natural because I was always very high on me.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/19/tyson-fury-holds-the-edge-over-deontay-wilder-before-rematch\">Tyson Fury holds the edge over Deontay Wilder before rematch</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His confidence and exuberance hid the mental trauma that nearly destroyed him a few years later. But Steward said Fury was one of the three biggest characters he had met in boxing \u2013 alongside Muhammad Ali and Naseem Hamed. \u201cI only went to Detroit for three weeks,\u201d Fury says nonchalantly, \u201cbut I left a mark. Like a dog pissing on the wall.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fury left his biggest mark in the ring. \u201cMe and Andy tore up the Kronk one day. I sparred every heavyweight and cleaned up. Andy sparred and beat up everyone under that weight. The old fellas at the side who were ex-champions couldn\u2019t believe it. They were shouting: \u2018Oh my God, I never thought I\u2019d see the day. White boys taking over the Kronk!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Steward looks up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just two white boys, it was two Gypsies. That\u2019s different. We recognised that, because black and Gypsy fighters feel they have been discriminated against. They have a chip on their shoulder, and always want to prove themselves. Black and Gypsy fighters have that same determined attitude forged in adversity. It\u2019s like when Andy moved to Detroit from Limerick [in 2005] no one but Manny knew who he was. He was just this white kid. Then his boxing, and his similarities to the black community, shone through. That won him approval and made him one of us. Tyson has the same qualities and there\u2019s definitely a bond between black and Gypsy fighters.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9961c176-1d89-4c75-8f96-beaa3aaf9ea6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_M2kIKd7KDM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The self-proclaimed Gypsy King is as proud of his heritage as Lee \u2013 an unusual figure in boxing who has acted in a Chekhov play in Dublin while sharing his intelligence in an understated way. Their decision to work with Steward stems from a belief that returning to these Kronk roots could make a decisive difference for Fury against Wilder.</p> \n<p>It might seem strange that Fury would change his awkward and elusive style as he bamboozled Wilder for long stretches of their first fight. The old Kronk strategy, of seeking the knockout above safety-first tactics, might also seem a worrying gamble against a devastating puncher. But Fury is one of the world\u2019s most unconventional boxers, and a daring and unpredictable man who believes he can do pretty much anything. He proved that in the first fight when, having been knocked out for a few seconds in the last round against Wilder, he showed spooky powers of recovery to haul himself up and be in complete control of his amazed opponent once the final bell rang.</p> \n<p>Ben Davison, the young trainer, did fine work in lifting Fury from the grip of depression to the brink of beating Wilder. But he has been replaced by SugarHill Steward. Davison\u2019s emotional connection with Fury is obvious but Steward has been brought in to instil key technical changes and, in essence, to teach the Gypsy King to throw his punches with more authority. Watching Steward teach Fury behind closed doors is instructive. A routine session becomes a boxing lesson in closing down angles, footwork and the best way to throw a punch.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/tyson-fury-muhammad-ali-deontay-wilder-heavyweight-title-boxing\">Tyson Fury has to channel Muhammad Ali \u2026 with his feet not his mouth | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s surprising that Fury, who calls himself the linear heavyweight champion of the world after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\" title=\"\">shocked Wladimir Klitschko</a> to gain control of all the belts in 2015, should need such basic tutelage. But Fury should be respected for his desire to improve in the ring. He admits it has been an adjustment and that initially, despite having fought professionally for 11 years, he felt like \u201ca novice\u201d when he began working with Steward seven weeks ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cI felt like I\u2019d never had a fight. It was weird but I knew it would come right. I just had to practise everything Sugar taught me. We haven\u2019t worked on what I\u2019m naturally good at. We\u2019ve worked on what I\u2019m not naturally good at and improved. Old tricks of the trade.\u201d </p> \n<p>An hour later, when Fury, Steward and Lee leave the ring, the education continues. Fury watches the next recording Lee has chosen. The second bout between Aaron Pryor and Alexis Arguello in September 1983 lights up the gym while Lee offers the full context. Pryor had stopped Arguello in the 14th round the previous November, in a bout eventually voted the fight of the decade. For the rematch Pryor brought in Emanuel Steward to replace his controversial trainer Panama Lewis.</p> \n<p>In his underpants, while towelling himself down, Fury points excitedly to Steward in the corner: \u201cThere\u2019s Manny!\u201d</p> \n<p>The Gypsy King\u2019s boxing knowledge is fallible and Lee is politely non-committal when Fury suggests Oscar De La Hoya is the greatest fighter in history. But, sitting with Lee and Steward, after Fury has waved goodbye, there is gravitas. Lee, who was instrumental in advising Fury that he should add Steward to his camp, says of the legendary trainer, who died eight years ago: \u201cEmanuel is no longer here, but he would have been the perfect trainer for Tyson. The closest thing to Emanuel now is Sugar. The fundamentals of boxing \u2013 correct balance, correct punching and ring craft \u2013 are not taught now. So that\u2019s why I suggested Sugar because I knew those things would benefit Tyson.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f07c881fff41ca4f9969848e2f3296589596723\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f07c881fff41ca4f9969848e2f3296589596723/0_0_4358_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury receives a count from the referee in his first fight with Deontay Wilder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fury receives a count from the referee in his first fight with Deontay Wilder.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Hahn/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Steward leans forward. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it the way Emanuel taught us. Emanuel would say: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not doing anything special. Just the basics everyone should learn the first day they walk into the gym.\u2019 Today, everybody wants entertainment. They\u2019re bored by the basics. They want to see 35 combinations, which is never going to happen. You just need to master the basic scenarios. Tyson is humble enough to want to get better.\u201d</p> \n<p>But isn\u2019t it difficult to change some elements of a 31-year-old fighter\u2019s technique with just seven weeks of preparation before the biggest fight of his life? \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult when you work with a person who wants to learn. I\u2019m just teaching him the fundamentals. Emanuel taught me that if you correct those things you can catapult a fighter to another level.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some people believe Fury has switched from Davison to Steward to save money. Eddie Hearn, Anthony Joshua\u2019s promoter, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/02/18/tyson-fury-slams-eddie-hearn-training-camp-deontay-wilder-12262690/\" title=\"\">suggests that there has been acrimony in the camp</a>. Yet, during my two days with Fury\u2019s team, in Vegas and Henderson, the atmosphere seems serene and good-humoured. \u201cI\u2019m smiling every day,\u201d Steward says of all the rumours. \u201cI\u2019m smiling even when it\u2019s windy and cloudy outside.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Tyson's balance has improved. He can knock Wilder out this time</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>SugarHill Steward</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As for all the speculation that Fury aims to stop Wilder early, and so risks being knocked out himself, Lee talks calmly. \u201cWilder has real power and that\u2019s a great thing. But that power\u2019s not so great when it\u2019s used against you. Sometimes you can wait for that big punch too long. Next thing you know you\u2019re getting outboxed and you\u2019re losing rounds. Or you might throw that big shot and get countered, and next thing you know you\u2019re underground. Your momentum and your own power\u2019s been used against you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is Fury hitting harder now? \u201cYes,\u201d Steward says simply. \u201cHis balance has improved. With improved balance comes greater power. By punching at the same time, and countering him before he lands, he can definitely knock Wilder out.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the first fight Lee was ringside in Los Angeles, commentating on BBC radio with Mike Costello, and afterwards \u201cI went to see Tyson in the dressing room. I was just amazed by him and everything he had done in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/05/tyson-fury-interview\" title=\"\">overcoming the weight loss and depression</a>. The fact they scored the fight a draw was OK. What he had done to get to that position was remarkable.\u201d</p> \n<p>When it is Steward\u2019s turn to remember where he was that night, he says: \u201cI was in hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>I look at him quizzically and he says: \u201cQuebec City. Adonis Stevenson against Oleksandr Gvozdyk. Same night as Fury-Wilder I.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 1 December 2018, Steward trained Stevenson, a formidable light-heavyweight, a violent and rugged man who lost his WBC world title and almost his life when he was knocked out in the 11th round by Gvozdyk. Stevenson suffered brain damage and slipped into a coma. It\u2019s a chilling reminder of the danger all boxers face.</p> \n<p>I tell the two trainers that, of all Fury\u2019s revelations, the one that has stayed with me longest is his story about how his wife, Paris, sat down on their hotel bed in LA after they returned from the Wilder fight. She took off her make-up, removed her false finger nails and began to sob. She told her husband she could not bear to watch him go through the same ordeal again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237b89ad76b752b884e0e93637499b1712a82d39\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237b89ad76b752b884e0e93637499b1712a82d39/147_0_5276_3166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fury has been typically loud and colourful in the pre-fight press conferences.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fury has been typically loud and colourful in the pre-fight press conferences.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Shopland/BPI/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The two boxing men know that the Gypsy King will face another brutal test on Saturday night.</p> \n<p>We meet again the following afternoon, at a gym in Henderson, where Fury undertakes a strength-and-conditioning session. He is still friendly but quieter than the previous morning. We sense the looming danger. Fury reveals that, before their first fight, he and Wilder exchanged regular texts \u2013 full of kidology and glee about how much money they would make together. But, since Fury shocked Wilder by getting up from seeming oblivion, the American has not responded to any texts from the Gypsy King. Has he got under Wilder\u2019s skin?</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Fury says. \u201cI don\u2019t read much into all that. I don\u2019t get involved in mind games. I\u2019ve seen Wilder at press conferences and he seemed OK. He knows what he\u2019s got to do. I know what I\u2019ve got to do. That\u2019s it. No more, no less.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lee adds: \u201cTyson\u2019s a gentleman. People don\u2019t see that. A big part of my job is just to talk to Tyson. Our conversations about boxing are relatively small but the conversation about life, about his past and his future aspirations, are much deeper.

      "bodyText": "At the Top Rank gym in Las Vegas, down a little side street called Business Lane, the door is sealed shut by a dustbin that stops it blowing open to the world outside. In this secluded space the old Detroit gang prepare for work on one of the last mornings left before Tyson Fury faces Deontay Wilder for the WBC heavyweight world title. Their first fight, in December 2018, produced an epic battle. Fury\u2019s superior skills seemed to have won him the decision but being knocked down twice by Wilder meant it was called a draw. Both men remain unbeaten, after 43 bouts for Wilder and 30 for Fury, and heavyweight boxing has a compelling decider between two riveting characters. Andy Lee, Fury\u2019s cousin and new assistant trainer, is a former world champion middleweight and one of boxing\u2019s most incisive analysts. In the gym he plays a recording of an iconic fight \u2013 Roberto Duran\u2019s defeat of Sugar Ray Leonard in Montreal 40 years ago this summer. Duran and Leonard were both fighters of huge ego, with their skill supplemented by ferocious will, and a fascinated Fury watches as he skips rope. Contemporary boxing finally has a bout to echo those halcyon days and reach a mainstream audience again. Despite his clear belief Fury will win the rematch in Vegas, and he has predicted that Wilder will be stopped early, Lee is admirably open about why this fight is on a knife edge. \u201cBoth men have huge belief in themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey almost have this God-given right they\u2019re going to win. You can analyse all Tyson\u2019s and Wilder\u2019s words and tactics but you can\u2019t see what\u2019s inside either man. [The late] Emanuel Steward (Lee\u2019s former trainer whose memory binds the Fury camp together] used to say champions were built from the inside. Their mental strength, toughness and resilience is deep inside them. Both Wilder and Tyson have all these qualities.\u201d Lee pauses as the rope whirrs and Fury\u2019s feet dance with light delicacy for a giant heavyweight of 6ft 9in and 270lb. \u201cThere is still something unquantifiable about this fight,\u201d Lee says softly. \u201cWe can\u2019t know for certain who will be the stronger inside. Who will get distracted? Who will dig deeper inside themselves? Who will crack first? I believe Tyson will win but it\u2019s like Duran against Leonard. Who could have predicted exactly what would happen?\u201d Duran won the first encounter but in their Las Vegas rematch five months later, in November 1980, he turned away in humiliating surrender, saying \u201cno m\u00e1s\u201d. Whenever boxing pits two fighters of immense ego and will against each other something elusive and mysterious rises up. In this rematch, the most unquantifiable facet is the Detroit connection between Fury and his new trainers Javan \u2018SugarHill\u2019 Steward and Lee. As they get ready for work on a Tuesday morning the minds of all three men drift back to Detroit and the Kronk gym, where they first hung out together 10 years ago. The Kronk was run by Emanuel Steward, who helped 40 boxers become world champions. One of those was Lee, the Irish middleweight who won the WBO world title in 2014. SugarHill, Emanuel\u2019s nephew, also worked in his great friend Lee\u2019s corner. Fury had flown to Detroit on a whim four years earlier to sample the Kronk\u2019s gritty magic. The bond between this trio, now plotting a way to overcome Wilder\u2019s murderous punching, was forged in the Kronk. \u201cEmanuel asked my dad a year before if I would go to Detroit and train with him,\u201d Fury remembers as SugarHill wraps his massive hands. Fury looks animated as the memories tumble through him. \u201cBut my wife was pregnant and it wasn\u2019t the right time. Then I had another fight and thought: \u2018If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll never know.\u2019 If I didn\u2019t go to Detroit that time, I knew my life would never turn out the way it was meant to do. So, aged 21, I jumped on a plane to Detroit. I didn\u2019t let anyone know I was coming. I flew into Detroit airport, first and only time I\u2019ve been there, and I got a yellow cab and said: \u2018Can you take me to the Kronk gym?\u2019\u201d SugarHill cocks a surprised brow. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe taxi driver finally found the Kronk and I said: \u2018Give me five minutes,\u2019\u201d Fury remembers. \u201cI was going in to see if I was welcome. If I wasn\u2019t I was going straight home. I walked in. SugarHill\u2019s in the ring and I said: \u2018Is Emanuel around?\u2019 Sugar said: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 I told him: \u2018I\u2019m Tyson Fury, the next heavyweight champion of the world.\u2019\u201d That brashness surprised SugarHill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think,\u201d the trainer admits. \u201cHe had hopes of being a world champion and he\u2019s this huge guy with a strange English accent. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I wanted to watch him box to see if he could live up to everything he said.\u201d Fury flexes his wrapped left hand, appreciating Sugar\u2019s work with the tape and gauze. \u201cI\u2019ve always been an outspoken, controversial character,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the shy type. I suppose they weren\u2019t used to seeing this because Americans look at the British as reserved. But I was louder than any American in the Kronk. They thought: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve not seen this before, but we\u2019ll roll with it.\u2019\u201d Emanuel Steward welcomed Fury into his home. He\u2019d done the same a few years earlier when he asked Lee to move from Limerick to Detroit so he could train him at the Kronk. \u201cManny didn\u2019t know me,\u201d Lee chips in from the apron of the ring. \u201cI could\u2019ve been a murderer but he made me feel at home. Manny gave me the bedroom next door to his.\u201d Fury nods. \u201cIt was the same with me. Andy was away when I arrived and straight from the start Manny insisted I stay with him. He said I could stay in Andy\u2019s room. He was a very welcoming old man. Even though I hadn\u2019t met him before, I felt like I knew him 25 years. I\u2019d never had my hands wrapped before fights. Manny took half an hour wrapping these hands every day \u2013 just like Sugar\u2019s doing it.\u201d I\u2019ve sat in the dressing room before a fight with Lee and watched him wrap the hands of his brilliant protege, Paddy Donovan, and there is something hypnotic about the Kronk way. It\u2019s just as easy to get caught up in Fury\u2019s memories of Detroit. \u201cEmanuel used to take me, Sugar and Andy to this special place. It was all boarded up on the outside. But when we went in it was a restaurant and bar full of former Motown singers, and people who didn\u2019t quite make it to Motown. Everybody was singing and it was unbelievable. Best singers I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll sing a song.\u2019 I took the mic and sang Eric Clapton\u2019s Wonderful Tonight. Everyone fell in love with me. I was only a young kid but I was happy getting up in front of this crowd and singing. It felt very natural because I was always very high on me.\u201d His confidence and exuberance hid the mental trauma that nearly destroyed him a few years later. But Steward said Fury was one of the three biggest characters he had met in boxing \u2013 alongside Muhammad Ali and Naseem Hamed. \u201cI only went to Detroit for three weeks,\u201d Fury says nonchalantly, \u201cbut I left a mark. Like a dog pissing on the wall.\u201d Fury left his biggest mark in the ring. \u201cMe and Andy tore up the Kronk one day. I sparred every heavyweight and cleaned up. Andy sparred and beat up everyone under that weight. The old fellas at the side who were ex-champions couldn\u2019t believe it. They were shouting: \u2018Oh my God, I never thought I\u2019d see the day. White boys taking over the Kronk!\u2019\u201d Steward looks up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just two white boys, it was two Gypsies. That\u2019s different. We recognised that, because black and Gypsy fighters feel they have been discriminated against. They have a chip on their shoulder, and always want to prove themselves. Black and Gypsy fighters have that same determined attitude forged in adversity. It\u2019s like when Andy moved to Detroit from Limerick [in 2005] no one but Manny knew who he was. He was just this white kid. Then his boxing, and his similarities to the black community, shone through. That won him approval and made him one of us. Tyson has the same qualities and there\u2019s definitely a bond between black and Gypsy fighters.\u201d The self-proclaimed Gypsy King is as proud of his heritage as Lee \u2013 an unusual figure in boxing who has acted in a Chekhov play in Dublin while sharing his intelligence in an understated way. Their decision to work with Steward stems from a belief that returning to these Kronk roots could make a decisive difference for Fury against Wilder. It might seem strange that Fury would change his awkward and elusive style as he bamboozled Wilder for long stretches of their first fight. The old Kronk strategy, of seeking the knockout above safety-first tactics, might also seem a worrying gamble against a devastating puncher. But Fury is one of the world\u2019s most unconventional boxers, and a daring and unpredictable man who believes he can do pretty much anything. He proved that in the first fight when, having been knocked out for a few seconds in the last round against Wilder, he showed spooky powers of recovery to haul himself up and be in complete control of his amazed opponent once the final bell rang. Ben Davison, the young trainer, did fine work in lifting Fury from the grip of depression to the brink of beating Wilder. But he has been replaced by SugarHill Steward. Davison\u2019s emotional connection with Fury is obvious but Steward has been brought in to instil key technical changes and, in essence, to teach the Gypsy King to throw his punches with more authority. Watching Steward teach Fury behind closed doors is instructive. A routine session becomes a boxing lesson in closing down angles, footwork and the best way to throw a punch. It\u2019s surprising that Fury, who calls himself the linear heavyweight champion of the world after he shocked Wladimir Klitschko to gain control of all the belts in 2015, should need such basic tutelage. But Fury should be respected for his desire to improve in the ring. He admits it has been an adjustment and that initially, despite having fought professionally for 11 years, he felt like \u201ca novice\u201d when he began working with Steward seven weeks ago. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d never had a fight. It was weird but I knew it would come right. I just had to practise everything Sugar taught me. We haven\u2019t worked on what I\u2019m naturally good at. We\u2019ve worked on what I\u2019m not naturally good at and improved. Old tricks of the trade.\u201d An hour later, when Fury, Steward and Lee leave the ring, the education continues. Fury watches the next recording Lee has chosen. The second bout between Aaron Pryor and Alexis Arguello in September 1983 lights up the gym while Lee offers the full context. Pryor had stopped Arguello in the 14th round the previous November, in a bout eventually voted the fight of the decade. For the rematch Pryor brought in Emanuel Steward to replace his controversial trainer Panama Lewis. In his underpants, while towelling himself down, Fury points excitedly to Steward in the corner: \u201cThere\u2019s Manny!\u201d The Gypsy King\u2019s boxing knowledge is fallible and Lee is politely non-committal when Fury suggests Oscar De La Hoya is the greatest fighter in history. But, sitting with Lee and Steward, after Fury has waved goodbye, there is gravitas. Lee, who was instrumental in advising Fury that he should add Steward to his camp, says of the legendary trainer, who died eight years ago: \u201cEmanuel is no longer here, but he would have been the perfect trainer for Tyson. The closest thing to Emanuel now is Sugar. The fundamentals of boxing \u2013 correct balance, correct punching and ring craft \u2013 are not taught now. So that\u2019s why I suggested Sugar because I knew those things would benefit Tyson.\u201d Steward leans forward. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it the way Emanuel taught us. Emanuel would say: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not doing anything special. Just the basics everyone should learn the first day they walk into the gym.\u2019 Today, everybody wants entertainment. They\u2019re bored by the basics. They want to see 35 combinations, which is never going to happen. You just need to master the basic scenarios. Tyson is humble enough to want to get better.\u201d But isn\u2019t it difficult to change some elements of a 31-year-old fighter\u2019s technique with just seven weeks of preparation before the biggest fight of his life? \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult when you work with a person who wants to learn. I\u2019m just teaching him the fundamentals. Emanuel taught me that if you correct those things you can catapult a fighter to another level.\u201d Some people believe Fury has switched from Davison to Steward to save money. Eddie Hearn, Anthony Joshua\u2019s promoter, suggests that there has been acrimony in the camp. Yet, during my two days with Fury\u2019s team, in Vegas and Henderson, the atmosphere seems serene and good-humoured. \u201cI\u2019m smiling every day,\u201d Steward says of all the rumours. \u201cI\u2019m smiling even when it\u2019s windy and cloudy outside.\u201d As for all the speculation that Fury aims to stop Wilder early, and so risks being knocked out himself, Lee talks calmly. \u201cWilder has real power and that\u2019s a great thing. But that power\u2019s not so great when it\u2019s used against you. Sometimes you can wait for that big punch too long. Next thing you know you\u2019re getting outboxed and you\u2019re losing rounds. Or you might throw that big shot and get countered, and next thing you know you\u2019re underground. Your momentum and your own power\u2019s been used against you.\u201d Is Fury hitting harder now? \u201cYes,\u201d Steward says simply. \u201cHis balance has improved. With improved balance comes greater power. By punching at the same time, and countering him before he lands, he can definitely knock Wilder out.\u201d For the first fight Lee was ringside in Los Angeles, commentating on BBC radio with Mike Costello, and afterwards \u201cI went to see Tyson in the dressing room. I was just amazed by him and everything he had done in overcoming the weight loss and depression. The fact they scored the fight a draw was OK. What he had done to get to that position was remarkable.\u201d When it is Steward\u2019s turn to remember where he was that night, he says: \u201cI was in hospital.\u201d I look at him quizzically and he says: \u201cQuebec City. Adonis Stevenson against Oleksandr Gvozdyk. Same night as Fury-Wilder I.\u201d On 1 December 2018, Steward trained Stevenson, a formidable light-heavyweight, a violent and rugged man who lost his WBC world title and almost his life when he was knocked out in the 11th round by Gvozdyk. Stevenson suffered brain damage and slipped into a coma. It\u2019s a chilling reminder of the danger all boxers face. I tell the two trainers that, of all Fury\u2019s revelations, the one that has stayed with me longest is his story about how his wife, Paris, sat down on their hotel bed in LA after they returned from the Wilder fight. She took off her make-up, removed her false finger nails and began to sob. She told her husband she could not bear to watch him go through the same ordeal again. The two boxing men know that the Gypsy King will face another brutal test on Saturday night. We meet again the following afternoon, at a gym in Henderson, where Fury undertakes a strength-and-conditioning session. He is still friendly but quieter than the previous morning. We sense the looming danger. Fury reveals that, before their first fight, he and Wilder exchanged regular texts \u2013 full of kidology and glee about how much money they would make together. But, since Fury shocked Wilder by getting up from seeming oblivion, the American has not responded to any texts from the Gypsy King. Has he got under Wilder\u2019s skin? \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Fury says. \u201cI don\u2019t read much into all that. I don\u2019t get involved in mind games. I\u2019ve seen Wilder at press conferences and he seemed OK. He knows what he\u2019s got to do. I know what I\u2019ve got to do. That\u2019s it. No more, no less.\u201d Lee adds: \u201cTyson\u2019s a gentleman. People don\u2019t see that. A big part of my job is just to talk to Tyson. Our conversations about boxing are relatively small but the conversation about life, about his past and his future aspirations, are much deeper. Special people come along every now and then \u2013 like Elvis Presley, David Bowie or James Brown. Muhammed Ali is the one in boxing. I would have loved to be in his presence. Imagine being alive in those times, with those guys. But here, with Tyson, we\u2019ve got someone special as well. It\u2019s a privilege to be here.\u201d How do he and Steward feel about being in the corner on a tumultuous night in Vegas? \u201cI think both Tyson and Wilder have improved since the first fight,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThey\u2019ve faced each other and they both know how much better they need to be to win.\u201d He looks at his friend from Detroit. \u201cAndy\u2019s been involved in a lot of big fights.\u201d Steward says. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of big fights. Tyson\u2019s been around. Ain\u2019t nothing new for any of us. It\u2019s the same old shit.\u201d Lee smiles. \u201cYeah. The fight happens to be in Vegas but it could be anywhere. We\u2019ve all got one aim \u2013 just to win the fight.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The country\u2019s largest dementia charity, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, has been accused of spending as much as \u00a3750,000 on payouts to staff who agreed to sign non-disclosure agreements, according to a whistleblower complaint leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>The complaint says the use of the NDAs could be seen as an attempt to silence staff at the organisation, which insiders claim has been beset by allegations of bullying and a toxic management culture.</p> <p>One source who spoke to the Guardian separately claimed the charity\u2019s long-serving chief executive officer, Jeremy Hughes, had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour towards staff.</p> <p>It was announced last year that Hughes would be stepping down in April 2020. At the time, the charity was forced to deny his departure was related to claims of bullying which surfaced on social media via an anonymous Twitter account, subsequently deleted.</p> <p>Hughes, who co-chaired a <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-involved/dementia-friendly-communities/organisations/prime-ministers-champion-group\">dementia friendly communities champion</a><a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-involved/dementia-friendly-communities/organisations/prime-ministers-champion-group\"> group</a> for the former prime minister David Cameron, is due to take up a new role as chief executive of Samaritans in May.</p> <p>It has now emerged that a complaint was made to the Charity Commission in February 2018 by a former employee of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. The complaint raised concerns about the use of settlement agreements with non-disclosure provisions and the sums paid to settle claims.</p> <p>Despite the serious nature of the claims, the commission failed to investigate the complaint or even contact the whistleblower \u2013 an oversight the watchdog now admits was a mistake.</p> <p>In the 11-page complaint, the whistleblower said the large payouts by the charity \u201cmay also leave the society open to criticism \u2026 that it is silencing staff and critics of the organisation, undermining its stated values\u201d.</p> <p>The complainant said they were informed \u201cthat the total cost of settlements in the last few years is over \u00a3750,000 for staff leaving the society, all with non-disclosure settlement agreement\u201d.</p> <p>The Alzheimer\u2019s Society claims the figure is inaccurate but declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d.</p> <p>The contents of the whistleblower complaint have emerged amid rising wider concern over the use of NDAs by organisations dealing with staff complaints. A House of Commons report last year warned \u201callegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace are routinely covered up by employers\u201d using NDAs.</p> <p>The charity, which was launched in 1979, invests in dementia care research, runs campaigns and provides 3,000 local support services. It received income of \u00a3107m last year, with \u00a380m from public donations. It has received \u00a32.4m in taxpayers\u2019 money over the last two years.</p> <p>An investigation by the Guardian based on information detailed in the complaint and interviews with former employees reveals claims that:</p> <ul> <li><p>A number of staff were paid off and signed NDAs after submitting bullying complaints about Michael Dent, the charity\u2019s former director of fundraising, who in February last year moved to a senior role at the World Wildlife Fund. Dent did not provide a separate comment.</p></li> <li><p>One former senior member of staff claimed Hughes, who has been chief executive of the charity for nearly a decade, had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour, including shouting at colleagues and undermining them.</p></li> <li><p>A senior manager received a \u00a357,000 payout in 2017 after being accused of discrimination by a junior staff member returning from maternity leave. The money was paid despite an investigation into the complaint finding \u201cmainly \u2026 in favour of the female employee\u201d returning from maternity leave. According to the complaint to the Charity Commission<em><strong>, </strong></em>the settlement also covered the \u00a35,000 cost of the manager\u2019s legal fees and, in addition, approximately \u00a32,500 was paid by the charity to fund counselling sessions for the manager.</p></li> <li><p>The settlements and NDAs were signed off either by Brett Terry, the former director of people and organisational development, or Hughes, in different cases.

      "bodyText": "The country\u2019s largest dementia charity, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, has been accused of spending as much as \u00a3750,000 on payouts to staff who agreed to sign non-disclosure agreements, according to a whistleblower complaint leaked to the Guardian. The complaint says the use of the NDAs could be seen as an attempt to silence staff at the organisation, which insiders claim has been beset by allegations of bullying and a toxic management culture. One source who spoke to the Guardian separately claimed the charity\u2019s long-serving chief executive officer, Jeremy Hughes, had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour towards staff. It was announced last year that Hughes would be stepping down in April 2020. At the time, the charity was forced to deny his departure was related to claims of bullying which surfaced on social media via an anonymous Twitter account, subsequently deleted. Hughes, who co-chaired a dementia friendly communities champion group for the former prime minister David Cameron, is due to take up a new role as chief executive of Samaritans in May. It has now emerged that a complaint was made to the Charity Commission in February 2018 by a former employee of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. The complaint raised concerns about the use of settlement agreements with non-disclosure provisions and the sums paid to settle claims. Despite the serious nature of the claims, the commission failed to investigate the complaint or even contact the whistleblower \u2013 an oversight the watchdog now admits was a mistake. In the 11-page complaint, the whistleblower said the large payouts by the charity \u201cmay also leave the society open to criticism \u2026 that it is silencing staff and critics of the organisation, undermining its stated values\u201d. The complainant said they were informed \u201cthat the total cost of settlements in the last few years is over \u00a3750,000 for staff leaving the society, all with non-disclosure settlement agreement\u201d. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society claims the figure is inaccurate but declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d. The contents of the whistleblower complaint have emerged amid rising wider concern over the use of NDAs by organisations dealing with staff complaints. A House of Commons report last year warned \u201callegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace are routinely covered up by employers\u201d using NDAs. The charity, which was launched in 1979, invests in dementia care research, runs campaigns and provides 3,000 local support services. It received income of \u00a3107m last year, with \u00a380m from public donations. It has received \u00a32.4m in taxpayers\u2019 money over the last two years. An investigation by the Guardian based on information detailed in the complaint and interviews with former employees reveals claims that: A number of staff were paid off and signed NDAs after submitting bullying complaints about Michael Dent, the charity\u2019s former director of fundraising, who in February last year moved to a senior role at the World Wildlife Fund. Dent did not provide a separate comment. One former senior member of staff claimed Hughes, who has been chief executive of the charity for nearly a decade, had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour, including shouting at colleagues and undermining them. A senior manager received a \u00a357,000 payout in 2017 after being accused of discrimination by a junior staff member returning from maternity leave. The money was paid despite an investigation into the complaint finding \u201cmainly \u2026 in favour of the female employee\u201d returning from maternity leave. According to the complaint to the Charity Commission, the settlement also covered the \u00a35,000 cost of the manager\u2019s legal fees and, in addition, approximately \u00a32,500 was paid by the charity to fund counselling sessions for the manager. The settlements and NDAs were signed off either by Brett Terry, the former director of people and organisational development, or Hughes, in different cases. They worked closely with each other and, according to the claims of the senior ex-staffer, \u201cto cross one was to cross them both and to incur their wrath and bullying\u201d. The pair previously worked together at the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Terry moved to a similar role at the NSPCC in January 2018, where he earns \u00a3103,000 a year. He did not provide a separate comment. The charity spent thousands of pounds on hiring the law firm Mishcon de Reya, which worked on the settlement agreements. The complaint claims that in one case, the legal firm charged \u00a31,500 plus VAT and that the market rate for London legal outfits for equivalent work would have been between \u00a3350 and \u00a3500. Claims about the charity\u2019s handling of grievances are detailed in a 2018 complaint to the Charity Commission. A copy of the complaint, seen by the Guardian, flagged concerns about a series of issues, including \u201cthe disproportionate and excessive amounts being wasted on settling matters\u201d and the \u201clack of accountability in the decision-making process to agree to the value of the complaints\u201d. While many complaints made by staff who received settlements and signed NDAs were considered legitimate grievances, the whistleblower expressed concerns that some were not \u2013 meaning the charity was simultaneously viewed as a \u201csoft touch\u201d. The former staffer, whose family also made a donation to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society after their mother died of dementia, added in the document: \u201cI am aghast that charitable donations are being spent so recklessly and without the proper risk assessments or effective governance. My family sincerely regret the donation that we made in light of the use of charitable funds on these unnecessary payments.\u201d Separately, a former senior employee at the charity told the Guardian they were shocked at the behaviour they claim they witnessed by Hughes, who is understood to earn up to \u00a3160,000 a year. \u201cJeremy was well known within the organisation as someone with an explosive temper,\u201d they said, \u201csomeone who didn\u2019t appreciate being questioned even when this was when his staff were trying to understand what he wanted or what decision was being made.\u201d The source alleged they had witnessed many instances of his poor behaviour, including shouting at junior staff and undermining senior staff, including trustees.

The move was mainly intended to benefit people without bank accounts or credit cards. But the rest of us have reason to be grateful, too \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/09/21/study-has-tip-for-waiters-credit-card-logos-serve-them-too/2f13b12f-86d9-4e46-b27d-5d52e96a4619/\" title=\"\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239810637_Do_Payment_Mechanisms_Change_the_Way_Consumers_Perceive_Products\" title=\"\">study</a> shows we spend more when we pay with a card. (Up to 100% more, in the case of one <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008196717017\" title=\"\">experiment</a> involving pricey tickets for sporting events.) Certain wires get crossed in our brains, it seems, and we confuse how easy it is to pay for something with how easily we can afford it.</p> <p>Part of the explanation is that credit cards postpone the unpleasantness of actually paying until the bill arrives. But research on debit cards and digital wallets points to the more intriguing phenomenon of psychological distance: cash just feels more immediately real, and losing it feels more painful. Of course, coins and notes are \u201cvirtual\u201d, too, in the sense that they only have any value thanks to a web of laws and agreements.

      "bodyText": "The other day, New York\u2019s city council voted to make it illegal for businesses to refuse payment in cash. The move was mainly intended to benefit people without bank accounts or credit cards. But the rest of us have reason to be grateful, too \u2013 because study after study shows we spend more when we pay with a card. (Up to 100% more, in the case of one experiment involving pricey tickets for sporting events.) Certain wires get crossed in our brains, it seems, and we confuse how easy it is to pay for something with how easily we can afford it. Part of the explanation is that credit cards postpone the unpleasantness of actually paying until the bill arrives. But research on debit cards and digital wallets points to the more intriguing phenomenon of psychological distance: cash just feels more immediately real, and losing it feels more painful. Of course, coins and notes are \u201cvirtual\u201d, too, in the sense that they only have any value thanks to a web of laws and agreements. But they retain a crucial component of concreteness, demonstrated most clearly by the fact that if you set fire to a \u00a320 note, you really are \u00a320 worse off. I suspect many of us still implicitly interact with cash as though a well-dressed bank manager is sitting on the other side of the cashpoint, hurrying off to fetch your money from a little box with your name on it. It\u2019s much harder to feel so possessive about digital information. And contactless payment? That barely seems more real than simply thinking about making a purchase. Worryingly, I know of no research to suggest that this unreality effect is diminishing as we grow accustomed to a cashless world. Instead, frictionless payment is embedding itself as a prime case of what has been called \u201cthe tyranny of convenience\u201d, whereby technology makes it easier to get what we desire (the fancy new headphones I\u2019ve been coveting, say) but harder to be the kind of person we would rather be (who can manage without fancy headphones). In the useful phrase of the philosopher Harry Frankfurt, it undermines our capacity to \u201cwant what we want to want\u201d. A slightly more down-to-earth way of putting it is just that we\u2019re each a bundle of different, often contradictory desires \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise, nor necessarily even cause for condemnation, that businesses focus on stimulating the ones they can milk for profit. This does mean that, as technology continues to smooth our daily lives, we shall increasingly need to develop a taste for friction, for discovering that very particular, bracing sort of pleasure that comes from embracing minor discomforts \u2013 like making yourself dig through your bag for some actual cash \u2013 rather than always seeking to eliminate them. This is a close cousin of another taste that is equally worth developing: the miserly joy of not buying something that would have made you happy \u2013 because it makes you even happier to deny some corporation the chance to relieve you of your money.

It is taken as a signal that firms are grappling with more orders, such that it is taking longer to fulfil them. In this case, though, the rationale is rather less positive \u2013 and suggests that not all of the rise in the manufacturing PMI is for \u2018good\u2019 reasons.</p> <p>One caveat is that the PMIs can overstate the impact of sudden shocks. The surveys simply tell us how many firms are reporting deteriorating levels of stocks/delivery times, but not necessarily by how much. </p> <p>Either way, it suggests the sector could face a challenging couple of months and we could see a short-term hit to production as a result.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T10:28:37.170Z\">at 10.28am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4f98bc8f08e133247475b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T10:13:25.004Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Industries hit by the coronavirus are expecting governments to step up spending to help offset the economic impacts of the outbreak. </strong></p> <p>At the very least, the IATA airline trade body seems to be pricing in fiscal stimulus over the coming months:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not.</p> <p>Governments will use fiscal and monetary policy to try to offset the adverse economic impacts.

That is also lower than Reuters forecasts for an \u00a311.3bn surplus.

Have a great weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. -KM Billionaire Richard Branson attempted to shrug off coronavirus fears as he promoted the launch of his first cruise ship aimed at young travellers in Dover today. The adult-only cruise ship is meant to have a \u2018festival environment\u2019, featuring sundeck yoga, a vinyl record store, a tattoo studio, 20 restaurants, and a running track, with entertainment including DJ sets and drag queens. The first boat, dubbed the \u201cScarlet Lady\u201d, will be based in the US and Caribbean. Branson said he did not expect its success to be impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Its launch is unfortunate timing. Thousands of passengers have been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship since early February, when 10 people on board were diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain of the disease. Dozens of Britons on board are still waiting to be repatriated. However, Branson believes the cruise industry is set to grow. Obviously what happened in Japan was horrendously unfortunate. But I think the longer-term impact will be negligible. I think the fact that we\u2019re going out of America means that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll suffer. People are booking as much as they\u2019ve ever booked. The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its losses this afternoon. London\u2019s blue chip index is trading just 0.09% lower in afternoon trading, having started the session down by 0.6%. That is despite a 0.4% rise in the pound versus the US dollar, which tends to affect the attractiveness of multinational stocks that benefit when foreign currencies are stronger. The Financial Times (\u00a3) has published the first major interview with former Goldman Sachs boss Lloyds Blankfein since he retired from the CEO role in 2018. Twitter is already alight with some of his more surprising comments, which include insisting that (at least by his measure) he is not rich: Blankfein insists he is \u201cwell-to-do\u201d, not rich. \u201cI can\u2019t even say \u2018rich\u2019,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way. I don\u2019t behave that way.\u201d He says he has an apartment in Miami as well as New York. But he abjures most of the trappings. \u201cIf I bought a Ferrari, I\u2019d be worried about it getting scratched,\u201d he jokes. \u201cKen Griffin [the Chicago-based hedge fund billionaire] buys all these houses. He\u2019s out there every minute, calling the office. It can\u2019t make any sense to people outside.\u201d Despite the positive headlines from the latest PMI reading for the manufacturing sector, there are some warning signals for the road ahead, writes the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Richard Partington. The latest snapshot suggests that the outbreak of the coronavirus in China has weighed on overseas orders for UK factories. In a worrying sign for future output, some orders from clients in Asia have been cancelled altogether. Extended factory shutdowns in China amid quarantine efforts also look to be causing delays in supplies of materials and components to British manufacturers who depend on them, with stocks falling at the fastest pace for more than seven years. In a stark reflection of the troubles ahead, supplier delivery times plunged the most since surveys began in 1992, even exceeding the previous record seen during the UK fuel protests in 2000 when trucks were left standing idle. Manufacturers will no doubt hope the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be lifted soon, lest they face continued disruption that could weigh on output in Britain. Duncan Brock, group director at CIPs, which compiles the survey, notes: These disruptions are threatening global supply chains as businesses look for new supply routes away from the epicentre of the outbreak whilst under pressure to maintain normal business levels. Regardless of whether the UK manufacturing PMI figure is being interpretted by some analysts as a false positive, the pound is now trading nearly half a percent higher against the US dollar at 1.294. (But before you get too excited, that\u2019s only the highest level since...Wednesday) Investors are turning to safe haven assets amid coronavirus fears, sending gold prices to a seven year high of $1,634.27 per ounce this morning. Car sales in China have collapsed by 92% as the coronavirus shutdown wreaks havoc on the automotive industry, writes Mark Sweney. The China Passenger Car Association said that \u201cbarely anybody\u201d has looked to buy cars in the first half of February and most dealerships have remained closed as the coronavirus shutdown takes its toll on businesses across China. The plummeting domestic car sales figures \u2013 96% down in the first week of February and 92% down across the first half of the month \u2013 come days after Jaguar Land Rover revealed it is currently making no sales in China. \u201cThere was barely anybody at car dealers in the first week of February as most people stayed at home,\u201d said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the CPCA. \u201cVery few dealerships opened in the first weeks of February and they have had very little customer traffic.\u201d Only 4,909 cars were sold in the first 16 days of February, down from 59,930 in the same period last year, and in a market where more than 25m cars were sold in 2019. You can read the full story here. Reuters reporter Andy Bruce highlights the same point, that increased delivery times which were factored into UK manufacturing PMI for February actually amount to a \u201cfalse signal on strength\u201d in the figures: ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith says the coronavirus impact on supply chains is overshadowing positive UK PMI data. He notes an \u2018alarming\u2019 drop in the supplier delivery component of the manufacturing PMI survey, which is a sign that deliveries are taking longer to fulfil. While delays are usually a sign that suppliers are struggling to keep up with a boost in orders (often a positive sign), in this case coronavirus is likely the culprit. It follows reports that Chinese factories are being disrupted by closures following the outbreak. He says: Slightly alarmingly, the nine-point drop in the supplier delivery component of the PMI \u2013 a sign that deliveries are taking longer \u2013 is the sharpest month-on-month slide in the survey\u2019s history (since 1992). In normal times, an increase in supplier delivery times would be interpreted as a positive signal. It is taken as a signal that firms are grappling with more orders, such that it is taking longer to fulfil them. In this case, though, the rationale is rather less positive \u2013 and suggests that not all of the rise in the manufacturing PMI is for \u2018good\u2019 reasons. One caveat is that the PMIs can overstate the impact of sudden shocks. The surveys simply tell us how many firms are reporting deteriorating levels of stocks/delivery times, but not necessarily by how much. Either way, it suggests the sector could face a challenging couple of months and we could see a short-term hit to production as a result. Industries hit by the coronavirus are expecting governments to step up spending to help offset the economic impacts of the outbreak. At the very least, the IATA airline trade body seems to be pricing in fiscal stimulus over the coming months: We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not. Governments will use fiscal and monetary policy to try to offset the adverse economic impacts. Some relief may be seen in lower fuel prices for some airlines, depending on how fuel costs have been hedged. The full statement can be found here. Fraser Munro, a public sector finance statistician at the Office for National Statistics, gives some context to the government borrowing figures: The PMI reading has helped push the pound higher, with sterling now trading up 0.3% versus the US dollar. Public sector net borrowing figures (excluding banks) shows the UK posted a smaller than expected budget surplus of \u00a39.8bn in January, down 18% compared to the same time last year. That is also lower than Reuters forecasts for an \u00a311.3bn surplus. The result is likely to put pressure on new chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of the budget on 11 March. (Correction: Apologies for the typo below, where the manufacturing output index figures were mistaken for the manufacturing PMI as a whole. That has been corrected in the original post) Flash estimates for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector, shows output hit its highest level in 10 months with PMI coming in at 51.9. That is compared to January\u2019s reading of 50.0. That\u2019s a solid performance, but it comes with a number of caveats, including warnings that supply chains are being affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The IHS/Markit report explains: There also reports that extended production stoppages in China following the COVID-19 outbreak had weighed on export sales and the receipt of manufacturing components from suppliers. February data pointed to the sharpest month-on-month drop in the suppliers\u2019 delivery times index in nearly three decades of data collection, while pre-production inventories fell to the greatest extent since December 2012. Elsewhere: Activity in the UK services sector fell to a two-month low of 53.3, according to flash PMI estimates for February. That\u2019s compared to January\u2019s reading of 53.9. It left composite PMI for the month unchanged at 53.3. Celebrations over slightly higher-than-expected German factory output may be short-lived. Danske Bank says there has been a drop in shipping activity, signalling a greater fall in manufacturing output. That could feed through into manufacturing PMI data very soon: The eurozone\u2019s PMI data suggests the economy performed reasonably well despite supply chain and travel disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson says: The eurozone economy managed to pick up some momentum again in February despite many companies having been disrupted in various ways by the coronavirus, which caused supply problems and showed signs of hitting travel and tourism numbers in particular. The flash PMI has climbed to a six-month high, consistent with GDP growing at a quarterly rate approaching 0.2%. However, he warned that the outlook is much less certain In particular, the widespread delivery delays seen in February bode ill for production in March unless new deliveries can be secured. While the February survey data are welcome news in a month in which media headlines have been dominated by fears of economic growth being hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, the full immediate impact may not yet be apparent. The euro is edging even higher as investors digest eurozone PMI data for February. Flash manufacturing PMI for the bloc came in better than expected at 49.1 versus forecasts for 47.5. While output declined, it did so at a weaker rate than in January, when the reading came in at 47.9. The service sector also beat its January performance of 52.5, with flash readings showing PMI at 52.8. That\u2019s higher than the Reuters poll which had forecast a figure of 52.2. Market analysts are surprisingly upbeat about the German manufacturing data, which is helping support the eurozone currency. The euro is now trading around 0.3% higher against the US dollar at \u20ac1.08. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, says: Investors are cheerful that the German manufacturing numbers have sharply bounced back up, it certainly strengthens\u2019 the bull case for the Euro. It\u2019s not a bright picture for German manufacturers, as flash manufacturing PMI for February came in below the 50-mark at 47.8. That\u2019s slightly better than the January reading of 45.3 as well as Reuters forecasts for 44.8. Like France, Germany\u2019s service sector expanded but at a weaker rate than expected. Service sector PMI came in at 53.3, lower than January\u2019s 54.2 reading and below the Reuters poll of 53.8. DATA FLASH: French PMI data is a mix-bag Flash manufacturing PMI out of France disappointed, coming in at 49.7 which is below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 50.7. However, the French service sector performed better than forecast, with service sector PMI coming in at 52.6 compared to a Reuters poll for 51.3. Service sector performance supported composite PMI readings for the months, resulting in a measure of 51.9, above forecasts for 51.0. If the coronavirus ends up resulting in a contraction in passenger growth for Asian carriers, it will be reminiscent of the decline that took place at the height of the SARS virus outbreak in 2003. That was the only decline for regional airlines in nearly two decades. European stock markets are in the red at the start of trading: FTSE 100 is down -0.6% German DAX is down -0.6% French CAC 40 is down -0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX is down -0.5% Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world economy, the eurozone, financial markets and business. Airlines have been told to brace for a near $30bn (\u00a323bn) hit to revenues in 2020, as fears over the coronavirus outbreak lowers passenger demand for air travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) trade body has released initial forecasts showing a potential 13% loss in passenger demand for airline carriers in Asia-Pacific. That\u2019s not great news for the region\u2019s airlines, which were only expected to see 4.8% growth for full year. That translates into a $27.8bn revenue loss, the bulk of which will be shouldered by Chinese carriers. Outside the region, global airlines are forecast to lose a further $1.5bn, assuming the loss of demand is focused to markets linked to China. This would bring total global lost revenue to $29.3bn. Alexandre de Juniac, IATA\u2019s Director General and CEO, said: The sharp downturn in demand as a result of COVID-19 will have a financial impact on airlines\u2014severe for those particularly exposed to the China market. We estimate that global traffic will be reduced by 4.7% by the virus, which could more than offset the growth we previously forecast and cause the first overall decline in demand since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. He added: Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes. Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue. This will be a very tough year for airlines.

Lorraine Oliver, a 68-year-old public health nurse in Vegas, has lived in the US for decades but grew up in South Africa: \u201cI\u2019m from one of the \u2018shithole countries\u2019,\u201d she said when asked what the race meant to her, referencing the infamous reports in 2018 of the president\u2019s insults against a number of African nations. \u201cIt is a big affront to me. It\u2019s an affront all of the time.\u201d Oliver, a Warren supporter, said the struggles of the most vulnerable patients she served are a constant reminder of the significance of this race. Whether Trump\u2019s attacks on low-income immigrants\u2019 access to food stamps and the rights of refugees, or his threats to deport Dreamers (immigrants brought to the US as children and protected under Obama), \u201cIt just brings you down, emotionally.\u201d Jocelyn Torres, a 30-year-old who works at a not-for-profit, said it was stressful to even consider the possibility of a second term of the president\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda: \u201cAnother four years of the Trump administration could completely ruin us as a community \u2026 Some people\u2019s lives are on hold. It\u2019s no way to live.\u201d In the final stretch of the race, the candidates have been spending most of their time in Vegas, which is known globally for its casino industry and is often a focal point of state political organizing. Reno, a smaller city 400 miles north of Vegas and not far from Lake Tahoe, has been seen as a crucial region in a swing state. There was less visible campaigning this week in the colder city by snowy mountains, but small groups were coordinating last-minute canvassing trips. On a break from work in downtown Reno, Tanya Duncan said the ongoing hardships facing her parents and her children moved her to vote for Sanders. The 47-year-old financial analyst is taking care of the medical needs of both her parents and said she constantly struggles to make sense of their insurance. \u201cPeople who have more money are getting better-quality care. Money shouldn\u2019t be able to buy health.\u201d Meanwhile, Duncan\u2019s children are both students who will be graduating with huge debts. \u201cThey are not going to be able to survive when they get out of school. It\u2019s horrible. And it\u2019s just not fair.\u201d Laynette Evans, a 67-year-old career coach, who traveled from Reno to Vegas for the presidential debate on Wednesday, noted that the state\u2019s two major cities are the fastest-warming in the US, a trend that has significant and sometimes fatal health consequences. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be around for the worst of it, but I have three children and I want them to have a big future. We\u2019ve already lost so much critical time, which makes it so much harder to achieve what we must in order to prevent the worst.\u201d This week, the Culinary Union, Nevada\u2019s largest and most powerful union, received international attention with a picket outside the Palms casino resort in Vegas that drew appearances from many of the Democratic candidates. \u201cYou\u2019re working full time, 40 hours and you don\u2019t have enough money to pay your bills. It\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Victor Chicas, a 53-year-old union member, who works as a server assistant at a casino restaurant. Chicas grew up in El Salvador and came to the US in 1990 to seek asylum and flee violence in his home country. He said he wanted to see all the Democratic candidates fight to protect immigrants like him and address the daily anxieties his community faces: \u201cWe have a politician come in and do something for immigrants, and then we have another politician come in and take it away. We are in limbo. We don\u2019t know if the eyes of immigration officers will be outside of our doors looking for us.\u201d Rebeca Wolfe, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mother in Reno, who was knocking on doors for Warren on Thursday, said affordable childcare was her number one issue. She was on a seven-month waiting list to get her daughter, now 21 months old, a spot at a daycare. Warren\u2019s passion on the issue gave her a feeling of optimism, she said. But if Trump wins, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear that might be amplified and turned into hopelessness.\u201d Latinos across Reno are united in their anxieties, she added: \u201cEvery single Latino knows someone who came here undocumented or is currently undocumented. So it\u2019s very personal.\u201d Tom Flynn, a 70-year-old retired surgeon also knocking on doors on Thursday in Reno, said his experience with the healthcare industry was one of his motivations for helping with voter outreach. He mentioned people in his life suffering long-term health consequences due to their inability to afford care \u2013 one friend with a lump on his neck that has continued to grow, which he can\u2019t afford to remove; another hit by a drunk driver who was uninsured, who now can\u2019t afford to get back surgery to fix his chronic pain and is no longer employable. The diversity of Nevada\u2019s voters extends beyond the major cities. At the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe, Janet Davis, 59, said she has been organizing to make sure tribal members have easy access to voting. She noted that Trump\u2019s attacks on environmental regulations threatened the protection of her tribe\u2019s water, and that federal budget cuts had hurt local health clinics and other programs. Davis, who was still deciding between Warren and Sanders, said she hoped to see a surge in turnout from Native American voters: \u201cOur numbers can make a difference.\u201d Beyond the policies that target communities like hers, she said she was also eager to see Trump gone because of the way he has eroded the basic rules and standards of his office: \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s not really a democracy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What is the purpose of the Windrush review? It was set up to provide an independent assessment of the events leading up to the Windrush scandal \u2013 particularly from 2008 to March 2018 \u2013 and to identify the key lessons for the Home Office going forward. Among the review\u2019s official objectives is the establishment of the key legislative, policy and operational decisions that led to members of the Windrush generation becoming entangled in measures designed for illegal immigrants. The review will seek to establish why these issues were not identified sooner and what lessons the Home Office can learn. The original aim, as laid out in the terms of reference, was to publish the report by 31 March last year. Who is on the panel behind the review? The review is being led by an independent adviser, Wendy Williams, an inspector with Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS). Williams worked with a small team drawn primarily from the Home Office, headed by a Home Office director who was external to immigration. During the review, Williams was backed up by the Independent Advisory Group (IAG), which was composed of nine members: Dame Ursula Brennan, a retired civil servant and a former permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice; Sandra Dawson, professor emerita of management studies and former director of Judge Business School University of Cambridge; James Hanratty, former chief executive of the Royal Courts of Justice and immigration judge; Sir Peter Housden, chief executive of Nottinghamshire county council; Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust; Loraine Martins, who was Network Rail\u2019s first director of diversity and inclusion; Dr Mike Philips, broadcaster and writer; Seamus Taylor, lecturer in social policy at Maynooth University, Ireland; and Jacqueline McKenzie, an immigration advisor and barrister to the eastern Caribbean supreme court of Grenada. How was the review conducted? The review looked at a broad range of factors surrounding the Windrush scandal. It considered key events over the 10 years to March 2018, such as key immigration policy decisions leading to Windrush, including legislation and the extent to which equalities laws, policy, practice and principles were considered. The review looked at key themes and common factors arising from the handling of individual Windrush generation cases, drawing on information from wider case data and current case reviews, as well as evidence from the compensation scheme and Windrush taskforce meetings. The experience of people impacted by the events \u2013 people from the Windrush generation caught up in these cases, including their families, children and grandchildren, and also people inside the Home Office involved in handling them \u2013 were considered as part of the review. The review used workshops and individual interviews, as well as digital searches of Home Office, inspection reports and parliamentary committee papers, and documents held in the National Archives. Where are we now? The report is currently going through the process of \u201cMaxwellisation\u201d \u2013 the principle under which a report is shown to ministers and officials it is critical of, who are then given the chance to respond.",

      "body": "<p>Kelly Ramsden hardly sleeps a wink when heavy rain is forecast. Last Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/anger-and-fear-across-uk-as-second-storm-breaks-ciara-dennis\">when the army was deployed</a> to Yorkshire\u2019s Calder Valley to build flood defences in preparation for Storm Dennis, the 39-year-old was up half the night fretting.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t have to wait for flood sirens to know if she needs to switch from slippers to wellies. The window of her attic bedroom looks up towards the moors and she can gauge how soggy her kitchen will be by the amount of water rushing down the hillside towards the cobbled alley at the back of her house. From her living room, she can guess whether the River Calder, speeding along just 15 metres away behind a waist-high wall, is going to cause problems downstream in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/yorkshire-residents-criticise-delays-to-flood-defence-scheme\">Hebden Bridge or Mytholmroyd</a>.</p> <p>Just over five years ago, Ramsden moved into a early-19th-century stone cottage on Burnley Road in Todmorden. Since then, she has been flooded six times, most recently on 9 February during Storm Ciara, when a month\u2019s worth of rain fell on the valley in 24 hours.</p> <p>Though a caterer by trade, she becomes a full-time flood defender during times of high rainfall. She knows how to wrench the lid off a blocked storm drain (with brute strength and, ideally, a friend). She knows which \u201cfloodproof doors\u201d should be done for trade descriptions violations (the useless ones Calderdale council paid for in her house at a cost of several thousand pounds). She knows which switches to flick to keep the lights on upstairs when downstairs is underwater. And she has even become a human beaver, making dams to divert water away from her house with five coffee sacks, five huge rubble sacks and eight sandbags.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b6951cc59b06ddedfa1718fa2a34344558f544f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6951cc59b06ddedfa1718fa2a34344558f544f/0_137_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A side road which floods after much rainfall next to a house in Todmorden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A side road which floods after much rainfall next to a house in Todmorden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ff8ba3f26f621357d668722c2d0a479a90fbc8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff8ba3f26f621357d668722c2d0a479a90fbc8d/0_140_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That same road flooded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That same road flooded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelly Ramsden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Thursday night, Ramsden was out in her sparkly wellies and leopard-print leggings, hair divided into Pippi Longstocking plaits, wondering whether to start building the dam again as rain lashed down. Her house had survived Storm Dennis but what about <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/index\">Storm Ellen</a>, expected at any time?</p> <p>Next door, Barbara Campion was in despair. \u201cIt\u2019s hit me harder, psychologically, this time than before,\u201d sighed the 64-year-old, her ground floor still in disarray 10 days after Ciara flooded 1,200 properties in the Calder Valley. In the living room, her dog, Roxy, scuttled around the bare concrete floor: like everyone in this little row of houses, she gave up on carpets several floods ago.</p> <p>She knew she\u2019d been flooded again on the ninth before she even came downstairs: \u201cYou can smell it: damp, stagnant water.\u201d For Campion, who suffers from ME, the stress and cold that comes with flooding causes terrible joint and muscular pain, as well as extreme fatigue.</p> <p>Campion bought the property in July 2017, knowing it had flooded during Boxing Day 2015, along with 3,000 properties across Calderdale. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it would happen again,\u201d she said. Now she feels stuck: \u201cI don\u2019t know where to go next or how to adapt. I mean, it\u2019s not like you can say: \u2018Never mind, I\u2019ll sell up.\u2019 Because you\u2019re not going to get the same money and you\u2019re not going to get anything to replace it.\u201d</p> <p>The cottages have changed hands in recent years for between \u00a373,000 and \u00a3128,000 \u2013 cheap for the area but a big financial burden if no one will buy them. \u201cIt\u2019s hit me this time just how alone I am. The community is brilliant, and the neighbours, but I feel very alone,\u201d said Campion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/todmorden_flood_house/giv-3902HyzqfUVb9Yfu/\" data-alt=\"Map showing River Calder\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/todmorden_flood_house/giv-3902HyzqfUVb9Yfu/\">Map showing River Calder</a> </figure>  <p>Flooding repeatedly is a profoundly depressing experience, said Ramsden. She remembers driving through Mytholmroyd after the Boxing Day floods in 2015 and seeing \u201cgrown men crying\u201d as they threw out their belongings. \u201cI\u2019m quite a worrier anyway, so I lose sleep from it. When it rains I am constantly waking up because I can see the drain that blocks from my bedroom, so I am constantly getting up and checking it and moving things up off the floor all the time, moving the dog upstairs. It\u2019s stressful.\u201d</p> <p>Two doors down, hairdresser Carla Welch was determined to put on a brave face, despite having only three months ago finished renovating her downstairs after the last flood, in July. People keep asking if she regrets buying the house in October 2018. Not at all: \u201cI love living here more after the floods. I know all my neighbours now. I feel very safe here, actually. We all stick together.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike her neighbours, Welch has flood insurance. The company was quick to install two dehumidifiers soon after Ciara swept through the valley, which have been humming away 24/7 ever since in her kitchen and front room. Her premiums are already \u00a350 a month and she is crossing her fingers she\u2019ll be able to renew.</p> <p>The latest flood has already cost Ramsden dearly.

      "bodyText": "Kelly Ramsden hardly sleeps a wink when heavy rain is forecast. Last Saturday, when the army was deployed to Yorkshire\u2019s Calder Valley to build flood defences in preparation for Storm Dennis, the 39-year-old was up half the night fretting. She doesn\u2019t have to wait for flood sirens to know if she needs to switch from slippers to wellies. The window of her attic bedroom looks up towards the moors and she can gauge how soggy her kitchen will be by the amount of water rushing down the hillside towards the cobbled alley at the back of her house. From her living room, she can guess whether the River Calder, speeding along just 15 metres away behind a waist-high wall, is going to cause problems downstream in Hebden Bridge or Mytholmroyd. Just over five years ago, Ramsden moved into a early-19th-century stone cottage on Burnley Road in Todmorden. Since then, she has been flooded six times, most recently on 9 February during Storm Ciara, when a month\u2019s worth of rain fell on the valley in 24 hours. Though a caterer by trade, she becomes a full-time flood defender during times of high rainfall. She knows how to wrench the lid off a blocked storm drain (with brute strength and, ideally, a friend). She knows which \u201cfloodproof doors\u201d should be done for trade descriptions violations (the useless ones Calderdale council paid for in her house at a cost of several thousand pounds). She knows which switches to flick to keep the lights on upstairs when downstairs is underwater. And she has even become a human beaver, making dams to divert water away from her house with five coffee sacks, five huge rubble sacks and eight sandbags. On Thursday night, Ramsden was out in her sparkly wellies and leopard-print leggings, hair divided into Pippi Longstocking plaits, wondering whether to start building the dam again as rain lashed down. Her house had survived Storm Dennis but what about Storm Ellen, expected at any time? Next door, Barbara Campion was in despair. \u201cIt\u2019s hit me harder, psychologically, this time than before,\u201d sighed the 64-year-old, her ground floor still in disarray 10 days after Ciara flooded 1,200 properties in the Calder Valley. In the living room, her dog, Roxy, scuttled around the bare concrete floor: like everyone in this little row of houses, she gave up on carpets several floods ago. She knew she\u2019d been flooded again on the ninth before she even came downstairs: \u201cYou can smell it: damp, stagnant water.\u201d For Campion, who suffers from ME, the stress and cold that comes with flooding causes terrible joint and muscular pain, as well as extreme fatigue. Campion bought the property in July 2017, knowing it had flooded during Boxing Day 2015, along with 3,000 properties across Calderdale. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it would happen again,\u201d she said. Now she feels stuck: \u201cI don\u2019t know where to go next or how to adapt. I mean, it\u2019s not like you can say: \u2018Never mind, I\u2019ll sell up.\u2019 Because you\u2019re not going to get the same money and you\u2019re not going to get anything to replace it.\u201d The cottages have changed hands in recent years for between \u00a373,000 and \u00a3128,000 \u2013 cheap for the area but a big financial burden if no one will buy them. \u201cIt\u2019s hit me this time just how alone I am. The community is brilliant, and the neighbours, but I feel very alone,\u201d said Campion. Flooding repeatedly is a profoundly depressing experience, said Ramsden. She remembers driving through Mytholmroyd after the Boxing Day floods in 2015 and seeing \u201cgrown men crying\u201d as they threw out their belongings. \u201cI\u2019m quite a worrier anyway, so I lose sleep from it. When it rains I am constantly waking up because I can see the drain that blocks from my bedroom, so I am constantly getting up and checking it and moving things up off the floor all the time, moving the dog upstairs. It\u2019s stressful.\u201d Two doors down, hairdresser Carla Welch was determined to put on a brave face, despite having only three months ago finished renovating her downstairs after the last flood, in July. People keep asking if she regrets buying the house in October 2018. Not at all: \u201cI love living here more after the floods. I know all my neighbours now. I feel very safe here, actually. We all stick together.\u201d Unlike her neighbours, Welch has flood insurance. The company was quick to install two dehumidifiers soon after Ciara swept through the valley, which have been humming away 24/7 ever since in her kitchen and front room. Her premiums are already \u00a350 a month and she is crossing her fingers she\u2019ll be able to renew. The latest flood has already cost Ramsden dearly. She runs her vegan and vegetarian catering company, Beets and Beans, from her kitchen, which has been out of action for almost two weeks. She supplements that income by working in a basement bar in Hebden Bridge, Nelson\u2019s, which has been closed since Storm Ciara. She has applied for grants: earlier this week, the government said it would fund up to \u00a3500 in financial hardship payments for flood-hit households and grants of up to \u00a32,500 for small-to-medium sized businesses that have \u201csuffered severe, uninsurable losses\u201d. Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said he was sorry to hear of Ramsden and her neighbours\u2019 concerns and would respond as soon as possible. He insisted the council regularly clears drains and gullies, particularly when heavy rain is forecast. \u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cduring periods of intense rain and flood events, gullies can become overwhelmed, as they are not designed for flood water drainage.\u201d He added: \u201cAlthough the council and dozens of other organisations and communities are doing a massive amount of work to reduce risk and boost resilience, there is only so much we can do to limit damage during major floods, and we always urge individual residents and businesses to do all they can to be prepared and protect themselves and their property.\u201d Everyone in Calderdale has their own theory of what causes the flooding.

The protest seemed to work, and on Friday Natural England said it would be conducting a site visit to the moor next week and would work with Treesponsibility on solutions. Ramsden would like more help. \u201cI knew when I moved to Todmorden it could flood and I\u2019m prepared to manage my house as good as I possibly can. But I need help with the drains and the building behind the house.

Even in London, which has had smoke control areas for more than 60 years, wood burning accounts for up to 31% of PM2.5, according to a study by King\u2019s College. <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/every-londoner-is-exposed-to-dangerous-toxic-air\">The mayor\u2019s office says</a> almost 8 million residents of the city live in places where this form of air pollution exceeds World Health Organization guidelines by at least 50%.

This change means some people may have to pay more to heat their homes. Worst affected are likely to be former coalmining communities where sales of relatively cheap local supplies will be prohibited, and low-income residents in the countryside.

The government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/air-quality-using-cleaner-fuels-for-domestic-burning/outcome/summary-of-responses-and-government-response\">says this problem is overstated</a> because coal can be replaced by manufactured solid fuels that are more economical and have lower levels of sulphur and other pollutants.</p> <h2><strong>Will it make a difference to air quality?</strong></h2> <p>These measures will help, but they should only be a start.

      "body": "<p>The footage of a suited Jimmy Greaves trying to celebrate with his England teammates while they dance around Wembley with the World Cup makes for painful viewing. As BT Sport\u2019s excellent documentary explains, Spurs\u2019 record goalscorer had just about got over a kick in a group game \u2013 his second recovery after getting over hepatitis that season. Alf Ramsey stuck with Geoff Hurst and you could argue it turned out to be a sensible decision.</p> <p>The 1966 World Cup was the last without substitutes. With extra time, surely Ramsey would have given Greaves 20 minutes. When those people were on the pitch thinking it was all over, Jimmy wouldn\u2019t have lamped it into the top left-hand corner \u2013 it wasn\u2019t his style. He would have just passed it in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/20/manchester-city-offer-an-olive-branch-now-uefa-holds-all-the-power\">Manchester City offer an olive branch now Uefa holds all the power | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My dad\u2019s obsession with Jimmy Greaves and his determination to brainwash me mean I\u2019ve heard that sentence a thousand times. It\u2019s become a parody. Spurs game ends, the phone rings \u2013 and eventually he\u2019ll tell me how Greaves would have finished that missed chance. The culprit may have changed over the years \u2013 Falco, Armstrong, Rebrov, Pavlyuchenko, Rasiak, Parrott (well not yet, but soon) but the outcome is always the same. Jimmy Greaves would have scored.</p> <p>Watching him glide over those mud bogs of the 60s stirred up a joy and happiness way beyond you would imagine for a man I never saw play. And deep down I hold Ramsey in some kind of contempt for not selecting him for the final.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If an oil-rich state bought Cambridge and abused FFP, I would probably stick my head in the sand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The case against is strong. Hurst scored a hat-trick, England won the World Cup, I wasn\u2019t born for another 13 years. But still my brain tells me that it should have been Greaves. Such is the irrational mind of a football fan. And it might seem quite the leap to get from Wembley 1966 to Manchester City\u2019s Champions League ban, from Alf to Sheikh Mansour \u2013 but it helps me sympathise with the section of City fans who genuinely believe that there is a Uefa conspiracy against them.</p> <p>There clearly is not one. With all the evidence at our disposal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/20/manchester-city-offer-an-olive-branch-now-uefa-holds-all-the-power\" title=\"\">it is evident that City broke the rules</a>. Rules they had signed up for. And then misled Uefa about breaking the rules. It\u2019s hard to be petty and aggressive at the same time, yet City\u2019s response has been both. They continue to call them allegations when they are verdicts.</p> <p>City players and even Pep Guardiola should feel let down by the owner \u2013 perhaps privately they do. But for supporters it isn\u2019t that simple. It is very hard to unpick that unswerving loyalty.</p> <p>Those playing the Uefa agenda card will not be the first to get it wrong \u2013 to side with their club or their player when they shouldn\u2019t. A large number of Liverpool\u2019s fanbase supported Luis Su\u00e1rez over the Patrice Evra incident. As Jamie Carragher admitted this season, they were wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84519ea069a13d6956025d00d699e9196a95e145\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84519ea069a13d6956025d00d699e9196a95e145/0_0_5104_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City fans get the banners out at their home game against West Ham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City fans get the banners out at their home game against West Ham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are Manchester City fans who believe with total conviction that Uefa, and the highly experienced adjudicatory committee, are all prepared to risk their reputations with this verdict because they don\u2019t like Manchester City. It is a stretch to suggest the former prime minister of Belgium really is that irked by City fans booing the Champions League anthem.</p> <p>Meanwhile opposing fans are revelling in City\u2019s turmoil, not necessarily because it is the right decision but simply because it is not their club.</p> <p>There might be a strange beauty in Mourinho picking up a Premier League title for that season at Old Trafford, or Steven Gerrard lifting the trophy before Jordan Henderson gets the chance to do it. But you wonder if those Liverpool and Manchester United fans claiming those honours would be equally open to handing theirs back if their owners had committed some sort of financial misdemeanour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/20/manchester-city-uefa-champions-league-players\">Time passes fast in football, so will Manchester City players want to stay? | Eni Aluko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere lower-league fans like seeing any club who have spent loads of money get some sort of comeuppance. We all love the rules when they count against someone else. And we rail against them when they hit our own.</p> <p>That tribalism infects every part of football. We watch games differently: the same action, the same moves, the same goals, viewed through completely different lenses. We study our team and ignore the opposition. It\u2019s our good play or our mistakes \u2013 as if the opposition are just the supporting cast.</p> <p>Off the pitch it is the same. The officials, the authorities, the media conspire against your team, against you. I remember chatting to a half-cut Manchester United fan at Cluj years ago who told me I was \u201ceverything that is wrong with football\u201d. He may well have had a point about that. But he went on to say, with complete and utter certainty: \u201cThe thing is this, everyone is against us.\u201d</p> <p>I understand why City fans want an alternative truth. If an oil-rich state bought Cambridge United and abused FFP, however much I claim that I would vehemently criticise it, I would probably stick my head in the sand and hope we bought our way into the Premier League. I would be happy for [redacted] to sponsor the Habbin stand for \u00a3100m and start competing with Internazionale for ageing Premier League stars who still have something to offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pundits in warm TV and radio studios criticised Southampton fans for leaving early when Leicester went seven- or eight-nil up in the sideways rain on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that Friday night at St Mary\u2019s</a>. It is much easier for journalists and opposition fans to criticise City for breaking the rules than it is for their own fans to accept it.</p> <p>So we should sympathise with City fans. Even those who are determined to believe the club \u2013 however difficult it might be. They had no choice who bought them. They have no choice in how their club is run.</p> <p>Those City fans who have been critical of their club deserve our respect, too. I\u2019d love to say I\u2019d do the same \u2013 but until it happens, I don\u2019t know if my irrational love for my club would outweigh my belief in right and wrong. If I can\u2019t get over Jimmy Greaves not starting in the World Cup final then I\u2019m not convinced I would be first in line to hammer Cambridge if they sell their ground back to their owner to balance the books.

      "bodyText": "The footage of a suited Jimmy Greaves trying to celebrate with his England teammates while they dance around Wembley with the World Cup makes for painful viewing. As BT Sport\u2019s excellent documentary explains, Spurs\u2019 record goalscorer had just about got over a kick in a group game \u2013 his second recovery after getting over hepatitis that season. Alf Ramsey stuck with Geoff Hurst and you could argue it turned out to be a sensible decision. The 1966 World Cup was the last without substitutes. With extra time, surely Ramsey would have given Greaves 20 minutes. When those people were on the pitch thinking it was all over, Jimmy wouldn\u2019t have lamped it into the top left-hand corner \u2013 it wasn\u2019t his style. He would have just passed it in. My dad\u2019s obsession with Jimmy Greaves and his determination to brainwash me mean I\u2019ve heard that sentence a thousand times. It\u2019s become a parody. Spurs game ends, the phone rings \u2013 and eventually he\u2019ll tell me how Greaves would have finished that missed chance. The culprit may have changed over the years \u2013 Falco, Armstrong, Rebrov, Pavlyuchenko, Rasiak, Parrott (well not yet, but soon) but the outcome is always the same. Jimmy Greaves would have scored. Watching him glide over those mud bogs of the 60s stirred up a joy and happiness way beyond you would imagine for a man I never saw play. And deep down I hold Ramsey in some kind of contempt for not selecting him for the final. The case against is strong. Hurst scored a hat-trick, England won the World Cup, I wasn\u2019t born for another 13 years. But still my brain tells me that it should have been Greaves. Such is the irrational mind of a football fan. And it might seem quite the leap to get from Wembley 1966 to Manchester City\u2019s Champions League ban, from Alf to Sheikh Mansour \u2013 but it helps me sympathise with the section of City fans who genuinely believe that there is a Uefa conspiracy against them. There clearly is not one. With all the evidence at our disposal, it is evident that City broke the rules. Rules they had signed up for. And then misled Uefa about breaking the rules. It\u2019s hard to be petty and aggressive at the same time, yet City\u2019s response has been both. They continue to call them allegations when they are verdicts. City players and even Pep Guardiola should feel let down by the owner \u2013 perhaps privately they do. But for supporters it isn\u2019t that simple. It is very hard to unpick that unswerving loyalty. Those playing the Uefa agenda card will not be the first to get it wrong \u2013 to side with their club or their player when they shouldn\u2019t. A large number of Liverpool\u2019s fanbase supported Luis Su\u00e1rez over the Patrice Evra incident. As Jamie Carragher admitted this season, they were wrong. There are Manchester City fans who believe with total conviction that Uefa, and the highly experienced adjudicatory committee, are all prepared to risk their reputations with this verdict because they don\u2019t like Manchester City. It is a stretch to suggest the former prime minister of Belgium really is that irked by City fans booing the Champions League anthem. Meanwhile opposing fans are revelling in City\u2019s turmoil, not necessarily because it is the right decision but simply because it is not their club. There might be a strange beauty in Mourinho picking up a Premier League title for that season at Old Trafford, or Steven Gerrard lifting the trophy before Jordan Henderson gets the chance to do it. But you wonder if those Liverpool and Manchester United fans claiming those honours would be equally open to handing theirs back if their owners had committed some sort of financial misdemeanour. Elsewhere lower-league fans like seeing any club who have spent loads of money get some sort of comeuppance. We all love the rules when they count against someone else. And we rail against them when they hit our own. That tribalism infects every part of football. We watch games differently: the same action, the same moves, the same goals, viewed through completely different lenses. We study our team and ignore the opposition. It\u2019s our good play or our mistakes \u2013 as if the opposition are just the supporting cast. Off the pitch it is the same. The officials, the authorities, the media conspire against your team, against you. I remember chatting to a half-cut Manchester United fan at Cluj years ago who told me I was \u201ceverything that is wrong with football\u201d. He may well have had a point about that. But he went on to say, with complete and utter certainty: \u201cThe thing is this, everyone is against us.\u201d I understand why City fans want an alternative truth. If an oil-rich state bought Cambridge United and abused FFP, however much I claim that I would vehemently criticise it, I would probably stick my head in the sand and hope we bought our way into the Premier League. I would be happy for [redacted] to sponsor the Habbin stand for \u00a3100m and start competing with Internazionale for ageing Premier League stars who still have something to offer. Pundits in warm TV and radio studios criticised Southampton fans for leaving early when Leicester went seven- or eight-nil up in the sideways rain on that Friday night at St Mary\u2019s. It is much easier for journalists and opposition fans to criticise City for breaking the rules than it is for their own fans to accept it. So we should sympathise with City fans. Even those who are determined to believe the club \u2013 however difficult it might be. They had no choice who bought them. They have no choice in how their club is run. Those City fans who have been critical of their club deserve our respect, too. I\u2019d love to say I\u2019d do the same \u2013 but until it happens, I don\u2019t know if my irrational love for my club would outweigh my belief in right and wrong. If I can\u2019t get over Jimmy Greaves not starting in the World Cup final then I\u2019m not convinced I would be first in line to hammer Cambridge if they sell their ground back to their owner to balance the books. We find ways to justify our hypocrisy in many aspects of our lives. Football isn\u2019t an exception. Greavsie is on BT Sport 3 at 7.30pm on Saturday",

      "body": "<p>If ever there was a drink with a bad rep, it\u2019s lager \u2013 a style that\u2019s been demonised by real-ale drinkers, incorrectly labelled as chemical swill and considered the lowest of the low in the beer world. But all that is now changing, and lager is at last reclaiming its heritage.</p> <p>Lager is less a style and more a process, which is not just me being a nerd (though I am). We get the word from the German \u201c<em>lagerung</em>\u201d, which means \u201cstorage\u201d, and beers made using that method are head and shoulders above the shortcuts used by bigger brands.</p> <p>In reality, what lagering means is that the beer is left in a cold maturation environment for at least a month, which rounds it out and allows for the reabsorption of the fermentation byproducts that can cause an extra-fuzzy head. This takes time and money, so such beers can\u2019t be sold via the pile \u2019em high and sell \u2019em cheap method we\u2019ve come to associate with lager. There are even companies out there, such as Cotswold Brew Co, now taking things to remarkable lengths with the likes of its eight month-matured <strong>Munich Helles </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.cotswoldbrewco.co/product-page/munich-helles\" title=\"\">\u00a330 for 12 x 330ml bottles</a>, cotswoldbrewco.co, 6.5%).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/feb/04/96-pound-bottle-of-beer-expensive-as-vintage-wine\">\u00a396 a bottle: the exotic beer that is as expensive as vintage wine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lagers are a far broader church than the fizzy, yellow stuff we have become so familiar with. They range from primrose-yellow through conker-brown to stygian-black, and have a cornucopia of flavours from herbaceous helles to rye-bready bocks and coffee-laden <em>schwarzbiers</em>. They can also reach dizzying heights in alcohol content \u2013 especially the deep, fruity and boozy <em>eisbocks</em>, for which freezing is employed to concentrate the alcohol, and which results in complex and elegant offerings \u2013 for instance, <strong>Kulmbacher Eisbock</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.beersofeurope.co.uk/beer/country/germany/kulmbacher-eisbock\" title=\"\">\u00a33 for \u00a3330ml, beersofeurope.co.uk</a>, 9.2%) \u2013 that can be enjoyed as a digestif or paired with a good, poky cheese.</p> <p>There are also more hop-forward, modern lagers that taste almost like a pale ale but still have all the refreshing drinkability you expect from a lager: try Camden Brewery\u2019s <strong>Show Off</strong> (<a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Camden-Show-Off-Juicy-Lager/457384011\" title=\"\">\u00a31.95 for 330ml, Morrisons</a>; 5.8%) or, seeing as it\u2019s currently New Zealand beer month, go for an excellent import in the form of Deep Creek\u2019s <strong>Undercurrent Pilsner</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.beerhawk.co.uk/deep-creek-undercurrent-pilsner\" title=\"\">\u00a32.59 for 330ml, beerhawk.co.uk</a>; 5%).</p> <p>Believe it or not, there are even genuinely enjoyable alcohol-free options out there, too. Under EU regulations, anything at 0.5% and below counts as alcohol-free, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> means our laws may change. Try <strong><a href=\"https://luckysaint.co/products/0-5-unfiltered-lager\" title=\"\">Lucky Saint</a> </strong>(\u00a31.80 for 330ml, Sainsbury\u2019s, 0.5%), or <strong><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/big-drop-low-alcohol-lager-431198011\" title=\"\">Big Drop Lager</a></strong> (\u00a31.30 for 330ml at Ocado; 0.5%). And, while not technically alcohol-free but at just 1% abv, <strong>Original Small Beer Dark Lager</strong> is also a very tasty drop (\u00a32.15 for 330ml, Ocado).</p> <p>So, next time someone tells you that lager is just for louts, get them to try one of the new breed and don\u2019t be surprised if they ask for more.</p> <h2>Four lagers to change your mind</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"sgsryj\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"def4eac87613d21b709318bd1c8aa4c4d0b48847\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/def4eac87613d21b709318bd1c8aa4c4d0b48847/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lost and Grounded Keller Pils\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Lost &amp; Grounded Keller Pils</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/lost-and-grounded-keller-pils/823634-692475-692476\" title=\"\">\u00a32.50 for 440ml Waitrose</a>, 4.8%.</p> <p>Bready, peppery, lightly bitter and ridiculously drinkable, this beer ticks all the boxes for sophisticated lager lovers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"xfdghfh\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Donzoko Northern Helles</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b05ee23dccc5e6eb531a893d73e009cff8cee439\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05ee23dccc5e6eb531a893d73e009cff8cee439/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donzoko Northern Helles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://shop.hopburnsblack.co.uk/collections/beers/products/donzokonorthernhelleslagerunfilteredlager42440mlcan\" title=\"\">\u00a33.60 for 440ml hopburnsblack.co.uk</a>, 4.2%.</p> <p>Brisk, lightly acidic and with a grapefruit and lily nose \u2013 a newcomer, and an accomplished one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"asgdghlkj\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0a71a141faffbad5fc446dcc8d3e7fdba6e72eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a71a141faffbad5fc446dcc8d3e7fdba6e72eb/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Austell Korev\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>St Austell Korev</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/St-Austell-Brewery-Korev-Cornish-Lager-Abv-48/407373011\" title=\"\">\u00a31.75 for 500ml Morrisons</a>, 4.8%.</p> <p>Named after the Cornish for \u2018beer\u2019, this is an easy-drinking delight with a bop of grassy bitterness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spacer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ed1b082314a3724c4cb2fb4a6e9255573edb2e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed1b082314a3724c4cb2fb4a6e9255573edb2e6d/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Basecamp Pils\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Basecamp Pils</strong>,</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/303261428\" title=\"\">\u00a37 for a 330ml six-pack Tesco</a>, 4.7%. </p> <p>Guaranteed crowdpleaser with a floral aroma and smooth finish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"asf[asjhgf\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Fiona Becket is away.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "If ever there was a drink with a bad rep, it\u2019s lager \u2013 a style that\u2019s been demonised by real-ale drinkers, incorrectly labelled as chemical swill and considered the lowest of the low in the beer world. But all that is now changing, and lager is at last reclaiming its heritage. Lager is less a style and more a process, which is not just me being a nerd (though I am). We get the word from the German \u201clagerung\u201d, which means \u201cstorage\u201d, and beers made using that method are head and shoulders above the shortcuts used by bigger brands. In reality, what lagering means is that the beer is left in a cold maturation environment for at least a month, which rounds it out and allows for the reabsorption of the fermentation byproducts that can cause an extra-fuzzy head. This takes time and money, so such beers can\u2019t be sold via the pile \u2019em high and sell \u2019em cheap method we\u2019ve come to associate with lager. There are even companies out there, such as Cotswold Brew Co, now taking things to remarkable lengths with the likes of its eight month-matured Munich Helles (\u00a330 for 12 x 330ml bottles, cotswoldbrewco.co, 6.5%). Lagers are a far broader church than the fizzy, yellow stuff we have become so familiar with. They range from primrose-yellow through conker-brown to stygian-black, and have a cornucopia of flavours from herbaceous helles to rye-bready bocks and coffee-laden schwarzbiers. They can also reach dizzying heights in alcohol content \u2013 especially the deep, fruity and boozy eisbocks, for which freezing is employed to concentrate the alcohol, and which results in complex and elegant offerings \u2013 for instance, Kulmbacher Eisbock (\u00a33 for \u00a3330ml, beersofeurope.co.uk, 9.2%) \u2013 that can be enjoyed as a digestif or paired with a good, poky cheese. There are also more hop-forward, modern lagers that taste almost like a pale ale but still have all the refreshing drinkability you expect from a lager: try Camden Brewery\u2019s Show Off (\u00a31.95 for 330ml, Morrisons; 5.8%) or, seeing as it\u2019s currently New Zealand beer month, go for an excellent import in the form of Deep Creek\u2019s Undercurrent Pilsner (\u00a32.59 for 330ml, beerhawk.co.uk; 5%). Believe it or not, there are even genuinely enjoyable alcohol-free options out there, too. Under EU regulations, anything at 0.5% and below counts as alcohol-free, though Brexit means our laws may change. Try Lucky Saint (\u00a31.80 for 330ml, Sainsbury\u2019s, 0.5%), or Big Drop Lager (\u00a31.30 for 330ml at Ocado; 0.5%). And, while not technically alcohol-free but at just 1% abv, Original Small Beer Dark Lager is also a very tasty drop (\u00a32.15 for 330ml, Ocado). So, next time someone tells you that lager is just for louts, get them to try one of the new breed and don\u2019t be surprised if they ask for more. Four lagers to change your mind Lost &amp; Grounded Keller Pils \u00a32.50 for 440ml Waitrose, 4.8%. Bready, peppery, lightly bitter and ridiculously drinkable, this beer ticks all the boxes for sophisticated lager lovers. Donzoko Northern Helles \u00a33.60 for 440ml hopburnsblack.co.uk, 4.2%. Brisk, lightly acidic and with a grapefruit and lily nose \u2013 a newcomer, and an accomplished one. St Austell Korev \u00a31.75 for 500ml Morrisons, 4.8%. Named after the Cornish for \u2018beer\u2019, this is an easy-drinking delight with a bop of grassy bitterness. Basecamp Pils, \u00a37 for a 330ml six-pack Tesco, 4.7%. Guaranteed crowdpleaser with a floral aroma and smooth finish. Fiona Becket is away.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Are some people more at risk?</strong></h2> \n<p>Heymann said that who succumbs to the infection and who shrugs it off is often down to individual differences in the body\u2019s response to the virus.</p> \n<p>Some groups have a greater risk than others. \u201cAt the moment it appears that people who are at greater risk are the elderly and probably the very young,\u201d said Pankhania.</p> \n<p>But, he added, \u201cyou cannot have that only the elderly and the very young will die, it is part of the natural history of such infections that we will get deaths across the age ranges \u2026 The same pathophysiology can happen in the young as in the old.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Are doctors more at risk of infection than </strong><strong>non-medical </strong><strong>staff?</strong></h2> \n<p>In short, yes. \u201cIt is not surprising that fellow clinical colleagues have got infected and some have died,\u201d said Pankhania, noting that medical professionals were in a special situation as they had multiple potential exposures to infection.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have got infection control in place, however if you are forever being targeted, on the one rare occasion where your guard slipped, you get infected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like being in the battlefield \u2013 no matter how much protection you have, a stray bullet can catch you sometimes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Such a slip, he added, was not surprising. \u201cA minor slip is eminently possible, especially when you are working under stress, you are tired, you have done long hours and your guard falls \u2013 and you get infected,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>Repeated exposure puts you more at risk of contracting the virus, but does it make an infection worse?</strong></h2> \n<p>Pankhania said that at present it was thought there was only one form of the virus in circulation, so doctors were not being exposed to a more serious strain. </p> \n<p>But Heymann said that if doctors did become exposed to the virus, it might be in a higher dose than would have occurred in a social context \u2013 for example, they might come into contact with bodily fluids. \u201cIf there is a massive inoculum of virus, that could make it a more overwhelming infection,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/could-the-coronavirus-mutate-if-a-vaccine-cant-be-found-in-time\">Could the coronavirus mutate if a vaccine can't be found in time?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Doctors are often exposed to all sorts of illness and disease from patients \u2013 could this make them more at risk of having a severe coronavirus infection?</strong></h2> \n<p>That is a tricky question.

      "bodyText": "Eamonn McManus believes victory for St Helens against the NRL\u2019s Sydney Roosters in Saturday night\u2019s World Club Challenge would represent the greatest achievement by a British side in the competition\u2019s history. The Roosters are the heavy favourites to win the annual match between rugby league\u2019s two major champions and are looking to become the first team to win the event on consecutive occasions. That, and a number of injuries to key Saints players, has left McManus in no doubt about the scale of what St Helens could achieve in front of a sellout crowd at the Totally Wicked Stadium. \u201cI think it would be at the top for British teams,\u201d the Saints chairman said. \u201cBy definition this is the most successful team in the NRL, given the fact they\u2019ve gone back-to-back there and are favourites to go on and get the treble. They\u2019re probably the best team we\u2019ve seen in the NRL for a while. \u201cThey have the cream of Australia, New Zealand and Polynesia to pick from, and we\u2019re a little town of 120,000 people or so, with most of the players produced by our academy. You don\u2019t get match-ups like that in any other sport.\u201d Saints are aiming to win the World Club Challenge for the first time since 2007, having suffered a heavy defeat against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2015, and McManus admitted: \u201cOur non-performance against the Rabbitohs still stings. It\u2019s been a long time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d The St Helens captain, James Roby, is expected to make his first appearance since October\u2019s Grand Final after recovering from groin surgery. The hooker said: \u201cI was determined to be back for this game, this was the best-case scenario. We\u2019re expecting the best Roosters and we\u2019ll hopefully be the best St Helens team we can be.\u201d The future of the showpiece match is again up for debate after the Sydney coach, Trent Robinson, called on the NRL to mirror Super League\u2019s commitment to the competition. McManus, as one of the prominent club owners in the British game, echoed that sentiment but said there is a sure way to spark Australian interest. \u201cThe one thing they do not like is losing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Roosters have rightly come over and take it seriously, and you wonder if they lose, will more people back there perhaps take it seriously? \u201cThey\u2019re the benchmark in the NRL and the contact between the competitions has to improve. The more contact there is, the better the standards will get. Nothing will capture attention on both sides of the world more than an English team beating an Australian one, be that at club or international level. \u201cFor whatever reason, this game is unnecessarily and wrongly understated each year. It\u2019s the meeting of the best clubs sides in the world, so it definitely matters.\u201d Wolfpack comeback denied at Warrington Toronto are still awaiting their first Super League victory after falling to a 32-22 defeat in a hard-fought clash at Warrington. The Wolfpack had Sonny Bill Williams back in the starting line-up after attending the birth of his fourth child last week but the hosts eased into a 16-0 lead after 30 minutes when Josh Charnley, Gareth Widdop and Tom Lineham all crossed but the Canadian outfit hit back with two first-half tries. Jon Wilkin and Andy Ackers crossed either side of a Matty Ashton score to leave Toronto trailing by 10 points at the break. Toronto winger Matty Russell started the second-half scoring to cut the lead to 22-16 and the visitors were level with 24 minutes remaining when Gareth O\u2019Brien strolled under the posts. However, two Stefan Ratchford penalties and a late Ben Murdoch-Masila try proved enough. Long-serving forward Oliver Holmes marked his 200th appearance for Castleford with the clinching try as the Tigers cruised to a 14th successive derby win over Wakefield by a scoreline of 32-15. Trinity were poised to end their five-year losing streak when they led 15-14 at half-time but paid a high price for the sin-binning of substitute James Batchelor. Castleford are second-placed behind Huddersfield in the early-season table, after the Giants won 22-4 at Hull Kingston Rovers.",

But Yuhan said many of her friends\u2019 families would not leave the house at all. \u201cMy grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it\u2019s sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.\u201d Shanghai In the country\u2019s most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs. Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire. \u201cThe worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school has said they can\u2019t do anything \u2013 they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it\u2019s illegal not to cancel their visas if they\u2019re not working.\u201d Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged \u00a36 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants\u2019 allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them. En route to the UK Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles. Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people \u201cblatantly tested far above the threshold\u201d but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. \u201cMy partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn\u2019t seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren\u2019t properly over their face.\u201d At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. \u201cIt was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren\u2019t even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport. \u201cThere was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it,\u201d he added. \u201cI felt it was all a bit half-arsed.\u201d In the UK Back in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. \u201cThey called us \u2018Chinese virus\u2019 and \u2018you Chinese bastards\u2019,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time.\u201d Lee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food. He feels that since the outbreak cultural differences are causing issues. The British do not tend to wear face masks but it is normal for Asian people, he said. \u201cNow my Chinese friends get stared at for wearing them.\u201d *Some names have been changed.",

He will be out for about three weeks, which is not cool. But how we see it, we were still lucky. Hendo is exceptionally important, not just football-wise but for other reasons as well.\u201d The Liverpool manager has also warned his players \u2013 and the home support \u2013 against complacency against West Ham, adding that the relegation-threatened Hammers showed plenty of grit against Manchester City. \u201cThey fought really hard [against City] and defended the box with all they had \u2026 they were not outplayed,\u201d Klopp said. They took some positives out of the game and they will try it again so we have to be ready for that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a night match and we need a really good atmosphere. Not this perception that it will be 1-0 after seven minutes, 2-0 after 24 minutes and it will be easy. West Ham need to fight. They don\u2019t have time to waste points. I expect a really tough match.\u201d Sadio Man\u00e9 is expected to start the match after being withdrawn at half-time in Madrid after being booked. Klopp admitted the forward was \u201csurprised\u201d by the decision to substitute him, with the forward on a yellow card. \u201cI spoke to him (on Friday) morning, I asked was he surprised and he said \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe needed him physical, having contact with opponents. It\u2019s part of the game, I don\u2019t like it too much \u2026 eight players around the referee. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe we could complete the game with 11 [players], with him on the pitch. But now he\u2019s completely fine, he\u2019s rested which is good as well.\u201d",

But the party has been dogged by legal charges, which it says are politically motivated.</p> <p>On Friday, the court ruled the party had violated election rules by taking a 191.2m baht (\u00a34.7m) loan from Thanathorn. The law limits donations from an individual to 10m baht. Thanathorn denies any wrongdoing, and some political commentators say other parties\u2019 finances have not been scrutinised in the same way.</p> <p>The decision will strengthen the parliamentary strength of a coalition led by Prayuth Chan-ocha. The prime minister, who initially took power in a military coup in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/thailand-military-backed-pm-prayuth-chan-ocha-voted-in-after-junta-creates-loose-coalition\">was reinstated</a> as leader during a process critics said was rigged in favour of the army.</p> <p>Thanathorn, who was suspended from parliament in November over separate allegations, said in a comment on Facebook: \u201cWhy do we face a party dissolution, a ban on executives and even jail for wanting to build a new type of honest political party with good intentions and transparency?\u201d</p> <p>Future Forward has been hit with a series of legal charges, some of which carry a possible prison sentence, including sedition and an allegation the party broke public assembly law by organising a flash mob. Last month, the party was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51189239\">cleared of separate claims </a>that it was seeking to overthrow the monarchy and had links to the Illuminati \u2013 a suggestion apparently based on the party\u2019s symbol, an upside-down triangle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"150a2e9a606c5f52b45d07c5f188654b159b79f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/150a2e9a606c5f52b45d07c5f188654b159b79f4/0_96_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Future Forward react to a TV broadcast of the court verdict\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Future Forward react to a TV broadcast of the court verdict at the party\u2019s headquarters in Bangkok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the decision to disband the party was \u201ca critical setback for democratic development\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c[Future Forward] was a party that stood against military-authoritarian rule and more importantly against the circular nature of Thai politics that has made the country stuck at a standstill for 15 years,\u201d he said, adding that other parties had not been held to the same standards.</p> <p>On Friday, an image that read \u201cI am one of 6,330,617 people. Don\u2019t kill our voice,\u201d was shared widely on Twitter, referring to the number of people who voted for Future Forward last year, when it came third in the election.</p> <p>\u201cThis will definitely heighten the political uneasiness in the country,\u201d said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian MP and chair of the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian nations. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a sense of illegitimacy on the part of government and young people feeling they are being locked out of the system.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the party\u2019s lawmakers will retain their seats and can form a new party, but the ban on its leaders will reduce the opposition\u2019s votes and influence in parliament. The effective disenfranchisement of so many voters could prompt street protests, say analysts.</p> <p>The decision comes at a time of growing concern over Thailand\u2019s stagnating economy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/coronavirus-thailand-confirms-first-human-to-human-transmission\">the threat of coronavirus</a> \u2013 which has dealt a major blow to the tourism sector as well as posing a challenge to public health \u2013 the country\u2019s dangerous pollution levels, and drought.</p> <p>\u201cThai people like [Future Forward] supporters will either have to rise up in their own way or they will have to put up with autocratic preferences that have resulted in early economic stagnation,\u201d said Thitinan.</p> <p>An initial request by Thailand\u2019s election panel for the constitutional court to ban the party<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/14/thailand-sees-biggest-anti-government-protest-since-2014-coup\"> prompted thousands of people</a> to take to the streets of Bangkok.

Future Forward, which has criticised the Thai army\u2019s influence over politics, was founded less than two years ago but has rapidly emerged as a prominent opposition voice, gaining more than 6m votes during an election last year. Future Forward\u2019s anti-establishment message, and its charismatic leader, the billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, appealed especially to younger voters. But the party has been dogged by legal charges, which it says are politically motivated. On Friday, the court ruled the party had violated election rules by taking a 191.2m baht (\u00a34.7m) loan from Thanathorn. The law limits donations from an individual to 10m baht. Thanathorn denies any wrongdoing, and some political commentators say other parties\u2019 finances have not been scrutinised in the same way. The decision will strengthen the parliamentary strength of a coalition led by Prayuth Chan-ocha. The prime minister, who initially took power in a military coup in 2014, was reinstated as leader during a process critics said was rigged in favour of the army. Thanathorn, who was suspended from parliament in November over separate allegations, said in a comment on Facebook: \u201cWhy do we face a party dissolution, a ban on executives and even jail for wanting to build a new type of honest political party with good intentions and transparency?\u201d Future Forward has been hit with a series of legal charges, some of which carry a possible prison sentence, including sedition and an allegation the party broke public assembly law by organising a flash mob. Last month, the party was cleared of separate claims that it was seeking to overthrow the monarchy and had links to the Illuminati \u2013 a suggestion apparently based on the party\u2019s symbol, an upside-down triangle. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the decision to disband the party was \u201ca critical setback for democratic development\u201d. \u201c[Future Forward] was a party that stood against military-authoritarian rule and more importantly against the circular nature of Thai politics that has made the country stuck at a standstill for 15 years,\u201d he said, adding that other parties had not been held to the same standards. On Friday, an image that read \u201cI am one of 6,330,617 people. Don\u2019t kill our voice,\u201d was shared widely on Twitter, referring to the number of people who voted for Future Forward last year, when it came third in the election. \u201cThis will definitely heighten the political uneasiness in the country,\u201d said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian MP and chair of the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian nations. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a sense of illegitimacy on the part of government and young people feeling they are being locked out of the system.\u201d Most of the party\u2019s lawmakers will retain their seats and can form a new party, but the ban on its leaders will reduce the opposition\u2019s votes and influence in parliament. The effective disenfranchisement of so many voters could prompt street protests, say analysts. The decision comes at a time of growing concern over Thailand\u2019s stagnating economy, the threat of coronavirus \u2013 which has dealt a major blow to the tourism sector as well as posing a challenge to public health \u2013 the country\u2019s dangerous pollution levels, and drought. \u201cThai people like [Future Forward] supporters will either have to rise up in their own way or they will have to put up with autocratic preferences that have resulted in early economic stagnation,\u201d said Thitinan. An initial request by Thailand\u2019s election panel for the constitutional court to ban the party prompted thousands of people to take to the streets of Bangkok. A month later, thousands also gathered before dawn at a park in the capital to participate in what was described as an anti-government run \u2013 a show of defiance against Prayuth\u2019s government. \u201cThe established centres of power will likely become more repressive and autocratic,\u201d said Thitinan. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is the level of determination and resolve of reformers who want a better Thailand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Environmental and animal rights activists have been referred to the government\u2019s controversial anti-radicalisation programme, the Home Office has admitted. Responding to a freedom of information request, the Home Office provided a breakdown of reasons behind referrals of individuals to its Channel programme, an arm of Prevent, for \u201cother types of radicalisation.\u2019\u2019 Environmental and animal rights were among types of \u201cconcerns\u201d identified among individuals referred, as well far-left extremism, Northern Ireland-related extremism, \u201canti-Isil\u201d and Sikh-related extremism. Commenting on the inclusion of environmental and animal rights activism, Rosalind Comyn, Liberty policy and campaigns officer, said: \u201cThis reinforces long-held concerns that the government\u2019s staggeringly broad definition of extremism enables the police to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish. \u201cIf you\u2019re passionate about climate change or animal rights you\u2019re at risk of being labelled extremist and having your details passed to and stored by the police. \u201cWhile this news is alarming for all environmental and animal rights activists, the effects of Prevent are not evenly felt. It has disproportionately targeted Muslims and people of colour for over a decade, sowing distrust and alienation into our communities.\u201d The revelation comes after a series of reports by the Guardian exposed counter-terrorism interest in environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion, as well as other non-violent campaign groups including Peta and Stand Up to Racism. A range of guidance documents drawn up by the counter-terrorism policing network and featuring environmental groups were sent to teachers, doctors and other public sector workers, encouraging them to refer concerns to Prevent. Senior counter-terrorism police chiefs have since insisted that they do not believe support for environmental causes amounts to extremism and pledged to amend or withdraw documents that could have created that impression. The Home Office annually publishes figures on the number and type of referrals to Prevent, as well as a breakdown of the number of individuals referred that go on to receive support through Channel, a programme which provides tailored support for individuals feared to be at risk of being drawn into terrorism. A total of 776 individuals were referred to the Channel process for concerns related to \u201cother types of radicalisation\u201d in the year to March 2019, according to figures published in December. The Home Office said that fewer than 10 people were referred for Channel support for environmental concerns, and fewer than 10 were referred for animal rights activism. Only one in 10 referrals ends up advancing to the Channel programme; the majority leave the process or are signposted to alternative services such as substance misuse treatment or mental health support. The figures show that 660 were referred for \u201cinternational other extremism\u201d, which the Home Office said was Islamist-related extremism with links to global networks such as Daesh or al-Qaida. Twenty-five were referred for \u201cfar-left related extremism\u201d, 18 for \u201canti-Isil\u201d concerns and 14 for Northern Ireland-related extremism. Fewer than 10 were referred for international Sikh-related extremism and fewer than 10 for concerns related to Hezbollah, the Shia Islamist group. Public sector workers, including teachers and doctors, are under a legal duty to refer to Prevent any individual they suspect could be vulnerable to radicalisation. The total number of referrals to Prevent in the year to March 2019 was 5,738, of which 4,407 (77%) were deemed not suitable for Channel. Around 254 Channel cases were for concerns about suspected far-right radicalisation, while 210 cases were referred for suspected Islamist radicalisation. An independent review of Prevent was launched last year but fell into crisis in December when its chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to stand down over concerns about his impartiality in the role. The government is yet to announce Carlile\u2019s successor and is legally bound to complete the review and respond by August. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cProtest groups are not extremist groups and membership of a protest organisation is not an indicator that an individual is vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism. \u201cAll Prevent referrals are carefully assessed. If an individual does not meet the Prevent threshold, the case is immediately closed.\u201d",

All three take slightly longer to put on than I\u2019d like but, once dressed, I\u2019m transported to a version of me that I\u2019d long put away in a vacuum-packed bag and shoved under the bed. He\u2019s the guy whose eyes inadvertently roll into the back of his head, whose voice goes up at the end of every sentence, and whose favourite colour is, naturally, black. All the cliches about black are true: like a cloak of invisibility, it hides a multitude of sins but retains an air of unknowable cool and (in my wildest fantasy) a bit of protective menace. Perhaps this guy \u2013 and this look \u2013 is irresistible. Or are my eyes just blinded by the imaginary kohl eyeliner I feel I should be wearing? The problem with emo\u2019s return is that it\u2019s hard to wear and feel like a grownup. (Don\u2019t style it with a T-shirt featuring characters you might see in a risqu\u00e9 graphic novel. And obviously no bells.) There\u2019s nostalgia and there\u2019s \u201cfeeling like I should be in Camden Market, necking cider and crying\u201d. I\u2019m not sure I want to go back there. \u2022 Long-sleeve T and jeans, Priya\u2019s own. T-shirt, \u00a322, beyondretro.co.uk. Boots, \u00a3169, kurtgeiger.com.",

Last year Unesco removed the Aalst carnival from a list of \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d, an inventory of protected practices that includes Irish hurling and Cypriot-Greek Byzantine chant. The UN organisation said the festival, which has been on the list since 2010, had been guilty of \u201crecurring repetition of racist and antisemitic representations\u201d. The carnival\u2019s organisers had pre-empted the sanction by requesting that the event be taken off the Unesco inventory, claiming that support for its inclusion within the local community had been lost. At the time, Christoph D\u2019Haese, the mayor of Aalst, who is in the Flemish nationalist N-VA party, claimed his citizens had \u201csuffered grotesque accusations \u2026 Aalst will always remain the capital of mockery and satire\u201d. On Friday, D\u2019Haese said this year\u2019s carnival, the 92nd, would go ahead as planned as he defended the freedom of expression of those involved. \u201cA magnifying glass is now looking at a very beautiful folk festival that has been able to take place 91 times without any significant problems,\u201d he told a Flemish radio station. \u201cIf we can avoid sensitive issues, or visualise a theme without causing hurt, I call for that. We need to be aware of the fact that a large community may feel hurt and have respect for it. But Aalst will always remain the odd one out.\u201d D\u2019Haese said that \u201craising awareness is one thing; forbidding and censorship is something else\u201d. \u201cYou can focus your magnifying glass on many things, but you can also focus on the creativity that the carnivalists put into their work and on the young people who work on all those floats,\u201d he said. Bart Somers, a minister in the Flemish government, said the mayor \u201cshould make more efforts to enter into dialogue with the carnivalists and try to convince them that they are not acting morally and ethically\u201d. There is expected to be heavier security around the parade.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>Dominic Cummings\u2019s programme to recruit more \u201cweirdos\u201d and \u201cmisfits\u201d into No 10 got off to a cracking start with the appointment of \u201cMystic\u201d Andrew Sabisky, the self-styled superforecaster. Just weeks after Sabisky started work, several newspapers did a cursory trawl of his social media posts and discovered that he had a tendresse for racial eugenics and enforced contraception for working-class teenage girls.</p> <p>On this evidence, it seems unlikely that Sabisky\u2019s own parents share their son\u2019s enthusiasm for eugenics. Astonishingly, the prime minister\u2019s press spokesman was unable to confirm whether Boris Johnson, who has chosen the week when much of the country is underwater to make himself invisible, disagreed with eugenics and enforced contraception. It\u2019s possible of course that Boris may, with hindsight, have strong views on the latter. More remarkably, No 10 didn\u2019t even go into damage limitation mode and expedite Sabisky\u2019s dismissal; rather, it waited for the twentysomething to make the decision that Cummings had found too difficult and announce his own resignation.</p> <p>Inevitably, attention then turned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/18/no-10-under-pressure-andrew-sabisky-hired-cummings-race-intelligence\">what vetting procedures Downing Street had made</a> prior to Sabisky\u2019s appointment. The answer turned out to be none. Presumably, because if previously having written racist and offensive columns were to be a job disqualifier, then Boris would also also have to stand down. Equally oddly, some former special advisers then sought to place the blame for Sabisky getting the job entirely on Sabisky himself. It was up to him to have disclosed all his wacko writings and it was unreasonable to expect No 10 to conduct any due diligence. Just two Tory MPs \u2013 Caroline Nokes and William Wragg \u2013 were brave enough to go public with their disquiet over the recruitment process. The rest saw no problem: the country had had ample warning about what type of government Boris was likely to run so it was a bit late in the day to start moaning now. Classic Dom. He\u2019s got us all just where he wants us.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>If there were a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/19/immigration-firms-will-need-to-train-more-uk-workers-says-priti-patel\">points-based tally</a> for becoming home secretary, I\u2019m fairly certain that Priti \u201cTough on counter-terrorism, tough on the causes of counter-terrorism\u201d Patel would never have got the job. And not just because under the government\u2019s own system, her parents would never have been allowed to settle and work in the UK.</p> <p>Patel might have got the full 10 points for the necessary levels of viciousness, but \u2013 even in a Tory party not overburdened with talent \u2013 Patel stands out as a standard bearer for the stupid and underhand. Leaving aside that she has already been sacked from the cabinet once before for conducting her own undercover foreign policy without informing the prime minister \u2013 something you would have thought debarred her from almost any job in any profession, let alone home secretary \u2013 Patel doesn\u2019t appear to have understood some fairly basic facts about the labour market.</p> <p>First she has seized on the fact that 20% of people between 18 and 65 aren\u2019t in full-time work as a sign of huge slack in the economy \u2013 this at a time when her own government is boasting of record levels of employment \u2013 without realising that almost all these people are accounted for by students, the retired, those unable to work through disability, and full-time, unpaid carers. Then she seems unable to grasp the difference between unskilled and low-paid jobs. The starting salaries for many qualified jobs in the NHS, and other professions where there are severe staff shortages, are all below the threshold set by the government so immigrants from the EU and the rest of the world will automatically be excluded. It also doesn\u2019t appear to have occurred to Patel that most Brits \u2013 including her and the rest of the cabinet \u2013 aren\u2019t not doing these jobs because immigrants have stolen them from them, but because they don\u2019t want to do them. My 96-year-old mother now lives in a care home staffed by many people Patel now wants to keep out of the country. Perhaps the home secretary would like to explain to her and thousands of others like her just who is going to be looking after them in the future. If she had the imagination, Patel might also wonder who is going to be looking after her when the time comes. Still, it\u2019s what the people apparently voted for. Populism rules.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>All too predictably, Spurs slid to an ignoble <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/tottenham-rb-leipzig-champions-league-match-report\">1-0 home defeat</a> to Leipzig in the first round of the Champions League knockout stages. Just about the only positive from the night was that we didn\u2019t lose by more, though, God knows, we did try. Spurs\u2019 only tactic for the first 70 minutes was to boot the ball upfield to give possession back to our opponents. It was an unusual way to try and win a football match. Things did improve slightly in the last 20 minutes, during which the players attempted a couple of passes to their teammates before losing possession, but no one in the ground seriously believed we were ever likely to score. Either then or for the rest of the season as our two strikers, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, are both out of action.</p> <p>Who at a top Premier League club could possibly have anticipated key players might get injured and that it might be a good idea to have some replacements available? No one at Spurs, that\u2019s for certain. What made the lack of an attacking threat all the more poignant were the pre-match and half-time celebrations for the 80th birthday of Jimmy Greaves, one of the greatest ever goalscorers for Spurs and England. If you\u2019ve never seen how good he was, there\u2019s a brilliant documentary now showing on BT Sport. It was Greaves who was to blame for my love affair of 50-plus years with Spurs. I was nine when the 1966 World Cup took place and it was Jimmy whom I idolised. I\u2019ve never fully forgiven Geoff Hurst for scoring what should have been Greaves\u2019s hat-trick in the final. My obsession with Greaves was so total I even named my pet rabbit after him, and I\u2019ve supported Spurs ever since. So even though I know the best that can be hoped for against Chelsea is a 0-0 draw \u2013 as I said, we aren\u2019t likely to score \u2013 I will be in the away end at Stamford Bridge on Saturday for more misery. There are some addictions I just can\u2019t shrug off.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>It was only a matter of time, I suppose. Astrologer Jessica Adams has now started doing horoscopes for pets. The taurus cat is apparently \u201ca dribbler who loves its breakfast and will lick empty food bowls in the hope of finding the last scrap\u201d. Which pretty much describes every cat I\u2019ve ever come across, though it\u2019s possible that every cat I know was born between 21 April and 21 May.</p> <p>Meanwhile sociable libra dogs \u201clike to perform duets with other dogs\u201d. Really? I must have missed that karaoke night. Still, any port in a storm and all that, for me and Herbert Hound have had a falling out. Or rather I have had a falling out with him; he\u2019s totally unaware there\u2019s a problem. When my wife was away on holiday recently, Herbert couldn\u2019t get enough of me. He snuggled up to me in bed and was utterly devoted as we watched TV together. But ever since my wife came home, he has pretty much given me the cold shoulder, only bothering to be nice to me if Jill is out or doing something else. I\u2019ve tried reminding him that without me, he would have been utterly miserable but he\u2019s completely unmoved. So in desperation I\u2019ve checked his horoscope. Born on 17<sup> </sup>September, Herbert is a virgo which means \u201che loves routines and will stand on you five minutes before the alarm\u201d. There is a caveat, though. Mercury is now in retrograde \u2013 me neither \u2013 so Adams reckons his timings will be an hour out. So I had better get used to being ignored an hour earlier.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump is never usually shy in coming forward, so it\u2019s something of a surprise to find he hasn\u2019t yet boasted of his status as <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/we-calculated-how-much-we-pay-trump-to-play-golf-it-tu-1841793634\">America\u2019s 10th best-paid athlete</a> and the 17th in the world. Who knew the president was such an elite physical specimen? Or that cheating at golf could prove to be so lucrative? Using figures supplied by the Government Accountability Office, the US website the Root has calculated that during a one-month period in 2017, Americans paid $13m for four trips to Trump properties for presidential golf outings, including $60,000 for rooms and space at the Palm Beach resort. This includes thousands of dollars for lodging and feeding Secret Service agents, paid directly to the resort owned by Trump.</p> <p>In total, since 2016, the local and federal costs for Trump\u2019s sporting triumphs total $152m. Or roughly $50.6m a year for The Donald to play golf. That\u2019s more than any other sports organisation has ever paid someone to play golf. Perhaps, we should be grateful that our own prime minister appears to have abandoned any pretensions to fitness and has reconciled himself to a life of slobdom. There again Johnson did take part in the most expensive game of tennis ever played. To help make up his mind which side of the EU referendum campaign would best further his career, Boris took to the court for a few sets against his sister Rachel, according to her. The outcome of that game has already cost the UK billions and will almost certainly continue to do so for a while yet. Just think. If only someone had paid Boris \u00a32bn just to do nothing other than have IT lessons with Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 we\u2019re still waiting for the outcome of that investigation \u2013 we could all have been so much better off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6776d4838d7c051fcec46ae3e8c9ec4c7d3151c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6776d4838d7c051fcec46ae3e8c9ec4c7d3151c4/0_299_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cYes, it\u2019s so sad that Meghan has gone to live in Canada.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Yes, it\u2019s so sad that Meghan has gone to live in Canada.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kensington Palace/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Digested week, digested: \u2018You\u2019re not welcome here.\u2019</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday Dominic Cummings\u2019s programme to recruit more \u201cweirdos\u201d and \u201cmisfits\u201d into No 10 got off to a cracking start with the appointment of \u201cMystic\u201d Andrew Sabisky, the self-styled superforecaster. Just weeks after Sabisky started work, several newspapers did a cursory trawl of his social media posts and discovered that he had a tendresse for racial eugenics and enforced contraception for working-class teenage girls. On this evidence, it seems unlikely that Sabisky\u2019s own parents share their son\u2019s enthusiasm for eugenics. Astonishingly, the prime minister\u2019s press spokesman was unable to confirm whether Boris Johnson, who has chosen the week when much of the country is underwater to make himself invisible, disagreed with eugenics and enforced contraception. It\u2019s possible of course that Boris may, with hindsight, have strong views on the latter. More remarkably, No 10 didn\u2019t even go into damage limitation mode and expedite Sabisky\u2019s dismissal; rather, it waited for the twentysomething to make the decision that Cummings had found too difficult and announce his own resignation. Inevitably, attention then turned to what vetting procedures Downing Street had made prior to Sabisky\u2019s appointment. The answer turned out to be none. Presumably, because if previously having written racist and offensive columns were to be a job disqualifier, then Boris would also also have to stand down. Equally oddly, some former special advisers then sought to place the blame for Sabisky getting the job entirely on Sabisky himself. It was up to him to have disclosed all his wacko writings and it was unreasonable to expect No 10 to conduct any due diligence. Just two Tory MPs \u2013 Caroline Nokes and William Wragg \u2013 were brave enough to go public with their disquiet over the recruitment process. The rest saw no problem: the country had had ample warning about what type of government Boris was likely to run so it was a bit late in the day to start moaning now. Classic Dom. He\u2019s got us all just where he wants us. Tuesday If there were a points-based tally for becoming home secretary, I\u2019m fairly certain that Priti \u201cTough on counter-terrorism, tough on the causes of counter-terrorism\u201d Patel would never have got the job. And not just because under the government\u2019s own system, her parents would never have been allowed to settle and work in the UK. Patel might have got the full 10 points for the necessary levels of viciousness, but \u2013 even in a Tory party not overburdened with talent \u2013 Patel stands out as a standard bearer for the stupid and underhand. Leaving aside that she has already been sacked from the cabinet once before for conducting her own undercover foreign policy without informing the prime minister \u2013 something you would have thought debarred her from almost any job in any profession, let alone home secretary \u2013 Patel doesn\u2019t appear to have understood some fairly basic facts about the labour market. First she has seized on the fact that 20% of people between 18 and 65 aren\u2019t in full-time work as a sign of huge slack in the economy \u2013 this at a time when her own government is boasting of record levels of employment \u2013 without realising that almost all these people are accounted for by students, the retired, those unable to work through disability, and full-time, unpaid carers. Then she seems unable to grasp the difference between unskilled and low-paid jobs. The starting salaries for many qualified jobs in the NHS, and other professions where there are severe staff shortages, are all below the threshold set by the government so immigrants from the EU and the rest of the world will automatically be excluded. It also doesn\u2019t appear to have occurred to Patel that most Brits \u2013 including her and the rest of the cabinet \u2013 aren\u2019t not doing these jobs because immigrants have stolen them from them, but because they don\u2019t want to do them. My 96-year-old mother now lives in a care home staffed by many people Patel now wants to keep out of the country. Perhaps the home secretary would like to explain to her and thousands of others like her just who is going to be looking after them in the future. If she had the imagination, Patel might also wonder who is going to be looking after her when the time comes. Still, it\u2019s what the people apparently voted for. Populism rules. Wednesday All too predictably, Spurs slid to an ignoble 1-0 home defeat to Leipzig in the first round of the Champions League knockout stages. Just about the only positive from the night was that we didn\u2019t lose by more, though, God knows, we did try. Spurs\u2019 only tactic for the first 70 minutes was to boot the ball upfield to give possession back to our opponents. It was an unusual way to try and win a football match. Things did improve slightly in the last 20 minutes, during which the players attempted a couple of passes to their teammates before losing possession, but no one in the ground seriously believed we were ever likely to score. Either then or for the rest of the season as our two strikers, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, are both out of action. Who at a top Premier League club could possibly have anticipated key players might get injured and that it might be a good idea to have some replacements available? No one at Spurs, that\u2019s for certain. What made the lack of an attacking threat all the more poignant were the pre-match and half-time celebrations for the 80th birthday of Jimmy Greaves, one of the greatest ever goalscorers for Spurs and England. If you\u2019ve never seen how good he was, there\u2019s a brilliant documentary now showing on BT Sport. It was Greaves who was to blame for my love affair of 50-plus years with Spurs. I was nine when the 1966 World Cup took place and it was Jimmy whom I idolised. I\u2019ve never fully forgiven Geoff Hurst for scoring what should have been Greaves\u2019s hat-trick in the final. My obsession with Greaves was so total I even named my pet rabbit after him, and I\u2019ve supported Spurs ever since. So even though I know the best that can be hoped for against Chelsea is a 0-0 draw \u2013 as I said, we aren\u2019t likely to score \u2013 I will be in the away end at Stamford Bridge on Saturday for more misery. There are some addictions I just can\u2019t shrug off. Thursday It was only a matter of time, I suppose. Astrologer Jessica Adams has now started doing horoscopes for pets.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been handed a modest boost before next month\u2019s budget from public borrowing rising by less than previously expected, despite the government failing to hit targets set four years ago. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain\u2019s foremost thinktank for the government finances, said the country was on track to record a budget deficit for the 2019-20 financial year around \u00a33.5bn smaller than forecast in December. Coming as Sunak prepares to deliver an expansionary Tory budget on 11 March to fulfil a raft of promises made by Boris Johnson before the election, the stronger performance from the public finances could help the new chancellor to deliver an upbeat assessment. Next month\u2019s budget will mark the first big Commons tax and spending setpiece since late 2018, after the first calendar year without a budget in Britain since at least 1900, due to last year\u2019s Brexit turmoil. However, the IFS issued a warning that the budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between government spending and income from taxes \u2013 was still set to balloon to about \u00a344bn in the current financial year. Although almost double the amount borrowed last year, the figure represents a modest improvement on the \u00a347.6bn forecast in December by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury watchdog. It also comes four years after George Osborne said the Tories would eliminate the deficit and generate a surplus, with tax income outstripping state spending, of about \u00a310.4bn this year, in a stark demonstration of Britain\u2019s battered public finances as government spending rises and the economy slows. Isabel Stockton, a research economist at the IFS, said a deficit of around \u00a33.5bn less than anticipated would please Sunak, who was promoted last week after Sajid Javid\u2019s shock resignation. However, after missing the targets set in 2016, Stockton added: \u201cNext month\u2019s budget will demonstrate how seriously the latest set of fiscal targets are being taken.\u201d According to the latest snapshot for the month of January from the Office for National Statistics, Britain generated a smaller than expected surplus of \u00a39.8bn, around \u00a32.1bn less than recorded in the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast an \u00a311.3bn surplus in January, which is usually a surplus month due to the timing of self-assessed income tax payments. Against a backdrop of record employment levels in Britain and rising numbers of self-employed workers, the ONS said the value of self-assessed income tax receipts rose by \u00a31.5bn last month to \u00a316.2bn, a record high for January. However, central government expenditure rose sharply last month, by about 3.6%, as spending on education, defence, health and social care was increased to meet a promisemade by Theresa May, when she was prime minister, to turn the page on austerity. Alison Ring, the public sector director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cWith headwinds from a weak economy and trade uncertainty, the immediate challenge for the chancellor in his budget next month will be to balance the adoption of credible fiscal rules with investing more into public services and building infrastructure outside London and the south-east.\u201d Despite the decline in the public finances, a closely watched business survey published on Friday suggested that the UK economy could be at a turning point after weaker levels of growth towards the end of last year. According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, growth in manufacturing output accelerated to the strongest level in 10 months, offsetting a slight loss of momentum in the service sector. February\u2019s IHS Markit/Cips \u201cflash\u201d purchasing managers index, which provides a snapshot of business activity and growth in the UK economy from surveys of companies, was unchanged from a month earlier at 53.3. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The PMI had risen sharply in January, suggesting rising business optimism since Johnson\u2019s election victory lifted some of the uncertainty hanging over the UK economy. Tim Moore, an associate director at IHS Markit, said the snapshot suggested that GDP would grow by about 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020. \u201c[The PMI] provides a clear indication that the UK economy is no longer flat on its back,\u201d he added.",

They are the latest to warn of the economic risks posed by the new immigration rules which have already drawn criticism from the agriculture, hospitality and social care sectors. Deborah Annetts, the chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, said the policy paper published on Tuesday night did not offer the pledges it had sought to allow EU bands to enter the country freely for gigs post-Brexit. The paper suggests performers will need advance permission \u201cat the very least\u201d, she claimed. The Home Office spokesman denied this was the case. \u201cThe UK attracts world-class artists, entertainers and musicians and that\u2019s not going to change under the new system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rules already permit performers from around the world to take part in events, concerts and competitions without the need for formal sponsorship or a work visa and that will continue to be the case.\u201d The issue stems from paragraphs 21 and 25 in the paper. Annetts is concerned that paragraph 21 suggests a visa will be required while paragraph 25 seems to be a summary of existing rules that require non-EU citizens to get permission before performing in the UK. The Home Office points to paragraph 25 as the relevant section for musicians which states performers are allowed entry without a visa for up to six months and \u201ccan receive payment for appearances at certain festivals or for up to a month for a specific engagement, without the need for formal sponsorship or a work visa\u201d. Annetts says this is \u201ca misrepresentation\u201d of the current visa arrangements for non-EU citizens as those who want to come up to a month have to get what is known as a permitted paid engagement visa which requires an advance engagement letter. \u201cTo get into the country for 30 days as a musician from the EU as from January 2021 you will at the very least need a letter of engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not at all clear what type of organisation is qualified to give such a letter. And you will need supporting documents such as bank statements. Neither of these are required for EU musicians at the moment.\u201d The Home Office said it was \u201cmaintaining the generous provisions for visitors, which include the provisions for artists, entertainers and musicians\u201d and that the UK\u2019s existing visitor rules permit artists, entertainers and musicians to perform at events and take part in competitions and auditions for up to six months. The post-Brexit policy outlined by the government will form the foundation of an immigration bill, which is expected to easily pass through the House of Commons on account of the Conservative party\u2019s 80-strong majority. However, the Home Office is still going to consult on exemptions that will form a shortage occupation list and the music sector leaders hopes clarity will also emerge for the creative industries. Annetts said: \u201cThis landed like a bombshell on Wednesday. We had been into the Home Office explaining to them that touring is not the same as immigration and they didn\u2019t really get it.

Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey \u2013 but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West Midlands \u2018The scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter\u2019 I am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, London \u2018Usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white\u2019 Mount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn\u2019t happen until April.

      "body": "<p>Pizza is a big part of my life. It\u2019s both my and my four-year-old\u2019s favourite food, so a lot of our meals revolve around it, and happily so. </p> <p>We are lucky enough to live in a part of London where there are good sourdough pizza places every 10 steps. In pizza terms, we are spoilt rotten. My favourite, though, is at Lardo, an unassuming place in Hackney that serves pizzas to rival Napoli\u2019s, and well thought out salads, pastas and small plates from Matthew Cranston in the kitchen.</p> <p>This is my approximation of their squash, kale and smoked tomato one, which has no cheese and \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this \u2013 I love it all the more for it.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t gone for sourdough pizza dough here (as Lardo makes); instead I\u2019ve used a family-friendly recipe inspired by my friend and baker Tom Herbert, using a bit of wholemeal flour. You can easily make a big batch and keep a few bases par-cooked in the freezer; after all, I never like to be more than 10 steps away from a pizza.</p> <h2><strong>Easy pizza dough</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written this recipe in such a way that you can make the pizza base two ways: to be topped and baked immediately, or to be par-cooked and frozen, ready to use whenever you need.</p> <p>Prep <strong>45 min</strong><br>Rest <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>4 </strong><strong>bases</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355767857f24fc6c41485d3251d796a29959e813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355767857f24fc6c41485d3251d796a29959e813/0_0_3906_4000/977.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 easy pizza dough.\" width=\"977\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 easy pizza dough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>325g strong bread flour</strong><br><strong>125g wholemeal spelt flour</strong><br><strong>10g sea salt</strong><br><strong>5g fast-action dried yeast</strong><br><strong>285ml warm water</strong><br><strong>40ml olive oil</strong>, plus extra cooking<br><strong>Semolina</strong> or extra bread flour, for dusting</p> <p>I make this in a stand mixer: put all the ingredients into the bowl and put on the highest setting for 12 minutes. If you are doing this by hand, mix the wet ingredients into the dry in a bowl and, once combined, knead on a dusted surface for 15 minutes \u2013 you want a very soft and stretchy dough. Put the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to rest for an hour.</p> <p>Tip the dough on to a clean work surface and divide into four roughly 200g portions. Make a claw with your hand around a piece of dough and, keeping your hand in contact with the table, make small, circular motions to mould each one into a tight, round ball.</p> <p>Put a good glug of olive oil in a large roasting tin and roll the dough balls around, coating them with oil; this will stop them sticking together. Leave covered with a damp tea towel in a warm place to rise for an hour or so.</p> <p>Turn the oven to the maximum temperature, above 230C (210C fan)/gas 8. If you have a baking stone or thick baking sheet, put it in the oven to warm. Scatter a good amount of flour on to a work surface, then, using a rolling pin, roll out the bases as thinly as you can, rotating them as you go.</p> <p>If you are eating them straight away, add your preferred toppings. If you are pre-baking them for later, cook them untopped.</p> <p>Carefully transfer each pizza or base to a cool, flat baking sheet dusted with flour to stop them from sticking, then shuffle on to the hot stone or baking sheet.</p> <p>To par-bake the bases, cook one at a time for a couple of minutes, until they are lightly coloured. Once cool, stack with a small square of baking paper between each one and put in the freezer; they\u2019ll also keep in the fridge for a few days. To cook from frozen, top and bake for five minutes at your hottest oven temperature (over 230C (210C fan)/gas 8) for eight to 10 minutes, until golden.</p> <p>For a topped pizza, cook one at a time for five to eight minutes, until golden.</p> <h2><strong>Squash and crispy kale pizza</strong></h2> <p>This is a maverick of a pizza. It has a squash puree where the tomato sauce might usually be; and no cheese, but instead a topping of crispy kale, toasted nuts and tomatoes. If you find the idea of pizza without cheese a bridge too far, some soft goat\u2019s cheese crumbled over the top at the end wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. At Lardo, they make this with smoked tomatoes: if you can get them, use them; if not, sun-blushed tomatoes are great. If you don\u2019t have the time or inclination to make pizza bases, I have topped naan or good, fluffy flatbread with this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f6e7692947989d1aef7c227dad88f546f2d73c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f6e7692947989d1aef7c227dad88f546f2d73c/0_0_4000_4007/998.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 pumpkin and crispy kale pizza.\" width=\"998\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 pumpkin and crispy kale pizza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep<strong> 15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>1 hr 30 min</strong><br>Makes<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>1 large butternut squash </strong>(about 1kg), peeled, deseeded and cut into roughly 2cm chunks<br><strong>2 sprigs </strong><strong>rosemary</strong>, leaves stripped <br><strong>1 good pinch </strong><strong>dried chilli flakes</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br><strong>4-6 tbsp</strong><strong> </strong><strong>vegetable stock</strong><br><strong>250g kale</strong>, leaves stripped<br><strong>30g toasted nuts </strong>(pine nuts, chopped almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts all work)<br><strong>200g sun-blushed tomatoes</strong>, cut into rough halves<br></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6.

      "bodyText": "Pizza is a big part of my life. It\u2019s both my and my four-year-old\u2019s favourite food, so a lot of our meals revolve around it, and happily so. We are lucky enough to live in a part of London where there are good sourdough pizza places every 10 steps. In pizza terms, we are spoilt rotten. My favourite, though, is at Lardo, an unassuming place in Hackney that serves pizzas to rival Napoli\u2019s, and well thought out salads, pastas and small plates from Matthew Cranston in the kitchen. This is my approximation of their squash, kale and smoked tomato one, which has no cheese and \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this \u2013 I love it all the more for it. I haven\u2019t gone for sourdough pizza dough here (as Lardo makes); instead I\u2019ve used a family-friendly recipe inspired by my friend and baker Tom Herbert, using a bit of wholemeal flour. You can easily make a big batch and keep a few bases par-cooked in the freezer; after all, I never like to be more than 10 steps away from a pizza. Easy pizza dough I\u2019ve written this recipe in such a way that you can make the pizza base two ways: to be topped and baked immediately, or to be par-cooked and frozen, ready to use whenever you need. Prep 45 min Rest 2 hr Cook 10 min Makes 4 bases 325g strong bread flour 125g wholemeal spelt flour 10g sea salt 5g fast-action dried yeast 285ml warm water 40ml olive oil, plus extra cooking Semolina or extra bread flour, for dusting I make this in a stand mixer: put all the ingredients into the bowl and put on the highest setting for 12 minutes. If you are doing this by hand, mix the wet ingredients into the dry in a bowl and, once combined, knead on a dusted surface for 15 minutes \u2013 you want a very soft and stretchy dough. Put the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to rest for an hour. Tip the dough on to a clean work surface and divide into four roughly 200g portions. Make a claw with your hand around a piece of dough and, keeping your hand in contact with the table, make small, circular motions to mould each one into a tight, round ball. Put a good glug of olive oil in a large roasting tin and roll the dough balls around, coating them with oil; this will stop them sticking together. Leave covered with a damp tea towel in a warm place to rise for an hour or so. Turn the oven to the maximum temperature, above 230C (210C fan)/gas 8. If you have a baking stone or thick baking sheet, put it in the oven to warm. Scatter a good amount of flour on to a work surface, then, using a rolling pin, roll out the bases as thinly as you can, rotating them as you go. If you are eating them straight away, add your preferred toppings. If you are pre-baking them for later, cook them untopped. Carefully transfer each pizza or base to a cool, flat baking sheet dusted with flour to stop them from sticking, then shuffle on to the hot stone or baking sheet. To par-bake the bases, cook one at a time for a couple of minutes, until they are lightly coloured. Once cool, stack with a small square of baking paper between each one and put in the freezer; they\u2019ll also keep in the fridge for a few days. To cook from frozen, top and bake for five minutes at your hottest oven temperature (over 230C (210C fan)/gas 8) for eight to 10 minutes, until golden. For a topped pizza, cook one at a time for five to eight minutes, until golden. Squash and crispy kale pizza This is a maverick of a pizza. It has a squash puree where the tomato sauce might usually be; and no cheese, but instead a topping of crispy kale, toasted nuts and tomatoes. If you find the idea of pizza without cheese a bridge too far, some soft goat\u2019s cheese crumbled over the top at the end wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. At Lardo, they make this with smoked tomatoes: if you can get them, use them; if not, sun-blushed tomatoes are great. If you don\u2019t have the time or inclination to make pizza bases, I have topped naan or good, fluffy flatbread with this. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Makes 4 1 large butternut squash (about 1kg), peeled, deseeded and cut into roughly 2cm chunks 2 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped 1 good pinch dried chilli flakes Sea salt and black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil 4-6 tbsp vegetable stock 250g kale, leaves stripped 30g toasted nuts (pine nuts, chopped almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts all work) 200g sun-blushed tomatoes, cut into rough halves Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. Make the pizza dough according to the recipe above, or using your own. Put the squash into a roasting tray, add the rosemary and chilli, then season, drizzle with olive oil and toss. Roast for an hour, or until soft, golden and cooked through. Remove from the tray and carefully tip into a food processor. Blitz to a spreadable paste, adding a little veg stock to loosen to the consistency of tomato sauce, if need be. While the squash is cooking, roughly tear the kale into one layer on a large tray (you may need two). Toss with a drizzle of olive oil and some salt and pepper, and roast for 10-15 minutes, until crisp. Meanwhile, roast the nuts on a tray for five minutes, or until golden, then set aside. For each pizza, top with five tablespoons of butternut squash puree (if it has thickened on resting, loosen with more stock), spreading evenly in one layer. Transfer to the oven using the method in today\u2019s dough recipe and bake for eight minutes. Once cooked, top with the kale and sun-blushed tomatoes, and sprinkle with toasted nuts.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere are words that cover up the world,\u201d thinks the protagonist of this prizewinning Argentinian dystopia. In our world of industrialised farming, we talk about \u201cgestation crates\u201d and \u201cinsemination phases\u201d. In the world of the novel, where cannibalism has become normalised after animals were wiped out by a global epidemic, euphemism is even more essential. Marcos runs a factory that raises and slaughters humans, and is intimately involved with every stage of production. \u201cThe processing plant does business with several breeding centres, but he only includes those that provide the greatest quantity of heads on the meat circuit.\u201d</p> <p>Marcos supplies butchers, tanneries, laboratories, even a mysterious game reserve, and is our tour guide through the horrors. He shows us a \u201chead\u201d being killed and butchered \u2013 a process familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen inside an abattoir. He tells us how the most superior meat is raised without growth accelerants or genetic modification; how the vocal cords are removed because \u201cmeat doesn\u2019t talk\u201d; how impregnated females must be restrained to stop them destroying their young. And how, after curfew, all bets are off: with the taboo on cannibalism removed, there\u2019s now a brisk trade in black market flesh. \u201cSpecial meat\u201d fulfils hygiene regulations and comes with a high price tag; \u201ceasy meat\u201d is \u201cmeat with a first and last name\u201d. Cremations have replaced funerals, for fear of bodies being snatched from hearses; starving, flesh-maddened Scavengers lurk in the shadows while upstanding citizens buy human hands on a bed of lettuce (\u201cUpper Extremity\u201d) in butcher\u2019s shops.</p> <p>If Marcos\u2019s recap of the Transition and its ethical doublethink is sometimes heavy-footed (\u201cHe thinks: merchandise, another word that obscures the world\u201d), the brusque, declarative narration and matter-of-fact staccato sentences are horribly effective. He is a man in shock not just at the undeniably shocking new reality but at the loss of his young son. As he says, with the bitterest of ironies, \u201cOne can get used to almost anything, except the death of a child.\u201d His father is sinking into dementia in a nursing home; his grieving wife has retreated to her mother\u2019s; his sister is a shallow social climber, happy to follow YouTube tutorials on how to carve up your own domestic head at home. But perhaps the biggest existential wound is the loss of animals: ever since they were eliminated to halt the spread of the virus, \u201cthere\u2019s been a silence that nobody hears\u201d.</p> <p>The eerie, depopulated landscape is reminiscent of another intensely effective Argentinian shocker, Samanta Schweblin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fever-dream-by-samanta-schweblin-review\" title=\"\"><em>Fever Dream</em></a>. That novel was a shifting, unstable fantasia inspired by fears about GM and environmental degradation; in <em>Tender Is the Flesh</em>, the metaphorical equivalence with factory farming is blatant, served up to us with relish. And where the critique of carnivorousness in Michel Faber\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/01/fiction.reviews2\" title=\"\"><em>Under the Skin</em></a> was produced by estrangement, making the taste for human flesh literally an alien matter, here it\u2019s done through familiarity. It is all too easy, Bazterrica demonstrates, to imagine eating our sentient fellows. We do it already; we\u2019ve built the infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ef0e55098b6f74f29b48da61721308d7a758ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ef0e55098b6f74f29b48da61721308d7a758ee/0_0_2864_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlton Heston in the 1973 film of Soylent Green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlton Heston in the 1973 film of <em>Soylent Green</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s true that cannibalism is both unthinkable and repeatedly thought about. Though the \u201cspecial meat\u201d of <em>Tender Is the Flesh</em> offers a pleasing echo of that mysterious, addictive \u201cspecial stuff\u201d sold in the Royston Vasey butcher\u2019s, when quizzed if it was intended to be human flesh the <em>League of Gentlemen </em>writers scoffed that there was \u201cnothing more mundane than cannibalism\u201d. Bazterrica\u2019s obvious antecedent here is <em>Soylent Green</em>, which gets a mention as a banned film viewed via the dark web (that vision of climate crisis, authoritarian government and resource famine, it is salutary to note, is set in 2022).</p> <p>She also draws on the conventions of horror, steadily ramping up the revulsion and introducing a hammily vampiric Romanian in charge of the game reserve who says things like \u201cSince the world began, we\u2019ve been eating each other\u201d and \u201c\u2018Let us take pleasure in the atrocity.\u201d But Marcos\u2019s main obsession is not flesh but language: how we construct the world out of words, how we speak the unspeakable, and how we negotiate the gap between words and reality. In a narrative otherwise so blunt and blood-spattered, he piles metaphor on simile as he tries to convey the weight of others\u2019 words \u2013 his wife\u2019s voice \u201ca river of lights, an aerial torrent\u201d when discussing the child they might have, then uttering only \u201cblack holes\u201d when grieving his death; his sister\u2019s speech \u201clike boxes filled with blank paper\u201d, smelling \u201cof confinement, of intense cold\u201d. When he visits a laboratory experimenting on humans, the only way he can think of to defy the Mengele-like scientist in charge \u2013 whose words \u201care like tiny tadpoles dragging themselves along\u201d \u2013 is to withhold his own speech.</p> <p>But if this is a fable about the inadequacy of language in the face of darkness, it also resonates with sadness at the prospect of the silence humans can expect when we are alone in the world, in the wake of mass extinctions. This provocative, sorrowful novel expertly wields a double-edged cleaver: when Marcos points out that \u201cin the end, meat is meat, it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s from\u201d, it\u2019s a statement of both dystopic extremity and banal everyday fact.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tender Is the Flesh, translated by Sarah Moses, is published by Pushkin (RRP \u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere are words that cover up the world,\u201d thinks the protagonist of this prizewinning Argentinian dystopia. In our world of industrialised farming, we talk about \u201cgestation crates\u201d and \u201cinsemination phases\u201d. In the world of the novel, where cannibalism has become normalised after animals were wiped out by a global epidemic, euphemism is even more essential. Marcos runs a factory that raises and slaughters humans, and is intimately involved with every stage of production. \u201cThe processing plant does business with several breeding centres, but he only includes those that provide the greatest quantity of heads on the meat circuit.\u201d Marcos supplies butchers, tanneries, laboratories, even a mysterious game reserve, and is our tour guide through the horrors. He shows us a \u201chead\u201d being killed and butchered \u2013 a process familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen inside an abattoir. He tells us how the most superior meat is raised without growth accelerants or genetic modification; how the vocal cords are removed because \u201cmeat doesn\u2019t talk\u201d; how impregnated females must be restrained to stop them destroying their young. And how, after curfew, all bets are off: with the taboo on cannibalism removed, there\u2019s now a brisk trade in black market flesh. \u201cSpecial meat\u201d fulfils hygiene regulations and comes with a high price tag; \u201ceasy meat\u201d is \u201cmeat with a first and last name\u201d. Cremations have replaced funerals, for fear of bodies being snatched from hearses; starving, flesh-maddened Scavengers lurk in the shadows while upstanding citizens buy human hands on a bed of lettuce (\u201cUpper Extremity\u201d) in butcher\u2019s shops. If Marcos\u2019s recap of the Transition and its ethical doublethink is sometimes heavy-footed (\u201cHe thinks: merchandise, another word that obscures the world\u201d), the brusque, declarative narration and matter-of-fact staccato sentences are horribly effective. He is a man in shock not just at the undeniably shocking new reality but at the loss of his young son. As he says, with the bitterest of ironies, \u201cOne can get used to almost anything, except the death of a child.\u201d His father is sinking into dementia in a nursing home; his grieving wife has retreated to her mother\u2019s; his sister is a shallow social climber, happy to follow YouTube tutorials on how to carve up your own domestic head at home. But perhaps the biggest existential wound is the loss of animals: ever since they were eliminated to halt the spread of the virus, \u201cthere\u2019s been a silence that nobody hears\u201d. The eerie, depopulated landscape is reminiscent of another intensely effective Argentinian shocker, Samanta Schweblin\u2019s Fever Dream. That novel was a shifting, unstable fantasia inspired by fears about GM and environmental degradation; in Tender Is the Flesh, the metaphorical equivalence with factory farming is blatant, served up to us with relish. And where the critique of carnivorousness in Michel Faber\u2019s Under the Skin was produced by estrangement, making the taste for human flesh literally an alien matter, here it\u2019s done through familiarity. It is all too easy, Bazterrica demonstrates, to imagine eating our sentient fellows. We do it already; we\u2019ve built the infrastructure. It\u2019s true that cannibalism is both unthinkable and repeatedly thought about. Though the \u201cspecial meat\u201d of Tender Is the Flesh offers a pleasing echo of that mysterious, addictive \u201cspecial stuff\u201d sold in the Royston Vasey butcher\u2019s, when quizzed if it was intended to be human flesh the League of Gentlemen writers scoffed that there was \u201cnothing more mundane than cannibalism\u201d. Bazterrica\u2019s obvious antecedent here is Soylent Green, which gets a mention as a banned film viewed via the dark web (that vision of climate crisis, authoritarian government and resource famine, it is salutary to note, is set in 2022). She also draws on the conventions of horror, steadily ramping up the revulsion and introducing a hammily vampiric Romanian in charge of the game reserve who says things like \u201cSince the world began, we\u2019ve been eating each other\u201d and \u201c\u2018Let us take pleasure in the atrocity.\u201d But Marcos\u2019s main obsession is not flesh but language: how we construct the world out of words, how we speak the unspeakable, and how we negotiate the gap between words and reality. In a narrative otherwise so blunt and blood-spattered, he piles metaphor on simile as he tries to convey the weight of others\u2019 words \u2013 his wife\u2019s voice \u201ca river of lights, an aerial torrent\u201d when discussing the child they might have, then uttering only \u201cblack holes\u201d when grieving his death; his sister\u2019s speech \u201clike boxes filled with blank paper\u201d, smelling \u201cof confinement, of intense cold\u201d. When he visits a laboratory experimenting on humans, the only way he can think of to defy the Mengele-like scientist in charge \u2013 whose words \u201care like tiny tadpoles dragging themselves along\u201d \u2013 is to withhold his own speech. But if this is a fable about the inadequacy of language in the face of darkness, it also resonates with sadness at the prospect of the silence humans can expect when we are alone in the world, in the wake of mass extinctions. This provocative, sorrowful novel expertly wields a double-edged cleaver: when Marcos points out that \u201cin the end, meat is meat, it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s from\u201d, it\u2019s a statement of both dystopic extremity and banal everyday fact. \u2022 Tender Is the Flesh, translated by Sarah Moses, is published by Pushkin (RRP \u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s impossible not to love Alina Cojocaru. There\u2019s no ballerina more natural on stage, a bringer of light with a kind of innocent intelligence always dancing around her face. A lead principal with English National Ballet, the 38-year-old now brings her first wholly self-produced offering, following the likes of Sylvie Guillem and Natalia Osipova in creating her own show. But where Guillem and Osipova used the platform to experiment with contemporary dance, that\u2019s not Cojocaru\u2019s jam. Instead, she brings a slightly disjointed collection of short ballets and films, followed by Frederick Ashton\u2019s meatier Marguerite and Armand from 1963. There are gemlike moments from the off. The simplicity of Tim Rushton\u2019s Reminiscence, danced with partner Johan Kobborg to Arvo P\u00e4rt offers goosebumpy delight in the tenderness of their hands meeting palm to palm. She raises her leg in delicate developp\u00e9 and it just keeps rising, as if lifted by air, so seemingly effortless is her mastery of this fiendish discipline. Two highlights are short films by choreographer/director Kim Brandstrup, beautifully made miniatures rich with insight into a dancer\u2019s world. The first, Faces, watches Cojocaru in mesmerising closeup as she marks through a dance in her head, her eyes tracing a story. Kiev is a personal portrait of the dancer revisiting her old ballet school and it poignantly shows the thread of learning passed on, the imprint of teachers\u2019 words and hands living in her dancing body. Marguerite and Armand is new to Cojocaru and she gives a sensitive performance as the consumptive courtesan mourning her lost young love, never tipping into the melodrama some dancers do. ENB\u2019s Francesco Gabriele Frola ably plays her adoring young lover, but their partnership doesn\u2019t soar to the absolute heights. Kobborg\u2019s own Les Lutins is a bit cutesy.

So much for girl power. The individual pieces all have much to recommend them, and there\u2019s live music, too, but the bitty format means there is little flow to the evening. Still, perhaps that can be forgiven for the luminous Cojocaru. \u2022 At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 23 February.",

It felt like exploitation \u2013 maybe fetishisation \u2013 and part of a cloud of doubt that settles over the whole. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2020 to replace an image of Tiffany Boone playing Roxy Jones, which had been incorrectly captioned as showing Jerrika Hinton in the role of Millie Malone.",

Australia have won it four times but never played host, which changes tonight when they take the field against India in the first of 20 group games. The prize for the locals is more than the trophy alone on this occasion: to advance to the final would be to turn out in front of 91,000 spectators when the final is played on the evening of International Women\u2019s Day, the 8th of March. </p> <p>But there might be the smallest exposure for the world\u2019s best team, so utterly dominant in this format since they won the title back in 2018 when it was last played for - expectations, as Mel Farrell wrote in her preview, can do funny things.</p> <p>In turn, it\u2019s probably a good thing for Meg Lanning\u2019s side that they face Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s charges at the sold out Sydney Showgrounds to start this competition in Group A - there will be no crusing against the women in blue. Indeed, it was only a couple of weeks ago that they dropped a T20 to them in the triseries build-up tournament, albeit before going on to win the final. </p> <p>Right, more on the teams as we work towards the toss in about ten minutes from now. As somebody who has followed the women\u2019s game closely over the last six years, I\u2019m gutted not to be in Sydney tonight but I\u2019m thrilled to have your back here on the OBO.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from the Sydney Showgrounds. What a thrilling start to this Women\u2019s T20 World Cup with India triumphant. Thanks for your company. Bye for now! Harmanpreet Kaur speaks. She says they wanted 140 on a slow track and were short of that but were not too worried with 132 if their bowlers delivered, which thye did. A lot of praise for Poonam, who has returned from injury to be a matchwinner tonight. The skipper believes they can win the Cup. What a victory! Meg Lanning speaks. She credits her bowlers for bringing it back after India got off to a flyer. The plan with the bat was to play straight as there wasn\u2019t much bounce but it didn\u2019t work, aside from Healy and Gardner. \u201cA lack of partnerships,\u201d the main issue. \u201cIndia bowled extremely well and deserve their win.\u201d Well said. She knows they have to get back on the horse straight away - indeed they do. Gotta love players who defy conventional wisdom. Poonam Yadav is too slow and too short - so we\u2019re told. But time and again, she\u2019s too skilful and too good. Her four wickets turned the tide across two outstanding overs after coming into the attack, sorting Australia\u2019s middle order out with wrong\u2019un after wrong\u2019un, the best of those skittling Ellyse Perry first ball. She is player of the match! Talking via a translator at the presentation, she thanks the medical staff and her family. WHAT A VICTORY! India bowl Australia out one ball short of facing out their overs. A quite magnificent fightback. The hosts are left stunned. Caught and bowled! Gardner gets a full toss but completely miscues it into the air, Pandey making no mistake in her follow through. India have all-but done it! HAS STRANO EDGED PANDEY? It\u2019s the first ball of the final over - she takes a massive swing. No, she hasn\u2019t... it\u2019s landed just short of Bhatia. That puts Gardner on strike as they came through for the run. \u201cAustralia are alive,\u201d declares Mel Jones on TV, because the biggest hitter in the land is where she needs to be, up the business end. 20 off five balls, though. By ay measure, it\u2019s a lot. Can she do it? 19th over: Australia 112-8 (Gardner 34, Strano 0) Target 133 Gardner leans back and pulls Deepti with authority into the gap at backward square for four from the penultimate delivery. Can she find the boundary again or keep the strike with a single from the final ball? No she can\u2019t, missing everything. Deepti Sharma, wonderfully done! Her four overs went for 17 after making 49 not out with the bat, coming in when India were reeling at the end of the power play. Australia need 21 from the final over with Strano on strike. How do they do this? Pandey to bowl it. Coming back for a desperate second run, an excellent throw from Rodrigues is good enough to run Kimmince out at the non-strikers\u2019 end. Australia are surely now asking too much of Gardner here. They need 25 from eight balls. 18th over: Australia 106-7 (Gardner 29, Kimmince 3) Target 133 Right, so, after all that, they have seen off Poonam\u2019s final over without further loss, adding just four runs. What a fascinating spell it was and a fascinating passage of play. Poonam Yadav finishes with 4/15 and proves once again that our game has room for the unconventional. Australia need 27 runs in two overs. India\u2019s to lose. NO BALL! It has bounced twice before arriving at the crease so it is not a legal delivery. Instead of walking off she gets herself a free hit! Blimey! CONTROVERSY! Poonam has bowled Gardner but... has it bounced twice? This is going to take some sorting out. It will be the defining moment of this game. 17th over: Australia 102-7 (Gardner 28, Kimmince 1) Target 133 What an over for India! The wicket of Sutherland and just two runs. Shikha Pandey take a bow. She has one further over to send down and will do so full of confidence. Kimmince got Australia over the line in an ODI against England in July but this is different gravy. Bhatia brilliant again! Sutherland walked down at the medium pace of Pandey, missing well outside the off-stump - she might have seen her coming. But the wicket was the wicketkeepers\u2019. She held her pose once again to take the ball before making an athletic dive; the bails taken in a flash. Joyous cricket! 16th over: Australia 100-6 (Gardner 27, Sutherland 2) Target 133 Big call from Harmanpreet holding Yadav back in order to get Gayakwad\u2019s final over bowled and it doesn\u2019t quite work, Gardner coming down the track and lofting her waaaay back over the rope for SIX and into the crowd as well. What a striker of the ball she is. But to the spinners\u2019 credit, she only went for nine all up - no disaster at this stage. 33 from 24 is the equation from here. Poonam still has one over to bowl. \u201cTell you what,\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cthis Indian cricket team knows how to stay in the contest. More than being clinical in their abilities, staying cool and holding one\u2019s nerves under pressure will help teams to win in this World Cup (as well as sports in general).\u201d They sure do. Super impressive fightback. 15th over: Australia 91-6 (Gardner 19, Sutherland 1) Target 133 Reddy starts her final over with a ball on Gardner\u2019s pads and is duly put away into the gap - calm batting from the player of the final back in 2018. Sutherland - off the mark to long-off - is also a very useful chaser, as seen during the triseries fixture against England last week, hammering 22 in 11 balls to take that game into a Super Over. With Gardner back on strike they run hard for two, the senior player of the pair making her ground by about a foot when the TV umpire checks it out. The hosts are now left with 42 runs to get from 30 deliveries. But can they get through Poonam? Indeed, when will the legspinner be called upon to bowl her fourth over? 14th over: Australia 82-6 (Gardner 11, Sutherland 0) Target 133 Goodness me! Another wrong\u2019un to finish, at Sutherland, who did not pick it! It goes within a couple of inches from crashing into her off-stump. Poonam has 4/15 with one over still up her sleeve. All the pressure now on Australia. 51 needed in six overs. POONAM HAS FOUR! Bhatia put down Jonassen earlier but makes no mistake this time around, the left-hander\u2019s underedge clipped and taken nice and low by the stumper. That\u2019s a lovely taken given the big swing at the wrong\u2019un, staying nice and still. Australia are in serious strife at the Sydney Showgrounds! 13th over: Australia 81-5 (Gardner 10, Jonassen 2) Target 133 I\u2019m being kind to Bhatia in my previous post... she should have taken that hat-trick chance. \u201cSnatched at it,\u201d the assessment of Adam Gilchrist on the telly. Another consolidation over after the wickets, worth five to the home side off Reddy. They now require 7.6 an over (or 52 from 42) with two Poonam Yadav overs to come. 12th over: Australia 76-5 (Gardner 7, Jonassen 0) Target 133 DROPPED HER! The hat-trick ball found Jonassen\u2019s edge - another wrong\u2019un - but Bhatia has put the tough chance down! Three perfect googlies on the trot. A game-changing spell. Find a telly, this has suddenly morphed into a sensational World Cup scrap. She\u2019s bowled her first ball! ANOTHER picture-perfect wrong\u2019un, through the gate and hitting Perry\u2019s leg-stump. My oh my, it\u2019s ALL happening at the Sydney Showgrounds. Poonam Yadav is ON A HAT-TRICK! Poonam Yadav! You cannot underestimate this skilful spinner. She has done Haynes a beauty with her wrong\u2019un, beating the dancing left-hander, the bails taken nicely by Bhatia to leave the veteran metres short of her ground. Game on? Well, maybe not quite with Perry walking out. But if they can get her early. 11th over: Australia 71-3 (Haynes 6, Gardner 2) Target 133 A slower over for the chasing team, as is so often the case after a wicket. Just four singles off Reddy. \u201cWith India being such a cricket tragic country it is not surprising to see the skill of this team,\u201d writes Don Easter. \u201cBut wow what a form improvement in 2020. Culturally for India this is a 21st century time for the womens team.\u201d It\u2019s easy to disregard how dominant they looked in the 2018 tournament until the semi-final stage, when England found a way to get past them in Antigua. Not only were they undefeated in their group, they beat Australia in that early stage. How often do we see it from the pint-sized leggie? One ball after being lifted over the rope for six by Healy - the opener bringing up her half-century in 34 balls with the blow - she is taken caught and bowled after misreading the flight and slow turn. A leading edge ends her night. An excellent innings but Poonam has found a way through, as she so often does. Coming up, a test of Australia\u2019s depth. 10th over: Australia 67-3 (Haynes 4, Gardner 0) Target 133 9th over: Australia 58-2 (Healy 44, Haynes 2) Target 133 That was a very good catch watching the replay back, Bhatia so happy with it that she elected not to take the bails with Lanning well short of her ground when taking the ball. Very tidy. Haynes, with so much experience on this ground in the Big Bash with the Thunder, is busy from the get-go with singles from her first two deliveries. Lovely finger spinners\u2019 wicket! Gayakwad wins Lanning\u2019s edge with plenty of flight, dip and spin, the thin edge then gloved safely by Bhatia moving to her right. 8th over: Australia 52-1 (Healy 40, Lanning 5) Target 133 And just when India earned themselves a bit of an opening, Healy slams it shut. Fantastic batting from the opener, dispatching Reddy\u2019s first ball - a poor halftracker - then capitalising on that advantage with a steer behind point for four more before lifting a rank full toss over midwicket for a third boundary in the over. She already has 40 from 29. 7th over: Australia 37-1 (Healy 26, Lanning 4) Target 133 Much better second over from Gayakwad, Lanning playing herself in watchfully. There was a chance to run Healy out when taking a quick single, but the throw needed to be a direct hit. 6th over: Australia 33-1 (Healy 25, Lanning 1) Target 133 Lanning off the mark with a single, making 33-1 for the power play - the same as India. A lot gets made of this but comparative scores really mean nothing because Australia know where India ended up and can tailor their innings accordingly. More wickets needed. And India have the breakthrough! That got a big on Mooney with some extra bounce, picking out backward point after making a bit of room for herself. 5th over: Australia 30-0 (Healy 24, Mooney 5) Target 133 Nothing expansive at all about Australia\u2019s power play approach, systematically working Deepti around the field for five singles this time around. All signs point to them cruising this. India need urgent wickets - quite a few of them - to transfer some presser back. 4th over: Australia 25-0 (Healy 22, Mooney 2) Target 133 Seam from India for the first time via Pandey and after taking a look to begin, Healy sets herself to launch straight back over the bowlers\u2019 head for four. Cop that. After making 25 runs in five innings during the recent tri-series, she has 22 from 17 balls to begin this tournament. Of course, Healy smashed 225 runs at 56 in Australia\u2019s 2018 triumph. 3rd over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 15, Mooney 2) Target 133 Lovely over this from Deepti, giving the ball a chance to spin and forcing Healy to play her respectfully as a result. Just two off the set but India did burn their review along the way. IS MOONEY LBW TO DEEPTI? Harmanpreet wants to review and I have no idea why, it has pitched a mile outside leg. DRS confirms this. Terrible referral. 2nd over: Australia 17-0 (Healy 15, Mooney 2) Gayakwad makes it spin from both ends to start, left-arm orthodox in her case. And sure enough, Healy - badly out of form before this tournament - is after her straight away with a deft sweep for four. She goes the other way for the same result two balls later, dancing down the pitch before launching her with a checked-drive down to the long-off rope. She\u2019s away. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Healy 4, Mooney 1) Quite brilliant fielding from Mandhana, diving full-stretch to drag in a Healy stroke that looked destined to reach the rope, winning the race by centimetres. But she\u2019s in trouble... holding her shoulder. Oh no, this could be terrible news for India. After clutching at the shoulder initially she was back on her feet but at the end of the over she leaves the field with the medical staff. Five from the set but the story is the superstar, Mandhana. The players are back on the field! Spin to begin: the experienced Deepti Sharma has the ball in her hand with Alyssa Healy taking the first delivery. She\u2019s there with the ever-reliable Beth Mooney. PLAY! That wasn\u2019t a good finish. Remember, India were 0/40 after four overs. Yes, they lost 3/9 in a hurry and were in strife; they had to rebuild. But they waited too long to pull the trigger and couldn\u2019t get resourceful enough at the end. Australia held their nerve after the early assault, stuck to a basic plan in the middle overs and bowled accurately in the final stanza. It\u2019s occasionally an easy game. 20th over: India 132-4 (Deepti 49, Krishnamurthy 9) Kimmince is truted with the final over and nails it with her range of cutters, neither Indian player able to get her away to the rope. It\u2019s a limp finish, just 17 runs coming from the final 18 balls. Australia require 133 to win, which should be straightforward with their line up. 19th over: India 125-4 (Deepti 45, Krishnamurthy 6) Excellent from Jess Jonassen, finishing her four overs with a set that goes for just four singles. Absolutely superb. She finishes with 2/24, getting Australia going after the sloppy start. They\u2019re going a good job inside the ground with the atmosphere, ZOMIE NATION getting a run between overs. If that can\u2019t get you on your feet, nothing will. 18th over: India 121-4 (Deepti 43, Krishnamurthy 4) Schutt knows the drill here, stump to stump with enough movement through the air to preclude a big swish. Six singles all told, which is a win for the hosts at this stage of the innings. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Tom Hopkins. \u201cJust wanted to say I love the sweater and am pleased to see you\u2019ve gone cream rather than iced white. Both on style grounds and because it probably hides the baby sick better. More seriously, she\u2019s absolutely gorgeous and so lucky to have parents like you. Hope everything is going great and mum is well (giving birth sounds challenging).\u201d Thank you, that\u2019s very kind. Winnie had the jumper gifted to her; initials on there and everything. Quite the present! Can\u2019t wait to get her to the cricket in April. And yes - we are all happy as can be: home, healthy and relaxed. Best week of my life. 17th over: India 115-4 (Deepti 39, Krishnamurthy 2) A lot happened this over but nothing more interesting to me than the no-ball called by the third umpire! Of course, that is the responsibility of the TV official now with the playing conditions changed for this tournament - and not before time. Krishnamurthy clips away the free hit to retain the strike. Earlier in the over, Deepti got busy. With her partnership with Rodrigues now over, the left-hander took some ownership with a sweep off Jonassen for four - their first bioundary in six overs. She made it two with another sweep two deliveries later. Can she now go on to stick the landing? Oh, that\u2019s very out! The DRS projection has the ball hitting middle halfway up. Lovely bowling from Kimmince, rewarded for her steady hand through the middle overs. The end of an important partnership with 24 balls remaining. 16th over: India 100-4 (Deepti 27) IS RODRIGUES LBW? Kimmince thinks so and the umpire agrees. But the Indian No3 is sending it upstairs, she thinks it has done too much. Stand by. 15th over: India 95-3 (Rodrigues 24, Deepti 24) Credit to India, this has been dedicated, effective and risk-free accumulation. This pair have now put on 48 in 53 balls - very good cricket; they needed this. But with five overs to go, they have to put the foot down to reach 150-plus. And that requires taking a few risks. 14th over: India 89-3 (Rodrigues 21, Deepti 21) Missed stumping! Down the legside off the seam of Schutt, but they are the type Healy so often executes so she\u2019s frustrated not to have taken Deepti\u2019s bails. Much as it has been over the last half an hour for India, there are singles from every ball in addition to the legside wide. 13th over: India 82-3 (Rodrigues 18, Deepti 18) Credit to India for going at just over a run a ball over the last five overs - it is what they needed to do after losing three wickets in a hurry. They\u2019re advanced the game to the stage where they have a base to crack on from in the final stretch. Who will they really take on, though? 12th over: India 76-3 (Rodrigues 15, Deepti 15) Kimmince is from the old school of women\u2019s cricket, forcing the batters to make the pace. I was momentarily distracted at the end of the over as my baby girl - a week old today - was brought downstairs to me for a cuddle. Winnie is her name. Check out her cricket jumper. 11th over: India 70-3 (Rodrigues 13, Deepti 12) Ash Gardner, who dominated that aforementioned 2018 final, is on as Australia\u2019s sixth bowling option now. Deepti Sharma doesn\u2019t mind that though, getting down low to sweep hard and sweep well to the role - India\u2019s first boundary for nearly seven overs. They\u2019ve put on 23. 10th over: India 63-3 (Rodrigues 11, Deepti 7) Australia have a variety of options with their fifth bowler and Kimmince gets the first opportunity. She was quite outstanding during their victory against England in the 2018 Final - indeed, throughout that tournament and ever since. A great story too, giving the game away after initially playing international cricket, working in a London pub for a time as she got away from it all. Six risk-free runs are added in her first over as India rebuild their base through these middle overs. Rodrigues has another gear to click into at some stage; I wonder who she will decide to take on? Strano, perhaps? 9th over: India 57-3 (Rodrigues 7, Deepti 5) Clever captaincy from Lanning to bring Schutt back now with the pressure back on India. The South Australian was taken apart from Verma during the power play, hammered for four boundaries in five balls. This time around, she\u2019s very happy to concede six singles. In fairness, that\u2019s good batting from India too - they need to get their mojo back and fast. 8th over: India 51-3 (Rodrigues 4, Deepti 2) The squeeze is on now. India have moved from 40-0 after four overs to 49-3 after four more. Perry gives them nothing this time around, conceding just a couple of singles behind square. 7th over: India 49-3 (Rodrigues 3, Deepti 1) Deepti is off the mark with a single to finish the successful Jonassen over. I wonder if they would have considered shifting Veda Krisnamurthy - one of my favourite players - up to No5 given how much experience she brings. Alas, we\u2019ll see her later as the finisher, I\u2019m sure. The skipper is gone! A dance, a swing, a miss! Healy is very fortunate, the ball deflecting from her pads into the stumps after missing it with her gloves. But this doesn\u2019t dampen her celebration: they know how big that is in a major tournament - it was Harmanpreet who destroyed them in the 2017 World Cup semi-final. 6th over: India 46-2 (Rodrigues 2, Harmanpreet 2) Wonderfully dragged back by experienced campaigners Jonassen then Perry, conceding just six runs from the final two overs of the power play and removing both openers in the process. The one they wanted! Perry had an lbw overturned earlier in the over but that matters little now as the danger woman Verma is back in the shed. She miscued her pull shot, directing it straight into the hands of Sutherland at mid-on. The end of a dazzling power play cameo from the youngster. That\u2019s a big moment. REVIEW! NOT OUT! Rodrigues is given out lbw to Perry but sends it straight upstairs. She was right to do so, DRS showing that the ball was missing leg. 5th over: India 42-1 (Verma 29, Rodrigues 1) Another shout for leg before, the Australians up when the No3 Rodrigues misses her sweep, but it was sliding down leg on this occasion. Super stuff from Jonassen after the flurry of boundaries in the previous couple of overs, a wicket and just two runs coming from her first set. Manadana tried to immediately put the foot down against the left-arm spin of Jonassen but missed her sweep, going straight onto middle stump. No review required there. It\u2019s early days, but Australia needed that to steady themselves. 4th over: India 40-0 (Verma 29, Mandhana 10) Bang, bang, bang! Verma goes again, this time at Schutt, hammering her for three boundaries in four balls! What a magnificent start this is for the Indian openers. And it isn\u2019t just the power either, this is class. Over mid-off with a checked drive, cut away past point then a square drive to die for with supreme timing. She barely swung her bat! And a fourth four to finish the over too, ticking a loose delivery away to the rope. 16 off it! Blimey. 3rd over: India 24-0 (Verma 13, Mandhana 10) Verma gets down the track to Strano and lashes her inside-out through cover for four. Shooot. Ohhh and she does it again three balls later, all the way for SIX! Have that! The young gun is away! 2nd over: India 11-0 (Verma 1, Mandhana 9) DROPPED! Mandhana dropped by Strano at midwicket from Perry\u2019s second ball. Oh, how costly that might turn out to be. Should have taken it. Dropping catches has been a weakness for Strano in her brief appearances at the top level. Later in the over, the left-hander starts to make the most of her chance, picking up Perry and middling her over midwicket for four. It prompts a change to around the wicket for the final delivery of the over and she misses well wide off the off-stump, called accordingly. Mandhana capitalises on the re-bowled ball, smashing it over long-off for four more! 1st over: India 2-0 (Verma 1, Mandhana 1) As Mel Jones confirms on telly, Strano has picked up Verma five times in seven attempts, the two having squared off against each other on an \u2018A\u2019 tour last year. It\u2019s a fantastic start from the off-spinner, too. Verma is of the mark with a push but Mandhana can\u2019t beat the field, her outside edge located and clipping Healy\u2019s glove on the way through to short third. You wouldn\u2019t call that a dropped catch but it is a little victory for the hosts. Just two from the over - outstanding. Strano is also one of the most entertaining players on the circuit. As Vish hints at here, we were both part of her elaborate recreation of Shane Warne\u2019s ball of the century with Mike Gatting at a Canterbury pub during the 2015 Women\u2019s Ashes. Strano to Verma it is! What a story for the Victorian spinner. PLAY!! The players are on the field for the national anthems. Australia are huddled up, ready to get into their work. Molly Strano has an impressive record against the wunderkind Verma, so expect to see her bowling the first over. Here we go! \u201cHello Sydney, welcome to the Big Dance.\u201d Get used to this gibberish branding over the next couple of weeks. For those who aren\u2019t from Australia, it relates to cricket inferiority complex with football. A long, weird, unnecessary story. Thrilled to see Annabel Sutherland given the nod tonight, a true product of the system that Australia have been building with the WBBL and the WNCL. She\u2019s a legitimate all-rounder, able to finish off innings with both the bat and the ball. The pitch, so says Michael Clarke on the broadcast, is a belter. He declares that Sydney is the best city on earth. Each to their own, Pup. Each to their own. We\u2019re now getting a bit of the opening ceremony on the coverage, which was surely filmed earlier as there are a lot of empty seats as they pan around. Right? Australia: Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Annabel Sutherland, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Molly Strano, Megan Schutt. India: Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Deepti Sharma, Veda Krishnamurthy, Shikha Pandey, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Arundhati Reddy, Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bowl first and see what happens,\u201d Meg Lanning says in her usual, casual matter-of-fact fashion. There\u2019s a bit of rain about in Sydney, she notes. Molly Strano is straight into the XI! She wasn\u2019t in the squad two days ago, coming in for the injured Tayla Vlaeminck, and she\u2019s immediately wins her chance. Wow. Harmanpreet acknowledges that India \u201cdefinitely\u201d would have bowled as well. Full teams shortly. This is the tough group. Make no mistake, qualification out of Group A is a lot more challenging than it is over in Group B, which begins tomorrow when the West Indies play Thailand. The loser tonight will have to overcome New Zealand later in the pool stage to guarantee progress, which is never straightforward. For India, they are relying on the strength of their top four to pile on the pressure. Since the last time a major tournament was played in 2018, that includes 16-year-old prodigy Shafila Verma at the top of the list. Last year, at age 15, she became the youngest Indian to ever clock an international half-century. She\u2019ll join Smriti Mandhana, on her day the most effective player in the world. They are followed by the skipper Harmanpreet, who knows all about breaking Australian hearts, then the busy Jemimah Rodrigues, who is going to strength to strength. While we wait for the toss here\u2019s Geoff Lemon on the journey Australian women\u2019s cricket has been on over the last five years. And what a story it has been. This tournament, now into its seventh iteration, has been a long time in the making. Australia have won it four times but never played host, which changes tonight when they take the field against India in the first of 20 group games. The prize for the locals is more than the trophy alone on this occasion: to advance to the final would be to turn out in front of 91,000 spectators when the final is played on the evening of International Women\u2019s Day, the 8th of March. But there might be the smallest exposure for the world\u2019s best team, so utterly dominant in this format since they won the title back in 2018 when it was last played for - expectations, as Mel Farrell wrote in her preview, can do funny things. In turn, it\u2019s probably a good thing for Meg Lanning\u2019s side that they face Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s charges at the sold out Sydney Showgrounds to start this competition in Group A - there will be no crusing against the women in blue. Indeed, it was only a couple of weeks ago that they dropped a T20 to them in the triseries build-up tournament, albeit before going on to win the final. Right, more on the teams as we work towards the toss in about ten minutes from now. As somebody who has followed the women\u2019s game closely over the last six years, I\u2019m gutted not to be in Sydney tonight but I\u2019m thrilled to have your back here on the OBO. Are you heading along? If so, do drop me a line. Welcome!",

It will be a fleeting trip \u2013 lasting less than 36 hours \u2013 but Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in India on Monday on his first official visit has prompted a frenzied, costly and controversial beautification drive by authorities. In Ahmedabad, in the western state of Gujarat, where the US president will fly on Monday to attend a huge rally with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, dubbed \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d, this 2 metre (6ft) wall has been a particular point of contention. Quickly erected this week, it serves to hide the stretch of slums along the route due to be taken by Trump\u2019s motorcade. The outrage at the project was coupled with some amusement in India, with many noting that \u201cTrump finally got his wall\u201d. Eviction notices were also served this week to more than 40 slum dwellers in the vicinity of the new cricket stadium where Monday\u2019s rally will be held, and street vendors were removed from the motorcade route, destroying their livelihoods. All stray dogs, cats and monkeys have been cleared. The irony of the climate science denier Trump arriving in Gujarat, a state already suffering some of the worst effects of the climate crisis including mass water shortages and drastically rising temperatures in its cities, was not lost on environmental activists in Ahmedabad. The activist Rohit Prajapati said some of the beautification measures being rolled out for Trump were environmentally detrimental. Trees are being chopped down for security purposes, and fresh water is being temporarily released into the Sabarmati River in Gujurat and the Yamuna River in Agra, where Trump will visit the Taj Mahal, to create the illusion that these usually toxic, sewage-ridden and smelly rivers are flowing normally. Prajapati said police surveillance of activists had increased in recent days to try to stop protests during Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cIt is almost like we are under house arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the past few days I am under constant surveillance and everywhere I go they follow us. They can\u2019t arrest us because that would make the news so instead they are terrorising our neighbours, family, to create an atmosphere of intimidation.\u201d Residents have also alleged that the increased security restrictions have led to increased police harassment of the Muslim community in Ahmedabad. The adulation India typically shows US presidents is likely to play well to Trump\u2019s ego, while Modi, grappling with a huge backlash against his BJP government\u2019s new citizenship law and one of India\u2019s biggest periods of unrest in 40 years, will hope to bolster his domestic image. Trump has been retweeting Indian accounts of the grandiose welcome that awaits him, including Modi\u2019s far-fetched claim that 7 million people will come out to greet him in Ahmedabad \u2013 almost the population of the entire city. More realistic estimates say around 100,000 people are likely to line the streets, while the stadium where the rally will be held seats 120,000. Tanvi Madan, the director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said: \u201cIn some ways, American presidents go to India to feel loved.\u201d Yet it may not be entirely seamless.

On the journey to India, or on the way back, Trump is also expected to make a detour to Afghanistan to sign a deal with the Taliban. There is always the risk of surprise with Trump. Modi was visibly bewildered when the president offered to broker a peace deal with Pakistan over Kashmir, the sort of outside intervention India has resolutely opposed. But Bruce Riedel, who travelled to India with Bill Clinton as a special adviser in 2000, suggested that the prime minister could reasonably expect not to be embarrassed by his visitor over his actions in Kashmir and the erosion of democratic norms in Indian public life. \u201cThe good news for India is that the last person in the world likely to raise any of these issues is Donald Trump,\u201d he said.",

We wanted to ask him to sing, but nobody had the nerve to do it. We had the guitar around the corner hiding!\", 2:D - Who will be Owen\u2019s manager and Andy\u2019s adversary on Sunday., 3:D - City beat G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the final. Neither team has reached a European final since., 4:C - Pavoletti denies he was in a fight. \"We came out of the restaurant, start joking around and pushing each other. I felt my knee give way and found myself on the ground without really knowing why. It was just bad luck.\", 5:D - Yes, really. Gowda can run 100m in less than 11 seconds, but he only hits world record pace with the help of a herd., 6:D - Hostilities between Terville and Soetrich continued after the match, spilling into the dressing room and then the car park. When a Terville player stepped in to calm things down, an opponent bit his member. The victim needed 12 stitches and had to take four days off work to recover. The teams are playing again in May, which should be fun., 7:C - They lost games to Napoli, Red Star Belgrade, PSG and Barcelona last season and have lost to Napoli and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this season., 8:B - The record was 6.16 metres before Duplantis came along.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Mattha Busby with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump: Roger Stone has \u2018very good chance of exoneration\u2019 Roger Stone, a self-described political dirty trickster and longtime ally of the president, was sentenced on Thursday to more than three years in prison after attempting to sabotage the congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to investigators about his contacts with WikiLeaks and trying to block the testimony of a witness to protect Donald Trump. After his sentencing, a representative for Stone urged Trump to \u201cright this horrible wrong\u201d and pardon him \u2013 before the president suggested he might do so. \u2018Totally tainted\u2019. The president undermined proceedings, tweeting they were \u201cfraudulent\u201d and claiming the jury forewoman was an \u201canti-Trump activist\u201d during a running commentary of the case. Above the law? This week, Trump issued pardons and commutations to nearly a dozen other convicts guilty of public corruption, also ageing white men with personal ties to him. Bots responsible for one in four tweets about climate crisis An army of automated Twitter bots are distorting online conversations to make climate science denialism more prevalent, with research finding a quarter of all climate-related tweets are produced by bots. Analysis of millions of tweets from around the time Trump announced he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in June 2017 suggested bots had a substantial impact in amplifying misinformation, while disproportionately tending to applaud and support the president. \u2018Fake science\u2019. Bots were responsible for 38% of tweets that claimed scientific falsehoods with the phrase used by Trump to dismiss the climate crisis, and 28% of all tweets about the petroleum giant Exxon. Bloomberg campaign posts heavily edited video of debate A misleading video capturing a snapshot of the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s widely criticised Democratic debate performance, which suggests he silenced his rivals after saying he is the \u201conly one here, I think, that\u2019s ever started a business\u201d, will not be removed from Instagram. The decision by the social media platform prompted fresh concern over the policing of online disinformation by politicians, but the Bloomberg campaign said it was \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d and not meant to be viewed as real. Not a violation. A spokesman for Facebook said \u201cthis video does not violate our manipulated media policy\u201d, while Twitter said it would probably fall under a new policy warning of significantly altered content. Russia working for Trump re-election, officials warned \u2013 reports Members of Congress were told Russia was trying to interfere in the 2020 election campaign in favour of Donald Trump last week, according to reports that said it led to the abrupt removal of the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire. The alleged briefing led the president to announce the appointment of the hardline loyalist Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany, after a confrontation with Maguire, a former navy admiral, in the Oval Office. Motive. Grenell\u2019s appointment is an attempt to politicize intelligence and hide information from Congress as Russia again assists Trump, claimed the former justice department spokesman Matthew Miller on Twitter. Cheat sheet Parts of the UK have one Airbnb listing for every four properties, with the prevalence of the letting company in cities and villages believed to be depriving locals of much-needed homes \u2013 fears mirrored in Barcelona. A 29-year-old doctor in Wuhan has become the latest victim of coronavirus as China reported infections in prisons across three provinces, as well as clusters in Beijing, and the virus spread in South Korea. For the first time, an AI algorithm that trawled through vast digital libraries of pharmaceutical compounds has discovered a powerful antibiotic that can kill dangerous drug-resistant bacteria. Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian group with lawyers worldwide working against LGBTQ+ people, reportedly received $55m in donations in 2018 and has forced cases before the US supreme court. Must-reads New York City\u2019s Chinatown takes hit over coronavirus fears Businesses in the usually busy neighborhood are cutting staff amid dropping sales even though the virus has no presence, as the illness stigmatises people of Chinese descent and fuels irrational fears \u2013 prompting a new campaign, Show Some Love for Chinatown. A playwright wants only critics of color to review her Criticism should \u201ccome from a place of knowledge\u201d, the Indigenous artist Yolanda Bonnell has said after receiving racist reviews. How the American dream died on the world\u2019s busiest border The US-Mexico border has become a focal point for human suffering, writes Ed Vulliamy, with tent cities full of terrified migrants on one side, border guards alleged to have left a Guatemalan teenager to die in a concrete cell in the middle, and a country that has increasingly lost its way on the other. The yee-haw agenda\u2019s founder on the politics of cowboy style Black cowboys are back on centre stage. Erased from history, despite one in four cowboys believed to have been black, the fashion sense of celebrities such as Lil Nas X is at the forefront of a new movement that challenges the ubiquity of the white American cowboy myth. Opinion Mike Bloomberg\u2019s debate was a disaster, but that\u2019s not enough to rule him out, writes the Guardian columnist Emma Brockes. Bloomberg\u2019s implosion on Wednesday, a man blinking in the headlights of his own defeat, will be right up there, but possibly because, for depressing reasons, it may not rule him out of the race.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/02/sally-rooney-interview-dont-respond-authority-normal-people\" title=\"\">Sally Rooney</a> doesn\u2019t come across as someone who spends a lot of time on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat\" title=\"\">Snapchat</a>. There is no scene in her 2018 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Normal People</a></em> where her protagonists Marianne and Connell bond over the camera filter that turns your face into a dog. The characters in her debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Conversations With Friends</a></em> (2017), mostly communicate by text. Nevertheless, the label \u201cSalinger for the Snapchat generation\u201d \u2013 apparently dreamed up by an editor at Faber \u2013 surfaces in every article about the Irish author. Including this one.</p> <p>It would be dishonest to pretend it doesn\u2019t serve a purpose. Addictive apps are associated with millennials, much in the same way as scary drugs or outlandish musical genres were with earlier generations. JD Salinger\u2019s coming-of-age novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield\" title=\"\">The</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield\" title=\"\">Catcher in the Rye</a></em> (1951) made him the archetypal \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d \u2013 and even if the coolly detached prose of <em>Normal People</em> seems at odds with Holden Caulfield\u2019s overt anger, Rooney\u2019s characters are no less preoccupied with phoniness. Connell, the idealised working-class hero, studies English because \u201cthere it is: literature moves him\u201d. Only, when he arrives at Trinity College, Dublin, he discovers that his richer classmates use books primarily as a way of appearing cultured. \u201cEven if the writer himself was a good person, and even if his book really was insightful, all books were ultimately marketed as status symbols, and all writers participated to some degree in this marketing. Presumably this was how the industry made money.\u201d </p> <p><em>Normal People</em> has been greeted by readers, critics and booksellers alike as one of those novels that captures something ineffable about its age. The forthcoming BBC adaptation stretches its 266 pages to a decadent 12 episodes, a pages-to-minutes ratio that recalls the famous 1981 version of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/30/brideshead.revisited\" title=\"\">Brideshead Revisited</a></em>, which spent as much time on the apparently incidental scenes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/evelynwaugh\" title=\"\">Evelyn Waugh</a>\u2019s novel (the whisky and water business on the ocean liner, for example) as it did on the central plot. <em>Normal People</em> is also a novel of tiny details and the beats of pleasure that come from noticing them: \u201cLife offers up these moments of joy despite everything.\u201d</p> <p>From 1953 until his death in 2010, Salinger hid in his cottage in rural New Hampshire. He submitted nothing more to his publisher after 1965. Which suggests that the \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d label might be as much of a curse as an honour. As Rooney herself said in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/02/sally-rooney-interview-dont-respond-authority-normal-people\" title=\"\">Guardian interview</a>: \u201cI certainly never intended to speak for anyone other than myself. Even myself I find it difficult to speak for. My books may well fail as artistic endeavours but I don\u2019t want them to fail for failing to speak for a generation for which I never intended to speak in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The generation-defining label has been applied to books as various as F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s <em>This Side of Paradise</em> (1920), Jack Kerouac\u2019s <em>On the Road</em> (1957), Joan Didion\u2019s <em>The White Album</em> (1979), Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/02/evil-under-the-sun-the-dark-brilliance-of-bret-easton-ellis\" title=\"\">Less Than Zero</a></em> (1986), Douglas Coupland\u2019s <em>Generation X</em> (1991), Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s <em>Fight Club</em> (1996) and Zadie Smith\u2019s <em>White Teeth</em> (2000). </p> <p>Then there are the books that slipped between the historical cracks. Sid Chaplin\u2019s <em>The Day of the Sardine</em> (1961), about a disaffected young man coming of age in the coal-mining north-east, was typical of the 1950s-60s wave of \u201cAngry Young Man\u201d novels. Ann Quin\u2019s mordant, creepy novel <em>Berg</em> (1964) was praised in its day as presenting \u201ca working-class voice from England quite unlike any other\u201d \u2013 but Quin was too avant garde for mainstream acceptance. Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s <em>The Country Girls</em> (1960) gave voice to an emerging Irish sensibility \u2013 but O\u2019Brien was usually pressed into representing her country rather than her generation. At least Rooney has managed to evade that responsibility.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The zillennials or the zoomers are going to be rebelling against the aspirational values of millennials and that is going to be a very interesting moment</p> <footer> <cite>Bret Easton Ellis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume,\u201d says the literary agent Karolina Sutton, \u201cwe are talking about debut writers who write about the realities of modern life in a way that breaks away from what came immediately before them. They assert a new set of values in response \u2013 and often in opposition \u2013 to the values they inherited from the previous generation. I think voice is a key word. Perhaps it\u2019s defiance or urgency or a political stance, even if it is not overtly expressed, something that feels bold, relevant and uncompromising. And it has an emotional truth to it that speaks to a specific generation.\u201d</p> <p>Among contemporary novelists, you might point to Ottessa Moshfegh, Hanya Yanagihara, Sheila Heti, Ben Lerner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/candice-carty-williams\" title=\"\">Candice Carty-Williams</a>. But is the novel where we should be looking? How about non-fiction writers: Jia Tolentino, Reni Eddo-Lodge, Emilie Pine? Or screenwriters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\" title=\"\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>? But as Sutton notes, each of these candidates would surely detest the label. \u201cThey rightly challenge the narrative of universal perspectives as it makes no sense in the context of race, economic background, gender, sexuality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that there was a common sensibility among emerging writers,\u201d says Deborah Treisman, fiction editor of the New Yorker, reflecting on the 200 to 300 story submissions she has received each week since 1997. \u201cWriters emerge, by definition, because they\u2019re not like everyone else.\u201d She notes that current events \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> movement, the Trump presidency, the climate crisis, social media \u2013 are taking less time to percolate into fiction than they once did. \u201cBut fiction writers stand out not because of the events or cultural waves they\u2019re inspired by but because of what they do with that material.\u201d</p> <p>Lena Dunham made a good joke about all this in her TV series, <em>Girls</em>. \u201cI think I might be the voice of my generation\u201d says Hannah, an aspiring writer (played by Dunham), before backpedalling: \u201cOr at least <em>a</em> voice of <em>a</em> generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c7a6649123a01619200f2c6d17f9b1c056fa06d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c7a6649123a01619200f2c6d17f9b1c056fa06d/0_0_680_409/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Dunham in Girls (2017).\" width=\"500\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lena Dunham in Girls (2012-2017).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\" title=\"\">Roxane Gay</a>, author of <em>Bad Feminist</em>, has argued that Dunham really does merit the description. \u201cWhat is a voice of a generation, really? The phrase offers a seductive rhetorical flourish that speaks, at its core, to a yearning. We are forever in search of someone who will speak not only to us but for us.\u201d On the evidence of Dunham\u2019s essay collection, <em>Not That Kind of Girl</em> (2014), Gay found that she was just such a person: \u201cgutsy, audacious, willing to stand up and shout.\u201d</p> <p>Though isn\u2019t this gutsiness more characteristic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/gen-x-has-survived-its-gloomy-formative-years-now-we-will-have-to-deal-with-climate-change\" title=\"\">Generation X</a> (ie Gay\u2019s generation) than it is of millennials? Millennials do have common experiences that transcend identity \u2013 the financial crash, the shadow of climate change, growing up on the internet \u2013 but they are also acutely aware of the problems of speaking for other people. And if they are not aware of it when they set out, they will soon be made aware of it.</p> <p>Sian Norris, director of the Bristol Women\u2019s Literature festival, believes the label should be retired immediately. \u201cWhich generation? Who gets to decide?\u201d she wonders. \u201cThere should be some self\u2011awareness of who is excluded from these narratives.\u201d She also notes that pretty much all the current voice-of-a-generation candidates are female. \u201cWe have this tendency to lump all women writers together,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a young woman comes out, she\u2019s not seen as representing her own story. She\u2019s seen as somehow representing all women. None of that is to detract from Sally Rooney\u2019s brilliance \u2013 she explores a whole range of issues that are relevant to young people today. But it means she then becomes a target for all criticisms aimed at millennials.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s notable that the zeitgeisty coming-of-age novels lauded in the 1980s and 90s were usually by young men. Extreme drug-taking, degrading sex, casual violence and parodic consumerism were hallmarks \u2013 but so too was a flat, affectless tone that rendered the excess all the more shocking. Take this postcoital moment from Ellis\u2019s <em>Less Than Zero</em>, set among the sort of dead-eyed rich kids he grew up with in 1980s Los Angeles:</p> <blockquote> <p>I lie there, naked, sunglasses still on and she hands me a box of Kleenex. I wipe myself off then look through a Vogue that\u2019s lying by the side of the bed. She puts a robe on and stares at me. I can hear thunder in the distance and it begins to rain harder.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI guess I was trying to capture a kind of book I hadn\u2019t read before,\u201d Ellis recalls. \u201cI wanted to strip the coming-of-age novel of any kind of conventionality \u2013 kids good/parents bad \u2013 and eliminate the aspirational quality that fiction about young people usually possesses. I wanted to capture a state of numbness as a feeling through a very neutral voice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18d666f7f83f8bf0bffaff5e441ca9ca790c490a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18d666f7f83f8bf0bffaff5e441ca9ca790c490a/0_120_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Downey Junior in the 2002 film adaptation of Less Than Zero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Downey Jr in the 2002 film adaptation of Less Than Zero.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He reread it recently and \u201cit was OK\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m always struck by the control which gives the book a tension even when nothing\u2019s happening \u2013 impressive, I suppose.

In a recent interview to promote his essay collection <em>White</em> he complained: \u201cThey don\u2019t care about literature. None of them read books. Where is the great millennial novel?

Rooney\u2019s style is often described as spare, elegant, minimalist: \u201cHer paragraphs are built for the Instagram age,\u201d noted Christine Smallwood in the New Republic. \u201cThey are plain as white walls, empty rooms with one beautiful accent, like a potted fern.\u201d</p> <p>And the way that Rooney assesses feelings recalls the dispassion with which Ellis describes material reality. In Rooney\u2019s essay about her years as a teenage debating champion, she writes about a horror of appearing passionate: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to debate in order to express passion: I wanted to be aloof and cerebral like the speakers I most admired.\u201d Note the aloofness with which Marianne considers her own compulsion towards abusive relationships:</p> <blockquote> <p>How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary.

Francesca Wade, co-editor of the White Review, recalls publishing an early story by Rooney, \u201cAt the Clinic\u201d, which featured characters named Connell and Marianne, before <em>Conversations With Friends</em> was published. \u201cI was immediately struck by the directness of her writing and how subtly she\u2019d evoked the nuanced and very moving dynamic between her two characters.

      "bodyText": "Sally Rooney doesn\u2019t come across as someone who spends a lot of time on Snapchat. There is no scene in her 2018 novel Normal People where her protagonists Marianne and Connell bond over the camera filter that turns your face into a dog. The characters in her debut, Conversations With Friends (2017), mostly communicate by text. Nevertheless, the label \u201cSalinger for the Snapchat generation\u201d \u2013 apparently dreamed up by an editor at Faber \u2013 surfaces in every article about the Irish author. Including this one. It would be dishonest to pretend it doesn\u2019t serve a purpose. Addictive apps are associated with millennials, much in the same way as scary drugs or outlandish musical genres were with earlier generations. JD Salinger\u2019s coming-of-age novel The Catcher in the Rye (1951) made him the archetypal \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d \u2013 and even if the coolly detached prose of Normal People seems at odds with Holden Caulfield\u2019s overt anger, Rooney\u2019s characters are no less preoccupied with phoniness. Connell, the idealised working-class hero, studies English because \u201cthere it is: literature moves him\u201d. Only, when he arrives at Trinity College, Dublin, he discovers that his richer classmates use books primarily as a way of appearing cultured. \u201cEven if the writer himself was a good person, and even if his book really was insightful, all books were ultimately marketed as status symbols, and all writers participated to some degree in this marketing. Presumably this was how the industry made money.\u201d Normal People has been greeted by readers, critics and booksellers alike as one of those novels that captures something ineffable about its age. The forthcoming BBC adaptation stretches its 266 pages to a decadent 12 episodes, a pages-to-minutes ratio that recalls the famous 1981 version of Brideshead Revisited, which spent as much time on the apparently incidental scenes in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s novel (the whisky and water business on the ocean liner, for example) as it did on the central plot. Normal People is also a novel of tiny details and the beats of pleasure that come from noticing them: \u201cLife offers up these moments of joy despite everything.\u201d From 1953 until his death in 2010, Salinger hid in his cottage in rural New Hampshire. He submitted nothing more to his publisher after 1965. Which suggests that the \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d label might be as much of a curse as an honour. As Rooney herself said in a Guardian interview: \u201cI certainly never intended to speak for anyone other than myself. Even myself I find it difficult to speak for. My books may well fail as artistic endeavours but I don\u2019t want them to fail for failing to speak for a generation for which I never intended to speak in the first place.\u201d The generation-defining label has been applied to books as various as F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (1920), Jack Kerouac\u2019s On the Road (1957), Joan Didion\u2019s The White Album (1979), Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s Less Than Zero (1986), Douglas Coupland\u2019s Generation X (1991), Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s Fight Club (1996) and Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth (2000). Then there are the books that slipped between the historical cracks. Sid Chaplin\u2019s The Day of the Sardine (1961), about a disaffected young man coming of age in the coal-mining north-east, was typical of the 1950s-60s wave of \u201cAngry Young Man\u201d novels. Ann Quin\u2019s mordant, creepy novel Berg (1964) was praised in its day as presenting \u201ca working-class voice from England quite unlike any other\u201d \u2013 but Quin was too avant garde for mainstream acceptance. Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Country Girls (1960) gave voice to an emerging Irish sensibility \u2013 but O\u2019Brien was usually pressed into representing her country rather than her generation. At least Rooney has managed to evade that responsibility. \u201cLet\u2019s assume,\u201d says the literary agent Karolina Sutton, \u201cwe are talking about debut writers who write about the realities of modern life in a way that breaks away from what came immediately before them. They assert a new set of values in response \u2013 and often in opposition \u2013 to the values they inherited from the previous generation. I think voice is a key word. Perhaps it\u2019s defiance or urgency or a political stance, even if it is not overtly expressed, something that feels bold, relevant and uncompromising. And it has an emotional truth to it that speaks to a specific generation.\u201d Among contemporary novelists, you might point to Ottessa Moshfegh, Hanya Yanagihara, Sheila Heti, Ben Lerner and Candice Carty-Williams. But is the novel where we should be looking? How about non-fiction writers: Jia Tolentino, Reni Eddo-Lodge, Emilie Pine? Or screenwriters such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge? But as Sutton notes, each of these candidates would surely detest the label. \u201cThey rightly challenge the narrative of universal perspectives as it makes no sense in the context of race, economic background, gender, sexuality.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that there was a common sensibility among emerging writers,\u201d says Deborah Treisman, fiction editor of the New Yorker, reflecting on the 200 to 300 story submissions she has received each week since 1997. \u201cWriters emerge, by definition, because they\u2019re not like everyone else.\u201d She notes that current events \u2013 the #MeToo movement, the Trump presidency, the climate crisis, social media \u2013 are taking less time to percolate into fiction than they once did. \u201cBut fiction writers stand out not because of the events or cultural waves they\u2019re inspired by but because of what they do with that material.\u201d Lena Dunham made a good joke about all this in her TV series, Girls. \u201cI think I might be the voice of my generation\u201d says Hannah, an aspiring writer (played by Dunham), before backpedalling: \u201cOr at least a voice of a generation.\u201d Roxane Gay, author of Bad Feminist, has argued that Dunham really does merit the description. \u201cWhat is a voice of a generation, really? The phrase offers a seductive rhetorical flourish that speaks, at its core, to a yearning. We are forever in search of someone who will speak not only to us but for us.\u201d On the evidence of Dunham\u2019s essay collection, Not That Kind of Girl (2014), Gay found that she was just such a person: \u201cgutsy, audacious, willing to stand up and shout.\u201d Though isn\u2019t this gutsiness more characteristic of Generation X (ie Gay\u2019s generation) than it is of millennials? Millennials do have common experiences that transcend identity \u2013 the financial crash, the shadow of climate change, growing up on the internet \u2013 but they are also acutely aware of the problems of speaking for other people. And if they are not aware of it when they set out, they will soon be made aware of it. Sian Norris, director of the Bristol Women\u2019s Literature festival, believes the label should be retired immediately. \u201cWhich generation? Who gets to decide?\u201d she wonders. \u201cThere should be some self\u2011awareness of who is excluded from these narratives.\u201d She also notes that pretty much all the current voice-of-a-generation candidates are female. \u201cWe have this tendency to lump all women writers together,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a young woman comes out, she\u2019s not seen as representing her own story.

(This analysis only refers to those ads that are explicitly referencing African Americans or Latinos, and does not mean that Bloomberg was not attempting to reach those voters with other messages.)</p> <p>The campaign\u2019s spending on ads with messaging about women or reproductive health is substantial. Overall, the campaign\u2019s ads have been shown to significantly more women than men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"B O O O O - MBERG\">  <iframe title=\"Who sees Bloomberg's Facebook ads?&amp;nbsp;\" aria-label=\"Interactive donut chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u8CRw/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"370\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But other aspects of the Facebook campaign raise questions about Bloomberg\u2019s strategy, and whether it goes beyond throwing money at voters\u2019 Facebook Timelines to see what sticks.</p> <h2><strong>Where\u2019s the smoke?</strong></h2> <p>In mid-January, as news of the Australian brushfires filled social media feeds with devastating images of the climate crisis, the Bloomberg presidential campaign debuted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=611734909628774\">new Facebook ad</a> targeting California voters.</p> <p>\u201cWildfire prevention needs to be part of our climate plan,\u201d read the caption above a photograph of a wooded mountain in flames. \u201cMike will get it done.\u201d</p> <p>Targeting California voters with a message about wildfires is the kind of savvy political move that one might expect from a campaign that is competently run \u2013 and sparing no expense. Democratic voters overwhelmingly support government action on climate change, and wildfires are of particular concern to Americans on the west coast, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/\">recent polling</a> by the Pew Research Center.</p> <p>And yet, in subsequent weeks, the Bloomberg campaign began targeting wildfire ads at voters in states where wildfires are not a threat \u2013 and where polling shows other climate-related issues are of much greater interest to voters. The Bloomberg campaign has thus far spent more money on wildfire ads targeting voters in Texas (more than $60,000), Ohio and Illinois (more than $45,000 each) than California (more than $44,000). Of the $567,700 his campaign has spent in total on wildfire ads, just 15% has gone to voters in Pacific and mountain states where wildfires tend to occur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"wildfire map\">  <iframe title=\"Bloomberg's wildfire ads\" aria-label=\"USA states choropleth map\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TItNS/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The wildfire ads are emblematic of the at-times distorted logic of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spending. To an average campaign, half a million dollars is a significant amount of money that would require, for example, 27,000 donations from Bernie Sanders supporters (whose <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-q4-campaign-fundraising.html\">donations average $18.53</a>) or multiple trips to a wine cave. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign has spent just $544,000 on all Facebook advertising since Bloomberg entered the race in November.</p> <p>But to Bloomberg, the amount is insignificant. The half-million-dollar expenditure to a man with a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#54acb0b21417\">fortune</a> estimated at $65.2bn is comparable to the average American (<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-your-net-worth-and-how-do-you-compare-to-others-2018-09-24\">median household net worth</a> of $97,300) spending 85 cents.</p> <p>Some of the campaign\u2019s state targeting is also puzzling. It has spent at least $125,000 targeting voters in Vermont, Sanders\u2019 home state. This isn\u2019t a case of Vermont voters seeing ads intended for a national audience; most of the spending comes from ads that received 95% or more of their impressions in Vermont, suggesting intentional targeting. On a per-capita basis, the Bloomberg campaign has spent more money reaching Vermont voters than voters in any other state.</p> <p>Unlike his opponents, Bloomberg is not using Facebook ads to fundraise, so he is not running the kind of urgent appeals and contests that Trump and other candidates employ. Some of his ads do still resemble Trump-style clickbait, however, such as a number of advertisements that feature heart-tugging images of imperiled animals.</p> <p>\u201cMike saves animals\u201d, reads the message on one set of ads that closely mirror Facebook ads <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-facebook-ad-campaign-2020-election\">run by the Trump campaign</a>. \u201cYou be the one to tell this sea turtle that her species has no future,\u201d reads the caption on a video ad starring a heart-wrenching baby sea turtle.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Crazy Donald\u2019</strong></h2> <p>And then there\u2019s the invective. Trump is by far the most common topic of Bloomberg\u2019s ads, and a frequent message is that the president is unfit for the presidency. But the ads often mimic some of the very behaviors that define Trump\u2019s communication style, calling him \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cunhinged\u201d, \u201cunfit\u201d, \u201cembarrassing\u201d, \u201ca sell out\u201d, \u201ca con man\u201d, a \u201cmadman\u201d, \u201ca bully\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cff7f3ffceff291398e642526035b41dbd2d97f\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/02/20/bloomberg-ads-2.gif\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In some ads, the campaign adopts Trump\u2019s habit of giving opponents demeaning nicknames, referring to him as \u201ccrazy Donald\u201d.</p> <p>Many ads refer to Trump\u2019s use of Twitter. \u201cDo President Trump\u2019s tweets make you just want to get away?\u201d one reads. \u201cMike Bloomberg will put an end to the dysfunction and bring calm, steady leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the campaign is relying on the fact that most Facebook users do not use Twitter. If they did, they might have noticed that over the last several days, Bloomberg has himself been engaged in a decidedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/1230147743760486401\">puerile</a> Twitter fight, with Trump.</p> <p><em>Michael Barton and Joseph Smith contributed reporting</em></p>",

(This analysis only refers to those ads that are explicitly referencing African Americans or Latinos, and does not mean that Bloomberg was not attempting to reach those voters with other messages.) The campaign\u2019s spending on ads with messaging about women or reproductive health is substantial. Overall, the campaign\u2019s ads have been shown to significantly more women than men. But other aspects of the Facebook campaign raise questions about Bloomberg\u2019s strategy, and whether it goes beyond throwing money at voters\u2019 Facebook Timelines to see what sticks. Where\u2019s the smoke? In mid-January, as news of the Australian brushfires filled social media feeds with devastating images of the climate crisis, the Bloomberg presidential campaign debuted a new Facebook ad targeting California voters. \u201cWildfire prevention needs to be part of our climate plan,\u201d read the caption above a photograph of a wooded mountain in flames. \u201cMike will get it done.\u201d Targeting California voters with a message about wildfires is the kind of savvy political move that one might expect from a campaign that is competently run \u2013 and sparing no expense. Democratic voters overwhelmingly support government action on climate change, and wildfires are of particular concern to Americans on the west coast, according to recent polling by the Pew Research Center. And yet, in subsequent weeks, the Bloomberg campaign began targeting wildfire ads at voters in states where wildfires are not a threat \u2013 and where polling shows other climate-related issues are of much greater interest to voters. The Bloomberg campaign has thus far spent more money on wildfire ads targeting voters in Texas (more than $60,000), Ohio and Illinois (more than $45,000 each) than California (more than $44,000). Of the $567,700 his campaign has spent in total on wildfire ads, just 15% has gone to voters in Pacific and mountain states where wildfires tend to occur. The wildfire ads are emblematic of the at-times distorted logic of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spending. To an average campaign, half a million dollars is a significant amount of money that would require, for example, 27,000 donations from Bernie Sanders supporters (whose donations average $18.53) or multiple trips to a wine cave. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign has spent just $544,000 on all Facebook advertising since Bloomberg entered the race in November. But to Bloomberg, the amount is insignificant. The half-million-dollar expenditure to a man with a fortune estimated at $65.2bn is comparable to the average American (median household net worth of $97,300) spending 85 cents. Some of the campaign\u2019s state targeting is also puzzling. It has spent at least $125,000 targeting voters in Vermont, Sanders\u2019 home state. This isn\u2019t a case of Vermont voters seeing ads intended for a national audience; most of the spending comes from ads that received 95% or more of their impressions in Vermont, suggesting intentional targeting. On a per-capita basis, the Bloomberg campaign has spent more money reaching Vermont voters than voters in any other state. Unlike his opponents, Bloomberg is not using Facebook ads to fundraise, so he is not running the kind of urgent appeals and contests that Trump and other candidates employ. Some of his ads do still resemble Trump-style clickbait, however, such as a number of advertisements that feature heart-tugging images of imperiled animals. \u201cMike saves animals\u201d, reads the message on one set of ads that closely mirror Facebook ads run by the Trump campaign. \u201cYou be the one to tell this sea turtle that her species has no future,\u201d reads the caption on a video ad starring a heart-wrenching baby sea turtle. \u2018Crazy Donald\u2019 And then there\u2019s the invective. Trump is by far the most common topic of Bloomberg\u2019s ads, and a frequent message is that the president is unfit for the presidency. But the ads often mimic some of the very behaviors that define Trump\u2019s communication style, calling him \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cunhinged\u201d, \u201cunfit\u201d, \u201cembarrassing\u201d, \u201ca sell out\u201d, \u201ca con man\u201d, a \u201cmadman\u201d, \u201ca bully\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d. In some ads, the campaign adopts Trump\u2019s habit of giving opponents demeaning nicknames, referring to him as \u201ccrazy Donald\u201d. Many ads refer to Trump\u2019s use of Twitter. \u201cDo President Trump\u2019s tweets make you just want to get away?\u201d one reads. \u201cMike Bloomberg will put an end to the dysfunction and bring calm, steady leadership.\u201d Perhaps the campaign is relying on the fact that most Facebook users do not use Twitter. If they did, they might have noticed that over the last several days, Bloomberg has himself been engaged in a decidedly puerile Twitter fight, with Trump.

After lunch they debate the realpolitik of retreating from Russian pride and exceptionalism, the merits of reaching an accommodation with the English and subsuming their Russianness into a European identity, or conceding that they are European with an \u201cAsian\u201d sediment and might even undertake to spread this \u201cEuropeanness\u201d all over the world. The burden of empire leads the company to consider the British and their African conquests, and there is a defence of culture as an unashamedly elitist treasure. At dinner, one of the ladies restates her radical Tolstoyan conviction that the church has eroded the real values of faith, that the Resurrection is a myth, and that the spirit of the Gospels must reside in combating evil with non-violence. She is countered by the high-born gentleman, who has a copy of the New Testament to hand, which he expounds with a tiny thread of antisemitism. Beneath all this talk, there are strange hints of illness and below-stairs discontent, and at one stage the high-flown talk is interrupted by the sound of what appears to be jazz on a gramophone from another room. Then there is a deeply strange seismic eruption. It seems as if all this talk could be a big Bu\u00f1uelian joke, or a satiric comment on the cosseted arrogance of the ruling class. All the guests had, after all, been contemplating catastrophe, sombrely contemplating the horror of abolishing God \u2013 perhaps like Ivan Karamazov in Dostoevsky\u2019s novel, taunted by Satan for his intellectual braggadocio in saying that all is permitted if God does not exist, and then spiritually stricken when his father is murdered. Weirdly, the moment passes, though it is followed by an ambiguous silent sequence in the snow outside, perhaps representing a funeral or commemorative ceremony, and when the group discussion resumes it is so calm that you might think it takes place at some sort of reunion months or years later. Is it supposed to be a dream? I\u2019m not sure. For all that this film has something exasperatingly opaque and inert about it, it has an uncompromising insistence that ideas matter. These people\u2019s thoughts, although debatable, are not simply presented as absurd. Malmkrog is a long, demanding experience \u2013 a real festival event. But that bizarre dreamlike eruption lives on in the mind.",

      "body": "<p>King Krule, AKA 25-year-old south London native Archy Marshall, has always let his work sprawl. His 2013 debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/22/king-krule-6-feet-review\">6 Feet Beneath </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/22/king-krule-6-feet-review\">the Moon</a>, was a staggeringly novel and sometimes exquisite mashup of laptop hip-hop, smoky jazz and folk-punk, yet it was also loose and listless: a collection of guitar figures and gravelly moans that periodically coalesced into greatness.</p> <p>Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule, maintains many facets of his still beguiling original sound \u2013 the uneasy synth washes, the foregrounded strumming, his bassy rasp. But the fragments of melody and bursts of momentum that carried his previous material (2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/king-krule-the-ooz-review-archy-marshall\">The Ooz</a> was pretty impressionistic but at least featured some singalong segments) have largely gone. Instead, Man Alive! is mainly concerned with evoking disgust, dissolution and despair via vague choruses, eerie vocal samples and dogged dissonance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a31970e0549d008c74c580f7580b98cfa0eac6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a31970e0549d008c74c580f7580b98cfa0eac6a5/0_0_4000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Krule: Man Alive! album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Krule: Man Alive! album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are moments when the album is straightforwardly unenjoyable because of this approach, but it still contains plenty of evidence of its maker\u2019s singular talents. Flickers of 6 Feet Beneath the Moon\u2019s ragged poetry surface sporadically (see: Stoned Again\u2019s nightmarishly nostalgic mid-section), while the syncopated drums, incantatory chorus and starkly plucked chords on Cellular return Marshall to the moody, atmospheric and strangely beautiful punk update he wowed with on his debut.</p> <p>By the end of the album\u2019s 14 tracks, however, these glimmers of energy don\u2019t seem quite enough. Marshall remains an unequivocally talented, trailblazing artist but this album\u2019s bagginess and unremitting gloom mean it often struggles to hold the attention and unfortunately lacks much discernible appeal at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/45aznJm3etg3c6dMRmYARJ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/45aznJm3etg3c6dMRmYARJ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "King Krule, AKA 25-year-old south London native Archy Marshall, has always let his work sprawl. His 2013 debut, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon, was a staggeringly novel and sometimes exquisite mashup of laptop hip-hop, smoky jazz and folk-punk, yet it was also loose and listless: a collection of guitar figures and gravelly moans that periodically coalesced into greatness. Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule, maintains many facets of his still beguiling original sound \u2013 the uneasy synth washes, the foregrounded strumming, his bassy rasp. But the fragments of melody and bursts of momentum that carried his previous material (2017\u2019s The Ooz was pretty impressionistic but at least featured some singalong segments) have largely gone. Instead, Man Alive! is mainly concerned with evoking disgust, dissolution and despair via vague choruses, eerie vocal samples and dogged dissonance. There are moments when the album is straightforwardly unenjoyable because of this approach, but it still contains plenty of evidence of its maker\u2019s singular talents. Flickers of 6 Feet Beneath the Moon\u2019s ragged poetry surface sporadically (see: Stoned Again\u2019s nightmarishly nostalgic mid-section), while the syncopated drums, incantatory chorus and starkly plucked chords on Cellular return Marshall to the moody, atmospheric and strangely beautiful punk update he wowed with on his debut. By the end of the album\u2019s 14 tracks, however, these glimmers of energy don\u2019t seem quite enough. Marshall remains an unequivocally talented, trailblazing artist but this album\u2019s bagginess and unremitting gloom mean it often struggles to hold the attention and unfortunately lacks much discernible appeal at all.",

      "bodyText": "The young woman painted by Nicolaes Maes in the 1650s, resting her elbow on a cushion on a window ledge while she meditatively cradles her chin in her hand, looks like she is independently reaching the same conclusion as Ren\u00e9 Descartes just a few years earlier: \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d Maes\u2019s masterpiece Girl at a Window shows her surrounded by solid things. A wooden window covering has been flung open to show its planks to us in perspective. Bright apricots bulge over decaying plaster and brick. And yet, as the girl contemplates the physical world, a black void opens behind her. It is the cavern of consciousness in which all she can be sure of is cogito ergo sum. Maes was a pioneer of one of the world\u2019s most beloved art styles \u2013 the humble realism of the Dutch Golden Age. The paintings in this quietly captivating exhibition lay down elements that his contemporary, Johannes Vermeer, would refine \u2013 women working in rooms, domestic mysteries, secret glances. He pulls back the curtain on a private realm. In one of a series of variations on the image of an eavesdropper smiling complicitly at us while she listens in on household secrets, this is literally true \u2013 there\u2019s a curtain rail across the front of the picture with a green silk curtain partly pulled back to half-reveal a domestic row.

I\u2019ve also talked to many men who tell me the same story: \u201cI love my wife and we have built a great life together, but she doesn\u2019t want to have sex. She recoils when I touch her and when we do have sex, she just lies there and doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d It seems many women of my demographic (middle-aged, middle class, kids) don\u2019t or can\u2019t enjoy sex. I\u2019ve been there myself.</p> <p>Before last year, my marriage had been sexless for two decades.

      "bodyText": "Mexico\u2019s president has cast himself as the victim of feminist activists, amid an outburst of fury at the alarming violence targeting the country\u2019s women and girls \u2013 and the seeming impunity that accompanies each crime. A string of especially gruesome killings of women and girls has prompted widespread protests, especially in the capital. In one incident last week, masked women splashed blood-red paint on the doors of the national palace and sprayed the walls with graffiti. But Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has been accused of a tone-deaf response to the crisis as he offers vague plans for \u201cmoral regeneration\u201d and protestations that all murders matter. At his morning press conference on Thursday, he mused about the a \u201cfeminist collective\u201d that had descended on the palace. \u201cThey opposed the moral regeneration we\u2019re promoting. I respect their views but don\u2019t share them. I believe we have to moralise the country, purify public life and strengthen cultural, moral and spiritual values,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up my lifelong beliefs because they came and protested. We\u2019re going to struggle to achieve a material change, a spiritual change.\u201d Endless stories on horrific murders \u2013 and daily indignities such as harassment, catcalls and being groped on public transit \u2013 have prompted a burgeoning women\u2019s movement, whose members have protested online and in the streets and called for a national women\u2019s strike on 9 March. In recent years, Mexican women have become increasingly ready to call out callous and inept responses from public officials, police and prosecutors in cases of femicides, but in some cases politicians have appeared to show more concern over feminist graffiti than the crimes committed against women. Much of the recent outrage, however, has targeted L\u00f3pez Obrador, who identifies as left-leaning but has appeared exasperated by calls to confront the issue. This month, he responded to a question about the federal prosecutor\u2019s proposal to scratch the concept of femicides from the criminal code by saying the issue \u201chas been manipulated by the media\u201d. He also showed annoyance that the question interrupted his plans to talk about his pet project of raffling off the presidential airplane, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want femicides to overshadow the lottery.\u201d Women\u2019s groups say he is treating femicides in the same way as his predecessors: as a political and public relations problems rather than a crisis claiming the lives of women. \u201cThe message he\u2019s sending women is: I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Maricruz Ocampo, an activist in the state of Quer\u00e9taro. \u201cThey\u2019ve all had the same attitude toward the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a Mexican problem, not a women\u2019s issue.\u201d Several recent high-profile crimes have been especially gruesome. Ingrid Escamilla, 25, was murdered on 9 February by her husband, who skinned her corpse and disemboweled her. A tabloid newspaper fueled further anger by publishing photos of her corpse on its front page. In the second crime, a seven-year-old girl, F\u00e1tima Aldrighetti Ant\u00f3n, was abducted and tortured after her mother got stuck in traffic and was late to pick her up from school. Her body was found in a plastic bag four days later, showing signs of torture. Two suspects were arrested on Wednesday \u2013 but not after Mexico City officials leaked information on the complicated domestic situation in F\u00e1tima\u2019s home. L\u00f3pez Obrador responded Tuesday to questions about the femicides by blaming family breakdowns, along with \u201cneoliberal\u201d policies implemented over the past three decades. He also cast the blame on his predecessors \u2013 including those in Mexico City, where he governed from 2000-2005 and has heavily influenced local politics since leaving office. \u201cNot only is nothing being done today, but what\u2019s being said is discrediting women,\u201d said Regina Tam\u00e9s, director of Gire, a reproductive rights organisation. L\u00f3pez Obrador swept to power promising widespread social change but has consistently showed conservative tendencies on social issues. \u201cWhat\u2019s unfortunate about now, in comparison to before, is people have put a lot of hope of change in this government,\u201d Tam\u00e9s said.",

He\u2019s got quality of course, he\u2019s a very good finisher. He takes his chances really well. There\u2019s good technique in his finishing. He\u2019s good receiving the ball at times and dropping off. He can play almost like a false nine as well. Sometimes I\u2019d like him to be stronger physically.\u201d Martial also struck the opener in Monday\u2019s 2-0 win at Chelsea, a header that was the kind of poacher\u2019s striker Solskj\u00e6r is encouraging from his forwards. The manager said: \u201cIt was a 1980s centre-forward goal. Yeah, definitely [I want more of those]. I\u2019m encouraged by his attitude this season as well, wanting to do those things that are not natural for him. You\u2019ve got to make him a No 9 again after playing wide for so many years [under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]. Anthony and Marcus have played wide for a few years until the last 12 months really.\u201d Scott McTominay is in contention for Sunday\u2019s visit of Watford, having recovered from a knee injury. \u201cHe had a rest day [Thursday] so let\u2019s see how he is,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r, before describing what the midfielder can offer. \u201cHe\u2019s a physical specimen. He\u2019s a leader, he never shirks a tackle and he brings everyone with him. He can sit with Nemanja [Matic] or Fred, or he can be one of the runners in midfield. We\u2019ve [been] talking about that today \u2013 that we don\u2019t have that many runs past the striker. He used to be a striker before so he\u2019s used to being in the box.\u201d The futures of Angel Gomes, who is 19, and the 20-year-old Tahith Chong are in the balance, as both are out of contract in the summer. \u201cWe\u2019re still in talks with them,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cTahith scored [on Thursday for the reserves]. He\u2019d rather play a game than sit in the stands [at Bruges]. He\u2019s just making sure that he\u2019s ready when he gets a chance. He played really well against Wolverhampton in the FA Cup and I\u2019m very pleased with him. The boys have got a great attitude. They\u2019re absolutely top-class boys and we\u2019re doing what we can to keep them because in a few years we can see them becoming very very good players.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The death of Caroline Flack was first and foremost a tragedy for her family and her friends. But it also provoked a furious backlash; the tabloids, particularly the Sun, turned on the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing the domestic violence case against her. Critics of the papers blamed them for hounding a vulnerable woman. A full inquest may help to establish the background and circumstances of her death, but what is not in doubt is that Flack\u2019s career and love life have been a staple for the press over many years, and that the assault charge against her caused a media frenzy. A Guardian analysis shows the Sun published the most articles mentioning Flack in the six months before her death \u2013 with a total of 99. The figure is around a quarter of the 387 stories published in print by all of the UK\u2019s national newspapers in the same period. A review of the stories shows that a quarter of all these articles took a negative tone, slightly higher than those with a positive tone, which accounted for 18% of the total. Last October, for instance, Channel 4 announced Flack would present a new programme called The Surjury \u2013 in which members of the public would be given free plastic surgery. However, this was described as \u201ca new low for television\u201d \u2013 and has since been cancelled. The majority of stories about Flack during the six-month period were neutral in tone \u2013 many focusing on her successful stint as presenter of ITV\u2019s Love Island. That ratio changed in December, after she was charged with assaulting her partner, Lewis Burton. In that month Flack received twice as many negative headlines as positive. According to the Guardian\u2019s analysis, the proportion of negative headlines about her increased to 35%, while 18% were positive. Many of these articles included graphic references to the alleged assault. In February, the month of her death, there were an equal number of negative and positive headlines. This analysis is by no means definitive. It looked at stories in which \u201cCaroline Flack\u201d featured in the headline or body of the article between 14 August 2019 and 14 February 2020. Three journalists then reviewed them into \u201cpositive\u201d, \u201cnegative\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d categories. What the analysis does reveal, however, is that Flack was under enormous media scrutiny and negative coverage notably increased after the alleged assault. \u2022 The graphic on this article was amended on 27 February 2020. The chart showed an analysis of UK print media titles between August 2019 and February 2020, however an earlier version referred to the dates as 2018 and 2019. This has been corrected.",

Her new play explores the effects of intergenerational trauma on Indigenous women and aims to focus on storytelling.</p> <p>Bonnell says she has received a number of racist reviews in the past \u2013 including one that suggested her work was more suited to reservations. She received an apology for that article, but after discovering that other artists of color had experienced similar treatment, Bonnell decided to pull the plug on white critics for her current show.</p> <p>\u201cIn Toronto, critics are mostly white and male. They come at Indigenous art with a different lens \u2013 that often comes back to \u2018If I don\u2019t understand it, that means it\u2019s not good or it\u2019s not a valid form of theatre\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being critiqued. But at least let it come from a place of knowledge, of understanding what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>But what do other critics think of her stance?</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s arts and culture correspondent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lanre-bakare\">Lanre Bakare</a> says he can understand the desire for fresh perspectives. A 2018 analysis by Rotten Tomatoes found that for the 100 highest-grossing US films in 2017, of a total of 19,559 reviews, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/11/film-critics-white-and-male-study-rotten-tomatoes\">82% </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/11/film-critics-white-and-male-study-rotten-tomatoes\">were written by white</a> critics, and only 22% were written by women. Bakare points out that having a landscape where critics hail from similar backgrounds is limiting because it narrows the lens<strong> </strong>through which art is being critiqued.</p> <p>\u201cOne reviewer might not even see the same thing [as another] \u2013 because it\u2019s just not on their radar, or because they don\u2019t think about art like that.\u201d</p> <p>But he also points out that skin color is no guarantee that a critic will or won\u2019t be good. \u201cOne of my favorite critics, Ian Penman, is a white man who writes about Prince. He\u2019s amazing because he brings 50 years of fandom to the craft,\u201d says Bakare.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s film editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherineshoard\">Catherine Shoard</a>, points out that there is a quality benchmark that always needs to be discussed in a review, if audiences, playwrights, or readers are to gain anything from it. So getting a reviewer who understands the context behind the play is one thing, but assessing its quality should still be the primary concern.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One reviewer might not even see the same thing as another \u2013 because it\u2019s just not on their radar</p> <footer> <cite>Lanre Bakare</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an example, Shoard discusses the 2016 remake of Birth of a Nation. She says that when it screened at Sundance in 2016, people were so desperate in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite for there to be a good black movie that they gave it a standing ovation before it was screened. \u201cAnd it was an absolutely terrible film. If that won the best picture Oscar, the achievement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/05/steve-mcqueen-12-years-a-slave-opposition\">[Steve] McQueen</a> two years before that would have been completely undone,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s chief theatre critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arifa-akbar\">Arifa Akbar</a> agrees, adding that sometimes white reviewers seem reluctant to engage with the quality of a play by an artist of color. She gives the example of a recent play by a famous black British playwright that got praise but without any of the rigor that a canonical play about the white experience would. \u201cIt felt as though white critics were embarrassed \u2013 perhaps to reveal their ignorance, or that they would be called racially insensitive. But it meant a lot of them ducked out of actually doing the job properly,\u201d says Akbar.</p> <p>\u201cI can see why that\u2019s frustrating, patronising even. It\u2019s almost like an inverted form of racism,\u201d she says about Bonnell\u2019s stance. But intellectually she says she doesn\u2019t agree that you can silo off reviewing in this way. Akbar gives the writers Zadie Smith and Lionel Shriver as an example: both from very different backgrounds, but both arrive at the same idea when discussing the topic of diversity \u2013 that people should always be free to write outside their identity, walk around and imagine themselves in other shoes.

      "bodyText": "When Yolanda Bonnell\u2019s play Bug opened in Toronto last week, she had an unusual request for the media: that only people of color review it. Bonnell, an Indigenous artist from north-western Ontario, creates ceremonial art. Her new play explores the effects of intergenerational trauma on Indigenous women and aims to focus on storytelling. Bonnell says she has received a number of racist reviews in the past \u2013 including one that suggested her work was more suited to reservations. She received an apology for that article, but after discovering that other artists of color had experienced similar treatment, Bonnell decided to pull the plug on white critics for her current show. \u201cIn Toronto, critics are mostly white and male. They come at Indigenous art with a different lens \u2013 that often comes back to \u2018If I don\u2019t understand it, that means it\u2019s not good or it\u2019s not a valid form of theatre\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being critiqued. But at least let it come from a place of knowledge, of understanding what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d But what do other critics think of her stance? The Guardian\u2019s arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare says he can understand the desire for fresh perspectives. A 2018 analysis by Rotten Tomatoes found that for the 100 highest-grossing US films in 2017, of a total of 19,559 reviews, 82% were written by white critics, and only 22% were written by women. Bakare points out that having a landscape where critics hail from similar backgrounds is limiting because it narrows the lens through which art is being critiqued. \u201cOne reviewer might not even see the same thing [as another] \u2013 because it\u2019s just not on their radar, or because they don\u2019t think about art like that.\u201d But he also points out that skin color is no guarantee that a critic will or won\u2019t be good. \u201cOne of my favorite critics, Ian Penman, is a white man who writes about Prince. He\u2019s amazing because he brings 50 years of fandom to the craft,\u201d says Bakare. The Guardian\u2019s film editor, Catherine Shoard, points out that there is a quality benchmark that always needs to be discussed in a review, if audiences, playwrights, or readers are to gain anything from it. So getting a reviewer who understands the context behind the play is one thing, but assessing its quality should still be the primary concern. As an example, Shoard discusses the 2016 remake of Birth of a Nation. She says that when it screened at Sundance in 2016, people were so desperate in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite for there to be a good black movie that they gave it a standing ovation before it was screened. \u201cAnd it was an absolutely terrible film. If that won the best picture Oscar, the achievement of [Steve] McQueen two years before that would have been completely undone,\u201d she says. The Guardian\u2019s chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar agrees, adding that sometimes white reviewers seem reluctant to engage with the quality of a play by an artist of color. She gives the example of a recent play by a famous black British playwright that got praise but without any of the rigor that a canonical play about the white experience would. \u201cIt felt as though white critics were embarrassed \u2013 perhaps to reveal their ignorance, or that they would be called racially insensitive. But it meant a lot of them ducked out of actually doing the job properly,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cI can see why that\u2019s frustrating, patronising even. It\u2019s almost like an inverted form of racism,\u201d she says about Bonnell\u2019s stance. But intellectually she says she doesn\u2019t agree that you can silo off reviewing in this way. Akbar gives the writers Zadie Smith and Lionel Shriver as an example: both from very different backgrounds, but both arrive at the same idea when discussing the topic of diversity \u2013 that people should always be free to write outside their identity, walk around and imagine themselves in other shoes. Indeed, playwrights normally have to imagine experiences outside their own, and we trust and critique them on their ability to do so effectively. \u201cI feel like we should abide by that rule for everybody,\u201d says Akbar. Shoard argues one racist or uninformed reviewer should have no bearing on the rest of the population: \u201cA journalist should be informed about the world,\u201d she says. She gives the Guardian\u2019s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw as an example: \u201cHe is a straight white guy in his mid-50s and when he reviews a romcom badly, people say: \u2018You should have got a woman who likes romcoms to review it.\u2019 In fact, Peter loves romcoms. So for me, the idea that you\u2019re not allowed to say whether you think something is good or not on the basis of your gender, or any other demographic, it\u2019s just crazy.\u201d Bakare agrees, but adds that in a field dominated by white voices, the criticism of the work of artists of color \u2013 including knowledge of their artistic intent and the context in which they create \u2013 is simply lacking. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know that Scorsese\u2019s films frequently reference John Ford, you\u2019d be slated because that\u2019s seen as an obvious touchstone \u2013 but when the shoe is on the other foot, that kind of level of analysis isn\u2019t always there,\u201d says Bakare. Bakare points to a spoken-word artist, Danez Smith, whom he recently interviewed. Smith spoke about rarely being compared to prominent African American spoken-word artists, such as Saul Williams. \u201cThe link is rarely made because the critics [that are reviewing Smith] inhabit a completely different world,\u201d says Bakare.

While his debut album, 9, featured the likes of Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez, last year\u2019s playful follow-up replaced the big names with the titular superhero Princess Catgirl. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.omearalondon.com/events/cashmere-cat/\">Omeara, SE1, Thursday 27 February</a></em></p> <h2>Big Thief</h2> <p>If you want to know what Brooklyn alt-rock quartet Big Thief sound like live but can\u2019t be bothered to leave the house, just have a listen to their fourth album \u2013 and second of 2019 \u2013 Two Hands.

His second, Denis &amp; Katya, arrives in the UK after an award-winning premiere in Philadelphia last September. With a libretto by director Ted Huffman, and scored for just two singers, four cellos, video and electronics, it\u2019s the real-life story of two Russian runaways, whose web broadcasts of their final days together became a social media sensation. In this Music Theatre Wales production, mezzo Emily Edmonds and baritone Johnny Herford are joined by London Sinfonietta cellists. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.fedora-platform.com/news/denis-katya-touring-dates/109\">The Riverfront, Newport, Thursday 27 February; touring to 27 March</a></em></p> <h2>BBC Symphony Orchestra Total Immersion: Anders Hillborg</h2> <p>Anders Hillborg\u2019s music polarises opinions. To some, it is iridescent and inventive, to others it\u2019s contrived surface glitz. Anyone undecided can make up their mind at this day devoted to Hillborg\u2019s works. There is vocal and chamber music as well as a programme from the BBC SO, under Sakari Oramo, of six works, three of them UK premieres, including Hillborg\u2019s first violin concerto and his clarinet concerto, Peacock Tales. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-so-total-immersion-anders-hillborg-bbc-singers\">Barbican Hall, St Giles Cripplegate Church &amp; Milton Court, EC2, Saturday 22 February</a></em></p> <h2>Uproar</h2> <p>Wales\u2019s contemporary music group is the brainchild of conductor Michael Rafferty. Its latest concert includes three commissioned scores, from Sarah Lianne Lewis, Bethan Morgan-Williams and Andrew Lewis. But there are contemporary \u201cclassics\u201d too, by Tristan Murail, Kaija Saariaho and Fausto Romitelli. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.chapter.org/bookevent/uproar-professor-bad-trip/71601AMRKGCHRRTHJRLKKPCDSPHMKGQPR\">Chapter: Seligman Theatre, Cardiff, Friday 28 February</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ed53370273e93450e1056e9988b534ad99173df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ed53370273e93450e1056e9988b534ad99173df/0_0_1500_2000/750.jpg\" alt=\"David Hockney: Drawing from Life\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People person...

Before he paints, he draws \u2013 and sets out to draw exactly who he sees. This exhibition of some of his most intimate drawings of people \u2013 ranging from the 1950s to the present day \u2013 takes us into his world and shows how he transforms it into line and colour. A precious encounter with a modern master. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/david-hockney-drawing-from-life/exhibition\">National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thursday 27 February to 28 June</a></em></p> <h2>Young Rembrandt</h2> <p>Experimental, arrogant and bursting with genius, the young Rembrandt van Rijn was quite a character. His peasant-like face, doughy and unsymmetrical, bursts out of his early self-portraits as he makes his way in the competitive Dutch art market. He declares himself a painter like no other, rawer yet also grander: a true visionary. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ashmolean.org/youngrembrandt\">Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Thursday 27 February to 7 June</a></em></p> <h2>Linderism</h2> <p>Dada collagist Linder worked with the Buzzcocks in 1970s Manchester and has never gone straight. Her photomontage covers for their records mocked sex and gender identity. Her twisted, cut-up images still explore power, fantasy and liberation in unsettling, exciting ways. Pop theorists have compared punk with the dissonant strategies of early 20th-century modern art. Linder lives that history and is one of British art\u2019s true iconoclasts. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/events/linderism/\">Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge, to 26 April</a></em></p> <h2>Meet Vincent van Gogh Experience</h2> <p>Two centuries after its golden age, Dutch art once again produced a genius as profound as Rembrandt. Van Gogh\u2019s path in life was stony, his vision won in the face of madness. Meeting him would be quite an experience, but this walk-through sound and light show devised by Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh Museum is more a cursory introduction than a rapturous encounter. Best enjoyed as a preliminary to seeing his Sunflowers in the National Gallery. <br><em><a href=\"https://southbanklondon.com/attractions/meet-vincent-van-gogh-experience\">99 Upper Ground, SE1, to 21 May</a></em></p> <h2>Nicolaes Maes</h2> <p>Rembrandt was not only a great artist but a hugely effective teacher. Perhaps too effective. How do you escape the influence of one of the most powerful styles in art? Nicolaes Maes, one of his many students, fought his master\u2019s shadow by fixing his eyes on simple things, the humble moments of the everyday. Here are kitchens and yards, pets and porcelain: the stuff of life. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/nicolaes-maes-dutch-master-of-the-golden-age\">The National Gallery, WC2, Sat to 31 May</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad551fac38a3972a26bc4337a5c161c4984c2d01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad551fac38a3972a26bc4337a5c161c4984c2d01/0_320_4652_2790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prince of Egypt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pharaoh night out...

But this musical is not just big, it\u2019s epic. It is an adaptation of the DreamWorks animated film about the Old Testament life of Moses (see: Red Sea parting, plagues etc). Stephen Schwartz, the composer of Wicked, has added 10 new songs to his original score, which includes the belter When You Believe. Luke Brady and Liam Tamne play Moses and Ramses, respectively. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nederlander.co.uk/whats-on/prince-of-egypt\">Dominion Theatre, W1, to 12 September</a></em></p> <h2>The Boy in the Dress</h2> <p>An adaptation of David Walliams\u2019s first book, about a young lad who loves football \u2013 and dresses \u2013 this RSC musical has received gleefully enthusiastic reviews, and is only on for a few more weeks. Mark Ravenhill adapts, with music by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The whole show glows with wit and heart. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-boy-in-the-dress-musical/\">Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 8 March</a></em></p> <h2>The Special Relationship</h2> <p>Based on real-life stories, this new play from Hassan Abdulrazzak (Baghdad Wedding) is about British prisoners deported from the US after serving their sentences. The show is presented by a wise-cracking immigration officer and is as bonkers as it is brutal (it even includes a tango between Trump and May). It is directed by Esther Baker of Synergy Theatre Project, a company that works across the criminal justice system. <br><em><a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/special-relationship/\">Soho Theatre, W1, Wednesday 26 February to 21 March</a></em></p> <h2>Run Sister Run</h2> <p>A new play bursting with female talent: written by Chlo\u00eb Moss \u2013 a playwright of great integrity and emotional depth \u2013 and directed by Charlotte Bennett, with a cast that includes Lucy Ellinson and Helena Lymbery. It spans 40 years and is about two sisters whose lives veer off in very different directions. Nature knocks up against nurture, as the siblings struggle to stay close. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/events/run-sister-run\">Crucible Studio, Sheffield, Thursday 27 February to 21 March</a></em></p> <h2>Women Beware Women</h2> <p>This could get bloody. Thomas Middleton\u2019s brutal tragedy plays for the very first time at the Globe. It is set in the flamboyant Florentine court, where passions flare up and relationships crumble and curdle. Loyalties are tested, and lovers and family members betrayed in this bed-hopping, eye-popping, taboo-breaking whirlwind. Amy Hodge directs a strong cast, which includes Tara Fitzgerald, Olivia Vinall and Thalissa Teixeira. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/women-beware-women-19-20/\">Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 18 April</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc7fc60f3078f0cccc4c33670a8bbe51269bd757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc7fc60f3078f0cccc4c33670a8bbe51269bd757/0_1211_6081_4164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viviana Durante Company\u2019s Isadora Now\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isadora, we adore her...

In this Music Theatre Wales production, mezzo Emily Edmonds and baritone Johnny Herford are joined by London Sinfonietta cellists. The Riverfront, Newport, Thursday 27 February; touring to 27 March BBC Symphony Orchestra Total Immersion: Anders Hillborg Anders Hillborg\u2019s music polarises opinions. To some, it is iridescent and inventive, to others it\u2019s contrived surface glitz. Anyone undecided can make up their mind at this day devoted to Hillborg\u2019s works. There is vocal and chamber music as well as a programme from the BBC SO, under Sakari Oramo, of six works, three of them UK premieres, including Hillborg\u2019s first violin concerto and his clarinet concerto, Peacock Tales. Barbican Hall, St Giles Cripplegate Church &amp; Milton Court, EC2, Saturday 22 February Uproar Wales\u2019s contemporary music group is the brainchild of conductor Michael Rafferty. Its latest concert includes three commissioned scores, from Sarah Lianne Lewis, Bethan Morgan-Williams and Andrew Lewis. But there are contemporary \u201cclassics\u201d too, by Tristan Murail, Kaija Saariaho and Fausto Romitelli. Chapter: Seligman Theatre, Cardiff, Friday 28 February AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions David Hockney David Hockney\u2019s life in art is one long steady gaze. Before he paints, he draws \u2013 and sets out to draw exactly who he sees. This exhibition of some of his most intimate drawings of people \u2013 ranging from the 1950s to the present day \u2013 takes us into his world and shows how he transforms it into line and colour. A precious encounter with a modern master. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thursday 27 February to 28 June Young Rembrandt Experimental, arrogant and bursting with genius, the young Rembrandt van Rijn was quite a character. His peasant-like face, doughy and unsymmetrical, bursts out of his early self-portraits as he makes his way in the competitive Dutch art market. He declares himself a painter like no other, rawer yet also grander: a true visionary. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Thursday 27 February to 7 June Linderism Dada collagist Linder worked with the Buzzcocks in 1970s Manchester and has never gone straight. Her photomontage covers for their records mocked sex and gender identity. Her twisted, cut-up images still explore power, fantasy and liberation in unsettling, exciting ways. Pop theorists have compared punk with the dissonant strategies of early 20th-century modern art. Linder lives that history and is one of British art\u2019s true iconoclasts. Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge, to 26 April Meet Vincent van Gogh Experience Two centuries after its golden age, Dutch art once again produced a genius as profound as Rembrandt. Van Gogh\u2019s path in life was stony, his vision won in the face of madness. Meeting him would be quite an experience, but this walk-through sound and light show devised by Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh Museum is more a cursory introduction than a rapturous encounter. Best enjoyed as a preliminary to seeing his Sunflowers in the National Gallery. 99 Upper Ground, SE1, to 21 May Nicolaes Maes Rembrandt was not only a great artist but a hugely effective teacher. Perhaps too effective. How do you escape the influence of one of the most powerful styles in art? Nicolaes Maes, one of his many students, fought his master\u2019s shadow by fixing his eyes on simple things, the humble moments of the everyday. Here are kitchens and yards, pets and porcelain: the stuff of life. The National Gallery, WC2, Sat to 31 May JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows The Prince of Egypt Big new musical klaxon! But this musical is not just big, it\u2019s epic. It is an adaptation of the DreamWorks animated film about the Old Testament life of Moses (see: Red Sea parting, plagues etc). Stephen Schwartz, the composer of Wicked, has added 10 new songs to his original score, which includes the belter When You Believe. Luke Brady and Liam Tamne play Moses and Ramses, respectively. Dominion Theatre, W1, to 12 September The Boy in the Dress An adaptation of David Walliams\u2019s first book, about a young lad who loves football \u2013 and dresses \u2013 this RSC musical has received gleefully enthusiastic reviews, and is only on for a few more weeks. Mark Ravenhill adapts, with music by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The whole show glows with wit and heart. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 8 March The Special Relationship Based on real-life stories, this new play from Hassan Abdulrazzak (Baghdad Wedding) is about British prisoners deported from the US after serving their sentences. The show is presented by a wise-cracking immigration officer and is as bonkers as it is brutal (it even includes a tango between Trump and May). It is directed by Esther Baker of Synergy Theatre Project, a company that works across the criminal justice system. Soho Theatre, W1, Wednesday 26 February to 21 March Run Sister Run A new play bursting with female talent: written by Chlo\u00eb Moss \u2013 a playwright of great integrity and emotional depth \u2013 and directed by Charlotte Bennett, with a cast that includes Lucy Ellinson and Helena Lymbery. It spans 40 years and is about two sisters whose lives veer off in very different directions. Nature knocks up against nurture, as the siblings struggle to stay close. Crucible Studio, Sheffield, Thursday 27 February to 21 March Women Beware Women This could get bloody. Thomas Middleton\u2019s brutal tragedy plays for the very first time at the Globe. It is set in the flamboyant Florentine court, where passions flare up and relationships crumble and curdle. Loyalties are tested, and lovers and family members betrayed in this bed-hopping, eye-popping, taboo-breaking whirlwind. Amy Hodge directs a strong cast, which includes Tara Fitzgerald, Olivia Vinall and Thalissa Teixeira. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 18 April MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Viviana Durante Company: Isadora Now Prancing around the drawing rooms of Europe\u2019s artistic elite at the turn of the 20th century, Isadora Duncan set dance on a new path with her radical performances, liberated from the restrictive corset of classical ballet. Former Royal Ballet star Viviana Durante celebrates the free-spirited American dancer in a triple bill of historical and new works. Barbican Theatre, EC2, to 29 February Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan: 13 Tongues &amp; Dust It\u2019s all change for the stunning Taiwanese contemporary dance company as founder Lin Hwai-min retires after 47 years and Cheng Tsung-lung takes over. This double bill looks to past and future with a work by each: Lin\u2019s Dust and Cheng\u2019s 13 Tongues. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Wednesday 26 to 29 February Akram Khan Company: Chotto Xenos Khan\u2019s acclaimed solo Xenos, which explored the role of colonial soldiers in the first world war, is given a reworking by children\u2019s theatre specialist Sue Buckmaster to create an evocative, child-friendly dance work for ages eight and over. Ipswich, Saturday 22; Bristol, Friday 28 February to 1 March; touring to 11 March LW Main composite image: (clockwise from left) Sonic the Hedgehog; Greed; Linderism; The Call of the Wild; Obongjayar",

      "body": "<p>A familiar quote in Togo comes from the president, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, who once said: \u201cMy father told me to never leave power.\u201d</p> <p>He has heeded that advice. The first African country where a coup d\u2019etat occurred after independence and where the elected head of state was assassinated, Togo stands to be the last country in Africa to see the lights of a democratic alternation.</p> <p>On Saturday, the country goes to the polls. But on past evidence, things are unlikely to change.</p> <p>It was on 13 January 1963 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/07/guardianobituaries\">Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma</a>, father of the current president, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sylvanus-Olympio\">killed the first post-colonial president</a>, Sylvanus Olympio, in a military coup.</p> <p>Now, 57 years later, the Gnassingb\u00e9 family still is in power. Only North Korea\u2019s ruling dynasty has held executive power for longer.</p> <p>There have been six presidential elections in Togo since the democratic movements of the 1990s, all won by the Gnassingb\u00e9 family.</p> <p>Before the first multiparty presidential election, in 1993, protesters were shot on the streets, and the persecution of political opponents triggered an unprecedented wave of migration to neighbouring countries that re-established Gnassingb\u00e9\u2019s dictatorial power. Gross <a href=\"https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a9a9c.html\">human rights abuses</a> caused international donors to suspend development assistance. Eyadema Gnassingb\u00e9 ultimately \u201cwon\u201d more than 95% of the vote with a turnout of less than 36%.</p> <p>On 21 June 1998, the second multiparty presidential election was held. Eyadema Gnassingb\u00e9, seeing the vote going towards opposition parties, had the country\u2019s telecommunication lines and electric grid shut down, successfully halting the transmission of results from polling stations. The president of the electoral commission resigned and the minister of the interior took charge of counting the vote. On 24 June he declared Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema elected, with 52% of the votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98864244c2345dac33e0e0dc7772758f694ae19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98864244c2345dac33e0e0dc7772758f694ae19f/0_41_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema waves to the crowd during a parade on the 38th anniversary of his presidential reign in Togo in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erick-Christian Ahounou/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In June 2003, the constitution, which limits presidential terms, was amended to allow Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema to stand again. In addition, the electoral system was changed to a single round, and the presidential eligibility age was dropped from 45 to 35 (Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was 36 and his father\u2019s health was fragile). The day before the election, the regime stopped people collecting their voting cards and the polling stations were changed overnight. On the day of the election, thousands found themselves unable to vote because their names were missing from the lists at their polling stations. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema was re-elected with 57.2% of the vote against 34.1% for his main opponent, Emmanuel Bob-Akitani.</p> <p>Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema died in February 2005 after nearly four decades of autocratic rule. The military proclaimed his son Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, then 39, the new head of state in defiance of the constitution. International protests forced the new president to call an election. Amid massive electoral irregularities, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was sworn in as president on 4 May. About 700 people were killed, and more than 40,000 citizens fled to neighbouring countries when the military broke up protests.</p> <p>The 2010 and the 2015 presidential elections followed the previous patterns.</p> <p>All this would have been less harmful if the Gnassingb\u00e9 family ruled Togo like Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister of Singapore for 31 years until 1990, who made his country the most prosperous in south-east Asia.</p> <p>But they did not. Nearly 70% of the rural population of Togo lives below the global poverty line. It ranks low in all the <a href=\"https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/poverty/33EF03BB-9722-4AE2-ABC7-AA2972D68AFE/Global_POVEQ_TGO.pdf\">key indexes</a> of development, freedom and economics.</p> <p>Those less informed could be easily misled by the PR blitz of the Gnassingb\u00e9 regime, touting the modernisation of banking, electricity, transportation and other commercial infrastructure. Some of those improvements made the World Bank rank the country among the top 10 reformers in the world. But debt-driven economic growth does not bring prosperity to the people. It goes to a \u201cminority which monopolises the wealth of the country\u201d, in the words of Faure Gnassingb\u00e9.</p> <p>A <a href=\"tel:1 https://www.heritage.org/index/country/togo 2 https://www.prosperity.com/globe/togo 3\">2016 study from the University of Munich</a> concluded that \u201cgrowth in Togo was not pro-poor because it left the poor worse-off\u201d. </p> <p>According to UN reports, Togo has become a major hub of drug trafficking and money-laundering in west Africa. Between 2005 and 2011, the country lost $17.8bn (\u00a313.8bn) through illicit capital outflows.</p> <p>Togo had attracted the worst of everything. Banks with diplomatic immunity are headquartered in the capital Lom\u00e9. Pervasive corruption happens with the patronage of the regime.</p> <p>According to the 2019 <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019\">corruption perceptions index</a> by Transparency International, Togo is among the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 130 out of 180. More than half of Togolese believe corruption has increased in the past 12 months, and 68% believe the government is not doing enough to fight it.</p> <p>Is there any chance for change in this year\u2019s election? The constitutional court and the electoral commission are filled with handpicked regime loyalists. The army, gendarmerie and police are also faithful to the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/21/no-business-no-boozing-no-casual-sex-when-togo-turned-off-the-internet\">No business, no boozing, no casual sex: when Togo turned off the internet | Mawuna Koutonin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the two stage electoral system introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/togo-law-president-stand-terms-190509180859448.html\">latest constitution of May 2019</a>, President Gnassingb\u00e9 wants a \u201cknockout\u201d.</p> <p>His friend, the minister of public administration Gilbert Bawara, declared to the media that there would be no second round for this election but \u201ca clear, brilliant and indisputable victory from the first round\u201d, saving resources \u201cin order to respond to the real priorities of our populations\u201d.</p> <p>Christian Trimua, Togo\u2019s human rights minister, warned the opposition parties that there would be no tallying of votes by polling stations, only aggregated results.</p> <p>Everyone is tired of Togo\u2019s unending political crisis.

      "bodyText": "A familiar quote in Togo comes from the president, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, who once said: \u201cMy father told me to never leave power.\u201d He has heeded that advice. The first African country where a coup d\u2019etat occurred after independence and where the elected head of state was assassinated, Togo stands to be the last country in Africa to see the lights of a democratic alternation. On Saturday, the country goes to the polls. But on past evidence, things are unlikely to change. It was on 13 January 1963 that Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, father of the current president, killed the first post-colonial president, Sylvanus Olympio, in a military coup. Now, 57 years later, the Gnassingb\u00e9 family still is in power. Only North Korea\u2019s ruling dynasty has held executive power for longer. There have been six presidential elections in Togo since the democratic movements of the 1990s, all won by the Gnassingb\u00e9 family. Before the first multiparty presidential election, in 1993, protesters were shot on the streets, and the persecution of political opponents triggered an unprecedented wave of migration to neighbouring countries that re-established Gnassingb\u00e9\u2019s dictatorial power. Gross human rights abuses caused international donors to suspend development assistance. Eyadema Gnassingb\u00e9 ultimately \u201cwon\u201d more than 95% of the vote with a turnout of less than 36%. On 21 June 1998, the second multiparty presidential election was held. Eyadema Gnassingb\u00e9, seeing the vote going towards opposition parties, had the country\u2019s telecommunication lines and electric grid shut down, successfully halting the transmission of results from polling stations. The president of the electoral commission resigned and the minister of the interior took charge of counting the vote. On 24 June he declared Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema elected, with 52% of the votes. In June 2003, the constitution, which limits presidential terms, was amended to allow Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema to stand again. In addition, the electoral system was changed to a single round, and the presidential eligibility age was dropped from 45 to 35 (Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was 36 and his father\u2019s health was fragile). The day before the election, the regime stopped people collecting their voting cards and the polling stations were changed overnight. On the day of the election, thousands found themselves unable to vote because their names were missing from the lists at their polling stations. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema was re-elected with 57.2% of the vote against 34.1% for his main opponent, Emmanuel Bob-Akitani. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema died in February 2005 after nearly four decades of autocratic rule. The military proclaimed his son Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, then 39, the new head of state in defiance of the constitution. International protests forced the new president to call an election. Amid massive electoral irregularities, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was sworn in as president on 4 May. About 700 people were killed, and more than 40,000 citizens fled to neighbouring countries when the military broke up protests. The 2010 and the 2015 presidential elections followed the previous patterns. All this would have been less harmful if the Gnassingb\u00e9 family ruled Togo like Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister of Singapore for 31 years until 1990, who made his country the most prosperous in south-east Asia. But they did not. Nearly 70% of the rural population of Togo lives below the global poverty line. It ranks low in all the key indexes of development, freedom and economics. Those less informed could be easily misled by the PR blitz of the Gnassingb\u00e9 regime, touting the modernisation of banking, electricity, transportation and other commercial infrastructure. Some of those improvements made the World Bank rank the country among the top 10 reformers in the world. But debt-driven economic growth does not bring prosperity to the people. It goes to a \u201cminority which monopolises the wealth of the country\u201d, in the words of Faure Gnassingb\u00e9. A 2016 study from the University of Munich concluded that \u201cgrowth in Togo was not pro-poor because it left the poor worse-off\u201d. According to UN reports, Togo has become a major hub of drug trafficking and money-laundering in west Africa. Between 2005 and 2011, the country lost $17.8bn (\u00a313.8bn) through illicit capital outflows. Togo had attracted the worst of everything. Banks with diplomatic immunity are headquartered in the capital Lom\u00e9. Pervasive corruption happens with the patronage of the regime. According to the 2019 corruption perceptions index by Transparency International, Togo is among the most corrupt countries in the world, ranking 130 out of 180. More than half of Togolese believe corruption has increased in the past 12 months, and 68% believe the government is not doing enough to fight it. Is there any chance for change in this year\u2019s election? The constitutional court and the electoral commission are filled with handpicked regime loyalists. The army, gendarmerie and police are also faithful to the government. Despite the two stage electoral system introduced in the latest constitution of May 2019, President Gnassingb\u00e9 wants a \u201cknockout\u201d. His friend, the minister of public administration Gilbert Bawara, declared to the media that there would be no second round for this election but \u201ca clear, brilliant and indisputable victory from the first round\u201d, saving resources \u201cin order to respond to the real priorities of our populations\u201d. Christian Trimua, Togo\u2019s human rights minister, warned the opposition parties that there would be no tallying of votes by polling stations, only aggregated results. Everyone is tired of Togo\u2019s unending political crisis. The overall feeling is that it\u2019s time for change. But all the opposition parties can hope for to oust this regime is a post-electoral crisis. And that, sadly, could lead to fresh bloodshed and more suffering for the Togolese people. \u2022 Mawuna Koutonin is editor of SiliconAfrica.com and a social activist for Africa Renaissance. @siliconafrica",

      "bodyText": "The spread of the coronavirus will result in the first fall in global air travel in more than a decade, the international airline industry body has predicted. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned that falling passenger demand as a result of the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus would cost the airline industry $29.3bn (\u00a323.7bn) in lost revenues this year. In its initial assessment of the impact, the organisation said it expected global demand for air travel to fall by 4.7% in 2020, the first overall decline since the global financial crisis in 2008-09. \u201cAirlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes. Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue,\u201d said Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of Iata. \u201cThis will be a very tough year for airlines.\u201d The vast majority of the financial impact will hit airlines in the Asia Pacific region, where revenues will fall by $27.8bn, with the bulk borne by carriers registered in China. Iata estimates that losses in China\u2019s domestic market will hit $12.8bn. Carriers outside Asia Pacific are forecast to lose about $1.5bn this year, \u201cassuming the loss of demand is limited to markets linked to China\u201d. Iata said: \u201cThe sharp downturn in demand as a result of Covid-19 will have a financial impact on airlines \u2013 severe for those particularly exposed to the China market.

      "body": "<p>As the coronavirus outbreak nears its third month and shows few signs of abating before the spring holiday season, insurers and airlines face a growing number of claims as passengers attempt to cancel. But in what circumstances will they pay up, or offer refunds?</p> <p><strong>I have a</strong><strong> trip to China booked in March</strong><strong>. Will I get my money back?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The fact that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china\" title=\"\">Foreign Office has advised</a> against all but essential travel to the whole of mainland China (and all travel to Hubei) makes things easier. Tour operators have cancelled immediate trips \u2013 as have most airlines \u2013 and have all been offering full refunds.</p> <p>British Airways has cancelled all its flights to Beijing and Shanghai until 31 March. If you had booked an independent trip, your flight should be refundable. Other big losses should be reclaimable from your travel insurer, assuming you bought cover before this blew up.</p> <p>Axa, one of the biggest underwriters of travel policies in the UK said: \u201cWe always follow Foreign Office advice. So if you\u2019re scheduled to travel to a region or a country the FCO has asked people to avoid, our policies will kick in,\u201d says a spokeswoman.</p> <p>Generally, insurers will only pay out provided you bought the cover before the virus hit the headlines and became a \u201cknown\u201d factor.</p> <p><strong>What about Hong Kong?</strong></p> <p>The fact that Foreign Office is not advising against travel to Hong Kong makes things more complicated. The good news is that plenty of airlines are offering passengers with flight bookings to the city the chance to cancel or to move the flight date to later in the year.</p> <p>British Airways has been offering those with Hong Kong flights up until 1 April the chance to rebook on to another flight, or request a refund. Cathay Pacific this week said it had been forced to cancel 40% of flights for February and March. However, insurers are under no obligation to pay claims for significant expenses if you could get there, but chose not to travel.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m due to tour China in May</strong><strong>. What should I do?</strong></p> <p>The advice is to wait and see. The Foreign Office is constantly reviewing its advice, and in the face of the continued outbreak the no-travel ban advice would likely remain, meaning operators would have to cancel trips and refund. Insurers would have to follow suit. However, once the effective travel ban was lifted, insurers would no longer have to pay up if you decided not to travel \u2013 unless your GP advised against it.</p> <p><strong>I </strong><strong>am supposed to be taking my elderly parents to an affected area </strong><strong>soon, but we don\u2019t want to risk it</strong><strong>. Will our insurance cover it?</strong></p> <p>Technically not, unless the Foreign Office changes its advice and advises against travel to your chosen destination. Aside from Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Indonesia will be regarded by many as higher risk areas. Thailand saw a lot of Chinese visitors over the Lunar new year celebrations, but British tourists who decide they no longer with to travel are not entitled to refunds.</p> <p>The big exception is if your GP has advised you or any of your party not to travel to a virus area, in which case your travel insurance should then kick in.</p> <p>Axa told Money: \u201cIf your GP tells you not to travel to a nearby area (not China), you should contact us before your departure date, and you won\u2019t be penalised.\u201d</p> <p>However, it noted that the normal conditions of declaring pre-existing conditions will apply. So, if you were told not to travel by your doctor because of an underlying lung problem that you had not declared to your insurer when you bought the policy, you may find your claim turned down, or the payout reduced.</p> <p>That said, and given that the virus disproportionately affects the elderly, most doctors would probably recommend not travelling to a virus-affected area, with or without any previous medical conditions. In such cases it may be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim, although you can bet that some will try.</p> <p>It would be a similar story if the government lifts its travel-ban advice but the airline continues not offering flights.</p> <p>And it would be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim for other losses, if you could not get to your destination.</p> <p><strong>If I ignore any government advice against all but essential travel, will my travel insurance still cover me?</strong></p> <p>The Association of British Insurers is clear. If you travel against government advice then you will most likely find that this invalidates your travel insurance. If unsure, speak to your travel insurer, it says.</p> <p><strong>I am due to travel to Asia in June, but am yet to buy the flights</strong><strong>. Can I limit my exposure to the virus?</strong></p> <p>There has never been a cheaper time to book flights to east Asia but it is risky, given the possibility of events moving out of control. The advice is to buy tickets from an airline that offers flexible fares, or the chance to rebook at a later time. British Airways, for example, will let buyers change their flight booking for \u00a3150 per person plus any additional fare costs.</p> <p>Nearly all basic economy flights will not be refunded on cancellations, but you can choose to pay more for a \u201csemi flexible\u201d or \u201cflexible\u201d ticket, although the costs mount up. For example, Turkish Airlines was this week quoting a non-refundable economy fare of \u00a3240 to fly one way from London to Hong Kong (via Istanbul) on 7 March. The semi-flexible fare, which allows a fee-free date change, costs \u00a3404. The fully refundable fare costs \u00a3595. A canny buyer could opt for the latter, cancelling it in the event of a significant development of the virus. If the virus is successfully tackled, you could cancel the expensive flight, take the refund, and rebook a cheaper flight if available.</p> <p>Most of the big chains in Hong Kong are offering fully cancellable rooms this week, in an attempt to get some bookings. No sane person is making non-refundable hotel bookings in Asia right now.</p> <p><strong>Has there ever been a cheaper time to visit Asia?</strong></p> <p>At least nine out of 10 hotel rooms in Hong Kong are currently unoccupied, according to a <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3051371/coronavirus-hong-kong-hotels-facing-life-and-death\" title=\"\">South China Morning Post report this week</a>, which said the hotel industry is in a \u201clife or death\u201d struggle to survive. Last February there were up to 200,000 tourist arrivals every day in Hong Kong, but this has slowed to just 3,000. Many hotels have chosen to shut down temporarily instead. The impact is being felt in Da Nang in Vietnam, Bali in Indonesia and Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) in Cambodia. Four star hotels in Siem Reap are currently offering rooms starting at \u00a38 a night, while five star hotels are as low as \u00a320 a night. But the super-luxe hotels in Hong Kong are clinging on to their rates; the Mandarin is charging \u00a3400 a night.</p> <p><strong>Or book a cruise?</strong></p> <p>For the cruise industry, the coronavirus has been a public-relations nightmare. The world has watched as the Diamond Princess liner has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, its 3,600 passengers and crew stuck and the number of people infected by the coronavirus climbing to over 600. This week two passengers died.</p> <p>If you are made of strong stuff, you will practically be able to name your price on taking a cruise this summer. This week the Norwegian Cruise Line was advertising its <a href=\"https://www.ncl.com/uk/en/\" title=\"\">\u201cbiggest sale of the decade\u201d</a> with at least 30% off. Expect prices to fall even further.</p>",

So if you\u2019re scheduled to travel to a region or a country the FCO has asked people to avoid, our policies will kick in,\u201d says a spokeswoman. Generally, insurers will only pay out provided you bought the cover before the virus hit the headlines and became a \u201cknown\u201d factor. What about Hong Kong? The fact that Foreign Office is not advising against travel to Hong Kong makes things more complicated. The good news is that plenty of airlines are offering passengers with flight bookings to the city the chance to cancel or to move the flight date to later in the year. British Airways has been offering those with Hong Kong flights up until 1 April the chance to rebook on to another flight, or request a refund. Cathay Pacific this week said it had been forced to cancel 40% of flights for February and March. However, insurers are under no obligation to pay claims for significant expenses if you could get there, but chose not to travel. I\u2019m due to tour China in May. What should I do? The advice is to wait and see. The Foreign Office is constantly reviewing its advice, and in the face of the continued outbreak the no-travel ban advice would likely remain, meaning operators would have to cancel trips and refund. Insurers would have to follow suit. However, once the effective travel ban was lifted, insurers would no longer have to pay up if you decided not to travel \u2013 unless your GP advised against it. I am supposed to be taking my elderly parents to an affected area soon, but we don\u2019t want to risk it. Will our insurance cover it? Technically not, unless the Foreign Office changes its advice and advises against travel to your chosen destination. Aside from Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Indonesia will be regarded by many as higher risk areas. Thailand saw a lot of Chinese visitors over the Lunar new year celebrations, but British tourists who decide they no longer with to travel are not entitled to refunds. The big exception is if your GP has advised you or any of your party not to travel to a virus area, in which case your travel insurance should then kick in. Axa told Money: \u201cIf your GP tells you not to travel to a nearby area (not China), you should contact us before your departure date, and you won\u2019t be penalised.\u201d However, it noted that the normal conditions of declaring pre-existing conditions will apply. So, if you were told not to travel by your doctor because of an underlying lung problem that you had not declared to your insurer when you bought the policy, you may find your claim turned down, or the payout reduced. That said, and given that the virus disproportionately affects the elderly, most doctors would probably recommend not travelling to a virus-affected area, with or without any previous medical conditions. In such cases it may be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim, although you can bet that some will try. It would be a similar story if the government lifts its travel-ban advice but the airline continues not offering flights. And it would be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim for other losses, if you could not get to your destination. If I ignore any government advice against all but essential travel, will my travel insurance still cover me? The Association of British Insurers is clear. If you travel against government advice then you will most likely find that this invalidates your travel insurance. If unsure, speak to your travel insurer, it says. I am due to travel to Asia in June, but am yet to buy the flights. Can I limit my exposure to the virus? There has never been a cheaper time to book flights to east Asia but it is risky, given the possibility of events moving out of control. The advice is to buy tickets from an airline that offers flexible fares, or the chance to rebook at a later time. British Airways, for example, will let buyers change their flight booking for \u00a3150 per person plus any additional fare costs. Nearly all basic economy flights will not be refunded on cancellations, but you can choose to pay more for a \u201csemi flexible\u201d or \u201cflexible\u201d ticket, although the costs mount up. For example, Turkish Airlines was this week quoting a non-refundable economy fare of \u00a3240 to fly one way from London to Hong Kong (via Istanbul) on 7 March. The semi-flexible fare, which allows a fee-free date change, costs \u00a3404. The fully refundable fare costs \u00a3595. A canny buyer could opt for the latter, cancelling it in the event of a significant development of the virus. If the virus is successfully tackled, you could cancel the expensive flight, take the refund, and rebook a cheaper flight if available. Most of the big chains in Hong Kong are offering fully cancellable rooms this week, in an attempt to get some bookings. No sane person is making non-refundable hotel bookings in Asia right now. Has there ever been a cheaper time to visit Asia? At least nine out of 10 hotel rooms in Hong Kong are currently unoccupied, according to a South China Morning Post report this week, which said the hotel industry is in a \u201clife or death\u201d struggle to survive. Last February there were up to 200,000 tourist arrivals every day in Hong Kong, but this has slowed to just 3,000. Many hotels have chosen to shut down temporarily instead. The impact is being felt in Da Nang in Vietnam, Bali in Indonesia and Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) in Cambodia. Four star hotels in Siem Reap are currently offering rooms starting at \u00a38 a night, while five star hotels are as low as \u00a320 a night. But the super-luxe hotels in Hong Kong are clinging on to their rates; the Mandarin is charging \u00a3400 a night. Or book a cruise? For the cruise industry, the coronavirus has been a public-relations nightmare. The world has watched as the Diamond Princess liner has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, its 3,600 passengers and crew stuck and the number of people infected by the coronavirus climbing to over 600. This week two passengers died. If you are made of strong stuff, you will practically be able to name your price on taking a cruise this summer. This week the Norwegian Cruise Line was advertising its \u201cbiggest sale of the decade\u201d with at least 30% off. Expect prices to fall even further.",

Bots are a type of software that can be directed to autonomously tweet, retweet, like or direct message on Twitter, under the guise of a human-fronted account.</p> <p>\u201cThese findings suggest a substantial impact of mechanized bots in amplifying denialist messages about climate change, including support for Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris agreement,\u201d states the draft study, seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>On an average day during the period studied, 25% of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots. This proportion was higher in certain topics \u2013 bots were responsible for 38% of tweets about \u201cfake science\u201d and 28% of all tweets about the petroleum giant Exxon.</p> <p>Conversely, tweets that could be categorized as online activism to support action on the climate crisis featured very few bots, at about 5% prevalence.

      "bodyText": "The social media conversation over the climate crisis is being reshaped by an army of automated Twitter bots, with a new analysis finding that a quarter of all tweets about climate on an average day are produced by bots, the Guardian can reveal. The stunning levels of Twitter bot activity on topics related to global heating and the climate crisis is distorting the online discourse to include far more climate science denialism than it would otherwise. An analysis of millions of tweets from around the period when Donald Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement found that bots tended to applaud the president for his actions and spread misinformation about the science. The study of Twitter bots and climate was undertaken by Brown University and has yet to be published. Bots are a type of software that can be directed to autonomously tweet, retweet, like or direct message on Twitter, under the guise of a human-fronted account. \u201cThese findings suggest a substantial impact of mechanized bots in amplifying denialist messages about climate change, including support for Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris agreement,\u201d states the draft study, seen by the Guardian. On an average day during the period studied, 25% of all tweets about the climate crisis came from bots. This proportion was higher in certain topics \u2013 bots were responsible for 38% of tweets about \u201cfake science\u201d and 28% of all tweets about the petroleum giant Exxon. Conversely, tweets that could be categorized as online activism to support action on the climate crisis featured very few bots, at about 5% prevalence. The findings \u201csuggest that bots are not just prevalent, but disproportionately so in topics that were supportive of Trump\u2019s announcement or skeptical of climate science and action\u201d, the analysis states. Thomas Marlow, a PhD candidate at Brown who led the study, said the research came about as he and his colleagues are \u201calways kind of wondering why there\u2019s persistent levels of denial about something that the science is more or less settled on\u201d. The researchers examined 6.5m tweets posted in the days leading up to and the month after Trump announced the US exit from the Paris accords on 1 June 2017. The tweets were sorted into topic category, with an Indiana University tool called Botometer used to estimate the probability the user behind the tweet is a bot. Marlow said he was surprised that bots were responsible for a quarter of climate tweets on an average day. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow that seems really high,\u2019\u201d he said. The consistent drumbeat of bot activity around climate topics is highlighted by the day of Trump\u2019s announcement, when a huge spike in general interest in the topic saw the bot proportion drop by about half to 13%. Tweets by suspected bots did increase from hundreds a day to more than 25,000 a day during the days around the announcement but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent a fall in proportional share. Trump has consistently spread misinformation about the climate crisis, most famously calling it \u201cbullshit\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d, although more recently the US president has said he accepts the science that the world is heating up. Nevertheless, his administration has dismantled any major policy aimed at cutting planet-warming gases, including car emissions standards and restrictions on coal-fired power plants. The Brown University study wasn\u2019t able to identify any individuals or groups behind the battalion of Twitter bots, nor ascertain the level of influence they have had around the often fraught climate debate. However, a number of suspected bots that have consistently disparaged climate science and activists have large numbers of followers on Twitter. One that ranks highly on the Botometer score, @sh_irredeemable, wrote \u201cGet lost Greta!\u201d in December, in reference to the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. This was followed by a tweet that doubted the world will reach a 9-billion population due to \u201c#climatechange lunacy stopping progress\u201d. The account has nearly 16,000 followers. Another suspected bot, @petefrt, has nearly 52,000 followers and has repeatedly rejected climate science. \u201cGet real, CNN: \u2018Climate Change\u2019 dogma is religion, not science,\u201d the account posted in August. Another tweet from November called for the Paris agreement to be ditched in order to \u201creject a future built by globalists and European eco-mandarins\u201d.[* See footnote]. Twitter accounts spreading falsehoods about the climate crisis are also able to use the promoted tweets option available to those willing to pay for extra visibility. Twitter bans a number of things from its promoted tweets, including political content and tobacco advertising, but allows any sort of content, true or otherwise, on the climate crisis. A Twitter spokesperson disputed the accuracy of the Brown University research. \u201cNon-peer reviewed research using our public API can often be deeply flawed,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201csweeping assessments\u201d of users based on signals such as location and tweet content are routinely made by outside groups. \u201cTo be clear - none of these indicators are sufficient to determine if something is a bot. Looking for accounts that look similar to those disclosed as part of our archives is an equally flawed approach, given many of the bad actors mimic legitimate accounts to appear credible. This approach also often wrongly captures legitimate voices who share a particular political viewpoint that one disagrees with.\u201d Research on internet blogs published last year found that climate misinformation is often spread due to readers\u2019 perception of how widely this opinion is shared by other readers. Stephan Lewandowsky, an academic at the University of Bristol who co-authored the research, said he was \u201cnot at all surprised\u201d at the Brown University study due to his own interactions with climate-related messages on Twitter. \u201cMore often than not, they turn out to have all the fingerprints of bots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more denialist trolls are out there, the more likely people will think that there is a diversity of opinion and hence will weaken their support for climate science. \u201cIn terms of influence, I personally am convinced that they do make a difference, although this can be hard to quantify.\u201d John Cook, an Australian cognitive scientist and co-author with Lewandowsky, said that bots are \u201cdangerous and potentially influential\u201d, with evidence showing that when people are exposed to facts and misinformation they are often left misled. \u201cThis is one of the most insidious and dangerous elements of misinformation spread by bots \u2013 not just that misinformation is convincing to people but that just the mere existence of misinformation in social networks can cause people to trust accurate information less or disengage from the facts,\u201d Cook said. Although Twitter bots didn\u2019t ramp up significantly around the Paris withdrawal announcement, some advocates of action to tackle the climate crisis are wary of a spike in activity around the US presidential election later this year. \u201cEven though we don\u2019t know who they are, or their exact motives, it seems self-evident that Trump thrives on the positive reinforcement he receives from these bots and their makers,\u201d said Ed Maibach, an expert in climate communication at George Mason University. \u201cIt is terrifying to ponder the possibility that the Potus was cajoled by bots into committing an atrocity against humanity.\u201d * This footnote was added on 11 March 2020.

A middle-class city dweller, Ursa has neither the skills nor the clothes to manage life in Vard\u00f8, and turns to Maren as housemaid/teacher and then friend.

The narrative now switches between Maren and Ursa, a teenager in Bergen whose father owns the ship on which the Scottish lensmann, Commissioner Cornet, will travel north. Married off to Cornet, Ursa begins a grim voyage with a man who forces himself on her nightly, resents her talking to anyone else and takes away her money. A middle-class city dweller, Ursa has neither the skills nor the clothes to manage life in Vard\u00f8, and turns to Maren as housemaid/teacher and then friend. The women\u2019s relationship strengthens as Cornet takes control of Vard\u00f8, dividing its women into godly submissives and those whose unfeminine powers require supernatural explanation. As the trials begin and the burnings draw closer, Maren and Ursa\u2019s friendship turns to romance. Ursa\u2019s status as Cornet\u2019s wife is the women\u2019s best protection, but also their greatest vulnerability. The most interesting historical fiction speaks of the time of writing as much as of its subject. The Mercies has all the strengths of Millwood Hargrave\u2019s children\u2019s fiction: strong characters, gorgeous settings, a literary commitment to women\u2019s lives, work and relationships with each other. However, the echoing truth here is simultaneously four centuries old and sadly modern. Strong men in power can remake reality and invert reason to defend that power at any cost. Having ordained that women are weak, evidence of women\u2019s strength must be evidence of dark magic \u2013 the more a woman survives, the more dangerous she must be. I admired the way The Mercies shows us the patriarchal fear of women\u2019s strength and reason. It is the men in power who give themselves up to hysteria and superstition, abusing their control of others\u2019 lives and deaths in the service of self-justifying conspiracy theories: wouldn\u2019t it be nice if the Enlightenment had put an end to such tales? \u2022 Sarah Moss\u2019s Ghost Wall is published by Granta.

And this American group is busy abroad too.</p> <p>Last month, after a series of anti-abortion protests at Cardiff University in Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/30/anti-abortion-protests-anger-cardiff-students\">it was reported</a> that ADF International had been reminding universities of their responsibilities to protect freedom of speech.</p> <p>Laurence Wilkinson, legal counsel for ADF International said: \u201cOur London office has been glad to support students facing censorship.

In Romania, ADF pushed for a referendum to oppose same-sex civil unions.

      "bodyText": "A group of about two dozen people, mostly women, stood on the steps of the Connecticut capitol on a New England winter day with signs reading \u201cProtect Women\u2019s Sports\u201d and \u201c#FairPlay\u201d. In front stood Christiana Holcomb, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative Christian legal group representing three cis teen girls in a lawsuit filed this month demanding two transgender teen girls be barred from competing in the female high school sports division. \u201cGirls deserve to compete on a level playing field and the Connecticut policy now allows males to compete in the girls category if they identify as female,\u201d Holcomb later told the Guardian. \u201cNo amount of hormone therapy can ever fully undo those physiological advantages.\u201d But the lawsuit is just one arrow in ADF\u2019s quiver, a conservative Christian powerhouse working internationally to remake laws governing family, sex and marriage in a vision which \u201ckeeps the doors open for the Gospel\u201d. ADF, which reportedly received more than $55m in contributions in 2018, claims to have more than 3,400 affiliated attorneys and judges worldwide. In the 25 years since it was founded, it has brought 10 cases before the US supreme court, including some of the most consequential cases of the last decade on contraceptive and gay rights. ADF is, \u201can aggressive, strategic legal group that is about Christian supremacy and hegemony in the US and in the world,\u201d said Frederick Clarkson, a senior research analyst with Political Research Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s the world under God\u2019s law.\u201d The group\u2019s work against LGBTQ+ people has led experts on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center to label them a hate group. ADF rejects that label. One of its most famous recent cases was of a baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The group argued baking was his form of artistic expression, and won. In another, the group successfully argued the arts and crafts company Hobby Lobby should not be required to pay for birth control included in private insurance plans, because of the owner\u2019s Christian faith. ADF counts the former Trump-appointed US attorney general Jeff Sessions as an ally, and its founders are a who\u2019s-who list of opponents of gay rights. And this American group is busy abroad too. Last month, after a series of anti-abortion protests at Cardiff University in Wales, it was reported that ADF International had been reminding universities of their responsibilities to protect freedom of speech. Laurence Wilkinson, legal counsel for ADF International said: \u201cOur London office has been glad to support students facing censorship. On every occasion, when challenged with the robust legal protections which exist for speech, the university body has relented. That is something that all who care about free speech should be able to celebrate.\u201d In the last decade, ADF attorneys argued in favor of state-sanctioned sterilization for trans people at the European Court of Human Rights. Their brief argued, \u201cequal dignity does not mean that every sexual orientation warrants equal respect\u201d. In Belize, the group sided with another organization pushing to criminalize gay sex. In India, the executive director applauded a supreme court decision ruling gay sex illegal (that was struck down in 2018). In Romania, ADF pushed for a referendum to oppose same-sex civil unions. In Jamaica, ADF attorneys defended anti-sodomy laws. Meanwhile, in US states, the group has worked to craft legislation and defend \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws. These laws often give secular, public-facing businesses the right to refuse customers or perform services. Now, in the years since public sentiment and the law has swung in favor of same-sex marriage, groups who once opposed legal unions have worked on to curtail trans rights. Many have honed in on trans girls in particular, and alleged dangers they cause to cis women. People who have transitioned often have gender dysphoria, a recognized medical condition in which sex assigned at birth is incongruant with a person\u2019s gender identity. ADF\u2019s Connecticut lawsuit claims three cis female high school runners are being unfairly outcompeted by two trans sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood. \u201cThe essence of this argument is if you protect transgender people, this violates the rights of other people,\u201d said Chase Strangio, deputy director for trans justice at the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU is representing the trans girls named in the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks to establish a chromosomal standard for girls\u2019 high school sports \u2013 that only people with XX chromosomes should be able to compete, Strangio said. \u201cThe starting premise is that trans girls are not girls, and the second premise is that boys are always better, stronger, faster than girls,\u201d said Strangio. Yearwood and Miller issued statements vehemently defending their right to run in girls\u2019 events. \u201cI have faced discrimination in every aspect of my life and I no longer want to remain silent,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI am a girl and I am a runner.\u201d \u201cConnecticut has had plenty of trans athletes who are good or fine or bad,\u201d said Strangio. \u201cWhat\u2019s rare is having two examples of transgender girls who are good \u2013 and that\u2019s what bothers people.\u201d The ADF was founded in 1995 by a who\u2019s who of white, anti-gay, Christian men.

Fellow founder Alan Sears wrote the 2003 book: The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. ADF\u2019s legal work has earned the group glowing reviews from friendly media, such as Fox News, where host Laura Ingraham recently included Holcomb on her high-profile show. But ADF\u2019s Connecticut lawsuit is, in part, an acknowledgement that earlier tactics have failed. Just a few years ago, Christian legal groups were pushing \u201cbathroom bills\u201d across the country. The laws would have banned trans people from using the public toilet of their choice, arguing that woman would be in danger from other trans women. There is no evidence to support the claim. Bathroom bill referendums failed in Massachusetts, California and Alaska, and legislative efforts tanked in many more, including conservative states like Alabama and Arkansas. In place of the bathroom bills, ADF\u2019s new Connecticut lawsuit has put faces and names to those who it alleges are victimized by inclusive policies. Other groups, such as the American Principles Project, are testing the electoral success of this message in states like Kentucky. The group is running adverts which argue trans girls will destroy women\u2019s sports, in an effort to re-elect the Republican incumbent governor.

The outcomes will be inherently imperfect, but still superior to allowing the answers to be determined by those whose primary objective is to maximise profit.</p> <p>As councils have repeatedly demonstrated, it is developers who hold back housebuilding, rather than planning. Figures released by the Local Government Association yesterday revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/20/councils-say-1m-homes-given-go-ahead-but-not-yet-built\"> 2.6m units have been granted planning permission </a>by councils since 2009-10 \u2013 but only 1.5m have been completed.

The choice we are offered is the current system \u2013 painted as dystopian state control reminiscent of the Soviet Union\u2019s infamous Gosplan state planning committee \u2013 and the sunlit uplands where untrammelled market forces spontaneously enhance our environment and help us become carbon neutral. It claims councils are saddled with too many policy objectives around development, often pulling in different directions. Of course there are conflicts, and it is the role of local and national politicians, accountable to voters, to do their best to resolve them. The outcomes will be inherently imperfect, but still superior to allowing the answers to be determined by those whose primary objective is to maximise profit. As councils have repeatedly demonstrated, it is developers who hold back housebuilding, rather than planning. Figures released by the Local Government Association yesterday revealed that 2.6m units have been granted planning permission by councils since 2009-10 \u2013 but only 1.5m have been completed. Even allowing for the inevitable lag between permission and building, that is a poor hit rate. The number of planning permissions granted for new homes has almost doubled since 2012-13, with councils approving 9 in 10 applications. As the LGA says, councils need powers to step in where sites are left dormant, while they have an essential role to play as builders of affordable, sustainable, high-quality homes. Development controls and planning have a profound and lasting impact on our quality of life. A system largely shaped in the aftermath of the second world war and subjected to many piecemeal reforms in the subsequent decades is certainly ripe for reappraisal and reform. But suffocating local accountability and putting developers in charge is not the way forward. Simplistic solutions to complex problems may well appeal to a politician in a hurry, but we will all be left living with the consequences.",

Nyanzi collapsed as she left court in Kampala on Thursday, and scuffles broke out between her supporters and prison wardens, who fired live rounds into the air to disperse the crowd. Nyanzi was found guilty of cyber harassment of the president last year, after writing a poem about the president\u2019s mother\u2019s vagina.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far on Friday. 450 more passengers disembarked from the Diamond Princess. Two Australians passengers who were repatriated from Japan tested positive for the virus after arriving home. Another doctor in Wuhan died from the virus. He was 29. South Korea reported a big jump in confirmed cases, to 156, as it added 52 new cases on Friday. The vast majority of new cases were in the city of Daegu, where special measures were put in place to control the virus\u2019s spread. New cases in China reported on Friday totalled 1,109, up from 394 reported on Thursday. The total numbers of infections stands at 75,685. China reported 118 deaths nationally, taking total deaths from the outbreak to 2,236. 500 Chinese prisoners are infected with Covid-19, across three provinces. This includes 230 inmates at Wuhan\u2019s Women\u2019s Prison, where the director was sacked. The director of Wuhan Women\u2019s Prison has been removed from her position, according to the Hubei Daily, where it\u2019s believed 230 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19. Another 41 prisoners in Shayang Hanjin prison, also tested positive, according to reports in the Hubei Daily. The Global Times has reported on new cases in prisons in two other provinces (202 in Shandong, 28 in Zejiang). By my calculation that adds up to 500 new cases in prisons across three provinces. Agence France-Presse has conducted interviews with some of the crew members of the Diamond Princess, who were not subject to the same quarantine restrictions on the ship. They (the crew) were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease. As they have been in close contact with possibly infected passengers, the crew is expected to undergo a 14-day quarantine starting when the last passenger leaves the ship. Crew have generally been reticent to speak to media, apparently concerned for their jobs, but some have broken their silence to describe difficult conditions and fear on board. Sonali Thakkar, a 24-year-old security officer on board, told AFP in an interview crews were sleeping two to a cabin, sharing washrooms and eating together, \u201cso the disease can spread very easily.\u201d \u201cWe do have a lot of fear, me and my colleagues, more than 1000 crew. We\u2019ve been working since the quarantine started. As the days pass and the number of patients increase, the crew is feeling more afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are scared that it can spread really fast and all we want is tests to be done and to be separated from those who are positive. We don\u2019t want to stay on board.\u201d Her father Dinesh said: \u201cSonali is stuck in a small windowless room on the cruise and is very scared... We speak to her every day trying to calm her.\u201d \u201cWhy did the government wait for so long as more and more people got infected? She should have been rescued with other Indians from the cruise long ago. This is very wrong,\u201d he told AFP. Hubei province has revised its new cases for Friday up from 411 to 631, which pushes the day\u2019s total across china above 1,100. New deaths in Hubei remained unchanged at 115. \u201cThe prison system has increased by a total of 220 cases,\u201d the bulletin from the Hubei health commission says. A note at the top of the commission\u2019s revised figures says: \u201ccurrently, there is no access to the province prison network reporting system of infectious diseases\u201d. It also says 271 cases were reported by the prison department, of which 51 seem to have been counted previously, and the remaining 220 were added to the daily total of new cases today. In case you missed this, the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonell has made a video about the empty streets of Beijing and how its citizens are coping with the virus lockdown. China\u2019s Global Television Network is reporting that 200 prisoners in a facility in the eastern province of Shandong are infected with Covid-19. The sources of the infection is reported to be an affected prison guard. Car sales plummeted in China in February, state media is reporting. Another doctor in Wuhan has died from the virus. According to health authorities, 29 year old Peng Yinhua, working in respiratory and critical care at Wuhan\u2019s Jiangxia district\u2019s First People\u2019s Hospital, died at 9:50pm on Thursday. Peng had contracted the virus and was admitted to hospital on 25 January, where his condition worsened by the 30th. He was sent to Jinyin Tan hospital in Wuhan for emergency treatment and died at the hospital. The Jiangxia health commission said it expressed its \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to Peng\u2019s family. Jiangxia district had previously held Peng up as an example of the many doctors fighting on the frontline of the outbreak, featuring an article about Peng delaying his wedding in order to work. On Weibo, news of his death has travelled quickly, with more than 190 million views. \u201cThe bride will never get her bridegroom back home again,\u201d one user wrote. The Japanese media outlet, NHK, says a third group of passengers has left the stricken cruise ship in Yokohama. Some 700 people have disembarked since Wednesday and another 450 are expected to get off on Friday, NHK says. Only those who have tested negative are being allowed to leave, but \u201canyone who shared a cabin with an infected passenger is being asked to stay onboard for another 14 days after they separated \u2013 even if they have tested negative\u201d, the report says. We\u2019re getting some more detail on the 52 new cases of Covid-19 in South Korea. Yonhap news agency is reporting that 41 are in the city of Daegu, 300km southeast of Seoul, and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang Province. Another three were reported in Seoul, the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. Of the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu. Around 1,000 members of the church have been asked to self isolate. Yonhap also reported that military personnel have been confirmed as having Covid-19. Three cases were confirmed, one each in the army, the navy and the air force, it said. All three are believed to have visited or contacted people from Daegu. Meanwhile, in the capital, Seoul, authorities are taking measures to curtail the virus, including banning rallies and closing down Shincheonji church services, Yonhap said. Two Chinese officials have been removed from their posts at prisons, after both centres recorded confirmed cases of Covid-19, the state-owned Global Times is reporting. Just doubling back on those figures for the virus in China ... there were 889 new confirmed cases reported in Friday\u2019s national briefing from the country\u2019s health commission, which is a jump up from the 394 reported the previous day. The total number of infections stands at 75,465. You may recall that the way China reports cases changed again yesterday, to remove patients who had been clinically diagnosed (by a doctor/scan) who had subsequently tested negative for the virus. This appeared to influence the trend down on Thursday, compared to Wednesday. Trying to establish trends on a day-to-day basis is difficult, but generally, it would seem new cases are trending down, as you can see in the Johns Hopkins University graph of confirmed cases below. On Friday China reported 118 deaths (on Thursday it was 114), taking the total number of fatalities to 2,236. South Korea has seen a significant rise in Covid-19 cases \u2013 from 104 to 156 \u2013 prompting the PM to declare \u201cstrong and swift\u201d measures will be taken to tackle the outbreak. \u201cSpecial care zones\u201d have been designated in Daegu and Cheongdo. The latter recorded the country\u2019s first death from the virus on Thursday, according to Yonhap news agency. Seventy cases have been reported in Daegu (population 2.4 million) this week, many linked to a controversial \u201ccult\u201d church. The city\u2019s mayor said residents faced an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d from the virus outbreak. As of Friday more than 400 members of the church were showing symptoms of the disease, Reuters reports, though tests were still ongoing, Daegu mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said at a briefing. After several military members tested positive for the virus on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s defence minister banned all soldiers from taking leave, leaving their barracks, and receiving guests. Two Australians who were repatriated from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for Covid-19 after returning home. More than 160 Australians onboard the cruise liner were flown to the Howard Springs camp outside the northern city of Darwin on Wednesday. At news conference on Thursday local medical authorities said six passengers had cold-like symptoms on arrival and would be tested the virus. They were quarantined from the other passengers, and from other residents at the camp who were evacuated previously from the city of Wuhan. Health authorities say it is possible other Australian passengers from the Diamond Princess may test positive. On Thursday Australia extended its travel ban for people coming from China into a fourth week. It will stay in place until 29 February, despite please from the tertiary education sector, who want their international students to be able to return for the start of the academic year. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. China has recorded 889 new cases, up from 394 recorded on Thursday. There were also 118 new deaths, compared to 114 the day before.

Like many American mass shootings, the Hanau attack has a link to domestic violence: authorities said the shooter went home and shot his mother to death before killing himself.</p> <p>Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Extremism, said that many perpetrators of \u201cmass symbolic violence\u201d have multiple factors driving them, some primary and some secondary, including ideological motivations, revenge or personal benefit, and emotional or psychological problems.</p> <p>Researchers have found people with serious mental illnesses are more likely to become <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Public-Policy/Violence-and-Gun-Reporting-Laws\">a victim of violence</a> than a perpetrator of violence, and that other factors, particularly <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/myth-vs-fact-violence-and-mental-health\">previous violent behavior</a>, is a much better predictor of extreme violence than mental health issues.</p> <p>Within Germany, the Hanau attack follows the murder of a local German politician who had spoken out in defence of refugees and another mass shooting attack on a synagogue and a kebab shop in Halle, which left two people dead. The Halle shootings would likely have claimed more lives had the attacker not used handmade firearms which malfunctioned during the attack.</p> <p>Globally, white nationalist attackers have targeted synagogues in the United States and Germany; mosques in England, Norway, and Christchurch, New Zealand; and a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, near the border between the United States and Mexico. Some attackers have described migrants and immigrants as \u201cinvaders,\u201d as well as elaborating on the belief that a range of enemies, from Jewish people to feminists to leftists, are conspiring against the white race.</p> <p>In ideologically motivated attacks, \u201cthe violence is used to get people to go back and look at the manifesto,\u201d Donovan said, and when online platforms make it easy to share manifestos or even live-streamed footage of the attack, \u201cWe\u2019re gong to continue to see that same tactic over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>But Donovan said that she had seen some early evidence that on Twitter, at least, the Hanau gunman\u2019s manifesto, or messages celebrating his attack, had not spread in the same way as the footage of the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last March, which left 51 people dead.</p> <p>Changes in Twitter\u2019s policies, the disarray and de-platforming of certain white supremacist groups, and the German media\u2019s practice of not using an attacker\u2019s full name in news coverage are among the factors that might have contributed to this positive development, Donovan said.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The mass shootings targeting two bars in the German town of Hanau appear to be the latest in a series of global attacks motivated by white nationalist ideology, experts said. The 43-year-old German man identified by authorities as the gunman also appeared to be obsessed with America, and with American conspiracy theories, according to online video and documents German police are investigating in connection with the attack. One video, posted to YouTube under the same name as the website containing the gunman\u2019s manifesto, described a conspiracy about the abuse and torture of children in secret locations in America. Experts in global extremism said the comments paralleled several recent conspiracies popular with American far-right, including the \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy, which prompted an American gunman to invade a popular pizza restaurant in Washington, DC, in 2016, believing that it was the centre of a secret child abuse ring run by high-ranking Democratic politicians. In that incident, the gunman fired his military-style rifle inside the restaurant, but no one was injured. The Hanau attack is evidence that \u201cconspiracy theories that are circulated by Americans in the United States, and through message boards that are predominantly American, do have an impact in other places,\u201d said Dr Joan Donovan, a expert in technology and online extremism at Harvard University. While no early evidence emerged linking the alleged Hanau attacker to established extremist groups or individuals, analysts said that both the online manifesto and the nine people the gunman chose to murder made it clear that his attack was part of a ongoing pattern of white supremacist terror. \u201cHe targeted particular places where he knew he would find migrants,\u201d said Marilyn Mayo, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. \u201cIn his actions, he went to target the groups that he thought were detrimental to Germany and destroying German society and culture.\u201d The nine people killed at two different shisha bars in Hanau were all from immigrant backgrounds, many of them Turkish nationals.

German authorities have described the gunman as being motivated by a \u201cdeeply racist mindset,\u201d and are investigating the shootings as an act of domestic terrorism.

The postings also include references \u201cdifferent American and Canadian New Age conspiracy theorists, and researchers who believe in alien abductions and UFOs,\u201d Mayo said. Experts noted that the online Hanau manifesto also included a description of the writer\u2019s feelings of alienation from women and inability to find a partner, echoing misogynistic talking points made by the perpetrators of recent mass murders targeting women in the United States and Canada. Like many American mass shootings, the Hanau attack has a link to domestic violence: authorities said the shooter went home and shot his mother to death before killing himself. Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Extremism, said that many perpetrators of \u201cmass symbolic violence\u201d have multiple factors driving them, some primary and some secondary, including ideological motivations, revenge or personal benefit, and emotional or psychological problems. Researchers have found people with serious mental illnesses are more likely to become a victim of violence than a perpetrator of violence, and that other factors, particularly previous violent behavior, is a much better predictor of extreme violence than mental health issues. Within Germany, the Hanau attack follows the murder of a local German politician who had spoken out in defence of refugees and another mass shooting attack on a synagogue and a kebab shop in Halle, which left two people dead. The Halle shootings would likely have claimed more lives had the attacker not used handmade firearms which malfunctioned during the attack. Globally, white nationalist attackers have targeted synagogues in the United States and Germany; mosques in England, Norway, and Christchurch, New Zealand; and a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, near the border between the United States and Mexico. Some attackers have described migrants and immigrants as \u201cinvaders,\u201d as well as elaborating on the belief that a range of enemies, from Jewish people to feminists to leftists, are conspiring against the white race. In ideologically motivated attacks, \u201cthe violence is used to get people to go back and look at the manifesto,\u201d Donovan said, and when online platforms make it easy to share manifestos or even live-streamed footage of the attack, \u201cWe\u2019re gong to continue to see that same tactic over and over again.\u201d But Donovan said that she had seen some early evidence that on Twitter, at least, the Hanau gunman\u2019s manifesto, or messages celebrating his attack, had not spread in the same way as the footage of the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last March, which left 51 people dead. Changes in Twitter\u2019s policies, the disarray and de-platforming of certain white supremacist groups, and the German media\u2019s practice of not using an attacker\u2019s full name in news coverage are among the factors that might have contributed to this positive development, Donovan said.

Inside, I found walls covered in cold war memorabilia and learned that the owners worked for Radio Free Europe at that time, giving the authentic Polish restaurant its name. I decided against the <em>pierogi</em> (dumpling) menu (from \u00a35.50) and went for the <em>zurek w chlebie</em> soup (\u00a33.50). This did not turn out to be a lighter option but a thick meat broth with sausage and mushrooms served in a large rye bread roll.

The building dates from 1887 and the inside looks as though it has barely changed since. Step into a cool marble interior, warmed by dark wood, gilt mirrors and plants tumbling down wrought-iron pillars. If you\u2019re lucky, the resident Liberace-style performer will be playing the ancient piano, complete with candelabras. We especially loved the lunchtime paella (\u20ac20 for two people). But it\u2019s the combination of character and location that make El Jardin such a treasure. Kevin Sullivan Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Never just a daughter \u2013 my very best friend\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the news that matters most this morning.</p> \n<p>The New Zealand man found guilty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/grace-millane-man-jailed-for-life-for-killing-of-uk-backpacker\">murdering British backpacker Grace Millane</a> in November 2018 has been sentenced to life in prison, with no parole for at least 17 years. Millane, 22, from Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she died by strangulation in the Auckland hotel room of a man she met on the dating app Tinder. The man took photographs, then packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in bushland. Her remains were found eight days later. \u201cManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence \u2026 cold-blooded,\u201d said Justice Simon Moore in Auckland\u2019s high court on Friday morning. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim \u2026 You didn\u2019t ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grace\u2019s parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom. \u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian. \u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/a-life-sentence-grace-millane-leaves-trail-of-shattered-lives\">my very best friend</a>.\u201d The crown prosecutor, Brian Dickey, said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d. By court order the man\u2019s name cannot be published and the reason for this is also suppressed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Worker rules \u2018will fuel modern slavery\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Closing UK borders to low-skilled workers risks driving vulnerable EU citizens into modern slavery, charities have warned. The East European Resource Centre predicts some businesses might be happy to hire undocumented workers if the supply of low-skilled workers is choked off by the Tories\u2019 immigration policy. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/immigration-rules-post-brexit-could-fuel-modern-slavery-say-charities\">someone will have to do the dirty, low-paid jobs</a>, from construction to food processing to social care. Where are these workers going to come from?\u201d said Barbara Drozdowicz, the centre\u2019s chief executive. Critics of the government\u2019s proposed immigration laws say they do not make sense in an economy where there is near full employment. Emily Kenway, from Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: \u201cIf you take away the legal routes, people are just going to fall into the hands of traffickers. If we think of the tragedy in October when 39 Vietnamese people were killed, you see the terrible consequences of that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>D\u00e1il number incomplete \u2013 </strong>Leo Varadkar has resigned as Ireland\u2019s taoiseach as the wrangling to form a government continues following the election. Varadkar will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/irish-parliament-set-for-stalemate-in-attempt-to-form-new-government\">remain as caretaker in the post</a>, equivalent to prime minister, until his Fine Gael party, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in or a combination of those and others can assemble a working majority. Last night, at a testy sitting of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, Varadkar, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were all nominated for taoiseach but fell far short of receiving the votes required. Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Never just a daughter \u2013 my very best friend\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the news that matters most this morning. The New Zealand man found guilty of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane in November 2018 has been sentenced to life in prison, with no parole for at least 17 years. Millane, 22, from Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she died by strangulation in the Auckland hotel room of a man she met on the dating app Tinder. The man took photographs, then packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in bushland. Her remains were found eight days later. \u201cManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence \u2026 cold-blooded,\u201d said Justice Simon Moore in Auckland\u2019s high court on Friday morning. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim \u2026 You didn\u2019t ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.\u201d Grace\u2019s parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom. \u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian. \u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend.\u201d The crown prosecutor, Brian Dickey, said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d. By court order the man\u2019s name cannot be published and the reason for this is also suppressed. * * * Worker rules \u2018will fuel modern slavery\u2019 \u2013 Closing UK borders to low-skilled workers risks driving vulnerable EU citizens into modern slavery, charities have warned. The East European Resource Centre predicts some businesses might be happy to hire undocumented workers if the supply of low-skilled workers is choked off by the Tories\u2019 immigration policy. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: someone will have to do the dirty, low-paid jobs, from construction to food processing to social care. Where are these workers going to come from?\u201d said Barbara Drozdowicz, the centre\u2019s chief executive. Critics of the government\u2019s proposed immigration laws say they do not make sense in an economy where there is near full employment. Emily Kenway, from Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: \u201cIf you take away the legal routes, people are just going to fall into the hands of traffickers. If we think of the tragedy in October when 39 Vietnamese people were killed, you see the terrible consequences of that.\u201d * * * D\u00e1il number incomplete \u2013 Leo Varadkar has resigned as Ireland\u2019s taoiseach as the wrangling to form a government continues following the election. Varadkar will remain as caretaker in the post, equivalent to prime minister, until his Fine Gael party, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in or a combination of those and others can assemble a working majority. Last night, at a testy sitting of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, Varadkar, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were all nominated for taoiseach but fell far short of receiving the votes required. Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition. But, writes Rory Carroll, there is widespread acceptance that a stable government will require two of the three big parties \u2013 and Fine Gael appears determined to go into opposition, saying it needs to regroup after nine years in office and a hammering from voters. * * * Regions miss share of jobs \u2013 Almost half of new jobs in England in the past decade were in London and the south-east, which hold only a third of the population, the thinktank IPPR North has found. The north-east and north-west of England and Yorkshire and the Humber had 17% of the country\u2019s new jobs despite containing 28% of the population. Boris Johnson, has promised to put \u201clevelling up\u201d regional divides at the top of his government\u2019s agenda but Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: \u201cThis parliament must be the devolution parliament. It is time to overturn the centralisation that\u2019s let towns, cities and regions fall into decline \u2026 Levelling up should mean opening the door for all of England to benefit from devolution, while also letting areas that have devolution take on more.\u201d In today\u2019s long read, Luke Brown tells the story of how his Lancashire hometown of Fleetwood \u2013 the once-proud fishing port, home of Fleetwood Town FC and its Cod Army, as well as Fisherman\u2019s Friend lozenges \u2013 is hanging on, and the people who won\u2019t give up on it. And there is hope in Redcar, North Yorkshire, where a land deal means steelmaking could be back up and running within three years. * * * \u2018Tap forgotten shares for charity\u2019 \u2013 A government scheme that gives proceeds of dormant bank accounts to good causes could raise a further \u00a32bn by expanding to unclaimed insurance payouts and share sales. Since 2011 the UK\u2019s 30 biggest banks and building societies have been voluntarily transferring money left in dormant bank accounts to the scheme, called Big Society Capital, with \u00a3600m redistributed to charities helping young people get into work and housing, and others tackling financial exclusion. Under the existing scheme, if at a later date a consumer discovers they had a dormant account, they are always able reclaim the money.

Plus, there is lots of cutting-edge science seeking to answer the eternally unanswerable question of how babies become who they are, and what they do to us. Some of this is fascinating, some forehead-smackingly obvious to anyone who has experienced the deep privilege, joy, shock, isolation and boredom of parenting a baby from birth. Fundamentally, there is nothing as novel or revelatory here as watching an actual newborn. What you get is a series such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/27/the-baby-has-landed-review-wheres-the-blood-sweat-and-vomit\" title=\"\">The Baby Has Landed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/04/child-of-our-time-review-robert-winston\" title=\"\">Child of Our Time</a> given the Netflix Originals treatment: swish production values, a global outlook, a more diverse mix of families, lots of meaningful closeups of an infant\u2019s big toe, and a lush Blue Planet-esque opening with a lovely fat baby suspended in water instead of a beluga.</p> <p>The first episode, Love, is about bonding: those extraordinary early weeks saturated with milk, exhaustion and oxytocin. In London, we meet Rachel, Adam, Lily and Willow, who was the cause of all that mooing at the start. In Tel Aviv, Ruth Feldman, professor of developmental social neuroscience, is interested in what happens in our brains when we fall in love with our babies. She has discovered oxytocin levels increase in the first month not just in mothers but to an identical extent in fathers (or, as we call them in my two-mother family, second parents). \u201cFatherhood is as biologically deep as motherhood,\u201d Feldman concludes, which is quite the conclusion. At this point my brain tried to cogitate more on the implications of such findings on paternity leave, whether we should be aiming for biological parity or increased awareness of difference \u2026 but then my baby fell over, I forgot where I was, and you know how it goes.</p> <p>Spit-spot to Calgary, where Isaac and Josh have become parents to baby Eric, conceived through surrogacy. \u201cHaving Eric made our lives more stressful, but it\u2019s a good stress,\u201d says Isaac, which is a spot-on description of parenting and why we will never get a good night\u2019s sleep again. The science lies in the opening of the amygdala, the place in the brain where stress and vigilance responses are located, and which is activated by the surge in oxytocin in the mother after birth. Once it is open, Feldman says casually, it stays that way. FOREVER. This gave me and my gaping amygdala an instant headache. For Feldman, it led to scanning the brains of 48 gay male couples who had their babies from birth. Turns out their amygdalas were open, too. Incredible.</p> <p>Essentially, babies are tiny superpowers who prise open amazing stuff in us, if only we would pay attention. (Instead of, possibly, spending our precious time watching programmes about them.) They also, as the second episode examines, stimulate the production of breast milk. Yes, Babies wades knee-deep into the breastfeeding wars by marvelling at the \u201cbespoke\u201d properties of each mother\u2019s milk, which I found refreshing in an age when it has become controversial to say breast milk is amazing. It also features a mother breastfeeding after a caesarean section, which I did with my firstborn but have never before seen on telly.</p> <p>Ultimately, Babies is a lovely inclusive celebration of humans in their most compact, adorable form that slightly irritated me. While it is exciting that babies learn and know more from a very early age than we ever thought possible, it is also stressful. And it never seems to lead to a greater valuing of parenting, which is mostly done by women. This is why any programme about baby development, however well-meaning, might as well be subtitled: All the Ways in Which You Should Feel Anxious and Guilty as a Parent \u2026 and Probably a Woman. The mystery of existence can feel an awful lot to land on the dimpled shoulders of babies, too, who are mostly busy blowing milk bubbles. Ultimately, just as in real life, the best bits in Babies are not the latest discoveries about gut microbiome or the startling changes in hippocampi in response to parenting styles. They are the babies.</p>",

She has discovered oxytocin levels increase in the first month not just in mothers but to an identical extent in fathers (or, as we call them in my two-mother family, second parents). \u201cFatherhood is as biologically deep as motherhood,\u201d Feldman concludes, which is quite the conclusion. At this point my brain tried to cogitate more on the implications of such findings on paternity leave, whether we should be aiming for biological parity or increased awareness of difference \u2026 but then my baby fell over, I forgot where I was, and you know how it goes. Spit-spot to Calgary, where Isaac and Josh have become parents to baby Eric, conceived through surrogacy. \u201cHaving Eric made our lives more stressful, but it\u2019s a good stress,\u201d says Isaac, which is a spot-on description of parenting and why we will never get a good night\u2019s sleep again. The science lies in the opening of the amygdala, the place in the brain where stress and vigilance responses are located, and which is activated by the surge in oxytocin in the mother after birth. Once it is open, Feldman says casually, it stays that way. FOREVER. This gave me and my gaping amygdala an instant headache. For Feldman, it led to scanning the brains of 48 gay male couples who had their babies from birth. Turns out their amygdalas were open, too. Incredible. Essentially, babies are tiny superpowers who prise open amazing stuff in us, if only we would pay attention. (Instead of, possibly, spending our precious time watching programmes about them.) They also, as the second episode examines, stimulate the production of breast milk. Yes, Babies wades knee-deep into the breastfeeding wars by marvelling at the \u201cbespoke\u201d properties of each mother\u2019s milk, which I found refreshing in an age when it has become controversial to say breast milk is amazing. It also features a mother breastfeeding after a caesarean section, which I did with my firstborn but have never before seen on telly. Ultimately, Babies is a lovely inclusive celebration of humans in their most compact, adorable form that slightly irritated me. While it is exciting that babies learn and know more from a very early age than we ever thought possible, it is also stressful. And it never seems to lead to a greater valuing of parenting, which is mostly done by women. This is why any programme about baby development, however well-meaning, might as well be subtitled: All the Ways in Which You Should Feel Anxious and Guilty as a Parent \u2026 and Probably a Woman. The mystery of existence can feel an awful lot to land on the dimpled shoulders of babies, too, who are mostly busy blowing milk bubbles. Ultimately, just as in real life, the best bits in Babies are not the latest discoveries about gut microbiome or the startling changes in hippocampi in response to parenting styles. They are the babies.",

      "body": "<p>My parents moved to Fleetwood on the coast of Lancashire in the years when the British fishing industry was beginning its dramatic decline. In 1976 the North Sea trawlers had lost the rights to fish the Icelandic waters where the majority of Fleetwood\u2019s cod was caught. Cod fishing had been vital to the town\u2019s economy, and remains part of its identity: a person from Fleetwood is a \u201ccod head\u201d\u2013 a term used as an insult by our neighbours but as an endearment by us. The supporters of Fleetwood Town FC are the Cod Army. The town\u2019s biggest manufacturer is Lofthouse, makers of Fisherman\u2019s Friend lozenges, which were first concocted in Victorian times to relieve the colds that deckhands would catch from working days and nights in the freezing wet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/10/cod-wars-to-food-banks-how-a-lancashire-fishing-town-is-hanging-on-podcast\">Cod wars to food banks: how a Lancashire fishing town is hanging on \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My parents, originally from Gloucestershire, had moved to Fleetwood for their first teaching jobs when I was two years old. They found it forbidding at first, living at the end of a narrow peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. \u201cIt was so empty,\u201d my mother told me. \u201cWalking along the prom when we arrived in November was like looking out at an old painting of a storm. It felt like we were completely cut off.\u201d When I started school, my new friend Mike asked me: \u201cWhy do you talk like Prince Charles?\u201d (I had rhymed grass with arse.) At which point I started to speak like a northerner.</p> <p>I grew up with the sea at one end of my street, with a view across Morecambe Bay towards the mountains of the Lake District. When the tide was in, the sun on the water under a clear horizon, I would feel energised and free \u2013 although on an overcast day in winter, with the tide so far out you can\u2019t see it, the landscape can look empty, bleached, abandoned.</p> <p>There is almost nothing left of Fleetwood\u2019s fishing industry now, and the area, like many northern towns, has high unemployment and voted to leave the EU, driven in part by the promise to \u201ctake back control of our waters\u201d. Last year, two wards of Fleetwood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/06/most-depressed-english-communities-in-north-and-midlands\" title=\"\">featured separately</a> in a list of the 10 most depressing places to live in England, based on GP figures for people being treated for depression. I had left the town a month after I turned 18 to go to university in Birmingham, and stayed away. Even so, I bristled with defensiveness at the idea of my hometown being some kind of hell. I\u2019ve always hated lists of crap towns compiled by people who live in cities, and while this list, published by the House of Commons library as an index of mental health problems, had nobler aims, I wanted to remind myself what living in Fleetwood feels like to the people there, and what life might be like if I had stayed.</p> <p>My mother still lives in the town, and my sister not far away, and every couple of months I go back to see them. Over the past 20 years, I\u2019ve seen the way the high street has grown quieter, the pubs emptier or shut. What was Marks &amp; Spencer when I was a child is now boarded up. A year ago, a cannabis farm with a crop worth \u00a33m was discovered above it, tended by two enslaved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/26/vietnamese-cannabis-farms-children-enslaved\" title=\"\">Vietnamese</a> men.</p> <p>In November, I took my bike on the train from London Euston, changed at Preston and rode seven miles from Poulton-le-Fylde to Fleetwood down a busy A-road in the rain, lorries juddering past me on the long stretches without pavement. Fleetwood has been without a train station since 1970, although when the town was built by the architect Decimus Burton in the 1830s as a new port and resort for factory workers, the rail links were an integral part of the plan. Burton\u2019s North Euston hotel, still in operation, was named to make it explicit that Fleetwood is a destination for people arriving by train from London, on their way to Scotland. (Queen Victoria stayed there in 1847.)</p> <p>Londoners rarely stop here now, and towns like Fleetwood have become a symbol of the broken links between the metropolitan and the regional: the gulf in wealth, the suspicion of each other\u2019s motives. On the day after the EU referendum, when Fleetwood, like much of the north, voted to leave, I was travelling up, and though I\u2019d voted to remain and was feeling dismayed by the result, I was appalled to watch people I knew posting memes about how London and Scotland should join forces to form a new country and leave all the leave-voting racist morons to their fate.</p> <p>I had written to Mike, the friend who pointed out my southern accent at primary school, that I would be back home for a bit to write about the town. He replied: \u201cI think sometimes it\u2019s lost hope, but then I walk the dog along the beach and remember why I live here.\u201d I wandered over to see him at the house he lives in with his partner and her son, on the street where I grew up.</p> <p>My last two years living in Fleetwood were chaotic and miserable. My father left our home on this street for another woman, and I distracted myself by working all hours in a kitchen under two volatile Glaswegian chefs, while paying insufficient attention to my A-levels and getting drunk every night with Mike and the lads. The town was precociously alcoholic; we had all been drinking on the beach since we were 15 or younger, and the pubs served us as soon as we were 16. At the last minute, I applied myself and got the grades I needed to go to Birmingham University. Our tight group split into those who left and those who stayed.</p> <p>Mike did what many of the men in the town who didn\u2019t go to university did: joined the army, and was posted to Northern Ireland. You meet a lot of men who served in Northern Ireland in Fleetwood, and who were troubled by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s sympathy for the IRA. Mike was the fastest sprinter in the area, but developed knee problems and had to leave the forces early. For a while, he and a friend ran a business providing courses for army leavers, but new accreditation criteria put an end to that business, and since then Mike has worked in Asda. He was promoted to manager, but then the company made the manager position redundant, so he was back to where he started. \u201cSo I just have to work more shifts,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>That sort of stoicism is what I think of when I think of Fleetwood. Resignation rather than revolution. There is an excellent Granada documentary about Fleetwood called <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-life-apart-anxieties-in-a-trawling-community-1973-online\" title=\"\">A Life Apart (1973)</a>, which shows the older generation of fishermen telling the younger that their attempts to gain better conditions and pay are doomed. The ICI chemical factory, a few miles away, employed a lot of the men who left the fishing industry, but that was demolished in 1999.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t replace the fishing industry and ICI with a big Asda,\u201d said Mike.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Fleetwood has always prized itself on its sense of community, which derives in some part from the days when men relied on each other during dangerous excursions to the North Sea, and when women supported each other during the long absences of their men. Most of my sister\u2019s friends\u2019 husbands still work away: on the oil rigs or on construction sites down south, and return at weekends, if they can. These working patterns favour a certain type of person, accustomed to suffering. The town\u2019s most successful athlete is Jane Couch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/jane-couch-britains-first-licenced-female-boxer-interview\" title=\"\">the first British female </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/jane-couch-britains-first-licenced-female-boxer-interview\" title=\"\">licensed boxer</a> and a light-welterweight world champion several times over. She is the daughter of a trawler deckhand, a \u201cdecky\u201d, and her mother\u2019s second husband was a decky, too. She called me a cod head approvingly after learning that I grew up on Darbishire Road.</p> <p>Couch described growing up in the 70s. \u201cWe had an amazing childhood, though we didn\u2019t have any money. It would run out while you waited for the men to come home. But you could just knock on and ask the neighbour for a fiver, or milk or whatever. Fleetwood was just like one big family. I could walk into any of the houses on our side of the street without knocking. Three of the families on my side of the street were fishers. The others worked in the industry, in the factories or making the nets, or filleting the fish on the docks \u2013 we were all connected.\u201d</p> <p>Couch\u2019s voice was full of happiness remembering this, but she admitted that life was hard. \u201cWomen had to be tough because they had to bring the kids up on their own. And then when the men came home, they were pissed up all the time for their three days off, and the women would have to put them to bed. And then make sure they don\u2019t miss the boat back out there.\u201d She remembers dragging her mother\u2019s second husband out of bed because the taxi was outside waiting to take him on the ship. \u201cHe\u2019d be screaming, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go.\u2019 And nine times out of 10 he\u2019d go, but sometimes he wouldn\u2019t. And then he\u2019d be out of a ship and the money would run out. It\u2019s just a terrible existence.\u201d</p> <p>The men did a 100-hour-minimum working week. And it was dangerous, too. I talked to an ex-fisherman, Phil Thomas, who started in 1969, and he told me how hard it was. \u201cA trawler is a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week slaughterhouse. Before the cod wars, you\u2019d be on the north side of Iceland, one of the most dangerous places in the world. If anyone says to me you\u2019re going to hell, I say: \u2018I\u2019ve been to hell.\u2019 In winter, the ship would freeze over an inch every five minutes, and you\u2019d have to hack the ice away with an axe or you\u2019d capsize. In 1968, three ships from Hull got lost there in one night. It\u2019s just hell on Earth.\u201d Couch\u2019s friend Bozzy was lost overboard, and her gran\u2019s husband died in the Red Falcon disaster of 1959, when 19 men from Fleetwood were lost at sea just after they had radioed to say they would be home for Christmas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"829e7e2689f684191cbc548beb21b0ecb4482016\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829e7e2689f684191cbc548beb21b0ecb4482016/0_376_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fleetwood was once the third biggest fishing port in England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fleetwood was once the third biggest fishing port in England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this uneven way of life, it has always been a boozy town, quick to boil over. We always expected other lads to pick fights with us. A few of us had indie haircuts, which were seen as a provocation. Couch was a barmaid in one of the main fishing pubs from 14. \u201cWorking in the Kings was where I learned to fight. It was coming towards the end of the fishing, but it was still quite rough in there. The landlord was a taxi driver. He\u2019d pick them up off the ship and drive them straight back to the pub.\u201d</p> <p>Fleetwood has changed, and not just because of the decline of fishing, Couch thinks. \u201cBack then, it was only people from Fleetwood who lived here. You might have had the odd one from Blackpool or Manchester and Ireland. There\u2019s loads more now. You used to be able to walk down town and recognise every single person.\u201d And the village mentality can make people suspicious of outsiders. The town is overwhelmingly white \u2013 about 98% according to the past two censuses \u2013 but it was the accents from other regions that seemed to arouse suspicion rather than the small number of Syrian refugees who live in the town now. \u201cMy mum, when she talks to people,\u201d said Couch, \u201cshe\u2019d normally know them or know their father or mother. She won\u2019t talk to them if she doesn\u2019t know them. \u2018I\u2019m not talking to him.\u2019 But Mum, you\u2019ve got to, I say, because they\u2019re living here. \u2018But you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cat Smith, the Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, kept her seat with a margin of 2,000 votes in the December election. Lancaster is a university town on the other side of the bay with twice Fleetwood\u2019s population, and Smith held on in spite of some anger in Fleetwood about her closeness to Corbyn and the perception that Labour wanted to reverse Brexit. EU fishing quotas are blamed by many for exacerbating the decline of the fishing industry, and so much of the conviction of the town\u2019s leave voters seemed to come from the belief that the EU served the centre, not the regions. There was a strong feeling that those on the edges \u201chaven\u2019t been listened to and no one is fighting for them\u201d, said Rachel George, a town councillor who switched allegiance from the Labour party to the Brexit party in 2018. Every Saturday during the campaign, the Brexit party had parked its stall right outside Cat Smith\u2019s office on Fleetwood\u2019s high street. When I visited, they were advertising an event with Brexit party MEP June Mummery about how to restart Britain\u2019s fishing industry.</p> <p>Smith said she understood the anger that is still felt in the town about the decline of fishing. The town has suffered, she said, but she spoke of its resilience, too. \u201cIt has a closeness and sense of community that a lot of towns the size of Fleetwood wouldn\u2019t have. Everyone knows everyone.\u201d</p> <p>When they first moved there, my parents didn\u2019t know anyone. Their neighbours\u2019 lives were difficult and many of the children they taught were angry. I remember a big stone shattering our living-room window one afternoon and someone shouting \u201cBodser!\u201d before they ran off. (My father\u2019s nickname among some pupils was Bodser Brown, after a character from a book by Robert Westall he taught in his English lessons.) But one evening, a woman knocked on the door and invited my mother out to the Young Wives club, and through this my parents made friends.</p> <p>My parents stayed, but leaving \u2013 going where there\u2019s a living to be made \u2013 was the aspirational narrative I took from my parents, who had no generational roots in the town, unlike most of my friends\u2019 parents. But this isn\u2019t something to congratulate myself for. Since I left, I\u2019ve always enjoyed living in the cheapest, multiethnic parts of cities \u2013 Balsall Heath, Lewisham \u2013 for my own selfish reasons, in order to pursue writing and creative work that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and to enjoy culture and nightlife. It seems obvious to me that a greater claim for altruism might be made by those who stay put in the towns \u2013 those for whom family ties and place are more important than the individualist pull to the city.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>People need each other when times are tough, but communities struggle to survive without the shared work that once brought them together. Mark Spencer has been a doctor for 28 years. He was working long hours as a GP in town, but everything he saw in his surgery and in the public health data told him that the state of the town was getting worse and worse.</p> <p>\u201cThe town had particular problems with mental health, as well as with addictive behaviour,\u201d he told me. A lot of this seemed to him to be caused by isolation. \u201cHumans need a sense of purpose, they need a home and they need to be loved,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a long time, people in the town have been looking back at what we\u2019ve lost, and that bereavement has lasted 40 years. We\u2019d been treating them and then sending them straight back to the conditions that made them ill.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer\u2019s solution was, he said, \u201cto listen to the residents\u201d and help them take responsibility for setting up groups and activities they felt there was a need for. He founded Healthier Fleetwood five years ago, which supports locals setting up their own initiatives: a singing group, a woodwork club, various support groups. In a place with the lack of purpose that low employment brings, and with such underfunding of local services, the volunteer sector is vital. Since Spencer started his programme, admissions to A&amp;E from people registered with GPs in Fleetwood have fallen \u2013 a 10% drop in each of the past two years.</p> <p>Fleetwood Men\u2019s Shed is a support group for men who have experienced mental illness. When I got to the hut where they were having a meeting one morning, a group of about 15 men were busy making tea and coffee.</p> <p>At that point, the organisers, Tony O\u2019Neill and John Tyler, arrived together. They were gruff but welcoming. O\u2019Neill sat down and apologised to the group for an incident a couple of days ago when he smashed his phone against the wall and \u201cwent walkabout\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got all this pent-up anger inside me at the moment,\u201d he admitted to the group.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not handling it very well,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cListen guys, together we\u2019re strong. Individually we\u2019re just a man.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>People murmured in assent. A lot of the talk had been about a new \u201chub\u201d that Men\u2019s Shed were about to move into \u2013 who was a good and cheap plasterer, who was available to pick things up and give people lifts, paint walls and help get the place shipshape. O\u2019Neill cheered up in the face of this activity. \u201cLet\u2019s get this hub open and get into the new year,\u201d he said. \u201c2020 is our year! 2020 is Fleetwood\u2019s year!\u201d</p> <p>I saw several of the men again at 3pm on Saturday, when Fleetwood Town FC were hosting Tranmere Rovers. When I was a child, only a handful of people watched the club, but it has had a meteoric rise since 2004 when it was taken over by Andy Pilley, a local businessman who set about rebuilding the stadium, investing in players and training facilities, and overseeing six promotions to the third tier of English football. Before he made his fortune as an energy provider, one of Pilley\u2019s first jobs was as a market trader in Fleetwood, selling football shirts. In February 2004, he was invited to become part of a \u201cfinancially distressed\u201d club. \u201cThe gate was 80 people when I first watched them,\u201d he told me, \u201cand 60 of them might have been the players\u2019 family. The pitch was like the surface of the moon and we were close to closure.\u201d</p> <p>Now Pilley is the biggest employer in the town \u2013 there are 500-plus working for his companies and the club. The day before, I\u2019d toured Fleetwood\u2019s new training facility in Burn Naze, right next to the site of the disused ICI chemical plant. I\u2019d watched Joey Barton, the head coach, put the team through set-piece drills.</p> <p>Afterwards I spoke to Billy Crellin, a 19-year-old goalkeeper who grew up minutes from the ground and was preparing to make his first-team debut in the league. His friends are still in the town, one a plumber, one working on the docks, one a scaffolder. As a young boy, Crellin used to jump over the back fence to watch games.</p> <p>Twenty minutes into the game, Fleetwood were 1-0 up from a free kick, and the Cod Army were singing: \u201cBilly Crellin, he\u2019s one of our own.\u201d Half of the crowd behind the goal \u2013 \u201cthe Ultras de Cod\u201d proclaimed one banner \u2013 looked as if they were still at school. A young lad beat a drum and the fans sang: \u201cWe\u2019re walking in a Pilley wonderland.\u201d Fleetwood won 2-1 and Crellin was awarded man of the match on his debut.</p> <p>Afternoons like this can provide a focal point for a town\u2019s pride. But football and community projects can\u2019t fix a town\u2019s underlying problems on their own. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a personal affinity with the town, I would never have started a business here, with the terrible transport links. The main road here in here is gridlocked every morning. There\u2019s no train station. Maybe if some investment had been spent on transport links we wouldn\u2019t have lost the P&amp;O ferries. There\u2019s all the talk of the northern powerhouse, but it can\u2019t just be about Liverpool and Manchester and Leeds.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Fleetwood was built outwards from a hill, known as the Mount, with streets filled with large townhouses radiating out like bicycle spokes. One of the grandest is Bold Street, which runs from the foot of the Mount down past the police station and closed hospital, past the surviving amusement arcades to the terminal for the ferry across the estuary to Knott End, a little town on the way to Lancaster. Bold Street is notorious in the town for poverty and addiction; a man was found murdered in his room there last October. Houses have been bought cheap and chopped into flats. \u201cEveryone says they\u2019re all terrible who live down there,\u201d said Hilary Craig, who manages Mustard Seed, a charity that runs a food bank and cooks a communal meal for people from the flats every Monday night. \u201cBut most of them are very nice and polite. It\u2019s a scandal, the accommodation down Bold Street. Several come to us every week because they can\u2019t make a meal where they live.\u201d</p> <p>Craig runs one of the town\u2019s three food banks from a shop that used to sell \u201cterrible country and western records\u201d. I was there from open till close in the second week of January. People queued up from 11am in hats and furry-hooded parkas. The sandwiches disappeared quickly, because so many people\u2019s electricity had run out and wouldn\u2019t be topped up again until the next time their benefits came through.</p> <p>Some volunteers at the food bank once used the service themselves. Others are regulars at St Peter\u2019s church, whose vicar, John Hall, takes on a big role in coordinating all the many volunteer organisations that are keeping the community alive, and who has been instrumental in a successful bid to buy the hospital in order to turn it into a community centre. One volunteer told us he keeps a Naloxone kit in his fridge, for reversing the effects of an opiate overdose. \u201cNo one takes heroin in my house,\u201d he clarified, \u201cbut you never know what you might see outside.\u201d They hand out the kits at Inspired, the local addiction service, and another volunteer described administering them to people overdosing when he worked on the ambulances. \u201cThey\u2019d be outraged when they came round,\u201d he said. \u2018\u201cWhat are you doing? I spent 30 fucking quid on that!\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Later, a young man with an estuary accent came into the food bank for the first time, rocking on the back of his heels. I thought he might be drunk, but came to see that he was unsteady with anger and exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m confused about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on universal credit, zero hours, there\u2019s no work.\u201d He told a story of not being paid for six weeks, of the hole in his roof he couldn\u2019t get fixed, of his mother who would be 66 today, but died last year after breaking her pelvis in four different places in hospital \u2013 \u201ctell me, how did that happen?\u201d \u2013 about how she should still be alive, about the rash on his face because he\u2019s so stressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2255691d16c1b8c43f118943145961c2907a0ad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2255691d16c1b8c43f118943145961c2907a0ad1/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The North Euston hotel in Fleetwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The North Euston hotel in Fleetwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over and over, I heard about the problems with landlords who make their money by renting specifically to those on benefits. Ged Taylor lives just off Bold Street, and told me the tenants on benefits are at the mercy of the bad landlords. \u201cWho\u2019ve you got?\u201d shouted another volunteer when he overheard us. Taylor told him. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst one,\u201d said the volunteer. Taylor told us about the water coming through his double-glazed windows. \u201cHe owns most of the properties on my street. In my bedroom, the wall is literally crumbling because of the damp. You ask him but you get the impression: if you don\u2019t like it go and live somewhere else. But where would I or anyone on benefits find \u00a3500 to put down on a new bond? He knows we can\u2019t, so he gets away with it.\u201d</p> <p>Those streets should not be awful places to live. They are good Victorian buildings. One side of the short street opens up to a view of the sea, the North Euston hotel, a lighthouse. Taylor is ashamed to tell people where he lives: \u201cPeople think you\u2019re on heroin or crack. I don\u2019t want my daughter coming over to see what happens there. There are people kicking off all day long.\u201d</p> <p>I was constantly struck by people\u2019s openness, the honesty of those who had had to get past the shame of asking for help, and who now wanted to help others. Stewart told me about the first time he came in, and showed me a photo of a big man sitting on a bike on Fleetwood beach, wearing a chef coat and colourful trousers. \u201cHe took me in the back and asked me what was up. I was at rock bottom and I fell apart when I was talking to him; he let me admit I needed help.\u201d Stewart looked back at the photo. \u201cHe took his own life a year ago.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I kept hearing about suicide, and so I returned to talk to Tony O\u2019Neill at a weekly \u201cveteran\u2019s breakfast\u201d that Men\u2019s Shed cook for residents who\u2019ve served in the forces. The night before had been his daughter\u2019s birthday. Every birthday had been really hard for him since he had found out, during a battle with his ex-wife over access, that he wasn\u2019t her biological father.</p> <p>\u201cIt finished me,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019d left the army with a heart murmur, I\u2019d gone through leukaemia, lost an eye, but this was the end for me. I ended up at the end of North Pier in Blackpool looking at the tide. I was going. I was gone. The security guard came down and talked to me nicely. He didn\u2019t say: \u2018You\u2019re not doing that,\u2019 but said: \u2018Gimme your story.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to give him my story, it wasn\u2019t a cry for help, I was going to do it. But he said to me: \u2018Just give me a bit of your story, because when you\u2019ve done it, and the police have finished with me, I\u2019ve got to go home to my five-year-old daughter and explain what happened to me today.\u2019 That brought things home to me \u2013 that I had a responsibility to my daughter, whether she\u2019s my genetic daughter or not, she\u2019s still my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>That was in 2016, a year when there was a spike in male suicides in Fleetwood. After he\u2019d been talked down by the security guard, O\u2019Neill decided something had to be done about it. It\u2019s something I heard over and over again: we have to do something, because no one else is going to. It took O\u2019Neill until 2018 to find the help he needed to launch the group, and it was then he realised there was one big contributory factor to the suicides: \u201cPeople living on their own and not seeing anyone. Social isolation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1c4e5f5bfee5e472cb6dd610632801cb774bc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c4e5f5bfee5e472cb6dd610632801cb774bc8a/0_0_5421_3254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the last traditional trawlers working out of Fleetwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the last traditional trawlers working out of Fleetwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the volunteer activity in the town is aimed at addressing this. Talking to O\u2019Neill, and to Dave Smith, who plays a big role in the group, I was struck again by an emotional honesty I hadn\u2019t associated with men in the town in my memory. \u201cPeople are losing the fear of speaking out,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to say: \u2018I\u2019ve felt shit for 12 months.\u2019 They would never have had the courage, but when they see others come forward, they realise it\u2019s OK to say: \u2018I felt a bit down and I was crying.\u2019 Times have changed. We\u2019re not in the Victorian era any more. We\u2019ve got emotions and it\u2019s OK to talk about them. Whereas years ago it would be \u2018Man up. Get a grip.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There are good reasons that Fleetwood made the list of depressing towns. Poverty and isolation breed desperation. But in these smaller communities, it\u2019s harder to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t my problem\u201d. Smith told me about every person who had been sleeping rough in the town recently and what he\u2019d done to get them into temporary accommodation \u2013 often someone\u2019s spare bedroom \u2013 while he tried to get them into the housing system.</p> <p>Before I caught the train back to the city, I walked down the hidden path behind the amusement arcade, past the decaying landing gear where P&amp;O ferries from Ireland used to dock. I didn\u2019t see a soul there, and I found various signs advertising the Samaritans. The tide was out, and there was a small boat marooned in the sand. It was eerie to be alone in a place that would have once been so busy, looking at the ghosts of what had been. Many of the people in Fleetwood feel abandoned and unseen by the rest of the country, but they are still here and not willing to give up on the place. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My parents moved to Fleetwood on the coast of Lancashire in the years when the British fishing industry was beginning its dramatic decline. In 1976 the North Sea trawlers had lost the rights to fish the Icelandic waters where the majority of Fleetwood\u2019s cod was caught. Cod fishing had been vital to the town\u2019s economy, and remains part of its identity: a person from Fleetwood is a \u201ccod head\u201d\u2013 a term used as an insult by our neighbours but as an endearment by us. The supporters of Fleetwood Town FC are the Cod Army. The town\u2019s biggest manufacturer is Lofthouse, makers of Fisherman\u2019s Friend lozenges, which were first concocted in Victorian times to relieve the colds that deckhands would catch from working days and nights in the freezing wet. My parents, originally from Gloucestershire, had moved to Fleetwood for their first teaching jobs when I was two years old. They found it forbidding at first, living at the end of a narrow peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. \u201cIt was so empty,\u201d my mother told me. \u201cWalking along the prom when we arrived in November was like looking out at an old painting of a storm. It felt like we were completely cut off.\u201d When I started school, my new friend Mike asked me: \u201cWhy do you talk like Prince Charles?\u201d (I had rhymed grass with arse.) At which point I started to speak like a northerner. I grew up with the sea at one end of my street, with a view across Morecambe Bay towards the mountains of the Lake District. When the tide was in, the sun on the water under a clear horizon, I would feel energised and free \u2013 although on an overcast day in winter, with the tide so far out you can\u2019t see it, the landscape can look empty, bleached, abandoned. There is almost nothing left of Fleetwood\u2019s fishing industry now, and the area, like many northern towns, has high unemployment and voted to leave the EU, driven in part by the promise to \u201ctake back control of our waters\u201d. Last year, two wards of Fleetwood featured separately in a list of the 10 most depressing places to live in England, based on GP figures for people being treated for depression. I had left the town a month after I turned 18 to go to university in Birmingham, and stayed away. Even so, I bristled with defensiveness at the idea of my hometown being some kind of hell. I\u2019ve always hated lists of crap towns compiled by people who live in cities, and while this list, published by the House of Commons library as an index of mental health problems, had nobler aims, I wanted to remind myself what living in Fleetwood feels like to the people there, and what life might be like if I had stayed. My mother still lives in the town, and my sister not far away, and every couple of months I go back to see them. Over the past 20 years, I\u2019ve seen the way the high street has grown quieter, the pubs emptier or shut. What was Marks &amp; Spencer when I was a child is now boarded up. A year ago, a cannabis farm with a crop worth \u00a33m was discovered above it, tended by two enslaved Vietnamese men. In November, I took my bike on the train from London Euston, changed at Preston and rode seven miles from Poulton-le-Fylde to Fleetwood down a busy A-road in the rain, lorries juddering past me on the long stretches without pavement. Fleetwood has been without a train station since 1970, although when the town was built by the architect Decimus Burton in the 1830s as a new port and resort for factory workers, the rail links were an integral part of the plan. Burton\u2019s North Euston hotel, still in operation, was named to make it explicit that Fleetwood is a destination for people arriving by train from London, on their way to Scotland. (Queen Victoria stayed there in 1847.) Londoners rarely stop here now, and towns like Fleetwood have become a symbol of the broken links between the metropolitan and the regional: the gulf in wealth, the suspicion of each other\u2019s motives. On the day after the EU referendum, when Fleetwood, like much of the north, voted to leave, I was travelling up, and though I\u2019d voted to remain and was feeling dismayed by the result, I was appalled to watch people I knew posting memes about how London and Scotland should join forces to form a new country and leave all the leave-voting racist morons to their fate. I had written to Mike, the friend who pointed out my southern accent at primary school, that I would be back home for a bit to write about the town. He replied: \u201cI think sometimes it\u2019s lost hope, but then I walk the dog along the beach and remember why I live here.\u201d I wandered over to see him at the house he lives in with his partner and her son, on the street where I grew up. My last two years living in Fleetwood were chaotic and miserable. My father left our home on this street for another woman, and I distracted myself by working all hours in a kitchen under two volatile Glaswegian chefs, while paying insufficient attention to my A-levels and getting drunk every night with Mike and the lads. The town was precociously alcoholic; we had all been drinking on the beach since we were 15 or younger, and the pubs served us as soon as we were 16. At the last minute, I applied myself and got the grades I needed to go to Birmingham University. Our tight group split into those who left and those who stayed. Mike did what many of the men in the town who didn\u2019t go to university did: joined the army, and was posted to Northern Ireland. You meet a lot of men who served in Northern Ireland in Fleetwood, and who were troubled by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s sympathy for the IRA. Mike was the fastest sprinter in the area, but developed knee problems and had to leave the forces early. For a while, he and a friend ran a business providing courses for army leavers, but new accreditation criteria put an end to that business, and since then Mike has worked in Asda. He was promoted to manager, but then the company made the manager position redundant, so he was back to where he started. \u201cSo I just have to work more shifts,\u201d he told me. That sort of stoicism is what I think of when I think of Fleetwood. Resignation rather than revolution. There is an excellent Granada documentary about Fleetwood called A Life Apart (1973), which shows the older generation of fishermen telling the younger that their attempts to gain better conditions and pay are doomed. The ICI chemical factory, a few miles away, employed a lot of the men who left the fishing industry, but that was demolished in 1999. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace the fishing industry and ICI with a big Asda,\u201d said Mike. * * * Fleetwood has always prized itself on its sense of community, which derives in some part from the days when men relied on each other during dangerous excursions to the North Sea, and when women supported each other during the long absences of their men. Most of my sister\u2019s friends\u2019 husbands still work away: on the oil rigs or on construction sites down south, and return at weekends, if they can. These working patterns favour a certain type of person, accustomed to suffering. The town\u2019s most successful athlete is Jane Couch, the first British female licensed boxer and a light-welterweight world champion several times over. She is the daughter of a trawler deckhand, a \u201cdecky\u201d, and her mother\u2019s second husband was a decky, too. She called me a cod head approvingly after learning that I grew up on Darbishire Road. Couch described growing up in the 70s. \u201cWe had an amazing childhood, though we didn\u2019t have any money. It would run out while you waited for the men to come home. But you could just knock on and ask the neighbour for a fiver, or milk or whatever. Fleetwood was just like one big family. I could walk into any of the houses on our side of the street without knocking. Three of the families on my side of the street were fishers. The others worked in the industry, in the factories or making the nets, or filleting the fish on the docks \u2013 we were all connected.\u201d Couch\u2019s voice was full of happiness remembering this, but she admitted that life was hard. \u201cWomen had to be tough because they had to bring the kids up on their own. And then when the men came home, they were pissed up all the time for their three days off, and the women would have to put them to bed. And then make sure they don\u2019t miss the boat back out there.\u201d She remembers dragging her mother\u2019s second husband out of bed because the taxi was outside waiting to take him on the ship. \u201cHe\u2019d be screaming, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go.\u2019 And nine times out of 10 he\u2019d go, but sometimes he wouldn\u2019t. And then he\u2019d be out of a ship and the money would run out. It\u2019s just a terrible existence.\u201d The men did a 100-hour-minimum working week. And it was dangerous, too. I talked to an ex-fisherman, Phil Thomas, who started in 1969, and he told me how hard it was. \u201cA trawler is a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week slaughterhouse. Before the cod wars, you\u2019d be on the north side of Iceland, one of the most dangerous places in the world. If anyone says to me you\u2019re going to hell, I say: \u2018I\u2019ve been to hell.\u2019 In winter, the ship would freeze over an inch every five minutes, and you\u2019d have to hack the ice away with an axe or you\u2019d capsize. In 1968, three ships from Hull got lost there in one night. It\u2019s just hell on Earth.\u201d Couch\u2019s friend Bozzy was lost overboard, and her gran\u2019s husband died in the Red Falcon disaster of 1959, when 19 men from Fleetwood were lost at sea just after they had radioed to say they would be home for Christmas. Because of this uneven way of life, it has always been a boozy town, quick to boil over. We always expected other lads to pick fights with us. A few of us had indie haircuts, which were seen as a provocation. Couch was a barmaid in one of the main fishing pubs from 14. \u201cWorking in the Kings was where I learned to fight. It was coming towards the end of the fishing, but it was still quite rough in there. The landlord was a taxi driver. He\u2019d pick them up off the ship and drive them straight back to the pub.\u201d Fleetwood has changed, and not just because of the decline of fishing, Couch thinks. \u201cBack then, it was only people from Fleetwood who lived here. You might have had the odd one from Blackpool or Manchester and Ireland. There\u2019s loads more now. You used to be able to walk down town and recognise every single person.\u201d And the village mentality can make people suspicious of outsiders. The town is overwhelmingly white \u2013 about 98% according to the past two censuses \u2013 but it was the accents from other regions that seemed to arouse suspicion rather than the small number of Syrian refugees who live in the town now. \u201cMy mum, when she talks to people,\u201d said Couch, \u201cshe\u2019d normally know them or know their father or mother. She won\u2019t talk to them if she doesn\u2019t know them. \u2018I\u2019m not talking to him.\u2019 But Mum, you\u2019ve got to, I say, because they\u2019re living here. \u2018But you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.\u2019\u201d Cat Smith, the Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, kept her seat with a margin of 2,000 votes in the December election. Lancaster is a university town on the other side of the bay with twice Fleetwood\u2019s population, and Smith held on in spite of some anger in Fleetwood about her closeness to Corbyn and the perception that Labour wanted to reverse Brexit. EU fishing quotas are blamed by many for exacerbating the decline of the fishing industry, and so much of the conviction of the town\u2019s leave voters seemed to come from the belief that the EU served the centre, not the regions. There was a strong feeling that those on the edges \u201chaven\u2019t been listened to and no one is fighting for them\u201d, said Rachel George, a town councillor who switched allegiance from the Labour party to the Brexit party in 2018. Every Saturday during the campaign, the Brexit party had parked its stall right outside Cat Smith\u2019s office on Fleetwood\u2019s high street. When I visited, they were advertising an event with Brexit party MEP June Mummery about how to restart Britain\u2019s fishing industry. Smith said she understood the anger that is still felt in the town about the decline of fishing. The town has suffered, she said, but she spoke of its resilience, too. \u201cIt has a closeness and sense of community that a lot of towns the size of Fleetwood wouldn\u2019t have. Everyone knows everyone.\u201d When they first moved there, my parents didn\u2019t know anyone. Their neighbours\u2019 lives were difficult and many of the children they taught were angry. I remember a big stone shattering our living-room window one afternoon and someone shouting \u201cBodser!\u201d before they ran off. (My father\u2019s nickname among some pupils was Bodser Brown, after a character from a book by Robert Westall he taught in his English lessons.) But one evening, a woman knocked on the door and invited my mother out to the Young Wives club, and through this my parents made friends. My parents stayed, but leaving \u2013 going where there\u2019s a living to be made \u2013 was the aspirational narrative I took from my parents, who had no generational roots in the town, unlike most of my friends\u2019 parents. But this isn\u2019t something to congratulate myself for. Since I left, I\u2019ve always enjoyed living in the cheapest, multiethnic parts of cities \u2013 Balsall Heath, Lewisham \u2013 for my own selfish reasons, in order to pursue writing and creative work that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and to enjoy culture and nightlife. It seems obvious to me that a greater claim for altruism might be made by those who stay put in the towns \u2013 those for whom family ties and place are more important than the individualist pull to the city. * * * People need each other when times are tough, but communities struggle to survive without the shared work that once brought them together. Mark Spencer has been a doctor for 28 years. He was working long hours as a GP in town, but everything he saw in his surgery and in the public health data told him that the state of the town was getting worse and worse. \u201cThe town had particular problems with mental health, as well as with addictive behaviour,\u201d he told me. A lot of this seemed to him to be caused by isolation. \u201cHumans need a sense of purpose, they need a home and they need to be loved,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a long time, people in the town have been looking back at what we\u2019ve lost, and that bereavement has lasted 40 years. We\u2019d been treating them and then sending them straight back to the conditions that made them ill.\u201d Spencer\u2019s solution was, he said, \u201cto listen to the residents\u201d and help them take responsibility for setting up groups and activities they felt there was a need for. He founded Healthier Fleetwood five years ago, which supports locals setting up their own initiatives: a singing group, a woodwork club, various support groups. In a place with the lack of purpose that low employment brings, and with such underfunding of local services, the volunteer sector is vital. Since Spencer started his programme, admissions to A&amp;E from people registered with GPs in Fleetwood have fallen \u2013 a 10% drop in each of the past two years. Fleetwood Men\u2019s Shed is a support group for men who have experienced mental illness. When I got to the hut where they were having a meeting one morning, a group of about 15 men were busy making tea and coffee. At that point, the organisers, Tony O\u2019Neill and John Tyler, arrived together. They were gruff but welcoming. O\u2019Neill sat down and apologised to the group for an incident a couple of days ago when he smashed his phone against the wall and \u201cwent walkabout\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got all this pent-up anger inside me at the moment,\u201d he admitted to the group. \u201cYou\u2019re not handling it very well,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cListen guys, together we\u2019re strong. Individually we\u2019re just a man.\u201d People murmured in assent. A lot of the talk had been about a new \u201chub\u201d that Men\u2019s Shed were about to move into \u2013 who was a good and cheap plasterer, who was available to pick things up and give people lifts, paint walls and help get the place shipshape. O\u2019Neill cheered up in the face of this activity. \u201cLet\u2019s get this hub open and get into the new year,\u201d he said. \u201c2020 is our year! 2020 is Fleetwood\u2019s year!\u201d I saw several of the men again at 3pm on Saturday, when Fleetwood Town FC were hosting Tranmere Rovers. When I was a child, only a handful of people watched the club, but it has had a meteoric rise since 2004 when it was taken over by Andy Pilley, a local businessman who set about rebuilding the stadium, investing in players and training facilities, and overseeing six promotions to the third tier of English football. Before he made his fortune as an energy provider, one of Pilley\u2019s first jobs was as a market trader in Fleetwood, selling football shirts. In February 2004, he was invited to become part of a \u201cfinancially distressed\u201d club. \u201cThe gate was 80 people when I first watched them,\u201d he told me, \u201cand 60 of them might have been the players\u2019 family. The pitch was like the surface of the moon and we were close to closure.\u201d Now Pilley is the biggest employer in the town \u2013 there are 500-plus working for his companies and the club. The day before, I\u2019d toured Fleetwood\u2019s new training facility in Burn Naze, right next to the site of the disused ICI chemical plant. I\u2019d watched Joey Barton, the head coach, put the team through set-piece drills. Afterwards I spoke to Billy Crellin, a 19-year-old goalkeeper who grew up minutes from the ground and was preparing to make his first-team debut in the league. His friends are still in the town, one a plumber, one working on the docks, one a scaffolder. As a young boy, Crellin used to jump over the back fence to watch games. Twenty minutes into the game, Fleetwood were 1-0 up from a free kick, and the Cod Army were singing: \u201cBilly Crellin, he\u2019s one of our own.\u201d Half of the crowd behind the goal \u2013 \u201cthe Ultras de Cod\u201d proclaimed one banner \u2013 looked as if they were still at school. A young lad beat a drum and the fans sang: \u201cWe\u2019re walking in a Pilley wonderland.\u201d Fleetwood won 2-1 and Crellin was awarded man of the match on his debut. Afternoons like this can provide a focal point for a town\u2019s pride. But football and community projects can\u2019t fix a town\u2019s underlying problems on their own. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a personal affinity with the town, I would never have started a business here, with the terrible transport links. The main road here in here is gridlocked every morning. There\u2019s no train station. Maybe if some investment had been spent on transport links we wouldn\u2019t have lost the P&amp;O ferries. There\u2019s all the talk of the northern powerhouse, but it can\u2019t just be about Liverpool and Manchester and Leeds.\u201d * * * Fleetwood was built outwards from a hill, known as the Mount, with streets filled with large townhouses radiating out like bicycle spokes. One of the grandest is Bold Street, which runs from the foot of the Mount down past the police station and closed hospital, past the surviving amusement arcades to the terminal for the ferry across the estuary to Knott End, a little town on the way to Lancaster. Bold Street is notorious in the town for poverty and addiction; a man was found murdered in his room there last October. Houses have been bought cheap and chopped into flats. \u201cEveryone says they\u2019re all terrible who live down there,\u201d said Hilary Craig, who manages Mustard Seed, a charity that runs a food bank and cooks a communal meal for people from the flats every Monday night. \u201cBut most of them are very nice and polite. It\u2019s a scandal, the accommodation down Bold Street. Several come to us every week because they can\u2019t make a meal where they live.\u201d Craig runs one of the town\u2019s three food banks from a shop that used to sell \u201cterrible country and western records\u201d. I was there from open till close in the second week of January. People queued up from 11am in hats and furry-hooded parkas. The sandwiches disappeared quickly, because so many people\u2019s electricity had run out and wouldn\u2019t be topped up again until the next time their benefits came through. Some volunteers at the food bank once used the service themselves. Others are regulars at St Peter\u2019s church, whose vicar, John Hall, takes on a big role in coordinating all the many volunteer organisations that are keeping the community alive, and who has been instrumental in a successful bid to buy the hospital in order to turn it into a community centre. One volunteer told us he keeps a Naloxone kit in his fridge, for reversing the effects of an opiate overdose. \u201cNo one takes heroin in my house,\u201d he clarified, \u201cbut you never know what you might see outside.\u201d They hand out the kits at Inspired, the local addiction service, and another volunteer described administering them to people overdosing when he worked on the ambulances. \u201cThey\u2019d be outraged when they came round,\u201d he said. \u2018\u201cWhat are you doing? I spent 30 fucking quid on that!\u201d\u2019 Later, a young man with an estuary accent came into the food bank for the first time, rocking on the back of his heels. I thought he might be drunk, but came to see that he was unsteady with anger and exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m confused about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on universal credit, zero hours, there\u2019s no work.\u201d He told a story of not being paid for six weeks, of the hole in his roof he couldn\u2019t get fixed, of his mother who would be 66 today, but died last year after breaking her pelvis in four different places in hospital \u2013 \u201ctell me, how did that happen?\u201d \u2013 about how she should still be alive, about the rash on his face because he\u2019s so stressed. Over and over, I heard about the problems with landlords who make their money by renting specifically to those on benefits. Ged Taylor lives just off Bold Street, and told me the tenants on benefits are at the mercy of the bad landlords. \u201cWho\u2019ve you got?\u201d shouted another volunteer when he overheard us. Taylor told him. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst one,\u201d said the volunteer. Taylor told us about the water coming through his double-glazed windows. \u201cHe owns most of the properties on my street. In my bedroom, the wall is literally crumbling because of the damp. You ask him but you get the impression: if you don\u2019t like it go and live somewhere else. But where would I or anyone on benefits find \u00a3500 to put down on a new bond? He knows we can\u2019t, so he gets away with it.\u201d Those streets should not be awful places to live. They are good Victorian buildings. One side of the short street opens up to a view of the sea, the North Euston hotel, a lighthouse. Taylor is ashamed to tell people where he lives: \u201cPeople think you\u2019re on heroin or crack. I don\u2019t want my daughter coming over to see what happens there. There are people kicking off all day long.\u201d I was constantly struck by people\u2019s openness, the honesty of those who had had to get past the shame of asking for help, and who now wanted to help others. Stewart told me about the first time he came in, and showed me a photo of a big man sitting on a bike on Fleetwood beach, wearing a chef coat and colourful trousers. \u201cHe took me in the back and asked me what was up. I was at rock bottom and I fell apart when I was talking to him; he let me admit I needed help.\u201d Stewart looked back at the photo. \u201cHe took his own life a year ago.\u201d * * * I kept hearing about suicide, and so I returned to talk to Tony O\u2019Neill at a weekly \u201cveteran\u2019s breakfast\u201d that Men\u2019s Shed cook for residents who\u2019ve served in the forces. The night before had been his daughter\u2019s birthday. Every birthday had been really hard for him since he had found out, during a battle with his ex-wife over access, that he wasn\u2019t her biological father. \u201cIt finished me,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019d left the army with a heart murmur, I\u2019d gone through leukaemia, lost an eye, but this was the end for me. I ended up at the end of North Pier in Blackpool looking at the tide. I was going. I was gone. The security guard came down and talked to me nicely. He didn\u2019t say: \u2018You\u2019re not doing that,\u2019 but said: \u2018Gimme your story.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to give him my story, it wasn\u2019t a cry for help, I was going to do it. But he said to me: \u2018Just give me a bit of your story, because when you\u2019ve done it, and the police have finished with me, I\u2019ve got to go home to my five-year-old daughter and explain what happened to me today.\u2019 That brought things home to me \u2013 that I had a responsibility to my daughter, whether she\u2019s my genetic daughter or not, she\u2019s still my daughter.\u201d That was in 2016, a year when there was a spike in male suicides in Fleetwood. After he\u2019d been talked down by the security guard, O\u2019Neill decided something had to be done about it. It\u2019s something I heard over and over again: we have to do something, because no one else is going to. It took O\u2019Neill until 2018 to find the help he needed to launch the group, and it was then he realised there was one big contributory factor to the suicides: \u201cPeople living on their own and not seeing anyone. Social isolation.\u201d Much of the volunteer activity in the town is aimed at addressing this. Talking to O\u2019Neill, and to Dave Smith, who plays a big role in the group, I was struck again by an emotional honesty I hadn\u2019t associated with men in the town in my memory. \u201cPeople are losing the fear of speaking out,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to say: \u2018I\u2019ve felt shit for 12 months.\u2019 They would never have had the courage, but when they see others come forward, they realise it\u2019s OK to say: \u2018I felt a bit down and I was crying.\u2019 Times have changed. We\u2019re not in the Victorian era any more. We\u2019ve got emotions and it\u2019s OK to talk about them. Whereas years ago it would be \u2018Man up. Get a grip.\u2019\u201d There are good reasons that Fleetwood made the list of depressing towns. Poverty and isolation breed desperation. But in these smaller communities, it\u2019s harder to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t my problem\u201d. Smith told me about every person who had been sleeping rough in the town recently and what he\u2019d done to get them into temporary accommodation \u2013 often someone\u2019s spare bedroom \u2013 while he tried to get them into the housing system. Before I caught the train back to the city, I walked down the hidden path behind the amusement arcade, past the decaying landing gear where P&amp;O ferries from Ireland used to dock. I didn\u2019t see a soul there, and I found various signs advertising the Samaritans. The tide was out, and there was a small boat marooned in the sand. It was eerie to be alone in a place that would have once been so busy, looking at the ghosts of what had been. Many of the people in Fleetwood feel abandoned and unseen by the rest of the country, but they are still here and not willing to give up on the place. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

She is a founding member of <a href=\"http://collectif5050.com/\" title=\"\">50/50x2020</a>, the Time\u2019s Up-style movement seeking to redress the gender balance in international film-making, and is wearing a 50/50 badge when we first meet in the wake of her premiere in Cannes. In person, she speaks in confident, thoughtful English, though with the odd, sweary flourish. (\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. I don\u2019t give a shit about it,\u201d she says when the subject of the controversial lesbian film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/21/blue-is-the-warmest-colour-review\" title=\"\">Blue Is the Warmest Colour</a> comes up.)</p> <p>Born in the Parisian suburbs, Sciamma wrote the script for her first film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/14/worldcinema.drama\" title=\"\">Water Lilies</a>, while she was still at school. The film, a tense, at times troubling drama about three teenage synchronised swimmers, was screened at Cannes and followed up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/15/tomboy-review\" title=\"\">Tomboy</a>, which tracked the adolescence of a gender-nonconforming child. Most recently, there was the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/girlhood-review-celine-sciamma-karidja-toure\" title=\"\">Girlhood</a>, which documented the rollicking lives of a group of French-African schoolgirls. The focus of Sciamma\u2019s output is squarely on women, usually young women on the cusp of some major change \u2013 and how they look at themselves and each other.</p> <p>It is this art of seeing that is central to her latest \u2013 and best \u2013 film. Portrait of a Lady on Fire traces the crackling relationship between H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel), a young woman living on a remote island near Brittany, and Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), the artist tasked with painting a portrait of her, which will be sent off to a prospective husband for evaluation. (A process people have likened to an enlightenment-era precursor to a Tinder pic, Sciamma says, smiling.)</p> <p>The trouble is, H\u00e9lo\u00efse has shown little willingness to be married off, and has refused to sit for other portraits, so Marianne must capture her likeness surreptitiously while pretending to be her walking partner. Soon Marianne\u2019s searching looks towards her subject are returned in kind. The result is a film in which every covert glance feels weighted with meaning, both a commentary on and celebration of the power of the female gaze.</p> <p>With its lush visuals and rippling period detail, Portrait of a Lady on Fire might seem a jolting departure for anyone familiar with Sciamma\u2019s earlier work. Where her previous trio of films felt fizzingly contemporary, Portrait is often serenely still: the closest it gets to the raucous rendition of Rihanna\u2019s Diamonds in Sciamma\u2019s 2014 film Girlhood is when Marianne blasts out Summer from Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons on the harpsichord. Yet beneath the period trappings there is something strikingly modern about the film\u2019s outlook. It shows little interest in the cliches of doomed romance that similar LGBT love stories would usually lean into. The inevitable melodramatic moment where the lovers get caught thankfully never materialises. Instead, Sciamma decided \u201cto concentrate on the potential and fulfilment of their love story\u201d, even though history tells us it can\u2019t succeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69bd3bbfd7ae7c20a474e6027aa211da0c78a945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69bd3bbfd7ae7c20a474e6027aa211da0c78a945/403_0_1524_914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girlhood (2014).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girlhood (2014).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hold Up/Lilies/Cnc/Arte France Cinema/Canal+/Strand Releasing/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Modern, too, is the depiction of enlightenment-era art, a period that, it might be assumed, was overwhelmingly male-focused, but that Sciamma\u2019s research showed to be quite the opposite. \u201cI was ignorant of the fact that it was such an important time for women painters. We didn\u2019t get the memo, because it had been erased from the history of art.\u201d In fact, the female painters she unearthed were so \u201cvivid and numerous\u201d, she felt that to make a biopic of one would undervalue the rest. \u201cSo I decided to invent one to talk about all of them.\u201d</p> <p>This reclamation of women\u2019s art extends not just to those doing the painting. \u201cWe call models \u2018muses\u2019, and that\u2019s mostly what\u2019s left in the history of art for women artists,\u201d Sciamma explains. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/19/dora-maar-review-restless-experimenter-who-fascinates-and-surprises\" title=\"\">Dora Maar</a> was the muse of Picasso but also a photographer at the centre of the surrealist scene. And <a href=\"http://womanns-world.com/gabriele-buffet-picabia/\" title=\"\">Gabri\u00e8le Picabia</a> was the wife of [avant-garde painter Francis] Picabia but also the brain of his work. It\u2019s about co-creation, not this fetishised, silent woman standing there beautiful and mute.\u201d</p> <p>So, in the film, the portrait becomes a collaborative act between artist and subject, H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s thoughts and gestures shaping and informing the finished work. In this, art imitates life: the film\u2019s central relationship evokes that of Sciamma and her lead actor Haenel. The pair first worked together on Water Lilies and were, until recently, in a relationship.</p> <p>\u201cWe met through cinema and had our dialogue on set,\u201d Sciamma says. \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectual relationship that never stopped, even though we didn\u2019t officially work together for 12 years. We\u2019ve been growing and thinking together. And I wanted to portray that.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted it to be open,\u201d she continues. \u201cI wanted it to be generous and full of ideas, ideas about cinema. But it mostly tells about the present of our relationship, how we had this dialogue on this particular film and how we keep writing our relationship today.\u201d</p> <p>Haenel made headlines in November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/french-actor-adele-haenel-alleges-she-was-sexually-harassed-by-director\" title=\"\">after alleging that she had been sexually harassed by the French director Christophe Ruggia when she was 12</a>. Ruggia, who denies any wrongdoing, was charged with assault of a minor in January. In a country where the #MeToo movement, and its French equivalent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/woman-behind-french-metoo-sandra-muller-guilty-defaming-media-boss\" title=\"\">#BalanceTonPorc</a>, haven\u2019t always been enthusiastically received, Haenel\u2019s decision to speak out was fraught with risk, yet she has received praise for her bravery.</p> <p>When I catch up with Sciamma in London in the new year, she is reluctant to speak about Haenel\u2019s allegations, but is heartened by the response to them. \u201cShe had support, people believed her, so that\u2019s new.\u201d Still, resistance to #MeToo remains an issue, as seen last month when An Officer and a Spy, the new film by disgraced director Roman Polanski, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/29/outrage-as-polanski-film-nominated-for-12-french-oscars\" title=\"\">received the most nominations at France\u2019s answer to the Oscars, the C\u00e9sars</a>. The decision prompted 400 members of the French film industry to demand \u201cprofound reform\u201d at the C\u00e9sar academy, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/leadership-of-french-oscars-resigns-amid-polanski-controversy\" title=\"\">saw the resignation of its entire board</a>. Speaking after the nominations were announced, but before the board\u2019s mass resignation, Sciamma simply said: \u201cIt\u2019s France.\u201d</p> <p>Portrait of a Lady on Fire received 10 nominations at the C\u00e9sars, to add to a swelling number of festival and critics\u2019 choice prizes the film has won in the past eight months. One accolade notably absent was an Oscar nomination: with only one film from each nation able to be submitted for the Academy\u2019s best international film award, France elected to submit another film, Ladj Ly\u2019s state-of-the-nation cop drama Les Mis\u00e9rables, for the prize. It was a decision that prompted howls of protest from admirers of Sciamma\u2019s film, but the director is relaxed about the situation. She has seen the glad-handing Ly has been forced to do during awards season and, \u201cIt\u2019s eating up his life!\u201d</p> <p>Sciamma has enjoyed some reflected Oscars glory, though. Portrait of a Lady shares the same US distributor, Neon, as Parasite and throughout awards season she has been cheering the film on. After Parasite won the top prize at the Screen Actors Guild awards, Sciamma says that she got in touch with the director Bong Joon-Ho. \u201cI texted: \u2018I feel like I won, too\u2019 because we\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she says. On Oscar night a joyous video of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-02-10/parasite-oscars-are-a-huge-win-for-neon-why-the-scrappy-indie-bet-on-bong-joon-ho\" title=\"\">Bong and Sciamma celebrating</a> together went viral. She says happily: \u201cI have nothing to do with [Parasite\u2019s awards season wins], but it\u2019s a win for an idea of cinema we share.\u201d</p> <p><em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire is out on 28 February</em></p>",

Such are the historical and geopolitical layers of migration to the busiest border in the world, gateway to the globally ubiquitous American dream \u2013 a dream now twisting into a nightmare.</p> <p>Woody Guthrie wrote his song Deportee \u2013 about migrants working and dying in America\u2019s deserts \u2013 in 1948. It remains resonant, but the cast has changed.</p> <p>Mass migrations began with poor Mexicans crossing to work in America\u2019s farms, and continued with the <em>bracero</em> programme \u2013 a Spanish term for a labourer \u2013 initiated in 1942, which gave limited access to American jobs. The scheme ended in 1964, yet vast numbers of Mexicans continued to cross, legally and illegally.</p> <p>During the 80s, when civil wars erupted across Central America, tens of thousands tried to cross, many finding a place in the US thanks to the \u201csanctuary\u201d movement, which gave a path to legality.</p> <p>All the while millions of Mexicans came to the border not to cross but to live on it, in <em>maquiladora</em> assembly plants, producing goods exported duty-free to the US.</p> <p>From 2006, as the cartel wars devoured Mexico, more fled, seeking safety in the north. The demographics changed again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb61269777e26833ade105e5986f7057c5865730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb61269777e26833ade105e5986f7057c5865730/0_0_4288_2859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants from Haiti and Africa wait to see if their number will be called to cross the border to apply for asylum in the US, in Tijuana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants from Haiti and Africa wait in Tijuana to see if their number will be called to cross the border to apply for asylum in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Espejel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Methodist pastor Juan Fierro Garc\u00eda, who runs the shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, says: \u201cMore people than ever are on the move from generalised violence all over the world, seeking safe places for themselves and their children. And if anyone thinks this is going to stop, think again \u2013 this is just the beginning.\u201d</p> <h2>Policy of deterrence</h2> <p>The Trump administration has met this surge in arrivals with a policy of deterrence based on fear and brutality.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/us-immigration-court-parents-separated-children-families\">separation of children</a> from their parents for incarceration outraged the world. The policy was ruled illegal by US courts and abandoned, though hundreds of children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/26/trump-administration-family-separations-children-reunited\">remain separated</a> after their parents were deported. Internal documentation leaked from US Customs and Border Protection shows <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/16/trump-administration-knew-family-separations-harm-migrant-children/\">full knowledge</a> of the traumatic affects of child separation. <strong><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/16/trump-administration-knew-family-separations-harm-migrant-children/\"><br></a></strong><br>Unaccompanied minors crossing the border continue to be detained in appalling conditions. In December, ProPublica published <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-cell-where-a-sick-16-year-old-boy-died-in-border-patrol-care\">CCTV footage</a> that appears to show a Guatemalan teenager left to die in a concrete cell.</p> <p>An internal report from last July, seen by the Guardian and written by Jennifer Costello, the inspector general of homeland security, to acting director Kevin McAleenan, warned that \u201cat-risk populations are subject to overcrowding and prolonged detention\u201d.

The Trump administration announced in January that it plans to extend the MPP to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/remain-in-mexico-expansion-us-to-require-brazilian-asylum-seekers-to-wait-in-mexico-for-hearings/\">Portuguese-speaking Brazilian asylum seekers</a>.</p> <p>The policies are \u201cworking\u201d: US Customs and Border Protection <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-reversal-of-spring-crisis-border-arrests-drop-for-sixth-straight-month-11575912090#_ga=2.179828770.767697110.1581420397-1027687814.1575396541\">report</a> that the number of arrests for illegal crossings fell 75% from May to November last year, from 132,000 to 33,510.

Marisela fled El Salvador when the MS-13 gang demanded she join them \u2013 the problem being that Diego\u2019s father was among them.</p> <p>\u201cThey came to my house, armed, saying they needed me to do \u2018tasks\u2019 for them, and if I didn\u2019t they\u2019d kill me and the boy,\u201d she says. Marisela has spent the past year on \u201ctrucks and railway cars, crossing Mexico\u201d, paying $8,000 (\u00a36,211) to <em>coyotes</em> and other people smugglers. To her horror, Diego\u2019s father has traced her to Ju\u00e1rez, \u201cand I\u2019m scared when I go out for food, because he said his contacts here would take our son and kill me. I know that the police and gangs are friends \u2013 if I go to them for help, I\u2019ll be killed.\u201d</p> <p>In the men\u2019s dorm, Evian Mvouba, from DRC, prepares to cross and make his asylum claim. He stands a better chance than his Central American companions since MPP does not apply to Africans.

The shelters have been vital to current efforts to abate the suffering.</p> <p>Without radical Catholicism of the kind that inspires Garc\u00eda, far less would happen on the migrants\u2019 behalf. To overlook the faith of those who do this is to not accurately report what is happening.</p> <p>\u201cForty years ago, a group of us started this work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made a decision to offer hospitality to undocumented migrants.</p> <p>\u201cBut we also talked to reporters, universities, hoping we could bring about change for the better. And 40 years later, we have Mr Trump as president and below him very capable officials whose sole task is to make life unbearable for refugees. It makes me think of Lazarus, restored to life by Jesus, who turned to the community and said: \u2018Unbind him\u2019. In this situation, it is the refugees who unbind us, sharing their stories, their struggles. There\u2019ve been days when we\u2019ve received hundreds of people.\u201d</p> <p>One night, up to 1,000 migrants were released on to the streets around El Paso bus station. TV coverage showed Garc\u00eda, arms wide, saying to a group: \u201cBienvenidos!\u201d \u2013 welcome \u2013 and it seemed the first kind gesture they had encountered in months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fae6cefc8fc91936b574a4c78cae72db655d6534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fae6cefc8fc91936b574a4c78cae72db655d6534/0_0_5120_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruben Garc\u00eda, right, from the network of Casa Asenci\u00f3n - Annunciation House - shelters across El Paso, accompanies migrants seeking political asylum in the US, in Ciudad Ju\u00e0rez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruben Garc\u00eda, right, from the network of Casa Asenci\u00f3n - Annunciation House - shelters across El Paso, accompanies migrants seeking political asylum in the US, in Ciudad Ju\u00e0rez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H\u00e9rika Mart\u00ednez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garc\u00eda has seen generations of migrants \u201cflee death squads in the 1980s, when war was war, and you knew who the sides were, to this new kind of undeclared war, where no one knows the rules, and you live in a state of permanent insecurity. Plus drought and crop failure.</p> <p>\u201cYou either give up your children to those realities back there, or you pay the coyote, subjecting yourself to debt bondage and whatever risk, and leave.\u201d</p> <h2>Flawed system</h2> <p>Migrants need \u201cguidance through a system designed to fail\u201d, says Molly Molloy, up the road in Las Cruces. Molloy worked as an archivist at New Mexico State University, but has retired to work with migrants, something she first did in the 80s. She is now a \u201cparalegal, translator and researcher\u201d for immigration lawyer Nancy Oretskin.</p> <p>In the civil wars in the 1980s migrants were mainly people \u201cwho had never been to school or left their hamlet\u201d and, with successive waves of migrants, blocks have been laid in response, says Molloy. \u201cSeptember 11 2001 was a dividing line, after large numbers, mainly Mexican men, fled poverty as the result of the North American Free Trade Agreement and clearance of subsistence farms. Then came two further \u2018push factors\u2019: Mexicans fleeing violence after 2006, and the great recession, after which there were just fewer jobs for these people.\u201d</p> <p>And now \u201cclimate change, and in Central America, violence of gangs that were initially deported from Los Angeles. A level of violence more extreme, on a daily, monthly basis \u2013 more people killed \u2013 even than during the civil wars\u201d.</p> <p>Oretskin\u2019s family were migrants. \u201cI was raised by crazy Jewish entrepreneurs \u2026 raised to think: \u2018don\u2019t you ever forget\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Handling 10-15 asylum cases a year, she works in the immigration courts \u201cwhere 90% lose\u201d, affording a \u201csecond bite at the cherry to the Board of Immigration Appeals, where 99.9% of the 90% lose.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence required by an applicant is often impossible to produce, says Oretskin. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s report, it did not happen. If you are attacked in El Salvador, the gang will say: \u2018Go to the doctor and we\u2019ll kill you\u2019. We have reports of doctors in cahoots with gangs.\u201d</p> <p>Occasional successes are usually among Africans. Oretskin shows a wedding photo of one client, from Cameroon, permitted to stay after being kept in a gym in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez for three weeks, \u201cand staying at my house when she had nowhere else to go\u201d.</p> <p>What sets Trump apart, even in an environment systematically stacked against refugees, is the brutality of the manner in which rules applied. Former secretaries of homeland security, she says, \u201chad some idea of what cannot be done because it is illegal. But the people there now are there just because someone has to be. We do not even have due process, let alone justice.\u201d</p> <p>Night is eerie in the ecological park at Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, where the Rio Grande is shallow enough to wade to Texas. Many do it to surrender to the Border Patrol and apply for asylum, but as \u201cmetering\u201d limits the numbers and the wait lengthens, so the temptation rises to slip across illegally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1398b042b7c14d0aaa20ceaf1e6a2d34a368c421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1398b042b7c14d0aaa20ceaf1e6a2d34a368c421/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants from Guatemala cross the Rio Bravo river to enter the US illegally in El Paso, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants from Guatemala cross the Rio Bravo river to enter the US illegally in El Paso, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charly and Loreley, a father and daughter from Cameroon, have travelled on foot, by ship and bus, via Nigeria, Brazil, Ecuador and Central America, paying $6,000 to smugglers. </p> <p>Charly, a schoolteacher, says his community was continually harassed by militias of the French-speaking government, until one raid last year incinerated dozens of houses, and he was arrested, detained and tortured.</p> <p>\u201cThis cannot be the end of our long road: lavatories that leak into the ground, rubbish piling up that no one collects,\u201d he reflects.</p> <p>Not all migrants want to cross. Some are stung by experiences on the other side, others just tired of waiting.</p> <p>On the border\u2019s far western edge, Tijuana has become home to thousands of people who once intended to cross, but have remained. </p> <p>Robenson Metellus is among the hundreds who arrived from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, having travelled through Belize, Guatemala and Mexico only to be refused asylum in the US. Rather than return, he proceeded from the Casa del Migrante shelter to selling souvenirs to tourists.</p> <p>After a year, Robenson got a job in a coffee house and by night started a food delivery service \u2013 Mexican and \u201csoul food\u201d. He is now arranging for a sister and son to join him from Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>Robenson is part of a singularly successful assimilation, says the city\u2019s prosecutor, Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lvarez: \u201cThey\u2019ve been largely welcome; people find them interesting, and admire their work ethic. Do you know how many Haitians I\u2019ve indicted on a serious felony since they arrived? Zero.\u201d</p> <p>At the Zacazonapan bar in the red light district of Tijuana, thick with marijuana smoke and packed with Tijuaneros<em> </em>plus gringos in town for cheap drink, a Norte\u00f1o band is playing. \u201cResistencia Migrante\u201d was formed in the Espacio Migrante shelter.

We are survivors.\u201d</p> <p>In Tijuana, lawyers and volunteers are mostly concerned with what Nicole Ramos, at the Al Otro Lado migrant resource centre, calls \u201ctrying to get the US authorities to abide by their own laws, which they don\u2019t\u201d.

He crossed, was again deported, and returned to Honduras \u2013 for good, he thought. \u201cBut then the MS-13 informed me: \u2018We\u2019re having your daughter\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Milson, from Honduras, sits with his 14-year-old daughter, Loany, on the reedy riverbank beside the bridge connecting Matamoros, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, with downtown Brownsville, Texas, across the Rio Grande. On the far reach \u2013 a few yards but another world away \u2013 is a vast tent (officially a \u201csoft-sided facility\u201d) erected to cope with the sheer numbers seeking asylum in the US. In a few weeks\u2019 time, on the date stipulated on their \u201cnotice to appear\u201d document, the people staying here will have their \u201ccredible fear interview\u201d by video link. On the Mexican side, clinging to the bridge like barnacles, are hundreds of smaller tents, where roughly 1,000 people are gathered for safety, in fear of the mafia that has kidnapped, murdered or \u201cdisappeared\u201d hundreds of migrants over the past decade. It is a tent city where, says Milson, \u201ctime passes very, very slowly\u201d. Almost all are from Central America. Upriver at Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, about 250 people are encamped in the ecological park, staring across at the lights of Del Rio, Texas. Most are from Cameroon, Angola or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Further west, at Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a mix of Cubans, Central Americans, a Ugandan and an Indian kill the endless time in the yard of a Methodist-run shelter. On the border\u2019s far western edge, in Tijuana, Haitians trade on the streets \u2013 a community of hundreds who came to cross, but remained in Mexico. Ten years ago, most people trying to cross into the US from these various places were Mexicans, in flight from poverty or violence.More recently, though, there had been a lull, with Mexicans nowhere to be seen at some crossing points. But 2019 figures show a renewed rise in Mexican asylum seekers, as the narcotraffic cycle of violence returns to record levels. Roughly half the asylum-seekers on the border are now Mexican. As the migration crisis on the US-Mexican border becomes a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe and the centrepiece of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, one thing is clear to those who have supported migrants over decades: the world has converged here. Such are the historical and geopolitical layers of migration to the busiest border in the world, gateway to the globally ubiquitous American dream \u2013 a dream now twisting into a nightmare. Woody Guthrie wrote his song Deportee \u2013 about migrants working and dying in America\u2019s deserts \u2013 in 1948. It remains resonant, but the cast has changed. Mass migrations began with poor Mexicans crossing to work in America\u2019s farms, and continued with the bracero programme \u2013 a Spanish term for a labourer \u2013 initiated in 1942, which gave limited access to American jobs. The scheme ended in 1964, yet vast numbers of Mexicans continued to cross, legally and illegally. During the 80s, when civil wars erupted across Central America, tens of thousands tried to cross, many finding a place in the US thanks to the \u201csanctuary\u201d movement, which gave a path to legality. All the while millions of Mexicans came to the border not to cross but to live on it, in maquiladora assembly plants, producing goods exported duty-free to the US. From 2006, as the cartel wars devoured Mexico, more fled, seeking safety in the north. The demographics changed again. Methodist pastor Juan Fierro Garc\u00eda, who runs the shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, says: \u201cMore people than ever are on the move from generalised violence all over the world, seeking safe places for themselves and their children. And if anyone thinks this is going to stop, think again \u2013 this is just the beginning.\u201d Policy of deterrence The Trump administration has met this surge in arrivals with a policy of deterrence based on fear and brutality. The separation of children from their parents for incarceration outraged the world. The policy was ruled illegal by US courts and abandoned, though hundreds of children remain separated after their parents were deported. Internal documentation leaked from US Customs and Border Protection shows full knowledge of the traumatic affects of child separation. Unaccompanied minors crossing the border continue to be detained in appalling conditions. In December, ProPublica published CCTV footage that appears to show a Guatemalan teenager left to die in a concrete cell. An internal report from last July, seen by the Guardian and written by Jennifer Costello, the inspector general of homeland security, to acting director Kevin McAleenan, warned that \u201cat-risk populations are subject to overcrowding and prolonged detention\u201d. But Trump intends to expand the number of those detained rather than deported under migrant protection protocols (MPP). Under MPP, non-Mexicans from Spanish-speaking countries cannot remain in the US to await their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview, as is mandated under the 1939 Montevideo treaty on asylum. They must instead wait on the Mexican side, with the result that 57,000 asylum seekers, mostly from Central America, are now encamped south of the border in unsanitary conditions, prey to kidnap and extortion. Under another policy, called \u201cmetering\u201d, daily asylum applications are limited, so that unofficial waiting lists, thousands-long, are drawn up on the other side. The Trump administration announced in January that it plans to extend the MPP to Portuguese-speaking Brazilian asylum seekers. The policies are \u201cworking\u201d: US Customs and Border Protection report that the number of arrests for illegal crossings fell 75% from May to November last year, from 132,000 to 33,510. The reason is simple: word reaching the Mexican side of how appalling conditions are. \u2018The police and gangs are friends\u2019 The chapel at the Methodist Buen Pastor shelter in Ju\u00e1rez has become a dormitory for young mothers and children, among them Marisela del Carmen Espinosa, who lays her seven-year-old son, Diego, on a blanket; the child is running a fever. Marisela fled El Salvador when the MS-13 gang demanded she join them \u2013 the problem being that Diego\u2019s father was among them. \u201cThey came to my house, armed, saying they needed me to do \u2018tasks\u2019 for them, and if I didn\u2019t they\u2019d kill me and the boy,\u201d she says. Marisela has spent the past year on \u201ctrucks and railway cars, crossing Mexico\u201d, paying $8,000 (\u00a36,211) to coyotes and other people smugglers. To her horror, Diego\u2019s father has traced her to Ju\u00e1rez, \u201cand I\u2019m scared when I go out for food, because he said his contacts here would take our son and kill me. I know that the police and gangs are friends \u2013 if I go to them for help, I\u2019ll be killed.\u201d In the men\u2019s dorm, Evian Mvouba, from DRC, prepares to cross and make his asylum claim. He stands a better chance than his Central American companions since MPP does not apply to Africans. But he does fall under the \u201cmetering\u201d system, and more than 2,000 people are ahead of him on the list. Evian\u2019s village was attacked by government forces 18 months ago. He has since journeyed through Angola, Brazil, Colombia and Central America, with no word of many of his family members. \u201cIt is limbo,\u201d he says, \u201cnot knowing where I live, and whether they are alive. Most of my fellow Africans have moved on, and a few have been successful because they are politically persecuted \u2013 more than the people here from Guatemala and Honduras.\u201d In all these shelters the Cubans look different \u2013 better clad and fed, escaping not violence or desperation, but a regime they fear or despise. Pedro Ru\u00edz Tamayo is an opposition leader, educated and erudite. \u201cYou\u2019ll not find a Cuban in Ju\u00e1rez who supports the regime,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you\u2019ll not find many who contest it. They just want to try their luck in the US.\u201d Pedro commutes between the shelter and an emerging \u201cLittle Havana\u201d in Ju\u00e1rez, consisting of people waiting to cross or refused asylum and returned. Ariel Busquet kneads burritos in the Llenadora caf\u00e9. He was number 13,527 on the waiting list to cross. After hearing from a friend who returned following three months\u2019 incarceration on the other side, he elected to remain in Ju\u00e1rez. \u201cWe Cubans left our country to work for a wage \u2013 something we cannot do there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here in Ju\u00e1rez! My relatives call themselves Cuban-Americans; I call myself a Cuban-Mexican.\u201d In El Paso, Ruben Garc\u00eda has seen each migration wave arrive since 1978, when he first opened Annunciation House, which is now a network of shelters for migrants. The shelters have been vital to current efforts to abate the suffering. Without radical Catholicism of the kind that inspires Garc\u00eda, far less would happen on the migrants\u2019 behalf. To overlook the faith of those who do this is to not accurately report what is happening. \u201cForty years ago, a group of us started this work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe made a decision to offer hospitality to undocumented migrants. \u201cBut we also talked to reporters, universities, hoping we could bring about change for the better. And 40 years later, we have Mr Trump as president and below him very capable officials whose sole task is to make life unbearable for refugees. It makes me think of Lazarus, restored to life by Jesus, who turned to the community and said: \u2018Unbind him\u2019. In this situation, it is the refugees who unbind us, sharing their stories, their struggles. There\u2019ve been days when we\u2019ve received hundreds of people.\u201d One night, up to 1,000 migrants were released on to the streets around El Paso bus station. TV coverage showed Garc\u00eda, arms wide, saying to a group: \u201cBienvenidos!\u201d \u2013 welcome \u2013 and it seemed the first kind gesture they had encountered in months. Garc\u00eda has seen generations of migrants \u201cflee death squads in the 1980s, when war was war, and you knew who the sides were, to this new kind of undeclared war, where no one knows the rules, and you live in a state of permanent insecurity. Plus drought and crop failure. \u201cYou either give up your children to those realities back there, or you pay the coyote, subjecting yourself to debt bondage and whatever risk, and leave.\u201d Flawed system Migrants need \u201cguidance through a system designed to fail\u201d, says Molly Molloy, up the road in Las Cruces. Molloy worked as an archivist at New Mexico State University, but has retired to work with migrants, something she first did in the 80s. She is now a \u201cparalegal, translator and researcher\u201d for immigration lawyer Nancy Oretskin. In the civil wars in the 1980s migrants were mainly people \u201cwho had never been to school or left their hamlet\u201d and, with successive waves of migrants, blocks have been laid in response, says Molloy. \u201cSeptember 11 2001 was a dividing line, after large numbers, mainly Mexican men, fled poverty as the result of the North American Free Trade Agreement and clearance of subsistence farms. Then came two further \u2018push factors\u2019: Mexicans fleeing violence after 2006, and the great recession, after which there were just fewer jobs for these people.\u201d And now \u201cclimate change, and in Central America, violence of gangs that were initially deported from Los Angeles. A level of violence more extreme, on a daily, monthly basis \u2013 more people killed \u2013 even than during the civil wars\u201d. Oretskin\u2019s family were migrants. \u201cI was raised by crazy Jewish entrepreneurs \u2026 raised to think: \u2018don\u2019t you ever forget\u2019.\u201d Handling 10-15 asylum cases a year, she works in the immigration courts \u201cwhere 90% lose\u201d, affording a \u201csecond bite at the cherry to the Board of Immigration Appeals, where 99.9% of the 90% lose.\u201d The evidence required by an applicant is often impossible to produce, says Oretskin. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s report, it did not happen. If you are attacked in El Salvador, the gang will say: \u2018Go to the doctor and we\u2019ll kill you\u2019. We have reports of doctors in cahoots with gangs.\u201d Occasional successes are usually among Africans. Oretskin shows a wedding photo of one client, from Cameroon, permitted to stay after being kept in a gym in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez for three weeks, \u201cand staying at my house when she had nowhere else to go\u201d. What sets Trump apart, even in an environment systematically stacked against refugees, is the brutality of the manner in which rules applied. Former secretaries of homeland security, she says, \u201chad some idea of what cannot be done because it is illegal. But the people there now are there just because someone has to be. We do not even have due process, let alone justice.\u201d Night is eerie in the ecological park at Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, where the Rio Grande is shallow enough to wade to Texas. Many do it to surrender to the Border Patrol and apply for asylum, but as \u201cmetering\u201d limits the numbers and the wait lengthens, so the temptation rises to slip across illegally. Charly and Loreley, a father and daughter from Cameroon, have travelled on foot, by ship and bus, via Nigeria, Brazil, Ecuador and Central America, paying $6,000 to smugglers. Charly, a schoolteacher, says his community was continually harassed by militias of the French-speaking government, until one raid last year incinerated dozens of houses, and he was arrested, detained and tortured. \u201cThis cannot be the end of our long road: lavatories that leak into the ground, rubbish piling up that no one collects,\u201d he reflects. Not all migrants want to cross. Some are stung by experiences on the other side, others just tired of waiting. On the border\u2019s far western edge, Tijuana has become home to thousands of people who once intended to cross, but have remained. Robenson Metellus is among the hundreds who arrived from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, having travelled through Belize, Guatemala and Mexico only to be refused asylum in the US. Rather than return, he proceeded from the Casa del Migrante shelter to selling souvenirs to tourists. After a year, Robenson got a job in a coffee house and by night started a food delivery service \u2013 Mexican and \u201csoul food\u201d. He is now arranging for a sister and son to join him from Port-au-Prince. Robenson is part of a singularly successful assimilation, says the city\u2019s prosecutor, Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lvarez: \u201cThey\u2019ve been largely welcome; people find them interesting, and admire their work ethic. Do you know how many Haitians I\u2019ve indicted on a serious felony since they arrived? Zero.\u201d At the Zacazonapan bar in the red light district of Tijuana, thick with marijuana smoke and packed with Tijuaneros plus gringos in town for cheap drink, a Norte\u00f1o band is playing. \u201cResistencia Migrante\u201d was formed in the Espacio Migrante shelter. On keyboard is Oliv\u00e9r, who spent two years travelling from El Salvador and seven months in Tijuana. He has given up trying to cross the border; his flight from gang threats was insufficient for entry to the US, so he tried to cross illegally but was caught. \u201cWe\u2019ve abandoned the American dream as a nightmare,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s OK here. We are survivors.\u201d In Tijuana, lawyers and volunteers are mostly concerned with what Nicole Ramos, at the Al Otro Lado migrant resource centre, calls \u201ctrying to get the US authorities to abide by their own laws, which they don\u2019t\u201d. Though, she adds, \u201cterrifying numbers of our people just disappear in this city\u201d. State neglect The Mexican state is nowhere to be seen in all this. Grupo Beta, an organisation formed by the Mexican government to help migrants, has been withdrawn from some areas after allegedly taking bribes to move people up the waiting list. Almost all in Matamoros are from Central America, awaiting their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview on the other side. Conditions here are so bad that migrants blocked the bridge to Brownsville in protest in October. Milson and Loany sit by the river. Lack of fresh water makes them tempted to wash, with others, among the same eddies and whirlpools that drowned another father and daughter recently as they tried to swim to the far bank. Milson and Loany come from Tegucigalpa. This is Milson\u2019s third attempt to cross, and we joke about a hit song by Los Tigres del Norte, \u201cTres Veces Mojado\u201d \u2013 three times wet (from swimming the Rio Grande). Milson made it in 2014, but was deported. Before his second attempt, he was kidnapped by a gang, Los Zetas, and held in the desert for eight days. He is coy about how he was released, suggesting payment by a cousin in St Louis. \u201cThey told me that if I ever came back, they\u2019d kill me,\u201d he adds. He crossed, was again deported, and returned to Honduras \u2013 for good, he thought. \u201cBut then the MS-13 informed me: \u2018We\u2019re having your daughter\u2019. I said: \u2018Come on my love, we\u2019re leaving.\u2019\u201d Father and daughter were separated for a week on the US side. \u201cThey kept us in the heat by day, and as cold as the air-conditioning would go by night, with filthy blankets and toilets,\u201d says Loany. \u201cWhen we asked them to turn the cold air off, they refused\u201d. Milson is clear. \u201cI know some of the parents whose children have left [to go to the US alone]. They\u2019re devastated, whether they knew or not. I\u2019d never let Loany go without me \u2013 that\u2019s why we are here, so she can be safe with me. It has to be legal, and together or not at all.\u201d Loany concurs: \u201cI\u2019m staying with my Papa.\u201d The conviviality in such extreme hardship is remarkable; there is almost no friction. They line up for breakfast in respect of priority for women and children, served by a group called Team Brownsville from across the river, founded by Michael Benavides, a former bomb disposal soldier, now Mormon missionary. \u201cPeople disappear. It\u2019s so scary,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll agree to meet someone next day, come back, ask around, and no one knows where they are. They cannot do everything to defend against the mafia, but they look after each other. Watch them\u201d, he says, as volunteers hand out plates of beans, \u201cnot a push or shove\u201d. Benavides has the names of two teenagers who died in US government custody on two crosses, tattooed above his heart. Team Brownsville started out cooking in a tiny kitchen a block from the border, then expanded \u2013 raising money and buying tents, driven by a belief, explains Benavides: \u201cthat this is what America should be. My grandparents came from Mexico, and raised me to think of America as a country of compassion and open arms to those in need. This is my idea of patriotism.\u201d The operation feeds more than 600 people, \u201cwe just need to keep raising the funds to keep it going,\u201d he says. Lining up for breakfast are Jocelyne Flores and her daughter, Imena, four, sent back under migrant protection protocols. Pregnant Jocelyne left San Salvador after Imena\u2019s father \u2013 who beat her - threatened to kill them both. It has been explained to her that domestic violence is no longer grounds for asylum, but Jocelyne is confident they\u2019ll make an exception. Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar takes her under her wing and makes an arrangement with the local hospital. Glady runs the list of those waiting to cross. \u201cLa lista, la lista! - how I hate it\u201d, she says, as they call out names of those due to cross at 4am. Fork lightning and rain break over the camp. Night falls, and a group sits among the puddles, as torrential water lashes the concrete, singing \u2013 they all know the lyrics \u2013 a hit by Tropa Vallenata, called \u201cThe Roads of Life\u201d: \u201cLos caminos de la vida / No son como yo pensaba Como los imaginaba / No son como yo cre\u00eda\u201d (\u2018The roads of the life / They\u2019re not as I thought / Not as I imagined them / Not as I believed\u2019)",

      "bodyText": "Almost half of new jobs in England in the last decade were in London and the south-east, despite only a third of the population living in that region, according to a new report. Research by the thinktank IPPR North shows that 47% of new jobs between September 2009 and September 2019 went to the southern regions. Across England, which is home to 56 million people, the number of jobs increased by 3.8m over the last decade, from 26.7m to 30.5m. In London and the south-east, the number of jobs rose by 1.8m, from 9.2m to nearly 11m. Office-based professional and administrative roles, as well as those in accommodation and food service, were among the kinds of jobs that increased. In comparison, the north-east and north-west of England, and Yorkshire and the Humber had 17% of the country\u2019s new jobs. In those regions, which contain 28% of the population, the number rose from 7.2m in 2009 to 7.8m in 2019. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, analysed by IPPR, also showed differences between northern regions in the kind of jobs available. In the north-west, the highest number of new jobs were \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical\u201d, while in the north-east, as these types of jobs fell over the last decade, the highest increase was in administrative and support service roles. As a whole, the north-east, which also has the lowest average disposable income of all English regions, saw only 1% of the country\u2019s total job increases. Londoners were found not to be benefiting from regional economic divides, however, with those living in the capital facing some of least affordable housing in the country, and among the highest rates of income inequality. A recent report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the city had the highest rate of poverty, with 28% of people trapped in relative poverty after housing costs. Following his landslide victory in last year\u2019s general election, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, set \u201clevelling up\u201d regional divides at the top of his government\u2019s agenda. However, Luke Raikes, a senior research fellow at the thinktank, said the findings showed that the centralisation of power in Westminster had held all of England back. \u201cLevelling up should mean opening the door for all of England to benefit from devolution, while also letting areas that have devolution take on more,\u201d said Raikes. \u201cThis parliament must be the devolution parliament. It is time to overturn the centralisation that\u2019s let towns, cities and regions fall into decline. The government must give places the power and resources they need, to adapt to the decades of change that lie ahead.\u201d The metro mayor of North of Tyne, Jamie Driscoll, said: \u201cIPPR\u2019s new report underlines the failure of the pre-devolution economic model.

Earlier this month, ONS data showed that average real wages \u2013 which take account of inflation \u2013 had risen above their pre-financial crisis level for the first time. Weekly pay excluding bonuses was at \u00a3474 in the year to December, moving just \u00a31 above the peak of \u00a3473 recorded in March 2008.

The benders and breakdowns of celebrities, their horrified distress signals as their lives are taken over by their public persona, are well known.

To take kindness seriously, we need to confront not only the machinery that loops us into sadomasochistic frenzies for the purposes of generating profitable flows of attention and engagement. We also need to take seriously our own pleasure in, and fascination with, personal destruction.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Seymour is a political activist and author.

Yet if all of us are now celebrities \u2013 or at least all of us on social media \u2013 then that cruelty is also masochism. The thrill of the chase is accompanied by the thrill of realising that we are all at risk, all potential targets. Today\u2019s bloodhound is tomorrow\u2019s fox. So the more we extol the virtues we find wanting in others as we take them down on spurious grounds, from Natalie Wynn to Jameela Jamil, the more we are gleefully setting ourselves up for the same fall. This is why the ritual calls for kindness that follow tragedies like Flack\u2019s suicide are ineffectual, and as hollow as new year pledges of sobriety and clean living. To take kindness seriously, we need to confront not only the machinery that loops us into sadomasochistic frenzies for the purposes of generating profitable flows of attention and engagement. We also need to take seriously our own pleasure in, and fascination with, personal destruction. \u2022 Richard Seymour is a political activist and author. His latest book is The Twittering Machine",

      "bodyText": "Arrest warrants have been issued for Australians accused of fighting for or supporting Islamic State, including women held in Syria\u2019s al-Hawl camp. As pressure builds on Australia to join other governments in repatriating women and children held in the massive, squalid camp, the Australian federal police have announced that they have obtained 42 arrest warrants for Australian men and women who have travelled to Syria \u201cfor alleged criminal offences against Australian law\u201d. Currently, 19 women and 47 children, most of them under five, are held in the al-Hawl camp for family members of Isis fighters. Many of the children, living in tents, are suffering malnutrition and other illnesses. At least one Australian toddler has contracted severe frostbite, and will likely lose the fingers on her left hand as a result of the freezing cold. The AFP has not provided details on how many of the Australian women have had arrest warrants issued against them. \u201cAll of the women who are suspected to have travelled to the conflict zone are under investigation for a range of offences,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAll Australians believed to have travelled to the conflict zone are being investigated and the AFP will consider all relevant offences, capable of prosecution in Australia, in that investigation.\u201d Some of the women currently trapped in the camp are expected to face charges of travelling to a declared zone and supporting or joining a terrorist group. Family members and human rights groups have been pushing for the Australian government to repatriate its citizens out of the al-Hawl camp as conditions there deteriorate, arguing that many of the women in the camp had been coerced or tricked into travelling to Syria, and that the children held there now for a year were innocent. But the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has said some of the Australian women in the camp were \u201chardcore\u201d and \u201chave the potential and capacity to come back here and cause a mass casualty event\u201d. The issuing of the warrants may pave the way for repatriation. The AFP said warrants will only be served if the women return to Australia. The women in al-Hawl have consistently said they would cooperate with police and the Australian criminal justice system, even volunteering to submit to control orders. Across al-Hawl, where more than 60,000 women and children are guarded by Kurdish forces, conditions have grown steadily worse as Syria endures a freezing winter. Food runs short, violence including murder is common, children die regularly from illness, and others have been injured when tents catch fire. Many observers have raised concerns it is acting as an incubator for extremism and, if left to languish, a potential site of resurgence for Isis. The youngest Australian child held in al-Hawl is less than three months old, born on 30 November inside the camp. Australian children in the camp are suffering developmental disorders, malnutrition, chronic diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma.

      "bodyText": "The Tamil family from Biloela in Queensland fighting against being sent to Sri Lanka by the Australian government have made their case to the court that a visa application for their youngest daughter must be processed. Tamil asylum seekers Priya and Nades and their daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa have been detained on Christmas Island since late last year awaiting the hearing. Under the Migration Act, people who arrive in Australia by boat cannot apply for a visa while in Australia. Even though Tharunicaa was born in Australia, she is given the same visa status as her parents. But the immigration minister has the power to \u201clift the bar\u201d to allow her to apply for a visa. In July 2017, by a ministerial determination from the minister for home affairs, Peter Dutton, the bar was lifted on 7,500 people who arrived in Australia by boat between 2008 and 2013. Lawyers acting for Tharunicaa argued the bar was also lifted for her at that time, even though she was just one month old and Priya\u2019s application was under review. Her lawyers argue this means a visa application in September 2019 must be processed. The family\u2019s barrister Angel Aleksov told the court on Friday that Tharunicaa\u2019s application for asylum was not part of her mother\u2019s process and should be considered separately. \u201cShe was not a participant in her parents\u2019 visa applications. She was just a stranger to that case,\u201d he said. He argued the wording of the determination left it open for Tharunicaa to lodge an application after the 1 October 2017 deadline. Government barrister Stephen Lloyd said one \u201cannoying\u201d problem identified by the department in 2017 was that many of those affected were \u201chaving babies during this period of time\u201d, and those babies were also classified as unauthorised maritime arrivals, meaning that the determination had to apply to them, too. \u201cThe child might not even be born by July 2017, it will apply to a [visa] application by a person as long as the application is made prior to the parent\u2019s application being refused and finally determined,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately we accepted there is a future element of this operation.\u201d The family\u2019s lawyer, Carina Ford, said on Friday that the way the determination was written was ambiguous. \u201cBoth sides would agree it\u2019s not entirely clear in the way it is written, and that\u2019s what the argument is.\u201d The hearing will continue on a second ground on Tuesday, looking at whether Dutton personally considered lifting the bar, and whether the process was fair. It was delayed after the minister\u2019s lawyers asked to put on more evidence. Ford said her visit to Christmas Island last week was a \u201cpretty emotional\u201d. \u201cThe climate alone makes it very draining and difficult to do things, but the conditions in which they are living \u2013 it\u2019s not great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really run down.

The next day he squeezed Millane\u2019s body into a suitcase and buried her in the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area 45 minutes west of New Zealand\u2019s largest city.

      "bodyText": "Detective Inspector Scott Beard, who led the the inquiry into the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane, described the horrific narrative of the case as \u201clike reading a novel\u201d; and on Friday the drama that has played out in New Zealand over the past 15 months reached its grim conclusion. For the 28-year-old New Zealand man who strangled Millane there was life behind bars with a non-parole period of 17 years. By then he will be a middle-aged man. There will also be intensive psychology and rehabilitation for the pathological liar labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d in his sentencing report, a man estranged from his family, and who lived out a fantasy existence on Tinder, culminating in the \u201cdepraved\u201d murder of Millane. His identity remains suppressed, a not uncommon practice in the country. The reason for the name suppression is also suppressed by court order. The man\u2019s demeanour throughout the trial was one of indifference, which broke only briefly on Friday when the Millane family read out their victim impact statements via videolink from Britain. Then, the killer lowered his head into his hands, massaged his forehead, and began to cry. He has maintained his innocence throughout. But the real life sentence is the one that will be borne by Millane\u2019s family. On Friday morning her brother Declan told the court that the ordeal had left them broken and destroyed. \u201cI will simply miss my sister for the rest of my life and this pain will never go away,\u201d he said, using tissues to wipe the tears from his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to carry on life as normal after the destruction of our family \u2026 how do you carry on?\u201d he said, addressing his sister\u2019s killer. Millane, 22, from Essex, arrived in New Zealand in November 2018 as part of a round-the-world trip. She died by manual strangulation on 2 December during sex in the man\u2019s hotel apartment in central Auckland. The pair had met on the dating app Tinder and, according to Millane\u2019s excited text messages to a friend: they \u201cclicked\u201d. After Millane\u2019s death, the man watched hardcore pornography and took intimate photographs of her corpse, before embarking on another Tinder date with a different woman at a different Auckland bar. The next day he squeezed Millane\u2019s body into a suitcase and buried her in the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area 45 minutes west of New Zealand\u2019s largest city. He also purchased cleaning products and attempted to systematically hide and destroy evidence, as well as Googling \u201crigor mortis\u201d \u201cflesh-eating birds\u201d and \u201chottest fire\u201d. Millane\u2019s remains were found by police a week after she died, when her killer blamed rough sex gone wrong \u2013 a defence that later failed him in court. It was a week spent \u201cin a living nightmare\u201d for the Millane family, and a week in which New Zealanders \u2013 including the prime minister \u2013 hoped and prayed for Millane\u2019s safe return. Mass candlelight vigils, thousands strong, were held in her honour, one of which father David Millane attended. Mother Gillian Millane, who told the court on Friday that losing Grace had made her suicidal, said she could not, and had no interest in, ever forgiving her daughter\u2019s killer \u2013 a daughter she described as her \u201cvery best friend\u201d. \u201cNo life sentence you receive today will match my life sentence without my Grace,\u201d Gillian said. \u201cYou took it upon yourself to murder my beautiful Grace \u2013 an innocent girl. You ripped a hole in our hearts.\u201d Just as the police who worked on the case for 15 months struggled to believe it at times, so did New Zealanders. The case shook the country, and led many of its citizens \u2013 women, mostly \u2013 to question the assumption that it is a safe place. It also left some young women openly fearful of dating apps and casual sex, and circumspect about how bold \u2013 or vulnerable \u2013 they really can be. Justice Simon Moore, who oversaw the murder trial, drove home this point, saying Millane\u2019s age, diminutive stature and status as a lone traveller in a foreign country made her unquestionably \u201cvulnerable\u201d in his eyes \u2013 a state her killer took advantage of. Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey described the Millane murder as \u201cunique\u201d in New Zealand, in its \u201cpersonalised\u201d method, morbid aftermath and the wider ramifications that tore through the community. \u201cThis case has had a profound impact on young women in New Zealand and how safe they feel with men, or not.\u201d Beard said he had never before worked on a case that had such international impact, and said the \u201crough sex\u201d defence used by the killer \u201crepeatedly re-victimises the victim, and their family\u201d. It had been cruel and unfair that Millane\u2019s sexual history and private life were exposed before the court, the public, and her parents, who were in attendance for the full three weeks in November, he said. \u201cStrangling someone for five to 10 minutes until they die is not rough sex,\u201d said Beard after the sentencing. Justice Moore was similarly unequivocal, labelling the crime as \u201ccold-blooded\u201d, \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201cdepraved\u201d. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim\u201d Moore said. Back home in Essex, the Millane family are now slowly inching towards closure, and rebuilding lives in which at least three members have revealed shredded mental and physical health. Victoria Millane \u2013 Grace\u2019s sister-in-law \u2013 often visits the graveyard where Millane is buried. Victoria married Grace\u2019s brother Michael last year, in a ceremony where Grace was meant to be her bridesmaid. Instead, Victoria told the court, a photo of Grace stood in her place beside the altar. \u201cGrace became the little sister I always longed for,\u201d Victoria told the court via videolink, sobbing. \u201cI often dream about Grace and seeing her again, hoping I will wake from this nightmare.\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d she said, addressing Millane\u2019s killer, and staring into the Skype camera, \u201ccan never be forgiven.\u201d.",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many of those advocating abstention are close to despair and admit they have been over-optimistic about the change that can be achieved under the uncompromising supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p> \n<p>Yet some figures in government are nervous, fearing that the guardian council may have shot itself in the foot and depressed the turnout in urban areas by going so much further than normal in debarring so many prominent reformists.</p> \n<p>As a result, patriotic calls to vote to defeat the west came from every layer of Iranian government \u2013 military, political and clerical.</p> \n<p>Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to the president, Hassan Rouhani, said that however angry people might feel, abstention \u201cwill only please Iran\u2019s enemies and lead to increased sanctions, an increased probability of military invasion, larger budgets for hired anti-Iranian media, a decline in national resilience and reduced political bargaining power\u201d.</p> \n<p>Khamenei himself warned that \u201cfriends and foe are watching out for the election results\u201d.

Already available in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth, the app promises \u201ca safe, reliable and value-for-money way to get around\u201d, according to Lyn Ma, Didi Australia\u2019s general manager. That \u201cvalue-for-money\u201d statement will certainly be true in the first few weeks following the app\u2019s launch \u2013 it is offering riders who sign up before launch a 50% discount on their first four weeks of rides, up to the value of $1200. Didi is one of four major players in the Australian ride hailing market, alongside American giant Uber, Indian-based Ola and Estonian company Bolt, which was previously known as Taxify. All four apps vary slightly in their base pricing, ride offerings and compensation for drivers. But for consumers and drivers, there\u2019s not a clear answer for which app is \u201cbest\u201d.

In a speech delivered to the Australian Education Union on Friday, Plibersek warned both the government and internal critics arguing for lower social spending that \u201cthe fight for fair school funding is not over\u201d and claimed that \u201cvisible inequality\u201d in facilities suggests Australians care more about some children than others. The union\u2019s federal conference also heard from Adam Bandt, in his first major outing on education since he became Greens leader, who argued that public school fees of up to $5,000 should be abolished because the state system should be free. In her speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Plibersek thanked the union for campaigning for Labor at the 2019 election, acknowledging that \u201cunfortunately [Labor was not] given the opportunity to implement our vision \u2013 at least not yet\u201d. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean our principles have changed,\u201d the shadow minister for education and training said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean our hunger to prosecute them has diminished.\u201d Labor\u2019s pledge to deliver $14bn more over 10 years to public schools was one of its biggest points of difference with the Coalition at the last election, although internal critics of Labor\u2019s policy agenda argue that big spending promises failed to translate into votes and pushed the opposition towards increasing tax. Plibersek warned that her \u201chunger is as strong as it\u2019s ever been\u201d and that the ambition of all Australian schools reaching 100% of the schooling resource standard \u201cshould sit at the heart of education policy\u201d. \u201cThe government likes to say that it\u2019s now committed to sector-blind, needs-based funding, or that its policies are neutral, or that it\u2019s drained disagreement from the sector,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true.

In his speech, Bandt rebadged the Greens\u2019 policy of \u201cgenuinely free education\u201d in public schools and TAFE as part of its proposed \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d. Although public education was free \u201cin a broad sense\u201d, over decades there had been \u201ccreeping cost-shift from the state, pushing [the cost] back onto parents\u201d, Bandt said.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Friday\u2019s blog: It was another evening of late-breaking news. Here\u2019s a summary as our live politics coverage ends for the night: House members were reportedly warned by intelligence officials last week that Russia is interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get Trump re-elected, the New York Times and the Washington Post reported. The account Trump heard of the briefing reportedly enraged him, prompting him to lash out at his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who had expected to stay in the position. Instead, Trump replaced Maguire with Richard Grenell, a hardcore Trump loyalist, the current US ambassador to Germany, and a person with no intelligence experience. One sign of how Grenell will operate in this role: one of his new senior advisers, in his new role as the top intelligence official for the Trump White House, is Kash Patel, a former Hill staffer who made his reputation as the lead author of a Republican report \u201cquestioning the conduct of FBI and DOJ officials investigating Russia\u2019s election interference,\u201d Politico reported. Also: among the new information reportedly shared with lawmakers at the House intelligence briefing: \u201cRussia intends to interfere with the ongoing Democratic primaries as well as the general election,\u201d the Times reported. Meanwhile: Democrats discussed what they will do if Bernie Sanders wins the most voters in the Democratic primary, but not an outright majority of votes, a contentious issue. Elizabeth Warren renewed her demand that Michael Bloomberg release former employees who sued him or his company from their non-disclosure agreements, so they can speak promptly and publicly about the behavior that prompted their lawsuits. At a rally in Colorado, Trump complained that Parasite, a South Korean film, had won the best picture Oscar. \u201cCan we get Gone with the Wind back. please?\u201d he asked. Elizabeth Warren is not done with her demans that Michael Bloomberg, billionaire former New York mayor and late entrant into the 2020 Democratic primary, release former employees who have brought lawsuits against Bloomberg and his company from their nondisclosure agreements. The goal, Warren has said: allowing women to talk candidly about the behavior that prompted the lawsuits, and ensuring transparency in the primary. As a Hill staffer, Kash Patel was the \u201clead author of a report questioning the conduct of FBI and DOJ officials investigating Russia\u2019s election interference,\u201d a report Republican lawmakers used to bolster claims the investigation was a plot against President Donald Trump. Since then, Patel has received a series of promotions. Most recently, he has been made a senior adviser to new acting Director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist with no background in intelligence or the armed services, Politico reports. By appointing Grennell the \u201cacting director,\u201d Trump is sidestepping the Senate confirmation process required to appoint a new director, a maneuver he has used repeatedly. Earlier today, the New York Times reported that \u201csome current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress.\u201d Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, speaking alongside the president at a rally for Trump supporters in Colorado Springs, is now attacking \u201cthe normalization of socialism by Bernie Sanders.\u201d Gardner, facing a rocky path to reelection this year, pledged to fight hard to keep Republican control of the Senate and the White House. \u201cThey want to take our guns. They want to take our healthcare. That\u2019s their platform,\u201d Gardner said of the Democratic Party. Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told the Washington Post that none of the Democratic presidential primary candidates should get the nomination with less than a majority of delegates. Reid was pushing back on \u201csuggestions from Sanders and his supporters that he should become the nominee if he finishes with a plurality lead ahead of the still large pack of candidates,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cReid even suggested that a group of moderate candidates, trailing Sanders overall, could assemble a coalition ahead of the Democratic convention in July in Milwaukee to hand the nomination to someone else.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has already been pushing to position himself as a candidate who could benefit from the support of other \u201cmoderate\u201d candidates like Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg in this situation, Politico reported earlier today. A group co-founded by Hollywood actor Eva Longoria and DNC Finance Chair Henry R. Mu\u00f1oz III has endorsed Joe Biden for president. A Democratic political strategist notes that Trump\u2019s praise at this Colorado Springs rally for Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican facing a tough reelection campaign, will likely be used in attack ads against him. \u201cCory was with us all the way. He didn\u2019t move, he didn\u2019t budge,\u201d Trump added later in the speech, saluting Gardner for voting against impeaching him, a vote that was reportedly a tough one for Gardner. President Trump is now at a rally in Colorado complaining that the Oscar for Best Picture went to Parasite, a film from South Korea, and complaining that the country has trade problems with South Korea. \u201cCan we get Gone with the Wind back please?\u201d Trump asked. John Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a prominent public critic of Donald Trump, weighs in on the significance of the new report about Trump being furious about an intelligence briefing for members of Congress that included the conclusion that Russia is still attempting to interfere in the 2020 election with the goal of supporting him. \u201cRussia intends to interfere with the ongoing Democratic primaries as well as the general election.\u201d That\u2019s key new information that House lawmakers heard during an intelligence briefing last week, according to the New York Times. The briefing, which reportedly angered the president, once again conveyed to lawmakers the conclusion from intelligence officials that Russia was interfering in the election with goal of electing Trump. Mike Bloomberg is quietly lobbying Democratic Party officials and donors allied with moderate opponents like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg to flip their allegiance to him \u2014and defeat Bernie Sanders \u2014 if Democrats fail to choose a presidential nominee during the first round of voting, Politico reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a presumptuous play for a candidate who hasn\u2019t yet won a delegate or even appeared on a ballot,\u201d Politico\u2019s David Siders writes. \u201cAnd it could also bring havoc to the convention, raising the prospect of party insiders delivering the nomination to a billionaire over a progressive populist.\u201d A heavily edited video posted by the Bloomberg campaign to Instagram on Thursday paints a flattering, and false, portrait of the former New York mayor\u2019s widely panned debate performance. My colleague Kari Paul reports on how tech companies are responding to this kind of misleading political content. Facebook and Instagram: nothing. Twitter: would be flagged as misleading... under a new policy that hasn\u2019t started yet. The Washington Post obtained a recording of a private speech in London at which the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that the United States desperately needs more immigrants to fuel its economy, a position starkly different from the senior White House adviser Stephen Miller and others who have pushed to reduce any kind of immigration. \u201cWe are desperate \u2013 desperate \u2013 for more people,\u201d Mulvaney said, according to the Post. \u201cWe are running out of people to fuel the economic growth that we\u2019ve had in our nation over the last four years. We need more immigrants.\u201d The Trump administration wants those immigrants to come in a \u201clegal fashion\u201d, Mulvaney said, according to the Post. House members were reportedly warned by intelligence officials last week that Russia is interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get Trump re-elected, mirroring the country\u2019s meddling in the 2016 race. The New York Times reports: The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant. During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that Mr. Trump has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans. That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter. The Washington Post reported earlier today about the confrontation between Trump and Maguire, but the content of the intelligence briefing was not previously known. Trump has repeatedly pushed back against the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 race to help him defeat Hillary Clinton. During the impeachment inquiry and trial, some of the president\u2019s allies tried to peddle the baseless conspiracy theory that it was actually Ukraine who meddled in the 2016 race. That claim was dismissed by Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia expert, as a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d pushed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said he would not yet pardon Roger Stone, his former associate who was sentenced to 40 months in prison today, and would instead wait for \u201cthe process to play out\u201d. But the president added he thinks Stone has a \u201cvery good chance of exoneration\u201d. While delivering Stone\u2019s sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson denounced Stone\u2019s actions and warned that his disregard for the truth represented \u201ca threat to the very foundation of this democracy\u201d. Trump reportedly lashed out against the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire last week, after one of his staffers privately testified to the House intelligence committee on election security. The president announced yesterday that Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany and a Trump loyalist, would replace Maguire. Nearly 20 million people, a new record for a Democratic primary debate, watched last night\u2019s event. That could be bad news for Mike Bloomberg, whose first debate performance was widely panned. Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Coming off her strong debate performance, Elizabeth Warren said her campaign has raised more than $5 million since she took the stage last night. Warren had set a goal of raising $7 million before Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses, and she is now raising that number to $12 million. But Warren is also attracting some criticism today for refusing to distance herself from a new super PAC supporting her candidacy. The Massachusetts senator said she would support all the candidates disavowing super PACs but would not be the sole opponent. (This comes after Warren previously said she would reject the groups\u2019 support.) Shortly after Roger Stone was sentenced today, senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that Trump \u201chas all the legal authority in the world to review this case.\u201d The tweet was read as a possible indication that Trump\u2019s congressional allies will not push back much if the president chooses to pardon his former associate. In contrast, House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said such a move would be a \u201cbreathtaking act of corruption.\u201d Trump reportedly lashed out last week against the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, because one of his staffers gave a classified briefing to the House intelligence committee. The Washington Post reports: Maguire had been considered a leading candidate to be nominated for the post of DNI, White House aides had said. But Trump\u2019s opinion shifted last week when he heard from a GOP ally that the intelligence official in charge of election security, who works for Maguire, gave a classified briefing last Thursday to the House Intelligence Committee on 2020 election security. It is unclear what the official, Shelby Pierson, specifically said at the briefing that angered Trump, but the president erroneously believed that she had given information exclusively to Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the committee chairman, and that the information would be helpful to Democrats if it were released publicly, the people familiar with the matter said. Schiff was the lead impeachment manager, or prosecutor, during Trump\u2019s Senate trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president was furious with Maguire and blamed him for the supposed transgression involving Pierson when the two met the next day. \u2018There was a dressing down\u2019 of Maguire, said one individual, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. \u2018That was the catalyst\u2019 that led to the sidelining of Maguire in favor of Grenell, the person said. Trump announced yesterday that Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany and a loyaly supporter of the president, would replace Maguire as acting DNI. However, Grenell made clear today that he would not be nominated for the permanent position: Trump once again segued away from celebrating the Hope for Prisoners graduates by lamenting his impeachment. The president acknowledged the graduates\u2019 road ahead would be difficult at times, and he could commiserate about having \u201cthose days.\u201d \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and they impeached me a few weeks ago,\u201d Trump said. While Trump was listing his perceived political enemies moments ago, someone in the crowd responded by yelling, \u201cLock \u2018em up!\u201d According to the pool report, that outburst came as the president was accusing officials like former FBI director James Comey of lying like Roger Stone -- even though Stone was charged and convicted of lying to Congress, unlike Comey. As a reminder, this Las Vegas event is meant to celebrate the commencement of graduates from a program aimed at helping former prisoners reenter society. Trump emphasized he would be monitoring Roger Stone\u2019s case closely and indicated he would later make a decision on a potential pardon. \u201cWe will watch the process and watch it very closely. And at some point I will make a determination,\u201d Trump said. However, the president also made clear he thought Stone had been treated unfairly in the trial. \u201cRoger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly. And this has not been a fair process,\u201d Trump said. Trump indicated that he would not pardon Roger Stone at this time because he wanted to see the case continue making its way through the courts if his former associate appeals the ruling. \u201cI am not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed to the president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want the process to play out. I think that\u2019s the best thing to do because I would love to see Roger exonerated.\u201d The president defended Stone, who was convicted of obstructing and lying to Congress and witness-tampering in the Russia investigation. \u201cThey say he lied. But other people lied too,\u201d Trump said before going on to bash a number of his perceived enemies, such as former FBI director James Comey. Speaking at the Las Vegas event, Trump addressed the Roger Stone case for the first time since his former associate was sentenced. \u201cI\u2019m following this very closely, and I want to see it play out to its fullest because Roger has a very good chance of exoneration in my opinion,\u201d Trump said. The president then turned to attacking the jury foreman in Stone\u2019s case, who he said was \u201ctotally tainted\u201d and an \u201canti-Trump activist.\u201d Stone\u2019s team has argued he should get a new trial because of juror bias, but Judge Amy Berman Jackson seemed skeptical of that motion earlier today. Speaking at an event in Las Vegas, Trump said he was considering a pardon for the founder of the group Hope for Prisoners. Jon Ponder, who introduced Trump at the event, has said he first envisioned the group while he was serving time in prison. His program helps former inmates reentering society. \u201cWe are giving him absolute consideration, and I have a feeling he\u2019s going to get that full pardon,\u201d Trump said of Ponder. Trump issued a spate of commutations and pardons earlier this week, intensifying speculation that the president will pardon Roger Stone. Mike Bloomberg is being criticized fot tweeting out an altered video from last night\u2019s debate. The video appears to show Bloomberg\u2019s opponents reacting with blank stares and stuttering when he says he is the only candidate on stage who has started his own business. In reality, when Bloomberg delivered this line last night, he then quickly launched into praising mentoring programs he supported in New York. Some commentators said Bloomberg\u2019s use of the video raised questions about his credibility. In a new statement, a spokesperson for Roger Stone denounced Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u2019s handling of his sentencing and called on Trump to pardon him. Kristin Davis criticized Jackson for issuing a ruling on Stone\u2019s sentence before reaching a decision on the former Trump associate\u2019s motion claiming juror bias. However, Jackson applauded the jurors for their service earlier today, so she seems unlikely to issue a favorable ruling on Stone\u2019s motion. \u201cIt falls on President Trump to use the power of a pardon as the final means of checks and balances to right this horrible wrong,\u201d Davis said. Last night\u2019s Democratic debate drew 19.7 million viewers, setting a new record, according to Nielsen. Deadline reports: [NBC News and MSNBC] said that it was the most watched Democratic debate in history. It also topped the 18.1 million who watched the second night of the Democratic debate in June. That event was broadcast by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo. NBC said that the debate generated 13.5 million live video streams and 22 million video views across all platforms. The network said that it translated into an average audience of 417,000 viewers. Those figures will likely delight the candidates who performed well last night, namely Elizabeth Warren, but they may be greeted with panic over at Mike Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters. Warren\u2019s campaign said it raised nearly $3 million yesterday, as the candidate went after Bloomberg for his past sexist comments and his hefty campaign spending. But Bloomberg\u2019s performance was widely panned, with the former New York mayor appearing unprepared for some obvious lines of attack. Considering nearly 20 million people tuned in last night, that could be bad news for Bloomberg\u2019s hopes of turning in a formidable performance on Super Tuesday after skipping the early voting states. Here\u2019s some bad news for Democrats: a new poll found Trump leading all of the top presidential candidates in the pivotal swing state of Wisconsin. According to the Quinnipiac University poll, the 2020 Democratic field has an edge over the president in Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Trump carried in 2016. But the poll also found that all of the candidates are trailing Trump in the key toss-up state of Wisconsin. If the 2016 electoral map holds mostly steady this year, and Trump is able to hold Wisconsin while Democrats pick up Michigan and Pennsylvania, the president will still win reelection. Democrats have said they expect to be competitive in other states that went for Trump in 2016, such as Arizona and Georgia. But for the many Democrats who have argued their road to the White House runs through the Midwest, those polling numbers could cause alarm. Reacting to yet another one of the president\u2019s mocking tweets, Mike Bloomberg joked about the likelihood of Trump pardoning Roger Stone, after his former associate was sentenced to more than three years in prison. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s former associate, was sentenced to more than three years in prison for obstructing the congressional investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump has hinted at a possible pardon for Stone, which House intelligence commitee chairman Adam Schiff said would be \u201ca breathtaking act of corruption.\u201d Judge Amy Berman Jackson denounced Stone\u2019s actions while delivering her sentencing decision, calling Stone\u2019s disregard for the truth \u201ca threat to the very foundation of this democracy.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said Roger Stone\u2019s sentence was \u201cjustified\u201d and warned that a presidential pardon in the case would be a \u201cbreathtaking act of corruption.\u201d Trump has appeared open to pardoning Stone, pinning this clip from Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson to the top of his Twitter feed. \u201cLike the Russia collusion fantasy itself, Stone\u2019s prosecution was wholly poitical,\u201d Carlson says in the clip, although that argument was rejected by Judge Amy Berman Jackson today. Carlson goes on to say, \u201cPresident Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon, and there are indications tonight that he will do that.\u201d Allies and critics of Roger Stone faced off as the former Trump associate exited the courthouse after his sentencing hearing. From the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino, who is at the courthouse: Roger Stone will not report to prison for at least a few weeks, until Judge Amy Berman Jackson rules on his motion claiming juror bias in the case. But Jackson seems unlikely to give Stone a favorable ruling on his motion, considering she praised \u201cjurors who served with integrity under difficult circumstances\u201d while delivering her decision today. As she delivered her sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson delivered a defense of facts, accusing Roger Stone of disregarding them in his case. \u201cThe truth still exists. The truth still matters,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cRoger Stone\u2019s insistence that it doesn\u2019t, his pride in his own lies are a threat to the very foundation of this democracy.\u201d Despite America\u2019s current divisions, Jackson said that the condemnation of Stone\u2019s disregard for the truth \u201cshould transcend both parties.\u201d Roger Stone has been sentenced to spend three years and four months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release. The former Trump associate will also be required to pay a $20,000 fine. Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months on the first charge and concurrent sentences on the sixth other charges. Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s former associate, has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to and obstructing Congress and witness tampering in the Russia investigation. Judge Amy Berman Jackson defended the congressional investigation into Russian interference and the prosecution of Roger Stone\u2019s case. \u201cThere was nothing unfair, phony or disgraceful about the investigation or the prosecution,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWitnesses do not get to decide for themselves whether Congress is entitled to the facts.\u201d She also argued Stone\u2019s disregard for the truth should worry all those who care about American democracy. \u201cThe dismay and disgust at the defendant\u2019s belligerence should transcend party,\u201d Jackson said. Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Trump\u2019s tweets about Roger Stone\u2019s case, calling the president\u2019s comments \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d But the judge made clear she would not be swayed by Trump\u2019s comments or arguments from Stone\u2019s critics calling for a stiffer sentence. \u201cRoger Stone will not be sentenced for who his friends are or who his enemies are,\u201d Jackson said. Judge Amy Berman Jackson dismissed the arguments, repeatedly aired by Trump\u2019s allies on cable news and on Twitter, that Roger Stone is being punished for his political views. \u201cHe was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the president,\u201d Berman said. \u201cHe was prosecuted for covering up for the president.\u201d Judge Amy Berman Jackson said federal prosecutors\u2019 original sentencing recommendation, which called for seven to nine years in prison for Roger Stone, was \u201cthorough, well-researched and supported.\u201d However, she said she would not have issued that severe of a sentence, regardless of the \u201cunprecedented\u201d actions taken by Justice Department leadership last week. Judge Amy Berman Jackson also rejected the argument from Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers that he had been made to suffer a great deal during the course of the trial. Jackson noted that much of the public scrutiny of Stone came in response to his own handling of the trial, posting about the case on social media even after a gag order was issued. Outlining the charges against Roger Stone, Judge Amy Berman Jackson noted both chambers of Congress were controlled by Republicans when he lied to lawmakers, so it\u2019s illogical that Stone would feel the need to protect Trump against an allegedly unfair investigation. Judge Amy Berman Jackson applauded Randy Credico, the witness who was threatened by Roger Stone, for writing a letter in support of a lenient sentence. But Jackson dismissed the idea that Credico\u2019s \u201csensitivity\u201d and \u201cconcern\u201d reflected favorably upon Stone. Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Roger Stone had \u201cflat out lied\u201d to Congress as lawmakers investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cThis is not mere equivocation,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThese answers were clearly false.\u201d Quoting a letter in support of Roger Stone, Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected the notion that Stone was \u201cbeing pursued by political enemies.\u201d Jackson said the record clearly showed Stone had \u201cinjected himself\u201d into the WikiLeaks controversy by seeking the hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. Jackson\u2019s comments reject arguments from Trump and some of his allies that Stone is the victim of a political witch hunt. Delivering her decision on Roger Stone\u2019s sentence, Judge Amy Berman Jackson began, \u201cUnsurprisingly, I have a lot to say.\u201d Jackson then said she would walk through each aspect of the sentencing, starting with the nature of Stone\u2019s crimes. Roger Stone\u2019s sentencing hearing is back in session, and Judge Amy Berman Jackson will soon deliver her ruling. Judge Amy Berman Jackson tried to get to the bottom of what happened with the changed sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone. She noted that John Crabb, the newly installed federal prosecutor who joined the case last week after four colleagues withdrew in protest, was probably the least familiar person with this case in the courtroom, save for a lawyer who just joined the defense team. \u201cIs there anything you would like to say about why you are the one standing here today?\u201d Jackson asked. Crabb apologized for any \u201cconfusion,\u201d which he said was not caused by the original prosecution team. He said there was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d but did not elaborate on the nature of that. \u201cThis prosecution was, and this prosecution is, righteous,\u201d Crabb said. He refused to say if he wrote the second sentencing memo, citing internal deliberations. Asked if he was directed to sign the second sentencing memo by someone above him, he again declined to get into internal deliberations. Asked whether he would like to address the court, Roger Stone said he would not be speaking today. Judge Amy Berman Jackson then called for a short break before she delivers her ruling on Stone\u2019s sentencing. Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers argued the prosecution of his criminal case had already been punishing enough for him and his family, recommending probation for the former Trump associate. But considered the severe terms Judge Amy Berman Jackson has used today to describe Stone\u2019s actions, it seems unlikely she will be swayed by that argument. Under questioning from Judge Amy Berman Jackson, federal prosecutor John Crabb defended the original prosecutors who carried out Roger Stone\u2019s case. Crabb, who signed on to the revised sentencing recommendation last week, blamed the change on a \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d saying the original prosecutors received the proper approvals for their recommendation of seven to nine years in prison. \u201cThis prosecution was, and this prosecution is, righteous,\u201d Crabb said. But Crabb would not directly answer Jackson\u2019s questions about whether he was ordered to sign the revised sentencing recommendation, which came after Trump criticized the original recommendation. Crabb argued that process was a matter of internal deliberations, but he expressed confidence in Jackson\u2019s eventual sentence. \u201cWe are confident the court will impose a fair and just sentence in this matter,\u201d he said. The federal prosecutors and Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers argued in court over whether the former Trump associate had obstructed his own criminal case by posting about it on social media. As a reminder, Stone was slapped with an expanded gag order last year after he posted an Instagram appearing to show Judge Amy Berman Jackson and the crosshairs of a gun. Jackson warned in court today that the post could have incited violence against her and merited a sentencing enhancement, denouncing Stone\u2019s behavior as \u201cintolerable.\u201d The judge overseeing Roger Stone\u2019s case agreed with his lawyers that his sentence should not be extended due to evidence of planning to obstruct Congress in its Russia investigation. Interestingly, the federal prosecutor in Roger Stone\u2019s case who has repeatedly referred to the original sentencing recommendation, which was later contradicted by justice department leadership, is the same prosecutor who signed on to the revised recommendatinon. The judge overseeing Roger Stone\u2019s case has so far ruled that sentencing guidelines which could increase his prison sentence do apply to his conviction. But as a Politico reporter noted, the application of those guidelines does not necessarily mean Stone will receive the maximum sentence. It appears the federal prosecutors, who were added to Roger Stone\u2019s case after four of the original porsecutors withdrew from the case in protest, are standing by their colleagues\u2019 original sentencing recommendation. As a reminder, the four original prosecutors withdrew from the case because senior Justice Department leaders, including attorney geneeral William Barr, revised down their sentencing recommendation for Stone. That revision came after Trump criticized the recommended sentence, which was seven to nine years in prison. It now seems the prosecutors installed to replace their absent colleagues are standing by the original recommendation that the president objected to. As Roger Stone\u2019s sentencing hearing continues, Trump is tweeting about his former associate, claiming his crimes were on par with the actions of former FBI director James Comey and former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. But as a reminder, neither Comey nor McCabe were ever charged with a crime -- in comparison to Stone, who was both charged and convicted on seven counts. Roger Stone was yelled at by a few protesters as the former Trump associate arrived for his sentencing hearing at a federal courthouse in Washington. As a reminder, Roger Stone was found guilty on seven counts brought by the Justice Department in November. The former Trump associate was accused of lying to and obstructing Congress, as well as witness tampering, in connection to the investigation into Russia interference. According to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, Stone lied under oath about his communications with WikiLeaks as he tried to obtain hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election and threatened one of his friends to prevent that information from coming to light. The sentencing hearing of Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s former associate, is getting under way in Washington. Regardless of Stone\u2019s sentence, the judge overseeing his case has said she will delay execution of the sentence until Stone\u2019s request for a new trial over alleged juror bias is settled. There\u2019s also the possibility (if not probablility) that Trump will pardon Stone, making it unnecessary for Stone to serve out his sentence. Trump\u2019s appointment of Richard Grenell as the next acting director of national intelligence has raised some concerns about political influence over the intelligence community. Grenell, who currently serves as the US ambassador to Germany, is known as one of the president\u2019s most loyal allies, and he has no background in intelligence. Because he has only been appointed on an acting basis, Grenell will not have to be confirmed by the Senate, although his tenure will end after only six months unless he is formally nominated. Nonetheless, Grenell\u2019s oversight of the office of the director of national intelligence set off alarm bells among Trump\u2019s critics that the president was trying to exert political influence over the intelligence community. Trump\u2019s press secretary dismissed those concerns in a statement, insisting Grenell is \u201cis committed to a non-political, non-partisan approach as head of the Intelligence Community, on which our safety and security depend.\u201d Bernie Sanders also came under attack from his opponents during last night\u2019s debate, the first since Sanders became the definitive frontrunner in the race. Pete Buttigieg, in particular, criticized Sanders for not doing enough to chastize his online supporters, some of whom engaged in \u201cvicious attacks\u201d against Nevada\u2019s Culinary Union after the organizion came out against Medicare-for-all. \u201cLeadership isn\u2019t just about policy,\u201d Buttigieg told Sanders. \u201cI think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others.\u201d Sanders said he condemned the \u201cfew people who make ugly remarks\u201d online, but he added, \u201cAll of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s happening, but it would not shock me.\u201d But Twitter said in a statement that it would have disclosed any evidence of Russian disinformation campaign to sully the reputation of Sanders\u2019 supporters. \u201cUsing technology and human review in concert, we proactively monitor Twitter to identify attempts at platform manipulation and mitigate them,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson told CNBC. \u201cAs is standard, if we have reasonable evidence of state-backed information operations, we\u2019ll disclose them following our thorough investigation to our public archive \u2014 the largest of its kind in the industry.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s debate performance last night has been widely panned, with many critics saying the former New York mayor appeared unprepared to respond to some very obvious lines of attack about his record. Trump is now adding his name to the list of Bloomberg\u2019s critics, mocking the fellow billionaire in a tweet for his height and the \u201cworst debate performance in history.\u201d The tweet includes a video made by a supporter, which ends with Bloomberg being crushed under a giant foot before \u201cTrump-Pence: Keep America Great\u201d appears on screen. It isn\u2019t just a shift in poll-ratings that candidates were looking for after the Las Vegas debates last night - and it looks like Elizabeth Warren\u2019s performance has allowed her to hit the fund-raising jackpot. Her team say that they had their best debate day fund-raising of the campaign yet, bringing in $2.8m The Sanders campaign also seem to have had a rewarding night, with Eliza Collins reporting that they also claim to have had their best debate fund-raising day, with $2.7m coming in. It looks like it could be quite lively at the court in Washington where Stone is due to be sentenced. There already seem to be pro and anti-Stone camps making their presence felt outside. The president is up and tweeting - and not about Roger Stone. Trump has started his online day by posting a video clip of a veteran being carried to his seat at a Trump rally, which Donald Trump Jr had highlighted earlier. Politico have published a good long read looking into the saga of Roger Stone\u2019s almost inevitable presidential pardon by Darren Samuelsohn. It\u2019s a good refresher on just how deep the ties between Stone and Trump have been over the years: \u201cStone and Trump have a history unlike anyone else around the president. They\u2019ve known each other since Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 White House campaign and maintained a rapport that includes Stone counseling Trump during four potential presidential runs and Trump hiring Stone as a lobbyist to represent his gambling, airline and hotel businesses. In his most recent book, Stone boasted that he knew about Trump\u2019s 2016 plans more than two years before the formal campaign announcement.\u201d You can read it here: \u201cThe Roger Stone pardon saga\u201d While he awaits the outcome of US moves to extradite him, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been visited in prison by a leading British opposition politician - shadow chancellor John McDonnell. McDonnell described the US attempts to extradite Assange to face trial to face 18 charges, including conspiring to commit computer intrusion, as \u201cone of the most important and significant political trials of this generation, in fact longer.\u201d McDonnell criticised \u201cThe way in which a person is being persecuted for political reasons, for simply exposing the truth for what went on in relation to recent wars. We don\u2019t believe that extradition should be used for political purposes.\u201d McDonnell added that \u201cI think if this extradition takes place it will damage the democratic standing of our own country as well as America. We have a long tradition in this country of standing up for journalistic freedom, standing up for the protection of whistleblowers and those who expose injustices.\u201d Assange, 48, could face up to 175 years in jail if the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to extradite him is successful. Here\u2019s some more detail from the visit\u2026 Jordan Weissmann has reviewed Elizabeth Warren\u2019s performance in last night\u2019s debate in glowing terms for Slate: \u201cIt was brutal. It was crushing. It was a command performance full of zingers that drew roars, even if they were a bit obviously prewritten. And perhaps everyone should have seen it coming. Warren, after all, has often been at her best during this primary campaign when going toe-to-toe in the media with billionaires fearful of her candidacy. What better foil could she ask for than Bloomberg?\u201d Weissmann also makes the point that the set-up of the debate suited her - being positioned just to Bloomberg\u2019s left meant the cameras caught the full blast of her one-to-one attacks on him. If you missed it earlier, my colleague Sam Levin rounded up all of Warren\u2019s best attack lines on the billionaire and his arrogance and his record on NDAs, racist policing and taxes. Donald Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is in the UK at the moment, with meetings planned with some of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s staff over the issue of Chinese telecoms firm Huawei. The Trump administration has made no secret of their displeasure that the UK has approved Huawei to supply equipment to build the British 5G mobile phone network. Mulvaney was at a meeting in Oxford last night where he delivered a forceful warning: \u201cWe are very much concerned that integrity of that information is hardwired into your computer systems, and if you folks go forward with the decision to include Huawei, it will have a direct and dramatic impact on our ability to share information with you. Period, end of story.\u201d The Washington Post is also reporting a different line that came out of Mulvaney\u2019s talk, an admission that the Republican party can be hypocritical over the issues of deficits. Mulvaney is reported as saying: \u201cMy party is very interested in deficits when there is a Democrat in the White House. The worst thing in the whole world is deficits when Barack Obama was the president. Then Donald Trump became president, and we\u2019re a lot less interested as a party\u201d We\u2019ll know in a few hours what Roger Stone\u2019s sentence is going to be. What we don\u2019t know yet is whether he\u2019ll actually have to serve any of it, or whether he will benefit from an almost instantaneous presidential pardon. There was a strong hint from Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed that he might do just that. Last night he posted up a clip of Tucker Carlson from Fox News discussing the case. In the clip, Carlson says: \u201cLike the Russia collusion fantasy itself, Stone\u2019s prosecution was wholly poitical. It was a shocking insult to the American tradition of equal justice. The whole thing is enough to shake your faith in our justice system. President Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon, and there are indications tonight that he will do that.\u201d Not only did Trump tweet out the clip, but he also pinned it to the top of his feed. Trump has already made headlines with his pardons this week - freeing convicted Democrat Rod Blagojevich. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also sensationally claimed in a court in London yesterday that Trump had offered him a pardon if he would refute Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election - something that the president denies. Here\u2019s Austin Sarat, arguing that Trump\u2019s use of clemency undermines the rule of law. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has been in North Dakota visiting Minot Air Force Base, acclaiming president Trump\u2019s plan to modernise the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Esper told reporters that the spending was needed to keep up with Russia and outpace China. He told reporters that \u201cRussia and China are both modernizing and expanding their nuclear arsenals.\u201d He said the country needed to have confidence that US systems are effective, safe, reliable, and credible. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to deter war.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the first 10 years of the modernization plan will cost nearly $500 billion, and that over a 30-year span the total would hit $1.2 trillion, including the cost of sustaining the current and future force. California\u2019s lawmakers are expected to vote to formally apologize for the role the state legislature played in the incarceration of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent during the second world war. The resolution, which is likely to be approved today, was introduced by California state assembly member Albert Muratsuchi. In a reference to Trump\u2019s muslim travel ban and the separation of families at the US border, Muratsuchi has said that \u201cWe\u2019re seeing striking parallels between what happened to Japanese Americans before and during the second world war and what we see happening today\u201d Mario Koran in San Francisco has the full story. We\u2019ve also got an emotional piece from back in 2012, written by actor George Takei, who was interned along with his family in the 1940s. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that day, nor the tears streaming down my mother\u2019s face as we were forcibly removed, herded off like animals, to a nearby race track. There, for weeks, we would live in a filthy horse stable while our \u2018permanent\u2019 relocation camp was being constructed thousands of miles away\u201d He might not have shone in last night\u2019s debate, but Mike Bloomberg can console himself with the fact that he has picked up another three congressional endorsements. Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Nita Lowey of New York and Pete Aguilar of California have all come out and endorsed Bloomberg. Aguilar cited Bloomberg\u2019s record \u201cat both the national and local levels\u201d and his \u201ctrack record as a former mayor on gun safety and climate.\u201d It brings his total number of congressional endorsements to 15. Only Joe Biden has more. It\u2019s not always clear how much congressional endorsements turn into popular support, but Bloomberg will be grateful that the move today suggests his campaign still has momentum after Las Vegas. Here\u2019s what Richard Wolffe made of last night: \u201cThis Democratic primary is not the same as it was four years ago; nor is it like the Republican contest of the same cycle. After three years of Trumpian dysfunction and disinformation, nothing is the same. He believes that nothing can stop Sanders winning the nomination this time around. While a lot of eyes were on the debate in Las Vegas, president Donald Trump was at work, and used Twitter to announce that, as expected, Richard Grenell will become acting director of national intelligence. The US ambassador to Germany is a keen Trump ally, and now takes charge of the nation\u2019s 17 spy agencies, with whom the president has enjoyed a testy relationship. In his tweet Trump said that \u201cRick has represented our Country exceedingly well and I look forward to working with him.\u201d Grenell has been ambassador to Germany since 2018, and because he has been named as acting director, the appointment will not need to be confirmed by the Senate. The move hasn\u2019t been universally popular. Democrat senator Mark Warner of Virginia said Trump had \u201cselected an individual without any intelligence experience to serve as the leader of the nation\u2019s intelligence community in an acting capacity.\u201d Many pundits seemed to think that Elizabeth Warren was at her most effective in the debate last night when landing blows on Mike Bloomberg\u2019s record. \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another\u201d she said. Her performance sparked a lot of fun on social media - one person suggested that Bloomberg\u2019s Wikipedia page needed \u201cCause of death: Elizabeth Warren\u201d added to it. But there was nothing fun about her attacks on Bloomberg over his record on race relations, policing, NDA agreements and his wealth. Sam Levin here has a write-up of the lines that most wounded the former mayor of new York. Good morning - and it\u2019s the morning after the night before for the six major challengers for the Democratic nomination, as they wake up and wonder how their debate performance yesterday will have played with voters. We\u2019ll get our first real hint when Nevada holds its caucuses on Saturday. It is probably Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who will be most pleased with how they did. Sanders, the frontrunner in the polls, withstood the onslaught he faced, and Warren made her mark with a series of stinging attacks on Mike Bloomberg, who was appearing in a debate for the first time. Klobuchar and Buttigieg sparred. And Joe Biden? Well, he kept on plodding on. Here\u2019s the wrap of the night from my colleague Sam Levin in Las Vegas. Donald Trump is on the campaign trail too today. He\u2019ll be at a rally in Colorado Springs which starts at 7pm ET. Before then we\u2019ll almost certainly hear from the president on Twitter about the sentencing of Roger Stone. Stone was was convicted in November on seven felony charges, including lying to Congress and tampering with a witness, and will find out his punishment in court this morning, despite a last minute bid to get a re-trial.",

Hadley took aim at Bolt for his widely condemned comments about ABC Four Corners and St Kevin\u2019s victim Paris Street on the Bolt Report. After Street wrote an open letter to Bolt saying his comments made him sick, the News Corp journalist apologised on Sky News for upsetting him, saying he regretted using the phrase \u201chit on\u201d. On Friday\u2019s show Hadley said Bolt\u2019s claim that Street wasn\u2019t sexually assaulted but was \u201chit on\u201d was \u201cdemeaning, insulting and beyond the pale\u201d. \u201cYou do a lot of good in the community, but, by crikey, when it comes to paedophilia you\u2019ve got a very poor record,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cA very poor record. Which has compelled you to apologise to Street today. \u201cMr Bolt has a history of defending people who are convicted of paedophilia. He has a history of it! Even when appeals are denied, he has a history of it. Now that\u2019s on his conscience, not mine.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve been an ambassador for Bravehearts for two decades, Mr Bolt. I\u2019ll stand by my record in condemning paedophilia against yours any day of the week.\u201d Hadley said Bolt\u2019s comments on the case showed he was ignorant of the facts and had a complete lack of understanding of the victims of child sexual abuse. \u201cDefending paedophiles! ... Then apologising when he\u2019s attacked by me and others. That poor boy shouldn\u2019t have been penning that letter. He shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that on Sky News. And I hope that there\u2019s been a lesson well-learned here by Mr Bolt. \u201cAnd the only reason you made an apology is because you\u2019ve been targeted by various social media groups for your creepy behaviour!\u201d Camp Hill murders coverage condemned Many of the front pages about the horrific murder of Hannah Clarke and her three young children in Brisbane on Wednesday focused on the scourge of domestic violence and the \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cunthinkable\u201d act of a \u201cmongrel\u201d man who killed his estranged wife and children.

      "bodyText": "Senior Morrison government ministers are publicly at odds about whether Australia will take a long-term emissions reduction target to global climate talks in November after Labor unveiled a target of net zero emissions by 2050. On Friday the finance minister Mathias Cormann confirmed the government \u201cwill be finalising a longer-term target in time for Cop26\u201d but the emissions reduction minister would commit only to \u201ca long-term strategy\u201d despite repeatedly being asked about a new target. As revealed by Guardian Australia, Anthony Albanese used a speech to a progressive thinktank on Friday to commit the ALP to adopting a net zero target by 2050 if it wins the next federal election, without the use of carryover credits from the Kyoto period. Scott Morrison is holding off from making a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, partly because of an internal brawl within the Coalition and partly because the prime minister says Australia should not sign up to targets in the absence of costings. Some in the government have noted publicly in recent weeks that Australia implicitly accepted the net zero pathway when the Coalition signed and ratified the Paris agreement, and Liberal moderates are now pushing to make net zero an explicit target beyond the 26-28% emissions reduction promised by 2030. Asked about the existing Paris commitment on Friday, Cormann told Sky News \u201cwe will be finalising our longer-term emissions reduction target in time for Cop26 in Glasgow later this year\u201d, using the word \u201ctarget\u201d at least three times in his formulation of future government policy. \u201cBut what we will do as part of our process is to ensure that the agenda we determine to achieve any such target is environmentally effective and economically responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will ensure that we can look the Australian people in the eye and say \u2018this is what we\u2019re aiming to achieve, this is what it will mean for electricity prices, this is what it will mean for jobs\u2019.\u201d Cormann accused Labor of committing to targets without setting out the cost, warning that Albanese is \u201cmaking the same mistake\u201d as former leader Bill Shorten. Later on Friday, Angus Taylor told Sky News the Coalition had a \u201cvery clear target for 2030\u201d and a \u201cvery clear view that will drive emissions [reductions] beyond 2030\u201d. Taylor repeatedly avoided the question about whether a technology roadmap to reduce emissions would result in a new longer-term emissions reduction target. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is we\u2019ll have a long-term strategy and we\u2019re not going to have any target that is uncosted, unfunded [and] unplanned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going down that path.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve made very clear that we\u2019re focused on a long-term strategy and technology will be the focus of it \u2026 not taxes.\u201d \u201cWe are working towards a long-term strategy, a technology investment roadmap, we have a target for 2030, we\u2019re going to meet and beat that target.\u201d Despite the Coalition criticism, business rode to Labor\u2019s defence. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the net zero target \u201cis increasingly widely supported by Australian businesses, industry advocates such as Ai Group, the wider community and governments of all complexions\u201d. \u201cThat growing consensus is important to guide and discipline the development of efficient, trade neutral and fair policies to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate the challenge of net zero, which goes well beyond generating cleaner electricity. \u201cNor should we get too hung up on economic projections, which are about as reliable as trying in 1990 to estimate the cost and value of smartphones in 2020.\u201d Every state and territory has expressed at least an aspirational objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and Australia has been urged by the UK and its Pacific neighbours to sign up to that target. Albanese noted on Friday that the Business Council of Australia is calling for it as well as major corporates including AGL, Santos, BHP, Amcor, BP, Wesfarmers and Telstra. \u201cSeventy-three countries, including the UK, Canada, France and Germany, many with conservative governments, have already adopted it as their goal,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia should too.\u201d Earlier, Labor\u2019s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, told Radio National the opposition would set out a detailed policy about how to achieve targets and its cost \u201cwell before\u201d the next election.

      "bodyText": "A section of track near Wallan where a train derailed, killing two people on Thursday night, was awaiting maintenance and Victorian train drivers had refused to drive on it, the Rail Tram and Bus Union has said. The XPT from Sydney to Melbourne, with 153 passengers on board, came off the tracks near Wallan, about 45km by rail north of Melbourne, just before 8pm. It had been due to arrive in Melbourne at 6.30pm and was running more than two hours behind schedule. The union\u2019s state secretary, Luba Grigorovitch, said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the accident which had killed the train driver and train pilot, and \u201cunnecessarily\u201d injured passengers. \u201cThe Sydney to Melbourne XPT train derailment near Wallan Station last night occurred over a section of track over which was awaiting maintenance,\u201d Grigorovitch said. \u201cConditions were altered and V/Line drivers rightly refused to traverse this section over the past week.\u201d On Friday morning the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, was at the scene and described it as \u201ca very tragic day\u201d. He offered condolences to the families of those killed \u2013 a 54-year-old driver from the Australian Capital Territory and his co-pilot, a 49-year-old man from Victoria, who both died at the scene. He said the union claim that the track was in need of maintenance was a matter for investigators, and that he was unaware of driver complaints about the track. \u201cNo authorities would let a train go on on an unsafe track and engineering scopes and safety inspections are conducted on tracks \u2026 That happens all the time so public safety, passenger safety is first and foremost,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cI welcome the unions to partake in those investigations. I invite the unions to put all those matters to the proper authorities so that we can fully investigate what has taken place beforehand and of course, what took place last night. I reiterate no authority would let passengers travel on unsafe track. We will ensure that proper answers are found for the bereaved families and making sure these sorts of things don\u2019t happen again.\u201d Meanwhile police were trying to confirm the exact passenger number on Friday, urging anyone who was on the train but who had not spoken with emergency services, or who purchased a ticket but did not board the train, to call Seymour Police Station. Victoria police Inspector Peter Koger said there had been a number of passengers \u201cscrambling and trying to get off the train\u201d when first responders arrived. \u201cThere was a number of passengers that had already alighted from the train and there were still some on the train,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first responders to it established control of the scene and ensured that the passengers were escorted off the train and taken to a contact point where we can account for them and then they were treated.\u201d Passengers told reporters at the scene the train had been gaining speed when the crash occurred, after having been stopped near Wallan due to a signalling issue, but did not seem to be up to full speed. The crash caused several carriages to come off the track, with the engine and the first carriage lying on their side. McCormack said it was too soon to know how fast the train was travelling before the crash. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of what speed the train was travelling at \u2026 I\u2019m not aware of at the moment what section of the track and what speed limit was placed on that section of the track,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, that become part of the investigations by the national rail safety regulator and by the state authorities, both NSW and Victoria.\u201d One passenger, a man in his 60s, was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with upper body injuries but Ambulance Victoria said he was in a stable condition. Eleven other passengers were taken to nearby hospitals \u2013 three to Kilmore hospital, eight to Northern hospital \u2013 with minor injuries. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but V/Line had regularly warned passengers of delays to services to Albury on the Seymour/Sydney line this week due to \u201crail equipment faults at Wallan\u201d. An upgrade of the Melbourne to Albury rail link, on which the XPT travels, was assessed by Infrastructure Australia last year but deemed that it \u201cshould not be included on the Infrastructure priority list at this time\u201d. Passengers reported being tossed around the carriage. Dr Scott Rickard, from Canberra, said she and her husband used the airline brace position to stay in their seats when their carriage, which was the first one behind the engine, left the tracks and came to rest on an angle. \u201cWe thought the carriage was going to go 360 degrees at one point, but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. Other passengers fell out of their seats and across the aisle, landing on top of other passengers. The train conductor, who had been in their carriage handing out complaint slips for passengers annoyed that it had already been subject to lengthy delays, began checking if people were ok. Some received minor injuries, but Rickard said everyone was able to get up and jump down from the carriage to the tracks. It was immediately obvious the driver had been badly injured, Rickard said. \u201cHe seemed like a lovely man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very warm and generous talking to us on the intercom.\u201d Rickard and her husband boarded the XPT at Yass Junction, hoping for a quiet trip in Melbourne to make up for a summer in Canberra where bushfire smoke aggravated her asthma. They booked a return ticket, and say they haven\u2019t been put off rail travel. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change my outlook on trains,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want them to be better maintained and for there to be more of them.\u201d One passenger, James Ashburner, said the carriage he was travelling in was tilted 30 degrees to the right when it finally stopped. He said emergency services took 20 minutes to arrive, and that the response was \u201cexemplary\u201d and \u201cimmensely reassuring\u201d. Acting police Inspector Peter Fusianto told reporters at the scene that it was lucky more people had not died. \u201cAs a first responder who turned up, it would have looked like a horrific scene,\u201d Fusianto said. The outcome, it\u2019s unfortunate we lost two lives, but with 153 passengers, the outcome was probably far greater than what you would have anticipated when you first turned up.\u201d A spokesman for Victoria police said they were removing the bodies from the train on Friday morning and awaiting the arrival of investigators from the National Rail Safety Regulator, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and WorkSafe, who will all investigate the crash. The Victorian and New South Wales transport ministers, and the chief executive of V/Line, toured the site on Friday. Police will also prepare a report for the coroner. They are seeking information about 20 passengers, who are believed to have evacuated before emergency services arrived. Those passengers have been asked to come forward to confirm they are uninjured. Ambulance Victoria said they received an emergency call at 7.45pm. Passengers were triaged in the carpark of a BP service station, some 200m from the crash site. Almost all had been transferred to hospital, picked up by relatives, or transported by bus to Melbourne by 11pm. All V/Line train services to Seymour, Shepparton and Albury have been replaced by buses until further notice.",

The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, apologised on Friday for comments made by Det Insp Mark Thompson as he appealed for information into the deaths the previous day, saying the detective was \u201cgutted\u201d at his choice of words. Thompson\u2019s comments were condemned as victim-blaming by domestic violence campaigners including Betty Taylor from the Red Rose Foundation and Angela Lynch, the head of the Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland. \u201cThe Queensland Police Service apologises for comments made during a media conference yesterday about the deaths of five people in Camp Hill,\u201d Carroll said in a statement. \u201cI have spoken to Detective Inspector Mark Thompson who was very upset about the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cTo ensure public confidence I have asked Detective Inspector Thompson to step aside from the investigation.\u201d At a later media conference, Carroll said Thompson had volunteered to step down \u201cfor the integrity and the confidence\u201d not only of the current investigation, but Queensland policing more generally. \u201cAnd I totally agreed with that.\u201d She said Thompson was \u201can extraordinarily committed, experienced and brilliant investigator\u201d and \u201can exceptionally good police officer\u201d who was distressed and distraught by the consequences of what he had said.

Advocates made emotional pleas for social and political change after Clarke became the eighth woman killed by domestic violence in Australia this year. Clarke, 31, and her children, Laianah, 4, Aaliyah, 6, and Trey, 3, were killed when Baxter allegedly poured petrol on his family and set them alight at Camp Hill in Brisbane on Wednesday. Baxter died on the footpath from self-inflicted wounds, police say. The estranged couple had separated before Christmas last year, and members of both families have painted a picture of a violent and controlling relationship. Clarke\u2019s sister-in-law, Stacey Roberts, said her parents had \u201cexhausted themselves\u201d helping her \u201cescape this monster\u201d, and in messages obtained by the Courier-Mail, a family member of Rowan Baxter repeatedly reassured Clarke she\u2019d done the right thing in leaving. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I got out when I did,\u201d Clarke wrote to the woman earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m OK, struggling, but I know I\u2019ve made the right decision. \u201cI\u2019m safe, I\u2019m with my parents who are very, very normal. I\u2019m just so glad I got out when I did. And I\u2019m so glad you reached out to me.\u201d On Thursday, Thompson confirmed domestic and family violence orders had been granted against Baxter, saying there had been \u201ca number of engagements of police\u201d between the couple. \u201cI can confirm Queensland police have engaged with both Hannah and her estranged husband in relation to domestic violence issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also engaged with both of the parties in referring them to support services. \u201cWhen it comes to Hannah, we have dealt with her on a number of occasions and worked with the Brisbane Domestic Violence Centre in supporting Hannah throughout her family issues. And we\u2019ve also referred Rowan Baxter to support services as well.\u201d But in comments that drew an immediate and angry response from domestic violence advocates, Thompson also said police would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d about Baxter\u2019s motives and wanted to speak to people who knew both families. \u201cWe need to look at every piece of information and to put it bluntly there are probably people out there in the community that are deciding which side, so to speak, to take in this investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this an issue of a woman suffering significant domestic violence and her and her children perishing at the hands of the husband, or is it an instance of a husband being driven too far by issues he\u2019s suffered by certain circumstances into committing acts of this form?\u201d Renee Eaves, a victims\u2019 advocate who has worked extensively with domestic abuse sufferers in their interactions with the Queensland police, said she could not believe the comments. \u201cThis \u2026 is nothing short of a flashing billboard about the mindset by some police around domestic violence,\u201d she said. \u201cThis narrative is the most dangerous thing that exists for victims who doubt themselves after an attack that maybe they were partly responsible. Police seem to think women make up complaints or are complicit, and as a result they fail to protect them. \u201cIf police are now implying that a murdered woman might be at fault, then that to me raises critical questions about whether they took the threat to her safety seriously enough. \u201cA calculated monster has killed a woman and her children in the most abhorrent way anyone could imagine.

It plays into very dangerous ideas in the community around victim-blaming and a whole range of myths about the family law system.\u201d Lynch said police often say domestic violence cases as \u201ctit for tat between two parties, rather than an abusive pattern of violence\u201d. Controversial media commentator and men\u2019s rights campaigner Bettina Arndt on Friday congratulated Queensland police \u201cfor keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been \u2018driven too far\u2019.\u201d In January, Arndt was made a Member of the Order of Australia, the third-highest rank in Australia\u2019s civic honours system, drawing furious criticism from women\u2019s groups. Much of the criticism around the decision to honour Arndt centred around an interview she conducted with the Tasmanian man Nicolaas Bester, a convicted paedophile jailed for grooming and repeatedly raping his 15-year-old student when he was a 58-year-old. Family violence campaigner and 2015 Australian of the year in 2015 Rosie Batty told Guardian Australia she found the decision to honour Arndt \u201cvery unhelpful\u201d, a view she believed most people working towards gender equality would share.",

Saturday brings something of a level playing field, though, given Chelsea are hardly laden with attacking depth. Tammy Abraham is struggling to be fit and Frank Lampard may have to go again with Michy Batshuayi or, given his good display off the bench against Manchester United, Olivier Giroud. In a parallel universe, Chelsea signed the forwards they wanted in January and allowed Giroud to fill a gaping hole at Tottenham. Instead, nobody feels satisfied and both sides find themselves feeling the heat of rivals making ground beneath them in the race for Champions League places. What price Giroud popping up with the winner \u2013 just as he did in a north London derby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/01/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-matchreport\">in 2013</a> \u2013 and forcing Mourinho to bemoan his threadbare set of options again? <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Chelsea v Tottenham (Saturday, 12.30pm \u2013 all times GMT)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f79b965f-1b60-45e5-b001-aa56b1ce5d7a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JIUzIi79Kek?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Does Sarr hold key to Watford survival?</h2> \n<p>Watford sparked a mini-resurgence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">with victory over Manchester United</a> just before Christmas. After four winless matches they could really use another. They could be boosted here by the return of record signing, Ismaila Sarr, who has been restricted to 11 starts this season. Watford have won four of those, and look a side transformed when they can benefit from the Senegalese forward\u2019s pace and directness on the right. The front three of Sarr, Gerard Deulofeu on the left and Troy Deeney in the middle looks capable of saving the club from relegation should they stay fit, but without any one of that trio the team looks immeasurably poorer.If Watford\u2019s results in those 11 games were extrapolated over a full 38-game season, they would end up with 52 points; if their results in 15 matches without him in the starting lineup were mirrored across a season they would finish with 23. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Manchester United v Watford (Sunday, 2pm)</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/21/premier-league-team-news-previews-and-chelsea-v-tottenham-buildup-live\">Premier League team news, previews and Chelsea v Tottenham buildup \u2013&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Will Arsenal or Everton continue league upturn?</h2> \n<p>Exactly two months ago, Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti watched their new teams from the Goodison directors\u2019 box and might have been forgiven slipping off to the nearest hostelry well before half-time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">The goalless draw</a> was comfortably one of this Premier League season\u2019s worst games but it is not unrealistic to expect far more entertainment from Sunday\u2019s rematch. While both Arsenal and Everton \u2013 who endured disastrous first halves of the season \u2013 remain deeply flawed, the statistics tell a tale. Between them, the new managers have lost only two of the 16 top-flight games. Both can now glimpse a European place previously out of the question and anyone who takes the three points this time will sense the wind in their sails. Ancelotti\u2019s side, with three wins and two draws from the last five, are in the better form and have not had a Europa League tie in Greece to contend with. But Arsenal showed the right blend of defensive stability and attacking fluency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/16/arsenal-turn-on-the-style-in-second-half-to-thrash-newcastle\">against Newcastle</a> and passing this test would suggest the Arteta revolution does have legs. <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Arsenal v Everton (Sunday, 4.30pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e46b9fcd-3f78-4476-b5f3-2dac5a777426\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) A battle of bottom of the class</h2> \n<p>In Premier League rankings, it\u2019s the lowest scorers (Palace) against the joint second-lowest, the team with the fewest shots (Palace) against the joint second-fewest, the team with the fewest goals from inside the box (Newcastle) against the team with the (joint-) fewest from outside, the team with fewest passes (Newcastle) against the fifth-lowest passers, the team that has attempted the second-fewest crosses (Palace) against the third-fewest (with just three more attempts). The Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has been forced to make 106 saves; no one else is in triple figures; Newcastle have made 716 clearances, more than 40 more than anyone else. Over their last 10 games Palace have one win and eight points, putting them 19th in the form table; Newcastle have two wins (one of which was against Palace) and are 16th. In positive news, Newcastle\u2019s forward line could be boosted by the returns from injury of Yoshinori Muto (seven appearances this season, no shots) and Dwight Gayle (nine/two). <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Crystal Palace v Newcastle United (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2>5) The latest on-field reaction from Manchester City</h2> \n<p>There are people \u2013 many of them adults \u2013 who deem those seeking to take over football at any cost more likely truth-tellers than an independent body of legal experts with access to relevant evidence. Such is football fandom and such is the loyalty that has been manipulated by multi-billionaires casting themselves as plucky outsiders. Such is politics that we are intimately familiar with the strategy, but these particular circumstances have now changed. It is eminently possible that repurposed outrage inspires an excellent team to become even better \u2013 what better way to stick it up Uefa than by winning the Champions League? \u2013 but equally possible that righteous indignation becomes distracting. With, er, all due respect to West Ham, a home game against them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/manchester-city-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">was unlikely to be revealing</a>, but a visit to Leicester \u2013 without a league win over anyone but West Ham since New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 will show us plenty about their immediate prospects. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Leicester City v Manchester City (Saturday, 5.30pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6049e93d-ebda-4cb0-8f60-373169344602\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bxFUNa7Qr0Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Saints seek return to winning ways</h2> \n<p>There are few portents more troubling for a team than home defeat to West Ham, and that is exactly what happened to Southampton in mid-December to leave them third-bottom. But since then they have been superb, winning at Villa, Chelsea, Leicester and Palace as well as beating Spurs at home, a run which has taken them 12th. Nevertheless they remain just seven points above the relegation zone and they have now gone a month without a win. In Aston Villa, they will find a team not only desperate for points, but one fluid enough to pick the spaces in Southampton\u2019s 4-2-2-2 formation. Saints have lost eight home games so far this season, more than any team in the league, and Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said this week that the pressure created by the crowd is difficult for his players. This was not wise, because if you offer people an excuse, there\u2019s every chance they will accept it. He and they must acknowledge that no one is responsible for performances, apart from him and them. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Southampton v Aston Villa (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2>7) Burnley begins tough schedule for Bournemouth</h2> \n<p>Twelve games left, and Bournemouth are two places and two points outside the bottom three. They have played six of their last seven games against the other members of the bottom six, a run which featured two wins and five defeats, and with their remaining matches including fixtures against eight of the top nine and none of the strugglers. Burnley, on the other hand, still have to play seven of the bottom eight and though they remain \u2013 on goal difference \u2013 in the bottom half they are just two points off eighth, five from sixth, and their main problem at the moment seems to be in keeping down talk of another European campaign. In Matej Vydra they have a striker who brought a miserable personal run to an end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/15/southampton-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">at Southampton last Saturday</a>, his winner meaning he took part in a league victory for the first time this season \u2013 at the seventh attempt. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Burnley v Bournemouth (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2bd045095bda01bcccb54223bd9c434684e4b53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2bd045095bda01bcccb54223bd9c434684e4b53/0_114_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matej Vydra watches his shot fly into the top corner to give Burnley victory at Southampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matej Vydra watches his shot fly into the top corner to give Burnley victory at Southampton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8) Norwich need Buendia for Wolves test</h2> \n<p>Wolves remainpoised for a tilt at the top four although it is worth pointing out that, since beating Manchester City in December, they have only won once in seven top-flight games. Norwich\u2019s porous defence offers hope that they will put that right, and there is also the fact that Sunday\u2019s visitors desperately require points. Daniel Farke\u2019s team can hardly be accused of not \u201cgoing for it\u201d and it is hard to think of a more enterprising side that has languished seven points shy of safety at this stage. Their strength is to go hell for leather and that is why, having benched him for the last two games, Farke needs to recall Emi Buendia.

      "bodyText": "1) Level playing field for threadbare derby \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a fight with a gun without bullets.\u201d A manager\u2019s post-match interview is a decent advertisement for the health of his team and the problem for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is that his lament after Spurs\u2019 toothless defeat to RB Leipzig will, most likely, apply to the rest of their fixtures this season. Saturday brings something of a level playing field, though, given Chelsea are hardly laden with attacking depth. Tammy Abraham is struggling to be fit and Frank Lampard may have to go again with Michy Batshuayi or, given his good display off the bench against Manchester United, Olivier Giroud. In a parallel universe, Chelsea signed the forwards they wanted in January and allowed Giroud to fill a gaping hole at Tottenham. Instead, nobody feels satisfied and both sides find themselves feeling the heat of rivals making ground beneath them in the race for Champions League places. What price Giroud popping up with the winner \u2013 just as he did in a north London derby in 2013 \u2013 and forcing Mourinho to bemoan his threadbare set of options again? NA \u2022 Chelsea v Tottenham (Saturday, 12.30pm \u2013 all times GMT) 2) Does Sarr hold key to Watford survival? Watford sparked a mini-resurgence with victory over Manchester United just before Christmas. After four winless matches they could really use another. They could be boosted here by the return of record signing, Ismaila Sarr, who has been restricted to 11 starts this season. Watford have won four of those, and look a side transformed when they can benefit from the Senegalese forward\u2019s pace and directness on the right. The front three of Sarr, Gerard Deulofeu on the left and Troy Deeney in the middle looks capable of saving the club from relegation should they stay fit, but without any one of that trio the team looks immeasurably poorer.If Watford\u2019s results in those 11 games were extrapolated over a full 38-game season, they would end up with 52 points; if their results in 15 matches without him in the starting lineup were mirrored across a season they would finish with 23. SB \u2022 Manchester United v Watford (Sunday, 2pm) 3) Will Arsenal or Everton continue league upturn? Exactly two months ago, Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti watched their new teams from the Goodison directors\u2019 box and might have been forgiven slipping off to the nearest hostelry well before half-time. The goalless draw was comfortably one of this Premier League season\u2019s worst games but it is not unrealistic to expect far more entertainment from Sunday\u2019s rematch. While both Arsenal and Everton \u2013 who endured disastrous first halves of the season \u2013 remain deeply flawed, the statistics tell a tale. Between them, the new managers have lost only two of the 16 top-flight games. Both can now glimpse a European place previously out of the question and anyone who takes the three points this time will sense the wind in their sails. Ancelotti\u2019s side, with three wins and two draws from the last five, are in the better form and have not had a Europa League tie in Greece to contend with. But Arsenal showed the right blend of defensive stability and attacking fluency against Newcastle and passing this test would suggest the Arteta revolution does have legs. NA \u2022 Arsenal v Everton (Sunday, 4.30pm) 4) A battle of bottom of the class In Premier League rankings, it\u2019s the lowest scorers (Palace) against the joint second-lowest, the team with the fewest shots (Palace) against the joint second-fewest, the team with the fewest goals from inside the box (Newcastle) against the team with the (joint-) fewest from outside, the team with fewest passes (Newcastle) against the fifth-lowest passers, the team that has attempted the second-fewest crosses (Palace) against the third-fewest (with just three more attempts). The Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has been forced to make 106 saves; no one else is in triple figures; Newcastle have made 716 clearances, more than 40 more than anyone else. Over their last 10 games Palace have one win and eight points, putting them 19th in the form table; Newcastle have two wins (one of which was against Palace) and are 16th. In positive news, Newcastle\u2019s forward line could be boosted by the returns from injury of Yoshinori Muto (seven appearances this season, no shots) and Dwight Gayle (nine/two). SB \u2022 Crystal Palace v Newcastle United (Saturday, 3pm) 5) The latest on-field reaction from Manchester City There are people \u2013 many of them adults \u2013 who deem those seeking to take over football at any cost more likely truth-tellers than an independent body of legal experts with access to relevant evidence. Such is football fandom and such is the loyalty that has been manipulated by multi-billionaires casting themselves as plucky outsiders. Such is politics that we are intimately familiar with the strategy, but these particular circumstances have now changed. It is eminently possible that repurposed outrage inspires an excellent team to become even better \u2013 what better way to stick it up Uefa than by winning the Champions League? \u2013 but equally possible that righteous indignation becomes distracting. With, er, all due respect to West Ham, a home game against them was unlikely to be revealing, but a visit to Leicester \u2013 without a league win over anyone but West Ham since New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 will show us plenty about their immediate prospects. DH \u2022 Leicester City v Manchester City (Saturday, 5.30pm) 6) Saints seek return to winning ways There are few portents more troubling for a team than home defeat to West Ham, and that is exactly what happened to Southampton in mid-December to leave them third-bottom. But since then they have been superb, winning at Villa, Chelsea, Leicester and Palace as well as beating Spurs at home, a run which has taken them 12th. Nevertheless they remain just seven points above the relegation zone and they have now gone a month without a win. In Aston Villa, they will find a team not only desperate for points, but one fluid enough to pick the spaces in Southampton\u2019s 4-2-2-2 formation. Saints have lost eight home games so far this season, more than any team in the league, and Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said this week that the pressure created by the crowd is difficult for his players. This was not wise, because if you offer people an excuse, there\u2019s every chance they will accept it. He and they must acknowledge that no one is responsible for performances, apart from him and them. DH \u2022 Southampton v Aston Villa (Saturday, 3pm) 7) Burnley begins tough schedule for Bournemouth Twelve games left, and Bournemouth are two places and two points outside the bottom three. They have played six of their last seven games against the other members of the bottom six, a run which featured two wins and five defeats, and with their remaining matches including fixtures against eight of the top nine and none of the strugglers. Burnley, on the other hand, still have to play seven of the bottom eight and though they remain \u2013 on goal difference \u2013 in the bottom half they are just two points off eighth, five from sixth, and their main problem at the moment seems to be in keeping down talk of another European campaign. In Matej Vydra they have a striker who brought a miserable personal run to an end at Southampton last Saturday, his winner meaning he took part in a league victory for the first time this season \u2013 at the seventh attempt. SB \u2022 Burnley v Bournemouth (Saturday, 3pm) 8) Norwich need Buendia for Wolves test Wolves remainpoised for a tilt at the top four although it is worth pointing out that, since beating Manchester City in December, they have only won once in seven top-flight games. Norwich\u2019s porous defence offers hope that they will put that right, and there is also the fact that Sunday\u2019s visitors desperately require points. Daniel Farke\u2019s team can hardly be accused of not \u201cgoing for it\u201d and it is hard to think of a more enterprising side that has languished seven points shy of safety at this stage. Their strength is to go hell for leather and that is why, having benched him for the last two games, Farke needs to recall Emi Buendia. The Argentinian can frustrate defensively but his creative gifts are impossible to ignore: he is a chance-creating machine, most measures placing him comfortably in the division\u2019s top five, and it is hardly his fault that teammates tend to miss a fair chunk of them. It is no exaggeration to say Buendia can weight a through-ball as well as anybody; the shackles need to come off now and give Norwich hope of an unlikely escape \u2013 even if it also gives Wolves a greater chance of ending their mini barren run. NA \u2022 Wolves v Norwich (Sunday, 2pm) 9) Blades stunner not out of the question To praise Sheffield United is now clich\u00e9, and there is no greater praise than that.

Chelsea are struggling; Spurs, who\u2019ve been sneaking results despite themselves, will be without their two best players until the end of season; and so might Manchester United, who sit immediately below them.
