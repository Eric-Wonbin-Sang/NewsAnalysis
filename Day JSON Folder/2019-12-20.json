      "bodyText": "Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal have lost their way and that anybody who does not buy into his plans to change the club\u2019s culture will have no place in his regime. The former Manchester City assistant coach and Arsenal captain was formally presented on Friday evening after signing a three-and-a-half-year contract as head coach several hours previously. He inherits a club stuck in a deep rut and, in an impressive and commanding opening mission statement, he said his players will have to accept a new way of thinking in order to work under his command. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m sensing from the outside,\u201d he said when asked if Arsenal had become lost. \u201cI would like to start to make some steps and start to understand the reasons why. There will be reasons behind it, and a history behind it, and I have to try to understand quickly why this is, to implement certain things that will be quick wins, for the players, the staff and everybody. That is the challenge now.\u201d Questioned on whether he knew exactly what had gone wrong at Arsenal, who may slip into the bottom half of the Premier League if they fail to win at Everton on Saturday, he suggested that any malign elements will not last long under his regime. \u201cI have my ideas that I would like to keep to myself because I have to corroborate them when I see [the players] act, when I see them behave, when I see them live together,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do things my way but by convincing them that\u2019s it\u2019s the right way for everybody to live better. \u201cI don\u2019t want them hiding. I want people to take responsibility for their jobs and I want people who deliver passion and energy in the football club. Anyone who doesn\u2019t buy into this, or that has a negative effect or whatever, is not good enough for this environment or this culture.\u201d Arteta said he had been taken aback by the amount of negativity around the Emirates Stadium last Sunday when, alongside Pep Guardiola, he oversaw a comfortable 3-0 win for City. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t only the performance. It was the atmosphere and energy that I perceived when I was working around the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat worried me a little bit. I understand that they are used to success and fighting for things and at the moment it\u2019s difficult for them [the fans] to swallow the situation. So let me help.\u201d There are widespread suggestions that Arteta is inheriting a dressing room whose mentality is questionable. Several senior players have been linked with moves away; he admitted the team appear to be \u201csuffering\u201d and that \u201cwhen you are suffering, sometimes you want to go away\u201d. The challenge, he explained, is to create a new setting that gives them a platform to show the best of themselves. \u201cI am about to find out,\u201d he said of the players\u2019 attitudes. \u201cI have my resources and I have my opinions and there are things that are relevant for me that match what you are saying to what I believe.

      "body": "<p>The global success story that is the Premier League has had certain core drivers \u2013 money, slick marketing, talent, money, content, exposure, more money \u2013 and morphing from the monster have been particular phenomena. As Arsenal presented Mikel Arteta as their new manager on Friday evening, one of them felt particularly relevant. It is the personality cult of the manager.</p> \n<p>The manager of an English club has long been at the heart of the business, the person who makes the big decisions on the all-important technical side, and he has always had to face the media. But as the league\u2019s profile has entered a different stratosphere, so the demands on him to explain his choices and, very often, those of his club have ramped up.</p> \n<p>The English top-flight manager has become the de facto spokesman for the club because, very often, the executives prefer not to engage directly with the fans via the media and the arrangement is pronounced at Arsenal, where it is further heightened by the lack of access to the squad. When was the last time an Arsenal player was allowed to do an in-depth newspaper interview?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/arsenal-appoint-mikel-arteta-as-manager-to-replace-unai-emery\">Mikel Arteta vows to 'change the energy' and help Arsenal regain identity</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It has left the Arsenal manager, very often, as the only employee who speaks in public, attempting to meet the insatiable demand for insight, and it is hoped that he does so with a degree of polish. Which is fine when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is in situ but less so when it is Unai Emery, whose removal last month set the wheels in motion for Arteta\u2019s appointment.</p> \n<p>Emery\u2019s English was the subject of much mockery, which was unfair. The Spaniard did his level best to learn the language and, slowly, he was getting better. The issue, though, was his reluctance to engage with questions, whether in English or Spanish. Had he wanted to get his points across more lucidly in his native language via an interpreter \u2013 and there was one sitting alongside him throughout last season \u2013 it would have led to rejoicing among the press corps.</p> \n<p>He preferred the straight bat, the no comment, the general platitudes and, if it frequently led to confusion, the bottom line was that he came across as dull and boring. His media conferences were must-not-see events, numbers dwindled and the hard truth was that Arsenal slipped off the news agenda.</p> \n<p>Does this matter? At Wolves, for example, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo is not noted for his loquaciousness in front of the media and yet he is loved by the fans and the club is upwardly mobile. Meanwhile nobody was complaining about Emery\u2019s communication skills at the beginning of his Arsenal tenure when the team went on a 22-match unbeaten run. Results, plainly, are the primary determiner of a club\u2019s mood.</p> \n<p>But, on a more micro level, yes, this does matter. If a big club is not relevant in news terms, it is no great leap to see that its visibility and prestige can be affected, together with the energy around the place; the creative tensions. Players take their lead from the manager; how he connects with them, motivates and fires the wider atmosphere at the club. An inspirational orator can set the right tone, driving a feel-good factor when results are good; offering soothing assurance when they are not. Positive PR brings added edge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9576ac068f95f514b950d1fb6acbd805fa43089d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9576ac068f95f514b950d1fb6acbd805fa43089d/0_276_4851_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unai Emery was an unimpressive media performer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unai Emery was an unimpressive media performer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Arteta made the point during his unveiling that \u201cevery act is important,\u201d every little detail and he made it clear that every small word could contribute to his overall goal, which is to lead Arsenal back into the Champions League and have them competing for trophies.</p> \n<p>It was a command performance from Arteta, the antidote to the tedium of Emery and, time and again, he returned to his key themes \u2013 the need to change the culture and collective mentality, which he plainly believes has been a problem for years; to breathe positive energy into every pore of the club. In many respects he sounded like his friend and former Paris Saint-Germain teammate, Mauricio Pochettino, who has recently left Tottenham after overseeing a transformation of the club. Pochettino\u2019s obsession with the concept of universal energy is well-documented.</p> \n<p>Arteta\u2019s personality, and the force of it, was in full view as he moved from the TV cameras to a briefing with the written media, and there were moments of schmaltz when he talked of how it was a dream to be \u201cback home,\u201d the promise to \u201cburn every drop of blood for this football club to make it better,\u201d and how \u201cit\u2019s difficult to say no when Arsenal knocks on my door\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/20/weekend-football-countdown-arteta-to-be-unveiled-by-arsenal-live\">Arsenal's Mikel Arteta: 'I will give every drop of blood for this club' \u2013 weekend countdown as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it was the rallying cries that rang out; the clarity of his vision and a certain ruthlessness, too, which those who know him say has always been a part of his make-up and he believes has been finessed by working under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. To the players that buy into his methods, there will be possibility; to those that do not, there will be the exit door. Arteta intends to lead by words and deeds; to fashion a new identity out of the rubble of the Emery era and to win the trust of the players, who will then follow him.</p> \n<p>The mind went back to Emery\u2019s media presentation at the Emirates Stadium in May 2018, which was an altogether more stilted affair. \u201cWe want to be protoganists,\u201d Emery had said. Little else has stood the test of time.</p> \n<p>Arteta\u2019s soundbites were deeper and more expansive; from the heart and more natural. It was a performance that added up to a reference point, not only in his career but for his new players. Arteta knows Arsenal and the club\u2019s issues, having felt them from the inside as a player and watched them from the outside at City. Have they lost their way? \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m sensing,\u201d he said at one point. How Arteta means to lead them to better times will be underscored by his charisma.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "The global success story that is the Premier League has had certain core drivers \u2013 money, slick marketing, talent, money, content, exposure, more money \u2013 and morphing from the monster have been particular phenomena. As Arsenal presented Mikel Arteta as their new manager on Friday evening, one of them felt particularly relevant. It is the personality cult of the manager. The manager of an English club has long been at the heart of the business, the person who makes the big decisions on the all-important technical side, and he has always had to face the media. But as the league\u2019s profile has entered a different stratosphere, so the demands on him to explain his choices and, very often, those of his club have ramped up. The English top-flight manager has become the de facto spokesman for the club because, very often, the executives prefer not to engage directly with the fans via the media and the arrangement is pronounced at Arsenal, where it is further heightened by the lack of access to the squad. When was the last time an Arsenal player was allowed to do an in-depth newspaper interview? It has left the Arsenal manager, very often, as the only employee who speaks in public, attempting to meet the insatiable demand for insight, and it is hoped that he does so with a degree of polish. Which is fine when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is in situ but less so when it is Unai Emery, whose removal last month set the wheels in motion for Arteta\u2019s appointment. Emery\u2019s English was the subject of much mockery, which was unfair. The Spaniard did his level best to learn the language and, slowly, he was getting better. The issue, though, was his reluctance to engage with questions, whether in English or Spanish. Had he wanted to get his points across more lucidly in his native language via an interpreter \u2013 and there was one sitting alongside him throughout last season \u2013 it would have led to rejoicing among the press corps. He preferred the straight bat, the no comment, the general platitudes and, if it frequently led to confusion, the bottom line was that he came across as dull and boring. His media conferences were must-not-see events, numbers dwindled and the hard truth was that Arsenal slipped off the news agenda. Does this matter? At Wolves, for example, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo is not noted for his loquaciousness in front of the media and yet he is loved by the fans and the club is upwardly mobile. Meanwhile nobody was complaining about Emery\u2019s communication skills at the beginning of his Arsenal tenure when the team went on a 22-match unbeaten run. Results, plainly, are the primary determiner of a club\u2019s mood. But, on a more micro level, yes, this does matter. If a big club is not relevant in news terms, it is no great leap to see that its visibility and prestige can be affected, together with the energy around the place; the creative tensions. Players take their lead from the manager; how he connects with them, motivates and fires the wider atmosphere at the club. An inspirational orator can set the right tone, driving a feel-good factor when results are good; offering soothing assurance when they are not. Positive PR brings added edge. Arteta made the point during his unveiling that \u201cevery act is important,\u201d every little detail and he made it clear that every small word could contribute to his overall goal, which is to lead Arsenal back into the Champions League and have them competing for trophies. It was a command performance from Arteta, the antidote to the tedium of Emery and, time and again, he returned to his key themes \u2013 the need to change the culture and collective mentality, which he plainly believes has been a problem for years; to breathe positive energy into every pore of the club. In many respects he sounded like his friend and former Paris Saint-Germain teammate, Mauricio Pochettino, who has recently left Tottenham after overseeing a transformation of the club. Pochettino\u2019s obsession with the concept of universal energy is well-documented. Arteta\u2019s personality, and the force of it, was in full view as he moved from the TV cameras to a briefing with the written media, and there were moments of schmaltz when he talked of how it was a dream to be \u201cback home,\u201d the promise to \u201cburn every drop of blood for this football club to make it better,\u201d and how \u201cit\u2019s difficult to say no when Arsenal knocks on my door\u201d. But it was the rallying cries that rang out; the clarity of his vision and a certain ruthlessness, too, which those who know him say has always been a part of his make-up and he believes has been finessed by working under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. To the players that buy into his methods, there will be possibility; to those that do not, there will be the exit door. Arteta intends to lead by words and deeds; to fashion a new identity out of the rubble of the Emery era and to win the trust of the players, who will then follow him. The mind went back to Emery\u2019s media presentation at the Emirates Stadium in May 2018, which was an altogether more stilted affair. \u201cWe want to be protoganists,\u201d Emery had said. Little else has stood the test of time. Arteta\u2019s soundbites were deeper and more expansive; from the heart and more natural. It was a performance that added up to a reference point, not only in his career but for his new players. Arteta knows Arsenal and the club\u2019s issues, having felt them from the inside as a player and watched them from the outside at City. Have they lost their way? \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m sensing,\u201d he said at one point. How Arteta means to lead them to better times will be underscored by his charisma.",

Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency\u2019s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside.

Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.",

It needs to be discussed at length, because the only way to lessen the burden of our collective trauma is by sharing it. So with that in mind, here are the Cats moments that most sorely need to be dissected.</p> \n<p><strong>Where are all the humans?<br></strong>Cats is set in London. It\u2019s an easily identifiable London, full of buildings and statues and lights and advertisements. However, apart from the cats, it is entirely deserted.

      "bodyText": "Usually with an article like this, I\u2019d begin by warning you that the following contains plot spoilers. But I\u2019m not sure whether this does or not, because this is an article about Cats. Cats does not have a plot. It has plenty of other things \u2013 it has singing, and dancing, and a bunch of cats who all uniformly look like discarded test subjects from a harrowing genetic splicing accident \u2013 but not really a plot. Unless you count \u201cSome cats repeatedly introduce themselves at great length because their greatest wish is to be murdered in a Wicker Man-style death ritual\u201d. Which you absolutely should not. But still, it is perfectly evident that Cats needs to be discussed. It needs to be discussed at length, because the only way to lessen the burden of our collective trauma is by sharing it. So with that in mind, here are the Cats moments that most sorely need to be dissected. Where are all the humans? Cats is set in London. It\u2019s an easily identifiable London, full of buildings and statues and lights and advertisements. However, apart from the cats, it is entirely deserted. The streets are empty, the theatre abandoned. It\u2019s eerie. Where did everybody go? My guess \u2013 and I\u2019ll assume that I\u2019m correct \u2013 is that in their pursuit of ritual murder, the cats turned against their owners and savaged them to death. Why was Rebel Wilson masturbating? Rebel Wilson is the comic relief in Cats, in that she falls over a lot, but her showcase number is honestly one of the most traumatic things I have ever witnessed in my entire life. For starters, when we first meet her, she is splayed out on her back with her hands between her legs, rubbing herself frantically. The sexuality of the cats in Cats is generally quite explicit \u2013 they\u2019re all constantly about a microsecond away from humping each other \u2013 but Wilson\u2019s self-pleasure is quite graphic for a U-rated film. Why did Rebel Wilson rip off all her clothes? Luckily, Wilson understands that we\u2019d find the masturbation unsettling, which is presumably why she immediately does something far more terrifying. Halfway through her song, she stops and unzips herself, ultimately revealing that she was wearing a horrifying Ed Gein-style skin suit all along; something that apparently provoked enough arousal for her to start masturbating. Chilling. Why do none of the cats have any sort of consistency when it comes to clothes? The attitude to clothing in Cats is baffling from start to finish. Rebel Wilson can unzip her own skin.

      "bodyText": "The two billionaire candidates in the Democratic presidential race together spent roughly $15m on television ads in California leading up to Thursday\u2019s debate. If that money were spent on homeless people suffering from the state\u2019s severe and worsening housing crisis, advocates say, it could help thousands in need find a roof over their heads. Ahead of the sixth Democratic primary debate in Los Angeles on Thursday, the billionaires at the bottom of the polls, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, poured $13.5m and $1.6m respectively into TV ads in the state, according to Advertising Analytics, which monitors political ads. The ad buys renewed criticism of both the vast amounts spent in the presidential race and independently wealthy candidates\u2019 relying on their own fortunes to fund key aspects of their campaigns. The Guardian asked housing researchers and experts what difference $15m could make in one of California\u2019s most pressing crises \u2013 homelessness. Thursday\u2019s debate brought a national audience to a county with extreme income inequality, home to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people as well as an estimated 59,000 homeless residents \u2013 many on the streets for the first time due to evictions and unaffordable rents. The experts agreed it would be less than drop in the bucket given the scale of the public health emergency, but said it could still provide life-changing help for a sizable number of families in the most dire situations. In Los Angeles for example, $15m could provide new shelter for roughly 1,800 homeless people, estimated the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, the area home to massive tent encampments in downtown LA.

The goal of these shelters is to transition people into permanent housing, give them access to case managers, housing services, medical and mental healthcare, three meals a day, and beds and a roof over their heads. \u201cThey stay as long as it takes to get on their feet and into housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat campaign money might go further if it was used to address the real situation, rather than spent on TV ads.\u201d With more than 44,000 homeless people estimated to be living outside in LA county in cars, tents or makeshift quarters, the need for more beds and protected shelter space is dire. More than 1,000 homeless people died in the county last year. Some advocates, however, have urged governments to prioritize permanent housing instead of the expansion of emergency shelters, which can sometimes offer poor conditions. In LA, $15m could also fund a total of roughly 30 new individual units of supportive housing for homeless people, estimated Gary Painter, director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute at the University of Southern California. With families, those units could potentially offer housing for about 50 people. Even if that number seemed small, Painter noted that access to supportive housing can change the trajectory for families for years, potentially saving future generations from instability and homelessness: \u201cOne could imagine that investment on vulnerable families paying off in the long term.\u201d Bales estimated that $15m could also provide supportive community homes for roughly 100 homeless people suffering from mental illness in LA. One-off philanthropic donations won\u2019t resolve homelessness in California, which is a chronic and systemic problem, and advocates caution that the government has a responsibility to tackle the structural issues that drive the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re not a poor state that can\u2019t afford to solve this problem,\u201d said Eve Garrow, homelessness policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, noting that the state has the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and needs to focus on permanent, affordable housing. Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, noted that California has already poured billions into homelessness and that it\u2019s not nearly enough, given that for every 10 of the lowest-income renters in the state, there are fewer than two affordable homes available: \u201cIt\u2019s really the role of the federal government to step in and invest in the scale of solutions that are needed.\u201d But thinking through the potential impacts if this ad funding was spent on direct actions can be a helpful reminder of how the massive amounts of money flowing into America\u2019s political system. Steyer, a California billionaire who has poured his own money into advocating impeachment of Trump, fighting the climate crisis, voter registration initiatives and other issues, has argued that the money he is spending on his campaign is not taking away from his support of progressive causes. Bloomberg entered the race last month and didn\u2019t qualify for the debate this month, but has spent $117m on ads across the country, recently flooding the LA market. In the past 90 days, Steyer\u2019s campaign also spent more on Facebook ads targeted to California, according to Anna Massoglia, a researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics.

We saw a spike in terms of welcoming more people into the game after 2003 but what I really want to see is a greater diversity of people coming into rugby. I\u2019ve said it plenty of times before because it is something I\u2019m really passionate about but a third of the England squad in Japan were from BAME backgrounds. On the back of that I would love to see rugby grow and develop in areas such as inner cities as well as the traditional heartlands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/20/premierships-four-fallen-giants-face-up-to-very-real-relegation-risk\">Premiership\u2019s four fallen giants face up to very real relegation risk | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Stop time-sapping scrum resets</h2> <p>Law amendments. Where to start \u2026 if I were to make just one change it would be in an effort to reduce the amount of time wasted over reset scrums. During <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/exeter-sale-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Exeter\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/exeter-sale-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">win over Sale</a> last weekend it took four and a half minutes for one scrum to be completed. Stopping the clock could help but I also think that taking away the option of selecting another scrum from a free-kick could make a difference. Caterpillar rucks can also go too \u2013 no league likes to box-kick more than the Premiership and it is having an adverse effect.</p> <h2>3) Give fans the full picture on salary cap</h2> <p>Surely now is the perfect time to bring a greater transparency to the Premiership salary cap. I appreciate that a review of the regulations was recently announced but there is still a 103-page document sitting in Premiership Rugby\u2019s offices and it is not publicly available. As far as I\u2019m concerned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/saracens-docked-35-points-and-5m-fine-for-salary-cap-breach\" title=\"\">Saracens\u2019 breach happened</a>, they have been punished and it is time to move forward and the best way to do that for all the clubs is with as much transparency as possible. We often say it is a game for the fans but sometimes I wonder if they are given the full picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dd08199c19ef1d7db86dc2c31c4dd35abf956e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dd08199c19ef1d7db86dc2c31c4dd35abf956e9/0_226_5329_3198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saracens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saracens campaign has been derailed by their heavy points deduction, but the regulations need more transparency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) No wasted caps for England on return to Japan</h2> <p>When England return to Japan for a two-Test tour in the summer it will be with an unfamiliar squad. There is every chance that not a single player involved in the World Cup will be involved. That presents Eddie Jones and a lot of players with an opportunity but the one thing I do not want to see is wasted caps. I look to the 2017 tour of Argentina when so many players were away with the Lions and some of that squad have just disappeared. Will Collier has not been seen for England since, nor Jack Maunder, and Denny Solomona has been in and out. A lot of the responsibility lies with the player \u2013 if you are given an opportunity you have to take it \u2013 but Jones must also avoid wasting caps and, if he picks players who are not contributing to England over this four-year cycle, then it is a waste.</p> <h2>5) More flair in Six Nations and Champions Cup</h2> <p>In the coming months we have a fascinating Six Nations to look forward to with so many new coaches involved, followed by the business end of the club season. In each competition I want to see attacking rugby prevail. I wouldn\u2019t begrudge Wales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/wales-crush-ireland-win-grand-slam-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">their 2019 grand slam</a> \u2013 Shaun Edwards has always said that defence wins championships and he is so often right \u2013 but they had the second worst attack in the tournament. During the pool stages at the World Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/22/japan-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">it was all about Japan</a> and the speed and style with which they were playing. But then in the knockout rounds it was pragmatism and defence. At the moment I\u2019m loving watching Racing 92 and Leinster in the Champions Cup, Bristol and Northampton in the Premiership. It is often the case that a winning team provides the blueprint for many others to copy. In 2019 one would have to say that was Wales and South Africa but next year I hope it\u2019s a team that favours an attacking brand that sets the example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed3a344508fe63133154d964a3f47216db618e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed3a344508fe63133154d964a3f47216db618e9/0_165_3478_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales v Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defence won the Six Nations for Wales, which was sealed when they beat Ireland in March, and was the bedrock of South Africa\u2019s World Cup triumph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) No more \u2018tier two\u2019 and a truly global calendar</h2> <p>Changes are clearly afoot when it comes to the global calendar \u2013 CVC have spent an awful lot of money for a seat at the top table \u2013 and some improvements can undoubtedly be made. It\u2019s incredibly tough, like trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube with one hand, but let\u2019s put the players front and centre. Players always want to know what is going on in the future. I think we\u2019re moving towards a British and Irish league as well as a world club cup and that would have connotations for a revamped, perhaps streamlined, Champions Cup. If all the stakeholders can get together and iron out a global calendar that has the players at heart, perhaps by introducing a Christmas break, then rugby will be the better for it. In that calendar we need to build on the success stories of the World Cup. Japan simply have to join either the Six Nations or the Rugby Championship but there also needs to be a way for teams like Georgia and Fiji to have year-round access to matches against the top 10 teams in the world. And let\u2019s do away with the term \u201ctier-two\u201d for good.</p> <h2><strong>7) Off-air exchanges may help TMOs and referees</strong></h2> <p>One particular incident at the World Cup showed that referees are coming more and more into the spotlight: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/21/world-rugby-probe-photo-of-jaco-peyper-appearing-to-mock-sebastien-vahaamahina-france-wales\" title=\"\">Jaco Peyper\u2019s misguided photo</a> where he imitated the elbow by S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina that earned him a red card against Wales. They are in the spotlight more because, on top of everything, they are in effect broadcasters as well. Everything they say is broadcast on TV and inevitably they are scrutinised more. Supporters will always want to hear more, know more and get greater insight but my concern is that it has gone too far. In commentary I have a button \u2013 we call it the lazy button \u2013 and I can use it to talk to a producer or a director to ask for replays and I can have that conversation without it being broadcast. I think TMOs need that same button so they can speak to the referee and say: \u201cFor the last couple of minutes everyone has been offside \u2013 you might just want to have a look at that.\u201d I don\u2019t think we see as many interventions from TMOs because every word is broadcast and it is becoming counterintuitive.</p>",

That presents Eddie Jones and a lot of players with an opportunity but the one thing I do not want to see is wasted caps. I look to the 2017 tour of Argentina when so many players were away with the Lions and some of that squad have just disappeared. Will Collier has not been seen for England since, nor Jack Maunder, and Denny Solomona has been in and out. A lot of the responsibility lies with the player \u2013 if you are given an opportunity you have to take it \u2013 but Jones must also avoid wasting caps and, if he picks players who are not contributing to England over this four-year cycle, then it is a waste. 5) More flair in Six Nations and Champions Cup In the coming months we have a fascinating Six Nations to look forward to with so many new coaches involved, followed by the business end of the club season. In each competition I want to see attacking rugby prevail. I wouldn\u2019t begrudge Wales their 2019 grand slam \u2013 Shaun Edwards has always said that defence wins championships and he is so often right \u2013 but they had the second worst attack in the tournament. During the pool stages at the World Cup it was all about Japan and the speed and style with which they were playing. But then in the knockout rounds it was pragmatism and defence. At the moment I\u2019m loving watching Racing 92 and Leinster in the Champions Cup, Bristol and Northampton in the Premiership. It is often the case that a winning team provides the blueprint for many others to copy. In 2019 one would have to say that was Wales and South Africa but next year I hope it\u2019s a team that favours an attacking brand that sets the example. 6) No more \u2018tier two\u2019 and a truly global calendar Changes are clearly afoot when it comes to the global calendar \u2013 CVC have spent an awful lot of money for a seat at the top table \u2013 and some improvements can undoubtedly be made. It\u2019s incredibly tough, like trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube with one hand, but let\u2019s put the players front and centre. Players always want to know what is going on in the future. I think we\u2019re moving towards a British and Irish league as well as a world club cup and that would have connotations for a revamped, perhaps streamlined, Champions Cup. If all the stakeholders can get together and iron out a global calendar that has the players at heart, perhaps by introducing a Christmas break, then rugby will be the better for it. In that calendar we need to build on the success stories of the World Cup. Japan simply have to join either the Six Nations or the Rugby Championship but there also needs to be a way for teams like Georgia and Fiji to have year-round access to matches against the top 10 teams in the world. And let\u2019s do away with the term \u201ctier-two\u201d for good. 7) Off-air exchanges may help TMOs and referees One particular incident at the World Cup showed that referees are coming more and more into the spotlight: Jaco Peyper\u2019s misguided photo where he imitated the elbow by S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina that earned him a red card against Wales. They are in the spotlight more because, on top of everything, they are in effect broadcasters as well. Everything they say is broadcast on TV and inevitably they are scrutinised more. Supporters will always want to hear more, know more and get greater insight but my concern is that it has gone too far. In commentary I have a button \u2013 we call it the lazy button \u2013 and I can use it to talk to a producer or a director to ask for replays and I can have that conversation without it being broadcast. I think TMOs need that same button so they can speak to the referee and say: \u201cFor the last couple of minutes everyone has been offside \u2013 you might just want to have a look at that.\u201d I don\u2019t think we see as many interventions from TMOs because every word is broadcast and it is becoming counterintuitive.",

This time around there\u2019s a comedic twist, in that two elderly men are trapped inside the bodies of Johnson and Hart, allowing countless old man jokes about not understanding what a video game is, etc, etc.</p> \n<p>The laughs are sporadic, the stakes are never high, the set pieces are rarely impressive (although I did like one of them: an almost Escher-like array of rickety wooden bridges) \u2013 and the plot continually resets itself to the same basic coordinates, removing any sense of progress.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6QaLsw8EWY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6QaLsw8EWY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker \u2013 two stars</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/18/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-death-is-not-the-end-in-new-trilogys-laborious-exit\">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker review \u2013 death is not the end in new trilogy's laborious exit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Immediately after the conclusion of the latest<em> rah-rah-rah, pow-pow-pow, vr\u00e3u-vr\u00e3u-vr\u00e3u</em> (that\u2019s the sound of a swinging lightsaber) excursion into the Star Wars universe, my companion turned to me and said: \u201cI enjoyed it more than the last one, but maybe that\u2019s just because I\u2019m in a better mood.\u201d</p> \n<p>Indeed. We change but these movies, in the franchise\u2019s committee-managed and risk-averse post-George Lucas era, remain more or less the same.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not a Boxing Day release per se, but certainly one people will be still be flocking to. Fans will of course relish the lightsaber duels (<em>kksssshhhh-ksssshhhh-ksssshhhh!</em>) between hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and baddie Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). One of them takes place on a pier-like platform, with giant waves from a raging sea rising and crashing around them, because CINEMATIC. Director J.J. Abrams struggles to control a scrambled plotline, which builds up to the franchise\u2019s most ridiculous \u201clet me tell you my entire evil plan!\u201d moment yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"01e0e181-b29f-44d9-9f9f-3d73236cf152\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XLQDgWA8K30?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Cats \u2013 one star</strong></h2> \n<p>The weirdest thing about director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s beloved dance-mewsical isn\u2019t its Kafkaesque distortion of human faces, or the bizarre scale and perspective of its production design. It is how in the Sam Hill the film-maker managed to turn such a vibrant production into a chronically drab movie, his gallingly staid direction sucking the life out of everything.</p> \n<p>A CGI-slathered star-studded cast \u2013 including Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson \u2013 slink into the spotlight and belt out a number one<strong> </strong>by one. They play cats who are trying to impress Old Deuteronomy (Dench), who will make \u201cthe Jellicle choice\u201d, and allow one of them to go to a heaven-like place and be reborn.</p> \n<p>Just run with it. Or better yet, avoid this film at all costs. Taylor Swift is a brief highlight as Bombalurina, punching through the film\u2019s dour atmosphere and overpowering special effects. But nothing in Cats comes remotely close to justifying the price of admission.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/19/a-furry-orgy-in-a-dumpster-what-the-reviews-say-about-cats\">'A furry orgy in a dumpster': what the reviews say about Cats</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAtW1sa78iQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cAtW1sa78iQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Jojo Rabbit \u2013 three stars</strong></h2> \n<p>Making a Nazi- or Hitler-themed comedy is somewhere between a poisoned chalice and a Holy Grail for comedians. It\u2019s only for the brave or the foolhardy. As the writer/director Taika Waititi demonstrates in Jojo Rabbit, which is set in Nazi Germany during the final years of the second world war, framing and emphasis are fundamental. Who or what are we laughing at? Where does his moral compass lie?</p> \n<p>Ten-year-old protagonist Johannes, aka \u201cJojo\u201d (Roman Griffin Davis), whose imaginary friend is a cartoonish version of Hitler (Waititi), wants nothing more than to be a Nazi. But the script (adapted from Christine Leunens\u2019 novel) contextualises his aspirations inside a broader message about the susceptibility of children, and the danger of terrible role models. Importantly, Jojo\u2019s mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is a dissenter hiding a teenage Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic.</p> \n<p>The film has soft edges and a big heart, tracking a fundamentally good-natured young subject as he slowly realises what\u2019s important in life. It sometimes feels like a short film padded out into feature-length format \u2013 but nevertheless it is well-made and warming.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/16/jojo-rabbit-nazi-comedies-charlie-chaplin\">From Charlie Chaplin to Jojo Rabbit: an unlikely history of Nazi comedies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL4McUzXfFI\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tL4McUzXfFI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2013 five stars</strong></h2> \n<p>Writer/director C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s highly acclaimed period piece is brilliant on several levels: as a study of creative processes; as an exploration of the power dynamic between an artist and their subject; as a contemplation of memory; and as a romance between two women, situated on a far-flung island in Brittany circa the 18th century.</p> \n<p>Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) is commissioned to paint H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) in secret; the latter does not want to pose for a portrait and does not want to be married. The pair share long, ambiguous gazes before eventually realising their passions.</p> \n<p>This is not some stuffy and inaccessible high art production. Sciamma fires on all cinematic cylinders, combining Claire Mathon\u2019s immaculate cinematography with Julien Lacheray\u2019s beautifully measured editing to create a visually ravishing work with an expertly controlled pace. Riveting viewing and one of the year\u2019s best films.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-fQPTwma9o\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R-fQPTwma9o?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The Truth \u2013 two stars</strong></h2> \n<p>The director Hirokazu Koreeda\u2019s previous film was Shoplifters: a quietly powerful slice-of-life drama about an impoverished family scraping through day-to-day life in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>The characters and settings in The Truth, Koreeda\u2019s first film to be shot outside Japan, could hardly be more different: it is based in upper-class Paris and revolves around a family of well-to-do people. These include the obnoxious actor/diva Fabienne (Catherine Deneuve), her daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche) and Lumir\u2019s husband Hank (Ethan Hawke).</p> \n<p>Koreeda\u2019s dignified human-centric approach is still there, but this time around the story is meandering and the pace slow, if not glacial. The characters in The Truth are a bore and their (rarely compelling) circumstances involve sipping wine and delivering first-world-problem lines of dialogue such as \u201cI had too much lasagne\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEVedePfqlY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EEVedePfqlY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Sorry We Missed You</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/sorry-we-missed-you-review-ken-loach\">Sorry We Missed You review \u2013 Ken Loach's superb swipe at zero-hours Britain | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I haven\u2019t seen this one yet, but the buzz is very positive.

      "bodyText": "Jumanji: The Next Level \u2013 two stars Like its predecessor, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, director Jake Kasdan\u2019s backrows-playing comedy reduces its characters to video-game tropes and expects to be commended for its meta qualities. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black reprise their roles as cartoonish virtual avatars inhabited by characters who are transported into a magical video-game universe, and must complete a series of objectives in order to return to reality. This time around there\u2019s a comedic twist, in that two elderly men are trapped inside the bodies of Johnson and Hart, allowing countless old man jokes about not understanding what a video game is, etc, etc. The laughs are sporadic, the stakes are never high, the set pieces are rarely impressive (although I did like one of them: an almost Escher-like array of rickety wooden bridges) \u2013 and the plot continually resets itself to the same basic coordinates, removing any sense of progress. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker \u2013 two stars Immediately after the conclusion of the latest rah-rah-rah, pow-pow-pow, vr\u00e3u-vr\u00e3u-vr\u00e3u (that\u2019s the sound of a swinging lightsaber) excursion into the Star Wars universe, my companion turned to me and said: \u201cI enjoyed it more than the last one, but maybe that\u2019s just because I\u2019m in a better mood.\u201d Indeed. We change but these movies, in the franchise\u2019s committee-managed and risk-averse post-George Lucas era, remain more or less the same. It\u2019s not a Boxing Day release per se, but certainly one people will be still be flocking to. Fans will of course relish the lightsaber duels (kksssshhhh-ksssshhhh-ksssshhhh!) between hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and baddie Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). One of them takes place on a pier-like platform, with giant waves from a raging sea rising and crashing around them, because CINEMATIC. Director J.J. Abrams struggles to control a scrambled plotline, which builds up to the franchise\u2019s most ridiculous \u201clet me tell you my entire evil plan!\u201d moment yet. Cats \u2013 one star The weirdest thing about director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s beloved dance-mewsical isn\u2019t its Kafkaesque distortion of human faces, or the bizarre scale and perspective of its production design. It is how in the Sam Hill the film-maker managed to turn such a vibrant production into a chronically drab movie, his gallingly staid direction sucking the life out of everything. A CGI-slathered star-studded cast \u2013 including Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson \u2013 slink into the spotlight and belt out a number one by one. They play cats who are trying to impress Old Deuteronomy (Dench), who will make \u201cthe Jellicle choice\u201d, and allow one of them to go to a heaven-like place and be reborn. Just run with it. Or better yet, avoid this film at all costs. Taylor Swift is a brief highlight as Bombalurina, punching through the film\u2019s dour atmosphere and overpowering special effects. But nothing in Cats comes remotely close to justifying the price of admission. Jojo Rabbit \u2013 three stars Making a Nazi- or Hitler-themed comedy is somewhere between a poisoned chalice and a Holy Grail for comedians. It\u2019s only for the brave or the foolhardy. As the writer/director Taika Waititi demonstrates in Jojo Rabbit, which is set in Nazi Germany during the final years of the second world war, framing and emphasis are fundamental. Who or what are we laughing at? Where does his moral compass lie? Ten-year-old protagonist Johannes, aka \u201cJojo\u201d (Roman Griffin Davis), whose imaginary friend is a cartoonish version of Hitler (Waititi), wants nothing more than to be a Nazi. But the script (adapted from Christine Leunens\u2019 novel) contextualises his aspirations inside a broader message about the susceptibility of children, and the danger of terrible role models. Importantly, Jojo\u2019s mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is a dissenter hiding a teenage Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic. The film has soft edges and a big heart, tracking a fundamentally good-natured young subject as he slowly realises what\u2019s important in life. It sometimes feels like a short film padded out into feature-length format \u2013 but nevertheless it is well-made and warming. Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2013 five stars Writer/director C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s highly acclaimed period piece is brilliant on several levels: as a study of creative processes; as an exploration of the power dynamic between an artist and their subject; as a contemplation of memory; and as a romance between two women, situated on a far-flung island in Brittany circa the 18th century. Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) is commissioned to paint H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) in secret; the latter does not want to pose for a portrait and does not want to be married. The pair share long, ambiguous gazes before eventually realising their passions. This is not some stuffy and inaccessible high art production. Sciamma fires on all cinematic cylinders, combining Claire Mathon\u2019s immaculate cinematography with Julien Lacheray\u2019s beautifully measured editing to create a visually ravishing work with an expertly controlled pace. Riveting viewing and one of the year\u2019s best films. The Truth \u2013 two stars The director Hirokazu Koreeda\u2019s previous film was Shoplifters: a quietly powerful slice-of-life drama about an impoverished family scraping through day-to-day life in Tokyo. The characters and settings in The Truth, Koreeda\u2019s first film to be shot outside Japan, could hardly be more different: it is based in upper-class Paris and revolves around a family of well-to-do people. These include the obnoxious actor/diva Fabienne (Catherine Deneuve), her daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche) and Lumir\u2019s husband Hank (Ethan Hawke). Koreeda\u2019s dignified human-centric approach is still there, but this time around the story is meandering and the pace slow, if not glacial. The characters in The Truth are a bore and their (rarely compelling) circumstances involve sipping wine and delivering first-world-problem lines of dialogue such as \u201cI had too much lasagne\u201d. Sorry We Missed You I haven\u2019t seen this one yet, but the buzz is very positive. Sorry We Missed You comes from veteran English film-maker Ken Loach, who, now in his early-80s, continues to make intelligent and dramatically interesting films exploring important social issues. This one revolves around an up-against-it delivery worker (Kris Hitchen) and his family, examining zero hours contracts and the personal costs of the gig economy. Loach reunites with screenwriter Paul Laverty following their highly successful drama I, Daniel Blake, which the won Palme d\u2019Or at the 2016 Cannes Film festival. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw awarded Sorry We Missed You five stars, describing it as a film that \u201cdepicts the human cost of an economic development that we are encouraged to accept as a fact of life ... I was hit in the solar plexus by this movie, wiped out by the simple honesty and integrity of the performances.\u201d",

The Blue Mountains have burned many times. In 2013 they lost 203 homes. In the past week they have lost 11 more. The forest is \u201cincredibly, unprecedentedly dry\u201d, Greenhill says. The soil is a dry powder. \u201cThere has been a profound lack of rain,\u201d he says. \u201cI drive through [the mountains] now and the trees are just brown.\u201d The sky is no longer an unending blue. \u201cWhat I have now is a sky that is close to me and is brown,\u201d Greenhill says. \u201cYou sometimes wonder if it\u2019s ever going to be the same again.\u201d Ian Woolley is a volunteer firefighter with the Kulnura brigade on the Central Coast of NSW. Two weeks ago he and his colleagues were defending their town from an emergency level fire which later that night joined the Gospers Mountain megafire. Some neighbours lost buildings when winds changed and sent the fire through town from different directions. \u201cMy wife, this was the first major fire she\u2019s faced, she was home by herself and was scared,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s still fire burning in the gully from my place. There will still be trees smoking, dead trees burning on the inside.\u201d Trees like that are called \u201cwidow-makers\u201d by older firefighters because they drop without warning. When the roar of the flames has passed you can hear them creaking in the wind. It has been \u201ca lot of long days\u201d, Woolley says. He and the rest of his volunteer brigade have been doing full-time firefighting for weeks. His regular employer is continuing to pay him but other members aren\u2019t so lucky. They are either going without pay, have had to stop defending their community, or are trying to do both and running on empty. They have sufficient resources to cover the fires at the moment, Woolley says, but not if the fire season is this bad every year. \u201cIf it does become the new normal there needs to be more resourcing,\u201d he says.",

The Nationals find themselves besieged by furious constituents. Rural independents position themselves to challenge major party incumbents. Far-right populists preen and circle \u2013 Pauline Hanson, the Shooters party. As a consequence of the unwelcome competition, Nationals want to flex their muscle within the government and be seen to be delivering, which can create difficulties for the Liberals in urban areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/19/419c-australia-records-hottest-ever-day-one-day-after-previous-record\">Australia records hottest day ever - one day after previous record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Water politics (as my wise colleague Gabrielle Chan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/09/farmers-protest-is-a-sign-water-politics-is-about-to-go-into-hyperdrive\">put this, predictively, in August</a>) is in hyperdrive in regional Australia. The irrigators engaged in an existential fight to preserve their livelihoods (like the group that came to Canberra during the final sitting weeks of the parliament and camped outside the main entrance and outside the National Farmers Federation HQ, a protest convoy demanding an audience) \u2013 want more of the scarce water. They feel wedged between the ecology, the speculators and a basin plan they evidently associate with misery.</p> <p>But in cities, progressive Liberal voters fret about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/08/australians-overwhelmingly-agree-climate-emergency-is-the-nations-number-one-threat\">persistent government inaction on climate change</a>. Restiveness about a lack of climate action puts pressure on the other arm of the government, the arm inclined to worry the Coalition has lost control of the climate change narrative.</p> <p>A prelude to this summer nocturne played out during the last federal election, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/28/it-cant-get-any-worse-why-farrer-is-turning-against-the-coalition\">Nationals found themselves under significant challenge in seats</a> with direct exposure to the Murray-Darling. It gets forgotten, because the government has been entirely successful in projecting the sweetest victory of all post-election narrative, but Sussan Ley, the Liberal member for Farrer, suffered a negative swing on primaries of 7%. A high profile independent contesting the seat got almost 20,000 votes in the seat. National Mark Coultan had a similar experience in Parkes \u2013 a negative swing on primaries, and a bump for an independent.</p> <p>In the cities, climate-related anxiety swung votes too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/18/australian-election-tony-abbott-loses-his-warringah-seat-to-zali-steggall\">Tony Abbott lost his seat</a>, Josh Frydenberg suffered a negative swing of over 8% and Tim Wilson a negative swing of 3.66%. In Trent Zimmerman\u2019s seat of North Sydney, the Labor candidate got a positive swing of over 8%, while in Brisbane, Trevor Evans had a negative swing of 2% and the Greens a positive swing of nearly 3%.</p> <p>While the May election was fought on a range of issues, certainly not climate and environment alone, the election result tells us the Coalition did a better job than Labor of straddling its split constituency, neutralising and weaponising where required; and was more effective in channeling the inevitable protest votes back to the Coalition.</p> <p>So it is possible \u2013 Christmas holiday SNAFU and abject prime ministerial apologies notwithstanding \u2013 that Team Morrison will end the year resolved to maintaining the status quo with its actions and messaging. It\u2019s possible the Coalition will try and wait out the backlash. After all, what problem needs to be fixed here? The negative swings in May happened in seats the government holds by a large margin, so what\u2019s the case for a course correction? On this benign view Morrison can go on managing the different aspirations among the Coalition\u2019s supporters by walking every side of every street.</p> <p>To recap quickly, the Coalition\u2019s formula for neutralising the climate backlash in May was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/scott-morrison-blasted-by-pacific-heat-while-trying-to-project-calm-on-climate\">campaign calm down in the cities</a>. Morrison told voters he was not Abbott, and the Coalition would meet its international commitments with sensible practical policies that wouldn\u2019t crash the economy.

Everyone apart from the unmourned apex wrecker Abbott hung on, and while Labor and the Greens picked up votes on climate change in some parts of the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/14/australias-democracy-has-faceplanted-and-labor-is-staring-down-some-disturbing-truths\">a majority of voters either rejected Bill Shorten\u2019s plans to take corrective action</a>, or didn\u2019t particularly but prioritised another set of issues when casting their votes.</p> <p>So the Morrison et al political strategy prevailed. It absolutely did.</p> <p>But will it work forever? And by work, I mean continue to command a national majority of 50% plus one.</p> <p>Will Australians continue to either vote against climate action, or prioritise other things, when they are experiencing the practical consequences of policy failure in their daily lives? To frame this thought another way, if sanguine, or she\u2019ll be right mate (our natural default in Australia), is a piece of string, just how long is that piece of string?</p> <p>I\u2019m not asking this question rhetorically. I\u2019m asking it because I don\u2019t know the answer.</p> <p>I do know this. Australia\u2019s climate is changing, there are practical consequences associated with warming and these consequences are now too present to be ignored.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/18/climate-change-has-cut-australian-farm-profits-by-22-a-year-over-past-20-years-report-says\">A new authoritative study published this week</a> found that climate change has reduced the average annual profitability of farms by 22% over the past two decades (and yes, I know effective climate action is a global imperative, not just a local one). Cropping farms have been the worst hit, with revenue down 8% or around $82,000 a farm, and profits down 35%, or $70,900 for a typical cropping farm. Regional Australia is well aware it is now engaged in an adaptation exercise, because agribusinesses deal with that reality every day.</p> <p>One of the small fascinations of the year, certainly for me, and I suspect for a number of us that live outside Sydney, has been watching the perils of climate inaction becoming a major national story largely because Australia\u2019s largest city was inconvenienced by noxious bushfire smoke. All of a sudden, the issue gained traction and surround-sound coverage \u2013 television, radio, digital, print \u2013 at least in outlets that still perform journalism.</p> <p>I know the government has just endured a pretty spiky and uncomfortable month. You can only imagine how ropable Morrison would have been when it became obvious he would have to eat humble pie on Friday. You can actually picture that scene, or at least I can, quite vividly.</p> <p>What I don\u2019t know is whether the current community concern about the lack of leadership will be transient, vanishing once glorious Sydney harbour reverts to sparkling, and people resume bushwalking in the Blue Mountains without masks and asthma inhalers, or whether the summer of 2019 and 2020 will be remembered in the future as an awakening of sorts.</p> <p>Obviously, I hope it\u2019s the latter. In the spirit of good cheer, generosity and hope, I also hope that Morrison and the government he leads will take the opportunity of shifting on climate policy in 2020, and by shifting I mean actually doing something rather than pretending to be doing something.</p> <p>The government has an entirely viable opportunity to pivot in 2020, to end the domestic war of political convenience in the new year, because the world will be contemplating what fresh emissions reduction commitments to offer between now and 2050. Opportunity beckons.</p> <p>I am <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/28/the-doofus-roll-call-scott-morrisons-worst-week-as-prime-minister\">often tough on this prime minister</a>, because he furnishes plenty of reasons to be. But I\u2019ve said before, and will now say again, I think Morrison is capable of finding a 50% plus one on climate change that is about more than winning a single election at a particular point in time, but about actually trying to fix a problem that requires fixing.</p> <p>But first he has to make some decisions. Morrison has got to decide whether he covets power for its own sake or whether he wants to use the power Australian voters have given him to do good.</p> <p>He\u2019s got to decide whether he\u2019s a chess grand master or a prime minister. These are two different callings.</p> <p>Morrison can be feckless and shallow, possibly without serious negative consequences. It is the political age for feckless and shallow. Populists and charlatans litter the landscape.</p> <p>So he can do that, and he won\u2019t lack company when he struts and frets on the world stage.<strong> </strong>Or he can find the courage and the moral purpose to do some good in the world, and leave a legacy that benefits future generations.</p> <ul> <li><p>Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor</p></li> </ul>",

The ground is like concrete, and dust is obscuring yellowed grass on my parched suburban block. Bushfire smoke has rolled in and out of Canberra. Smoke is the last thing I smell before going to sleep and the first thing I smell as I wake up. With the summer stretching out in front of us and no significant rain forecast before April, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, December and January promises extreme weather, burning bushland, eerie blood-red sunsets. Towns are on the brink of running out of water. Instead of resting and recharging with their loved ones, emergency services workers are spending their days toiling in a hellscape. Long dries are dangerous times for Coalition governments, politically. The public furore over Scott Morrison\u2019s ill judged mini-break in Hawaii while parts of the country were battling a national disaster \u2013 and Morrison\u2019s attempt on Friday to clean up the damage \u2013 points to the political difficulties the government faces. Long dries create negative feedback loops for centre-right parties in Australia. The Nationals find themselves besieged by furious constituents. Rural independents position themselves to challenge major party incumbents. Far-right populists preen and circle \u2013 Pauline Hanson, the Shooters party. As a consequence of the unwelcome competition, Nationals want to flex their muscle within the government and be seen to be delivering, which can create difficulties for the Liberals in urban areas. Water politics (as my wise colleague Gabrielle Chan put this, predictively, in August) is in hyperdrive in regional Australia. The irrigators engaged in an existential fight to preserve their livelihoods (like the group that came to Canberra during the final sitting weeks of the parliament and camped outside the main entrance and outside the National Farmers Federation HQ, a protest convoy demanding an audience) \u2013 want more of the scarce water. They feel wedged between the ecology, the speculators and a basin plan they evidently associate with misery. But in cities, progressive Liberal voters fret about persistent government inaction on climate change. Restiveness about a lack of climate action puts pressure on the other arm of the government, the arm inclined to worry the Coalition has lost control of the climate change narrative. A prelude to this summer nocturne played out during the last federal election, when Nationals found themselves under significant challenge in seats with direct exposure to the Murray-Darling. It gets forgotten, because the government has been entirely successful in projecting the sweetest victory of all post-election narrative, but Sussan Ley, the Liberal member for Farrer, suffered a negative swing on primaries of 7%. A high profile independent contesting the seat got almost 20,000 votes in the seat. National Mark Coultan had a similar experience in Parkes \u2013 a negative swing on primaries, and a bump for an independent. In the cities, climate-related anxiety swung votes too. Tony Abbott lost his seat, Josh Frydenberg suffered a negative swing of over 8% and Tim Wilson a negative swing of 3.66%. In Trent Zimmerman\u2019s seat of North Sydney, the Labor candidate got a positive swing of over 8%, while in Brisbane, Trevor Evans had a negative swing of 2% and the Greens a positive swing of nearly 3%. While the May election was fought on a range of issues, certainly not climate and environment alone, the election result tells us the Coalition did a better job than Labor of straddling its split constituency, neutralising and weaponising where required; and was more effective in channeling the inevitable protest votes back to the Coalition. So it is possible \u2013 Christmas holiday SNAFU and abject prime ministerial apologies notwithstanding \u2013 that Team Morrison will end the year resolved to maintaining the status quo with its actions and messaging. It\u2019s possible the Coalition will try and wait out the backlash. After all, what problem needs to be fixed here? The negative swings in May happened in seats the government holds by a large margin, so what\u2019s the case for a course correction? On this benign view Morrison can go on managing the different aspirations among the Coalition\u2019s supporters by walking every side of every street. To recap quickly, the Coalition\u2019s formula for neutralising the climate backlash in May was campaign calm down in the cities. Morrison told voters he was not Abbott, and the Coalition would meet its international commitments with sensible practical policies that wouldn\u2019t crash the economy. In the regions, Morrison was also for the coal industry, for the farmers, for everyone immediately in front of him. The government lost bark, but speaking out all sides of its mouth worked earlier this year. Everyone apart from the unmourned apex wrecker Abbott hung on, and while Labor and the Greens picked up votes on climate change in some parts of the country, a majority of voters either rejected Bill Shorten\u2019s plans to take corrective action, or didn\u2019t particularly but prioritised another set of issues when casting their votes. So the Morrison et al political strategy prevailed. It absolutely did. But will it work forever? And by work, I mean continue to command a national majority of 50% plus one. Will Australians continue to either vote against climate action, or prioritise other things, when they are experiencing the practical consequences of policy failure in their daily lives? To frame this thought another way, if sanguine, or she\u2019ll be right mate (our natural default in Australia), is a piece of string, just how long is that piece of string? I\u2019m not asking this question rhetorically. I\u2019m asking it because I don\u2019t know the answer. I do know this. Australia\u2019s climate is changing, there are practical consequences associated with warming and these consequences are now too present to be ignored. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A new authoritative study published this week found that climate change has reduced the average annual profitability of farms by 22% over the past two decades (and yes, I know effective climate action is a global imperative, not just a local one). Cropping farms have been the worst hit, with revenue down 8% or around $82,000 a farm, and profits down 35%, or $70,900 for a typical cropping farm. Regional Australia is well aware it is now engaged in an adaptation exercise, because agribusinesses deal with that reality every day. One of the small fascinations of the year, certainly for me, and I suspect for a number of us that live outside Sydney, has been watching the perils of climate inaction becoming a major national story largely because Australia\u2019s largest city was inconvenienced by noxious bushfire smoke. All of a sudden, the issue gained traction and surround-sound coverage \u2013 television, radio, digital, print \u2013 at least in outlets that still perform journalism. I know the government has just endured a pretty spiky and uncomfortable month. You can only imagine how ropable Morrison would have been when it became obvious he would have to eat humble pie on Friday. You can actually picture that scene, or at least I can, quite vividly. What I don\u2019t know is whether the current community concern about the lack of leadership will be transient, vanishing once glorious Sydney harbour reverts to sparkling, and people resume bushwalking in the Blue Mountains without masks and asthma inhalers, or whether the summer of 2019 and 2020 will be remembered in the future as an awakening of sorts. Obviously, I hope it\u2019s the latter. In the spirit of good cheer, generosity and hope, I also hope that Morrison and the government he leads will take the opportunity of shifting on climate policy in 2020, and by shifting I mean actually doing something rather than pretending to be doing something. The government has an entirely viable opportunity to pivot in 2020, to end the domestic war of political convenience in the new year, because the world will be contemplating what fresh emissions reduction commitments to offer between now and 2050. Opportunity beckons. I am often tough on this prime minister, because he furnishes plenty of reasons to be. But I\u2019ve said before, and will now say again, I think Morrison is capable of finding a 50% plus one on climate change that is about more than winning a single election at a particular point in time, but about actually trying to fix a problem that requires fixing. But first he has to make some decisions. Morrison has got to decide whether he covets power for its own sake or whether he wants to use the power Australian voters have given him to do good. He\u2019s got to decide whether he\u2019s a chess grand master or a prime minister. These are two different callings. Morrison can be feckless and shallow, possibly without serious negative consequences. It is the political age for feckless and shallow. Populists and charlatans litter the landscape. So he can do that, and he won\u2019t lack company when he struts and frets on the world stage. Or he can find the courage and the moral purpose to do some good in the world, and leave a legacy that benefits future generations. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

Lee Cain, the director of communications, Sir Eddie Lister, the chief strategic adviser, and Munira Mirza, the director of the No 10 policy unit and co-author of the Tories\u2019 2019 election manifesto, are listed as the top earners, with a further four earning between \u00a3120,000 and \u00a3129,999. Dominic Cummings, the chief special adviser to the prime minister, is paid between \u00a395,000 and \u00a399,999, according to details published in the government\u2019s annual report on special advisers. Lister worked with Johnson when the latter was London mayor, and Mirza was Johnson\u2019s deputy mayor for education and culture. Special advisers, known as Spads, are temporary civil servants. The list shows staffing has increased from 99 full-time-equivalent employees under May to 108 under Johnson. The prime minister\u2019s personal advisory team has also expanded, with 44 members of staff now in place compared with May\u2019s 37. Prominent members of Johnson\u2019s election media team included his press secretary, Robert Oxley, who is paid between \u00a385,000 and \u00a389,999.

The deputy press secretary, Lucia Hodgson, is paid between \u00a375,000 and \u00a379,999. Nikki Da Costa, a legal adviser who worked with Johnson on the prorogation of parliament in September and early October, is paid between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3129,000.

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Charles Michel, the president of the European council, welcomed the vote, tweeting that it was an \u201cimportant step in the article 50 ratification process\u201d.

Today was, and still is, an opportunity to stop the procrastination and send a message to our lost voters \u2013 the voters that our party was created to give a voice to in parliament \u2013 that we do hear them, value them and genuinely want to rebuild their trust,\u201d she said. Lewell-Buck was joined in the aye lobby by Labour colleagues Jon Cruddas, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins, Sarah Champion and Rosie Cooper. Friday\u2019s vote was on the second reading of the legislation, when MPs vote on whether they are willing in principle for a bill to proceed. Amendments can be made during later stages. The Commons backed a previous draft of the bill at a second reading in October; but rejected the prime minister\u2019s plan to rush it through parliament in just a few days, prompting him to press for a general election.",

      "bodyText": "When Lionel Messi set off so did Diego Simeone, accompanying the run from the touchline. Drawn into what was unfolding before him, the inevitable conclusion edging closer, Simeone lurched and tensed and stuck his foot out as if willing his defenders to do the same until what he saw coming came. Messi bent the ball into the corner to score another late winner. The Atl\u00e9tico Madrid manager nodded, applauded and shrugged, arms outstretched, palms up, then clapped again: what ya gonna do? The following night Messi collected his sixth Ballon d\u2019Or. \u201cYou deserve it,\u201d last year\u2019s winner Luka Modric said simply, handing it over. The vote had been extremely close, Virgil van Dijk seven points behind. The same Van Dijk who after the Champions League final had said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any case [for me]. Messi is the best.\u201d Asked once for his all-time top five, J\u00fcrgen Klopp wouldn\u2019t name them all, but said the Argentinian was No 1. This year, he is ours as well. During Messi\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or acceptance speech, he said the most significant thing he has ever said: he admitted retirement was near, time was running out. There was a desperation in the response that was eloquent, as if this was an idea too bleak to contemplate, the void too vast, but it had been said now and couldn\u2019t be unsaid. He also said he was a \u201cconstructor\u201d, not a goalscorer, which is true, but he has still scored more in the Champions League and La Liga than anyone, Golden Shoe winner for the sixth time, three in a row. But for what, people ask? What did Messi do? In the end, it was a disappointing year. Barcelona won only the league and reached the Champions League semi-final and the Copa del Rey final. Only. Messi has had many victims over the past 15 years, and one of them is him. Being a World Cup runner-up accredited Modric as the best; being a World Cup runner-up is held against Messi, proof of failure. He was accused of being absent in May\u2019s 4-0 defeat at Anfield \u2013 maybe they mean apart from the shot Alisson saved, the two that whizzed just past the post and the three clear chances made for Jordi Alba, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Philippe Coutinho. In the Copa del Rey final, he scored one; another, which would have been among the great final goals, hit the post. What did Messi do? He has played better than anyone else in 2019. Maybe he has played better than anyone else, full stop. And in the play, he is peerless. For all the tangibles, the astonishing stats, it\u2019s not always tangible. A better measure of Messi might be sought in Simeone and reactions like his \u2013 in the men around Messi who comprehend him through competition. It might be sought less in what people said publicly, although there are some nice lines \u2013 a favourite is Jorge Sampaoli insisting that \u201ccomparing anyone to him is like comparing an average cop to Batman\u201d \u2013 and more in what they did. Moments that are more spontaneous, more real. The day before Sampaoli\u2019s Sevilla met Messi, one of his coaching staff privately admitted that preparation might prove pointless, \u201cIf he has one of those days\u201d.

When it\u2019s not, it weighs even more heavily. Some expressions are more eloquent than words and more telling than numbers: Simeone a fortnight ago, Samuel Eto\u2019o clutching his head unable to believe that goal against Getafe, Pep Guardiola in the stands whoah-ing and laughing after the nutmeg on James Milner, Pau L\u00f3pez\u2019s wide-eyed look when the ball orbited over his head, \u201cdid you see that? written across his face. That day in March, Messi got a standing ovation from the Betis fans.

But with people becoming increasingly eco-conscious and social media savvy, many are forgoing physical presents and opting instead to gift experiences. Sales on Black Friday, which falls less than a month before the big day \u2013 allowing Christmas shoppers to take advantage of online and in-store sales \u2013 saw a significant rise in experience packages, including weekend breaks, comedy nights and stadium tours this year. The department store Debenhams said Black Friday sales in the category were up 13% from last year \u2013 with food and drink experiences, such as bottomless brunches and afternoon teas, up 15%. Red Letter Days, alongside its parent company Buyagift, also reported that demand for experience gifts had almost doubled in the past five years. Richard Hurd-Wood, the chief executive of Virgin Experience Days, which saw a 92% increase in Black Friday sales compared with 2018, said consumers were becoming more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and opting out of buying as many disposable gifts. \u201cAnother factor is of course the so-called \u2018Instagram generation\u2019.

In light of shifting tastes among younger generations, the selection of gift experiences \u2013 which are often sent as e-vouchers, giving recipients the option to decide where and when they want to go \u2013 are also expanding. While Virgin offers eco-friendly activities, such as an \u00a380 class to make bespoke up-cycled shoes and vegan cookery classes, the online shop Not on the High Street is selling all manner of offbeat gifts, from a wild food foraging trip with the Masterchef winner Mat Follas to a 90-minute alpaca walk or an urban beekeeping taster session. A spokesperson for Buyagift said: \u201cThe mindset when purchasing gifts has changed as people are considering the emotional and environmental impacts more; we are seeing more value being placed on gifts that create long-lasting memories over gifts that can be thrown away.\u201d A study by the waste management company Biffa found that the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas, including an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 114,000 tonnes of plastic packaging.

They can\u2019t promise governing competence or stability,\u201d says the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/forget-ideas-do-the-maths-and-its-clear-political-leadership-always-comes-down-to-character\" title=\"\">studied leadership closely</a>. But the burden falls especially heavily on the left. They are demanding the nation give up what\u2019s familiar and head instead into uncharted territory. That requires a charismatic leader. For, to cite (again) the words of an old teacher of mine, the late <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/research/about/studies/back-issues/43-1/shimoni.html\" title=\"\">Ze\u2019ev Mankowitz</a>, \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe in ideas: they believe in people who believe in ideas.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, for a quality so determinative of political success or failure, it is maddeningly hard to define charisma, even if we feel we can spot its presence \u2013 or absence \u2013 in seconds. At its most basic, it begins with elementary communication skills. Would a TV channel choose this or that candidate to read the news? Applying that criterion to 1994, you\u2019d have known in an instant that, had it come to a contest, Blair would have beaten Gordon Brown. Obvious.</p> <p>But there is so much more to it than that. Charisma is a shifting, evolving quality, changing in reaction to the times and especially to whatever has gone before. The tightly managed political style of the Blair-Clinton era left voters weary of candidates who were polished and spun, hankering instead for something apparently more authentic, even dangerous. Today the key TV test is whether you\u2019d turn the sound up to hear what they say, not least because you wouldn\u2019t be sure what was about to come out of their mouth.</p> <p>Trump is the master of that form of unpredictability; Boris Johnson built a career on the frisson of appearing to defy convention and say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/06/tory-member-questions-boris-johnsons-ability-to-represent-minorities\" title=\"\">things politicians aren\u2019t meant to say</a>. Of the current Labour field, the only candidate who even comes close to having that quality is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/let-labours-fightback-begin-with-a-woman-as-leader\" title=\"\">Jess Phillips</a>. Stewart Wood, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, neither of whom were famed for their charisma, can see Phillips appealing partly because voters will know that \u201cshe\u2019ll sometimes screw up and say the wrong thing. She\u2019s visceral. She\u2019s got that unstable, combustible mix\u201d, which can be compelling.</p> <p>For a candidate of the right, that alone can carry you to victory. But it\u2019s so much harder for the left. They have both to excite and reassure, all at the same time. Clinton, Blair and Obama succeeded partly because they calmed those who would normally be resistant to change. To take a niche, but illustrative example: in Israel, the centre-left has won only twice in the last 42 years, on both occasions when they were led by certified military heroes. Both Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak had the credentials to soothe any doubts about security. They were phenomena. Anything less, and their party loses.</p> <p>In less extreme form, it means a left challenger needs to exude gravitas and competence. The model here is Clement Attlee, who could reassure Britons in 1945 not least because he had been at Winston Churchill\u2019s right hand as deputy prime minister throughout the war. What he lacked in sparkle, he made up in heft. His was the kind of anti-charisma offer Brown\u2019s team were aiming to make with their \u201cNot flash, just Gordon\u201d slogan in 2007. We will never know if it would have worked in the election that never was, after which Brown\u2019s image was no longer his to shape. But a left leader has to have at least one of those qualities \u2013 authority or charisma \u2013 and ideally both. (Supporters of Keir Starmer reckon his record as director of public prosecutions gives him a weight his rivals lack.)</p> <p>What complicates this further is that charisma can be in the eye of the beholder. To me, Jeremy Corbyn always looked like a glowering supply teacher, a man incapable of uttering a single memorable sentence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/jeremy-corbyn-labour-manifesto-antisemitism-brexit\" title=\"\">unable to command a room</a>. In the campaign just gone, it became clear that millions of voters saw him that way too. Yet to thousands of Labour activists, he was an inspiration. What might account for this perception gap is a notion of charisma confined mostly to the left.</p> <p>Corbyn clearly met the post-Blair demand for an unspun, authentic politician, but he also cut a figure with deeper historical resonance. Ascetic, living modestly, with a scraggly beard trimmed only once he won the leadership in 2015, it was easy to see him as the archetypal prophet, summoned from the wilderness after decades spent living in isolation with only his principles for company. Never mind that he\u2019s a boring or repetitive speaker: that only proves his consistency. Never mind the venom of his detractors or even the serial defeats: that only confirms him as a holy man who refuses to bend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/20/labour-rebuilding-communities-tory-cuts\">Labour doesn\u2019t have to wait five years to start rebuilding communities | Alex Sobel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bernie Sanders has some of this appeal in the US, but here\u2019s the key point: for all its roots in religious tradition, this is a form of charisma that today stirs only the left. Study the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1207786835130408960\" title=\"\">photograph on the front of Friday\u2019s Guardian</a>. It shows a gaunt Corbyn, staring fixedly ahead, alongside a chunky, Falstaffian Johnson, a mischievous smile on his lips. It\u2019s an image as old as England, Roundhead against Cavalier - and we know which side the country reverts to in the end.</p> <p>Democrats need to hold this structural imbalance between left and right in mind as they choose their challenger to Trump. Unfair it might be, but to win that person will need to offer both excitement and solidity, hope and calm. It\u2019s not an easy combination to pull off. Labour is in need of a similarly rare blend. But first it needs to decide what question it is asking. Is it looking for a leader who ticks all the members\u2019 pet ideological boxes, or for someone who might prove capable of interrupting Labour\u2019s long losing streak? By their choice, we\u2019ll know whether they want to win \u2013 or to enjoy once more the martyr\u2019s thrill of glorious defeat.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But it\u2019s so much harder for the left. They have both to excite and reassure, all at the same time. Clinton, Blair and Obama succeeded partly because they calmed those who would normally be resistant to change. To take a niche, but illustrative example: in Israel, the centre-left has won only twice in the last 42 years, on both occasions when they were led by certified military heroes. Both Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak had the credentials to soothe any doubts about security. They were phenomena. Anything less, and their party loses. In less extreme form, it means a left challenger needs to exude gravitas and competence. The model here is Clement Attlee, who could reassure Britons in 1945 not least because he had been at Winston Churchill\u2019s right hand as deputy prime minister throughout the war. What he lacked in sparkle, he made up in heft. His was the kind of anti-charisma offer Brown\u2019s team were aiming to make with their \u201cNot flash, just Gordon\u201d slogan in 2007. We will never know if it would have worked in the election that never was, after which Brown\u2019s image was no longer his to shape. But a left leader has to have at least one of those qualities \u2013 authority or charisma \u2013 and ideally both. (Supporters of Keir Starmer reckon his record as director of public prosecutions gives him a weight his rivals lack.) What complicates this further is that charisma can be in the eye of the beholder. To me, Jeremy Corbyn always looked like a glowering supply teacher, a man incapable of uttering a single memorable sentence, unable to command a room. In the campaign just gone, it became clear that millions of voters saw him that way too. Yet to thousands of Labour activists, he was an inspiration. What might account for this perception gap is a notion of charisma confined mostly to the left. Corbyn clearly met the post-Blair demand for an unspun, authentic politician, but he also cut a figure with deeper historical resonance. Ascetic, living modestly, with a scraggly beard trimmed only once he won the leadership in 2015, it was easy to see him as the archetypal prophet, summoned from the wilderness after decades spent living in isolation with only his principles for company. Never mind that he\u2019s a boring or repetitive speaker: that only proves his consistency. Never mind the venom of his detractors or even the serial defeats: that only confirms him as a holy man who refuses to bend. Bernie Sanders has some of this appeal in the US, but here\u2019s the key point: for all its roots in religious tradition, this is a form of charisma that today stirs only the left. Study the photograph on the front of Friday\u2019s Guardian. It shows a gaunt Corbyn, staring fixedly ahead, alongside a chunky, Falstaffian Johnson, a mischievous smile on his lips. It\u2019s an image as old as England, Roundhead against Cavalier - and we know which side the country reverts to in the end. Democrats need to hold this structural imbalance between left and right in mind as they choose their challenger to Trump. Unfair it might be, but to win that person will need to offer both excitement and solidity, hope and calm. It\u2019s not an easy combination to pull off. Labour is in need of a similarly rare blend. But first it needs to decide what question it is asking. Is it looking for a leader who ticks all the members\u2019 pet ideological boxes, or for someone who might prove capable of interrupting Labour\u2019s long losing streak? By their choice, we\u2019ll know whether they want to win \u2013 or to enjoy once more the martyr\u2019s thrill of glorious defeat. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

The autocrat, disguised as a man of the people, whose prescription for blue-collar Conservatism was old-fashioned, establishment paternalism. Brexit was done. Even if it wasn\u2019t. And anyone who dared whisper the word Brexit again after 31 January would be arrested for thought crimes. Boris had hoped he would feel more elated than this, but instead he could only feel disappointment closing in. He had gained the world, but had long since lost both his family and his soul. His narcissism would inevitably destroy him. In the beginning is my end. Now the light falls.

In agreement with the vendor, the agent will then ensure the bidding goes up to around \u00a3175,000. As a result, \u201cin addition to the agent\u2019s commission (usually 5%), the agent earns a secret profit of \u00a337,500. The vendor also earns an additional \u00a337,500 above the fair market value of \u00a3100,000 [while] the purchaser believes they have bought a horse that is below their maximum bid, so is happy and will use the agent again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dual representation occurs when an agent acts for both vendor and purchaser while one or both parties are unaware of the potential conflict of interest, while \u201cluck money\u201d is a payment \u2013 in effect a \u201ccashback\u201d of up to 5% of the sale price \u2013 which is demanded from a vendor by an agent after a sale has been completed.</p> \n<p>Many of the \u201cimproper practices\u201d detailed in the report can involve bloodstock agents, whose activities \u2013 along with those of other stakeholders in the bloodstock industry \u2013 are currently self-regulated via the Bloodstock Industry Code of Practice, which was most recently updated in 2009.</p> \n<p>The BHA, Felice says, should in future take charge of the regulation of all participants in the bloodstock industry, replace the 2009 code with a new version, which is \u201cmore robust and fit for purpose\u201d, and introduce a licensing system for agents, with sanctions including fines and suspensions from auctions imposed for breaches of the rules.</p>",

The report, commissioned by the British Horseracing Authority and conducted by Justin Felice OBE, a former chief superintendent of Lancashire police, includes recommendations that all bloodstock agents should be licensed and that the BHA should take on overall responsibility for the regulation of bloodstock sales. Failure to act on the recommendations, Felice warns, would leave the industry \u201cat serious risk of being publicly exposed by investigative media and/or those who have fallen victim to some of the improper practices [detailed by contributors to his report]\u201d. This, in turn, \u201cwould be likely to seriously damage the bloodstock industry\u2019s reputation\u201d. The report lists four practices \u2013 secret profiteering, dual representation/commission, \u201cluck\u201d money and bidding up \u2013 which, though not described as being \u201cendemic\u201d in the sales process, are \u201cunethical\u201d and, in some cases, \u201cpotentially criminal\u201d breaches of the Bribery Act (2010), the Fraud Act (2006) or the Criminal Law Act (1977). Secret profiteering involves collusion between a bloodstock agent and a vendor to ensure that a purchaser pays more than the market value for a horse, with the agent and vendor splitting the difference. In an example included in the report, a buyer might tell an agent they are willing to pay \u00a3200,000 for a horse when the vendor accepts its market value is \u00a3100,000. In agreement with the vendor, the agent will then ensure the bidding goes up to around \u00a3175,000. As a result, \u201cin addition to the agent\u2019s commission (usually 5%), the agent earns a secret profit of \u00a337,500. The vendor also earns an additional \u00a337,500 above the fair market value of \u00a3100,000 [while] the purchaser believes they have bought a horse that is below their maximum bid, so is happy and will use the agent again.\u201d Dual representation occurs when an agent acts for both vendor and purchaser while one or both parties are unaware of the potential conflict of interest, while \u201cluck money\u201d is a payment \u2013 in effect a \u201ccashback\u201d of up to 5% of the sale price \u2013 which is demanded from a vendor by an agent after a sale has been completed. Many of the \u201cimproper practices\u201d detailed in the report can involve bloodstock agents, whose activities \u2013 along with those of other stakeholders in the bloodstock industry \u2013 are currently self-regulated via the Bloodstock Industry Code of Practice, which was most recently updated in 2009. The BHA, Felice says, should in future take charge of the regulation of all participants in the bloodstock industry, replace the 2009 code with a new version, which is \u201cmore robust and fit for purpose\u201d, and introduce a licensing system for agents, with sanctions including fines and suspensions from auctions imposed for breaches of the rules.",

The money from last year\u2019s single provided 70,000 three-day emergency food parcels. More than 823,000 parcels were distributed through food banks between March and September 2019, the busiest period on record.</p> <p>Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust, said the charity was \u201cso grateful\u201d for the support: \u201cThe money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Hoyle told the Guardian that he and his wife had been encouraged that fans weren\u2019t just buying the single, but sharing photos of themselves going shopping to buy provisions for food banks: \u201cThat\u2019s what we wanted to do this year \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just about raising money, it was about awareness as well, and making sure people were going to help out [in person] as well as financially.\u201d</p> <p>The Hoyles recently visited a food bank and were surprised by the constant stream of people coming through the centre\u2019s door. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always people that were destitute \u2013 it was everyday people, and that was quite shocking,\u201d said Hoyle. \u201cA window cleaner said that he had fallen off a ladder and broken his leg, which had led him to be there.

He declined to state who he had voted for, but clarified that he had voted, and that it was important to do so.</p> <p>LadBaby\u2019s aim with the single, said Hoyle, was to offer a break from politics. \u201cSo much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what\u2019s happening with the government that so many issues \u2013 whether it be food banks or so many others \u2013 are taking a back seat.

Although perhaps not vegan: I Love Sausage Rolls makes one explicit, if unexpected political point on the matter of the meat-free pastry snacks that have proven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/14/greggs-vegan-sausage-rolls-fuel-profit-boom\">a sales winner for Greggs this year</a>.

They don\u2019t have the luxury of saying whether they\u2019re a vegan or a vegetarian \u2013 they just get what people have donated during that week. It\u2019s a luxury to be in that position where you can choose.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2019/dec/13/dont-despair-a-practical-guide-to-making-a-difference-from-food-banks-to-fighting-fake-news\">Don\u2019t despair: a practical guide to making a difference \u2013 from food banks to fighting fake news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hoyle said the family was looking for more ways to help the Trussell Trust throughout the year. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Christmas to be the one time when we help out. Summer is a really important time for them \u2013 that\u2019s when their food banks are really depleted because there\u2019s no school. Children don\u2019t have free school meals and a lot of parents have to rely on food banks.\u201d</p> <p>The Trussell Trust\u2019s Emma Revie argued that a more robust benefits system was needed to reduce food bank reliance. \u201cPoverty acts like a current, with big structural things \u2013 like the rising cost of living or insecure work \u2013 sweeping people away and leaving them without enough money for the basics. But this isn\u2019t inevitable. We know what things will anchor people against those tides and reduce the need for food banks: a benefits system that provides sufficient money and support to anyone who needs its help, work that is secure and pays fairly and emergency support from local authorities that fills the gaps when someone is hit by something unexpected.\u201d</p> <p>In October, LadBaby signed with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to represent them across all areas of their business and expand their platform across licensing, merchandising, literary and live events, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/ladbaby-wme-margravine-1203382621/\">Variety reported</a>. Hoyle said they had no specific plans as of yet. \u201cI like to be places we\u2019re not expected. I don\u2019t know what else is next. I\u2019ll pick up the phone to anything, so as long as it\u2019s funny and we can make people laugh and spread a positive vibe, we\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201d</p>",

In 2018, they pipped Ariana Grande and Ava Max to the Christmas No 1 with We Built This City on Sausage Rolls, a riff on Starship\u2019s 1985 single. This year\u2019s LadBaby campaign drew support from Stormzy, who described their mission as a \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d, and Scottish musician Lewis Capaldi, who posted a characteristically unfiltered video of himself dancing topless to the song. Alan Merrill, who wrote and released the original song with his group the Arrows in 1975, said: \u201cWhen I wrote it back then I could never have imagined this!\u201d The proceeds from both singles benefit the Trussell Trust, a charity that supports more than 1,200 food banks in the UK. The money from last year\u2019s single provided 70,000 three-day emergency food parcels. More than 823,000 parcels were distributed through food banks between March and September 2019, the busiest period on record. Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust, said the charity was \u201cso grateful\u201d for the support: \u201cThe money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.\u201d Mark Hoyle told the Guardian that he and his wife had been encouraged that fans weren\u2019t just buying the single, but sharing photos of themselves going shopping to buy provisions for food banks: \u201cThat\u2019s what we wanted to do this year \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just about raising money, it was about awareness as well, and making sure people were going to help out [in person] as well as financially.\u201d The Hoyles recently visited a food bank and were surprised by the constant stream of people coming through the centre\u2019s door. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always people that were destitute \u2013 it was everyday people, and that was quite shocking,\u201d said Hoyle. \u201cA window cleaner said that he had fallen off a ladder and broken his leg, which had led him to be there. We read so much about the problem but it\u2019s different when you actually see it. It\u2019s so much more heartbreaking. \u201cThere was a woman who came in with a little baby, probably about as old as ours, and when she left, the guy said, \u2018It\u2019s her 21st birthday tomorrow.\u2019 How are we in this position where there\u2019s a girl who\u2019s 21 is going to a food bank because she can\u2019t get food for her baby?\u201d LadBaby released I Love Sausage Rolls the day after the UK election. Said Hoyle: \u201cWe were really worried about whether it would get lost in what was going on but I think the country needed something to have a bit of a laugh about. However people felt about the government, this song hopefully gave them a reason to laugh and a reason to donate to the people who needed it most.\u201d Of the new Conservative administration, Hoyle said: \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna do a great job.\u201d Pressed on whether a government that introduced austerity would do anything to mitigate the issue of food poverty, he said that the nation had to have faith that \u201cthe right people\u201d had been voted in. He declined to state who he had voted for, but clarified that he had voted, and that it was important to do so. LadBaby\u2019s aim with the single, said Hoyle, was to offer a break from politics. \u201cSo much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what\u2019s happening with the government that so many issues \u2013 whether it be food banks or so many others \u2013 are taking a back seat. We didn\u2019t want to involve politics at all, we wanted to focus on the people who can\u2019t eat.\u201d Hoyle was equally non-partisan on the matter of who makes the best sausage rolls, and said his sole requirement was that they were served hot. Although perhaps not vegan: I Love Sausage Rolls makes one explicit, if unexpected political point on the matter of the meat-free pastry snacks that have proven a sales winner for Greggs this year. The Hoyles sing: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to start a riot / We\u2019re not on a vegan diet / We know Quorn will never be a client.\u201d Hoyle said: \u201cWhen we spent some time with the Trussell Trust, we learned that the only thing people really get a choice in is allergies. They don\u2019t have the luxury of saying whether they\u2019re a vegan or a vegetarian \u2013 they just get what people have donated during that week. It\u2019s a luxury to be in that position where you can choose.\u201d Hoyle said the family was looking for more ways to help the Trussell Trust throughout the year. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Christmas to be the one time when we help out. Summer is a really important time for them \u2013 that\u2019s when their food banks are really depleted because there\u2019s no school. Children don\u2019t have free school meals and a lot of parents have to rely on food banks.\u201d The Trussell Trust\u2019s Emma Revie argued that a more robust benefits system was needed to reduce food bank reliance. \u201cPoverty acts like a current, with big structural things \u2013 like the rising cost of living or insecure work \u2013 sweeping people away and leaving them without enough money for the basics. But this isn\u2019t inevitable. We know what things will anchor people against those tides and reduce the need for food banks: a benefits system that provides sufficient money and support to anyone who needs its help, work that is secure and pays fairly and emergency support from local authorities that fills the gaps when someone is hit by something unexpected.\u201d In October, LadBaby signed with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to represent them across all areas of their business and expand their platform across licensing, merchandising, literary and live events, Variety reported. Hoyle said they had no specific plans as of yet. \u201cI like to be places we\u2019re not expected. I don\u2019t know what else is next. I\u2019ll pick up the phone to anything, so as long as it\u2019s funny and we can make people laugh and spread a positive vibe, we\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly Christmas, so I\u2019m going to wrap this blog up now. I\u2019ll leave you with a video asking is Mikel Arteta the man to bring the good times back to Arsenal? Thanks for all your emails and tweets. Bye! Meanwhile in non-London centric news, here\u2019s some hope for Bury fans: Here\u2019s the latest team news for Everton v Arsenal, when Frederick Ljungberg will sign off as caretaker manager and Duncan Ferguson will probably do the same in his role at Everton too. Look out ballboys! Not everybody is convinced, mind: And that\u2019s that. If I was an Arsenal fan, I\u2019d be encouraged. If a large part of management is about communication, Arteta does it very well. He looks and sounds like he cares and his Pep-like emphasis on believing every act is important suggests there will be no getting away with slacking. By the sounds of it, standards will not be allowed to slip any further than they already have and, in fact, should be raised over time. Arteta speaks really well. He\u2019s engaging and passionate and if you were a player you would warm to him. It\u2019s little wonder he captained Arsenal. He says he has been influenced positively by both Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Pep Guardiola. So, expect to see Wengerolia-style football Gunners fans: I was born in Barcelona and the club that had the most similar value, styles and ambition was Arsenal. One man believed in me, Arsene Wenger, he gave me the chance to play for this club. On Guardiola\u2019s influence, he says he has learned that: Every day is important, every act is important. The secret is that the people, players and staff have to believe what you are trying to deliver. What are his expectations? The ambition of this football club is very clear. You have to fight for trophies and be in Europe. The rest is not good enough. He says no decisions have been made about January transfer targets but he does make a point of saying that he thinks Mesut \u00d6zil is a very important player. He is a massive player for this football club. While the press conference is going on, Freddie Ljungberg has tweeted suggesting he will be staying at Arsenal. Arteta says contracts are still be ing arranged but his backroom staff \u201cwill be announced very shortly\u201d. Was it hard for him to leave Pep Guardiola and Manchester City? The relationship between [Guardiola] and me is incredibly good. Obviously he was sad and the timing wasn\u2019t the best for him but he understood. If I had admiration for him before, after working with him I can\u2019t explain [how much I have now]. When Arsenal knock on any door it is hard to say no. When they knock on my door, with them in my heart, it is very difficult. Arteta says he wants his players to believe in themselves again. Too often Arsenal players look scared in possession. As a ball playing midfielder he has a strong opinion on this: I don\u2019t want people hiding. I want people taking responsibility for the job. Anybody that doesn\u2019t buy into this is not good enough for this environment or culture. On how close he was to taking the job in the summer of 2018, he had this to say: I was a little bit close [but] it wasn\u2019t the right time. The right time came now and I\u2019m glad ... I learned a lot from that experience. On Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s influence he said: I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here if he didn\u2019t have the vision to give me this opportunity to enjoy this incredible football club. Arteta sounds confident and and very determined. He wants the supporters to be onside too. We need the fans. We need to give them [something]. Give them a little bit and they will maybe respond. When you look at this football club you think \u2018Wow!\u2019 this club is massive. I have a good feeling. What has he learned from his time away at Manchester City? What I have learned mostly is you have to be ruthless. I have so much respect for this football club that if I did not feel ready I would not be sitting in this chair. The first thing I have to do is change the energy. The players have to accept a different process, a different way f thinking. If we don\u2019t have the right culture the tree is going to shake. On his commitment to the Arsenal cause he has this to say: I will give every drop of blood for this football club to make it better. I know the expectations and the stature of this club and what it deserves. I\u2019ve got a good vibe. I\u2019m sensing a good energy. I feel so happy! Mikel Arteta is here. This is what he has to say: \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy and proud to have been to been given the opportunity to be manager of this football club. I\u2019ve been preparing for a few years now. I know the expectations. I\u2019ve sensed good energy since I walked in at London Colney. [When leaving as a player], I said to the people [at Arsenal] \u2018I\u2019m going outside [the club] I\u2019m going to get prepared and then hopefully I\u2019m going to come back one day when I feel prepared and ready\u201d Mikel Arteta is in the Arsenal media room! Once he\u2019s posed for pictures with an Arsenal shirt, we should get to hear from him. OK, well this is what we\u2019ve been waiting for. It\u2019s \u2026 our Bournemouth v Burnley match preview. The Eddie Howe derby! \u201cCongrats to Unai Emery,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cI never thought I would read a sentence that came straight out of the Philosophy lectures I vaguely recall attending sometime last century, but his \u2018I do believe this is a good decision and I would also like it to be a good decision\u2019 is a cracker. One of the big brains who lectured us used to insist that believing something to be true mean that you couldn\u2019t at the same time wish it to be true, due to a complex argument which I didn\u2019t understand at the time, and which I\u2019ve now thankfully forgotten. Anyway here\u2019s Unai with a categorical disproof. Sacked Manager 1, Philosophy Prof 0.\u201d A heartwarming story now. Real Sociedad have invited the whole village of Becerril (population of around 800 people) to watch a match at their Anoeta Stadium after thrashing the lower league team 8-0 in the Copa del Rey on Thursday. CD Becerril president Juan Antonio Redondo told MARCA. We\u2019re very grateful for the treatment of Real Sociedad and how they supported us despite the big scoreline. The president told me that whenever we wanted, we\u2019re invited to go to San Sebastian to see a top-flight match, whichever one we want, with tickets, travel and lunch for the team and board paid for. He also told me that the invitation was extended to the whole town and that he\u2019d send coaches to take the residents to San Sebastian. We have to look at our calendar and we\u2019ll be delighted to go when we can. Manchester City really should have invited the whole of Watford to the Etihad shouldn\u2019t they? What better way to power you into the last weekend before Christmas than some red-hot Nigel Pearson quotes on bottom-of-the-table Watford\u2019s predicament before they prepare to face Manchester United on Sunday. We know we are in a very difficult situation, but I\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest the players are not up for the challenge. We\u2019ve got some really good, technically-gifted players here. What we\u2019ve got to do, especially at home, is establish some sort of momentum during a performance which builds pressure on opponents. The statistics don\u2019t paint a false picture, We know we are in a very difficult situation... and we\u2019ve got to start winning points. That\u2019s the bottom line. While it\u2019s mathematically possible, it allows you to keep working in the most positive way. We are fully aware of the danger we are in, the precarious nature of our status if we don\u2019t rectify it sooner rather than later. They played well against Liverpool last weekend but it would help if his players had their boots on the correct feet when they were shooting. Unai Emery has reacted to news that Mikel Arteta will succeed him at Arsenal exactly how you would expect him to: He really is prepared to make that next jump. He has been at Arsenal before, he\u2019s been in the Premier League and he has been working with Pep Guardiola. I do believe this is a good decision and I would also like it to be a good decision. While we wait for Mikel Arteta to be wrapped in red and white Arsenal Christmas wrapping paper for his official unveiling shortly, why not take a look at our match previews page for the weekend\u2019s Premier League games here. This might turn out to be good news for anyone involved in grassroots football: Spurs\u2019 rough treatment of Wolves winger Adama Traor\u00e9 shows how rotational fouling has become more complex and embedded, writes Barney Ronay. Read all about it here: An early Christmas present for Manchester City fans: Flamengo\u2019s midfielder Everton Ribeiro says the players will dedicate the Club World Cup to the academy players who were killed in a fire earlier this year if they beat Liverpool in Doha. Ten young footballers died in a blaze at the Sao Paulo club\u2019s training ground in February, with president Rodolfo Landim saying it was \u201cwithout a doubt the worst tragedy\u201d in its 123-year history. Everton said the plan was to remember those teenagers if they won the title. It was a huge tragedy, the death of the young players at the training ground. Our message to the families of the players is that may God be with them and we will always support the families of those players. We will dedicate this title to the players and their spirits. We will do our best to win the title. We will never forget those young players. It is a sad story in the history of Flamengo and it is a source of inspiration and motivation to exert all our efforts. We hope the families will have strength again and maybe winning the title will bring comfort to those of the deceased. Darren Randolph could be heading back to West Ham, but only if Boro lower the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper\u2019s asking price. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s story: If Carlo Ancelotti is ever announced as Everton manager we\u2019ll all miss Big Dunc\u2019s touchline antics as caretaker won\u2019t we? Not since my days of going to Liverpool\u2019s 051 nightclub in the mid-90s have I seen a man wearing a shirt and smart trousers move around with so much aggressive enthusiasm. And Ferguson says he\u2019ll be pushing for a central role in the Italian\u2019s backroom team, if they confirm Ancelotti. I guess Ferguson would be quite hard to turn down. Nobody knows the players better than me. I\u2019ve been with the players for many a year and hopefully, whoever the new guy is, he uses me. I\u2019ve loved it [being caretaker]. The adrenaline\u2019s through the roof and of course the players have responded, which is the most pleasing thing. It\u2019s only been a few games but it gives you confidence. I\u2019m happy with the job I\u2019ve done. I just want Everton to be successful. I want the new manager to come in and do a fantastic job, which I\u2019m sure he will, and if I can be a part of that, brilliant. But I love the club, I love my job and, if I go back to being a coach, that\u2019s fine by me. It is genuinely heartwarming to see and feel how much Ferguson loves the club. Hello, it\u2019s Gregg here. Enjoy your lie down Will! So, Arsenal fans, what happens to Freddie Ljungberg now? Does he go back to his old role under Mikel Arteta or might that be a bit too awkward? Various reports are doing the rounds that Ljungberg is in talks with Malmo over succeeding Uwe Rosler, who left last week. That could be a good move for him if he wants to be a No 1 in his own right. Anyway ... what a mammoth session of fun that was. I am off for a lie down and to see what wine I can find. On the upside, Gregg Bakowski is coming your way. Ben Lake is saving this blog: \u201cI\u2019m largely filling time at work until the end of year. So have time to ponder long term football trends. I also work remotely so have no one to bore them with, so what better than to fling them pointedly into the liveblog void? \u201cI used to despair at former (often recently retired) players being parachuted into major jobs with little to no experience. See Mark Hughes (multiple times), Gianfranco Zola (also multiple times), Robberto Di Matteo, Gary Neville, Tony Adams etc. \u201cNot un-noticed by other commenters, there seem to be a reason trend of players transitioning fairly rapidly from playing to managing. Pep is obviously the test case for this. However, I though this was a one off example, bolstered by Barcelona\u2019s famous production line of young talent and genetic level adherence to a particular style. \u201cThen Real Madrid did the same thing with Zidane, although I\u2019m still not sure he is actually that good a manager. Since then, everyone is after a slice of that young manager pie and it hasn\u2019t blown up as often as I thought. Frank Lampard, Sol Campbell, Scott Parker (ignore Solskjaer for the purpose of not ruining my argument) and Arteta is thought of very highly. I\u2019m hoping lives up to it and I\u2019m all up for a big shake up at Arsenal. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m mostly wondering, what changed? Are younger players actually bothering to do their coaching badges now? Has the Traditional Football Man bluster been found out as mostly nonsense?\u201d Gregory Greene says: \u201cVery curious to know what discussions the Kroenke\u2019s (and the rest of the Arsenal circus) had with Arteta about the fans. Particularly the empty seats and Arsenal fan tv.\u201d Surely the fans will come back to give Arteta a chance. A quick reminder that Arteta will face the media at 5pm. What would you ask him? This is Mikel Arteta\u2019s most recent tweet. Good to see him doing some research. I hope Arteta\u2019s first move is to play a goalkeeper at centre-back. City have thanked Arteta for his work at the club. Pep Guardiola said of Arteta\u2019s departure: \u201cMikel has been an excellent coach for Manchester City. He has shown impressive dedication, hard work and knowledge of football during his time here and has been a real contributor to the Club\u2019s achievements over the past years. We all wish him well in his new role; I am sure he is ready for it.\u201d Meanwhile, Director of Football Txiki Begiristain said: \u201cMikel, as a member of Pep\u2019s team, has contributed significantly to the Club in his time here in Manchester. His work on the training field and detailed preparations have helped us become a side that wins with regularity and in style. This move to Arsenal is a further step in his football development and I am sure he will become a top-class coach.\u201d Charles Antaki points out how cool Mikel is: \u201cWhat I like about that Arsenal publicity photo of Arteta is his unmistakably chilly thousand-yard stare straight at us. Yes, there is something resembling a smile on the lips, for form\u2019s sake. But the whole thing screams \u2018Never mind the arithmetical illogical of it, when I say 120% effort, I mean 120% effort and that means you, Ozil\u2019.\u201d Peter Oh emails to say: \u201cIsn\u2019t Unai Emery from the Basque country too? Is this the first time a top, top English club have appointed back-to-back Basque bosses? In any case, it\u2019s nice to see Mikel Arteta bask in the limelight.\u201d Very much so. They are both from San Sebastian (Emery is from a little outside). Needless to say, Jose Mourinho says he will have no split loyalties when Chelsea come to visit Spurs on Sunday. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a game. I am 100 per cent Tottenham, 100 per cent my club always , all my career,\u201d he said. \u201cNo space at all for my previous clubs. I gave everything to all of them. Everything. I kept nothing. \u201cI gave everything but they are my previous clubs. I give everything to my club - my club is Tottenham. It\u2019s so easy for me to play that game. Difficult because of Chelsea\u2019s quality but not difficult from an emotional point of view.\u201d If Mikel Arteta has anything about him he will appoint all the players bought by Arsenal on the same day he arrived. Those players were Per Mertesacker, Yossi Benayoun and Andre Santos. What could possibly go wrong? Good to know ... Relations between Arsenal and Manchester City seem poor. Here is Nick Ames on Arteta\u2019s route to the top job at Arsenal. Have Sky Sports News superimposed Arteta\u2019s head onto a generic man in a suit? It looks odd. My great fear for Arteta is that the stress of Premier League management might mean he will be unable to maintain his perfectly coiffured hair. Sam Hedges emails in about Graeme: \u201cYou say he\u2019s not happy about Arteta\u2019s appointment... is Souness happy about anything? I can\u2019t remember a time he wasn\u2019t fulfilling the stereotypical role of miserable Scot.\u201d He was really happy talking about how great Brighton Pride was. Elsewhere in London ... Frank Lampard says he is his own man and will not become a clone of Jose Mourinho, who he played under at Chelsea. \u201cThere\u2019s not one thing no; he\u2019s obviously a good manager with loads of good attributes. But there\u2019s not one specific thing I learned working under him, and I wouldn\u2019t strive to be a clone or anything. \u201cI\u2019m happy to go up against Jose; for me to play under him, he was a big influence in my career. To go up against him for Derby against Manchester United last year was a big deal for me. And that still remains. \u201cI\u2019ll always have respect for him. The bigger thing is Chelsea-Tottenham, and what that rivalry means to our players and us. Rivalries are what you feel about your club. Our fans will demand on Sunday what we feel for the game - passion.\u201d Here he is ... Sky Sports are speaking to Graeme Souness next to a massive Christmas tree. He is not a fan of the inexperienced Arteta being given the job. It has taken a while but Josh Kroenke is pleased to have got his man. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be bringing Mikel back to Arsenal,\u201d Kroenke said. \u201cHe knows our expectations and those of our fans around the world are high and we are confident he can play a lead role in taking the club back to the levels we all demand. \u201cI also want to thank Freddie Ljungberg for skilfully guiding us through the last three weeks. He stepped up at short notice and has helped us through this difficult period with great professionalism.\u201d The Gunners say Arteta\u2019s backroom staff will be announced in due course. Mikel Arteta has signed a three-and-a-half year deal at the Emirates. The Basque will not start work until Sunday. He knows he has a job on his hands. This is a huge honour. Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world. We need to be competing for the top trophies in the game and that\u2019s been made very clear to me in my discussions with Stan and Josh Kroenke, and the senior people from the club. We all know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve that but I am confident we\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m realistic enough to know it won\u2019t happen overnight but the current squad has plenty of talent and there is a great pipeline of young players coming through from the academy.\u201d Here is the story of Mikel Arteta\u2019s return to Arsenal. There will be a press conference at 5pm. The deal is done!! Paul Doyle on Brendan Rodgers ... A little bit more from Guardiola on Arteta as we close in on some sort of announcement or other. \u201cHe\u2019s in London and is close to agreeing a deal with Arsenal,\u201d Guardiola told a press conference before Saturday evening\u2019s home game against Leicester. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. Yesterday not in training, today not in training. He\u2019s moving to Arsenal. I don\u2019t know the details of the contract.\u201d Norwich defender Ben Godfrey is expected to be out until February with a knee injury, head coach Daniel Farke has said. The England Under-21 international suffered the problem during last weekend\u2019s 1-1 draw at Leicester, but will not need an operation. \u201cWe have some sad news. Ben has a LCL (lateral collateral ligament) tear, but no surgery is required. He will be out until February,\u201d Farke said at a press conference reported by the club. \u201cGrant Hanley has been back in team training for a while so he is an option for us. We also have Alex Tettey and Ibrahim Amadou who can play there.\u201d Jose Mourinho says he is not the man who has convinced Toby Alderweireld to stay. Mourinho says his only impact was showing he believes in the Belgian and what he can do. Brendan Rodgers is offering some pretty tedious lines out about the game against Manchester City being an \u201camazing opportunity\u201d. He is asked if Leicester are favourites for the match but quickly puts that one down. Guardiola also spoke about how John Stones and Sergio Aguero have returned to training this week and will feature over the festive period. Guardiola says he had to allow Arteta to \u201cfollow his dream\u201d and backs him to do an \u201cexcellent job\u201d at Arsenal. Guardiola says he will not bring someone in to replace Arteta. City do not have a big coaching staff, so I find this surprising, but who would argue with Pep? Pep Guardiola says Mikel Arteta\u2019s departure is \u201calmost done.\u201d Alfie Haaland has sent in some banter ... Jurgen Klopp hopes Liverpool can change the impression of the Club World Cup in Europe. The German was criticised for taking a full squad to the competition in Doha, leaving a team of teenagers in England to lose 5-0 to Aston Villa in the League Cup. \u201cThe situations are different from Flamengo and us,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cFlamengo got sent here with a clear order to win it and to come back as heroes, we got told stay at home and play the Carabao Cup. That is a massive difference. \u201cWhen Flamengo go back, and if they win, they will have a proper party - we play Leicester City. That is how it is. The view in Europe is different to the rest of the world and I\u2019d very much like to change that. \u201cWill it (a Liverpool victory) change the view in Europe? Probably not. Liverpool fans want us to win, most of the other fans don\u2019t really care. We cannot make the competition bigger for us but for us it is the most important because it is the only game we play tomorrow.\u201d I quite like the prospect of Arsenal not getting the Arteta deal done today, forcing them to wheel out Freddie Ljungberg for the press conference. Southampton boss Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is hoping his side can improve their defensive record in the coming weeks. They have been linked with a few centre-backs who could potentially arrive in January. \u201cIn general our clean sheets have not been as much as they should be,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cIt is difficult in the Premier League, but this is something of a behaviour, to defend the box and defend our goal, which we do not do with the same intensity as we have maybe sometimes in attack and when running in behind. \u201cThe run on the way back is the more important, the recovery runs and the duels there are more important than the duels in the opposition half. \u201cWhen we do it, when we act together and work together, then it looks good. If we forget about our behaviours, save doing these runs back, then it doesn\u2019t look good. This is a behaviour we cannot accept and we must demand we do this.\u201d Bournemouth defender Adam Smith has revealed on Sky Sports News that he prefers goose to turkey at Christmas! More as we get it. Bon anniversaire! Premier League champions Manchester City have been handed their winter break a week later than their top-six rivals. Pep Guardiola\u2019s City will host West Ham on Sunday, February 9, while leaders Liverpool, second-placed Leicester, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United have been given that weekend off. Following an agreement in June 2018 between the Football Association, the Premier League and EFL, this season is the first to feature a mid-season player break. Full list of fixtures: Saturday, February 8: Everton v Crystal Palace (12.30pm), Brighton v Watford (5.30pm). Sunday, February 9: Sheffield United v Bournemouth (2pm), Manchester City v West Ham (4.30pm). Friday, February 14: Wolves v Leicester (8pm). Saturday, February 15: Southampton v Burnley (12.30pm), Norwich v Liverpool (5.30pm). Sunday, February 16: Aston Villa v Tottenham (2pm), Arsenal v Newcastle (4.30pm). Monday, February 17: Chelsea v Manchester United (8pm). It\u2019s 30 years since the fall of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu in Romania, which means I can gleefully pad out this blog with a link to this piece: Andy Brassell has been writing about Dortmund ... Sean Dyche says he is not planning to sell any Burnley players in January, unless someone asks to leave. \u201cWe are not at this stage thinking of anyone going out because we carry a small squad,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cThere are people that want football, of course, and if a situation arises where it is right for us then we try and be fair to the players where we can but equally the bigger picture is to perform in the Premier League and keep that going. \u201cWe do need everyone, and recently has shown that with six key injuries as that is a lot for us to carry and that did stretch us to the bare minimum. It is a tricky balance to give people what they want and what we need. \u201cI am very open with the players here and they have been open with me when they are not playing and get frustrated. That is the way it goes but as well as being open they are also professional and they understand being in the Premier League.\u201d Sky Sports News are tracking their presentation team driving around the country for little to no reason. Think of your carbon footprint, lads. Three mentions for Miguel Almiron in the blog today. Finally he speaks for himself. Louise Taylor went to go and have a lovely chat with him. Jurgen Klopp has been speaking in Doha about Virgil van Dijk\u2019s chances of facing Flamengo on Saturday. \u201cWe will see. Virgil was part of training today, Gini has had a session today, so we will see how it will look at the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no new injury concerns. It was Wednesday when we played and now it is Friday. \u201cWe use each hour for recovery so that is what we did. We will see who can line up tomorrow.\u201d Big Copa del Rey news in the Basque Country. Athletic Bilbao will play Sestao in the next round! Eddie Howe wants Bournemouth to build on their fine win over Chelsea when they face his former club Burnley this weekend. \u201cYou could see how much the game meant to us. The players gave everything, we needed a lift and it was a big moment,\u201d the Bournemouth manager said. \u201cWhen you win you naturally get a bounce, the players feel better about themselves, and it\u2019s the same for the supporters who will have had a lift. \u201cIt is key now that we push that on and get a good result against Burnley. They are a team that work incredibly hard, are a very effective team and we are going to have to make sure that we are good. \u201cWe will need all the qualities that we showed against Chelsea, to show them again against Burnley.\u201d We are closing in on noon! Will we get the the big announcement? Will I decide what to do for lunch? Will I put wine in the fridge for tonight? Will I bring you a bit of hot transfer gossip? As mentioned earlier, the Guardian\u2019s top 100 make footballers is complete. Spoiler: Lionel Messi is top. Live footage from Manchester City\u2019s training ground shows that Mikel Arteta is not there. I wonder where he could be ... Arteta will need to put together a backroom staff. I am hoping he will be bringing Richard Wright back to Arsenal from Manchester City where he\u2019s been working as a goalkeeping coach. I enjoyed this from Ben Fisher earlier this week. Will they be making moves in January? And Macclesfield have released a statement about their match tomorrow: Further to issues regarding our ground safety certificate, Macclesfield Town are desperately trying to get these resolved ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Sky Bet League Two clash with Plymouth Argyle. We fully accept that this is far from ideal - especially for those Plymouth fans who have a gargantuan trek ahead of them so close to Christmas. As a result of the above, ticket sales for tomorrow\u2019s game have been suspended until we gain further clarity regarding this situation. In addition, we are in constant communication with the EFL regarding this matter and our efforts relating to it.We unreservedly apologise for this and will provide a further update as soon as we possibly can. An update from the EFL about Macclesfield Town, whose game with Plymouth is in doubt due to safety concerns. Football and ethics are not always the best of friends. Chris Wilder has bemoaned the cynical tactics of Premier League players, which has seen his midfielders pick up plenty of bookings this season. \u201cThere are players in the Premier League when the ball has not even come to them and they are looking to go down,\u201d Wilder explained. \u201cThey are looking to put the referee in a tough position and asking a question of the referee before they have even dealt with the ball. That is fact from what I\u2019ve seen and the clips I\u2019ve got on store. \u201cWe try to make it competitive on a Saturday but I sometimes shake my head with some of the bookings we pick up for non-contact tackles, they\u2019re so soft. Fleck was a disappointing decision last week and now he is suspended for a game. \u201cI think people who watch us and our supporters have been disappointed in the attitude of some of the opposing, or opposition, players and how easy it is for them to go down, but we won\u2019t change our approach. \u201cUnfortunately at times, with the speed of the Premier League and the athletes in the Premier League, if you mistime a tackle then it sometimes looks a little bit worse than what it is - especially when players are rolling about all over the place for about five minutes and then the physio doesn\u2019t go on. \u201cI quite enjoy that part because I go to the physio and say: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it mate you won\u2019t be going on will you?\u2019 And nine times out of 10 he doesn\u2019t. \u201cHe jumps up out of his dugout with his bag and then, lo and behold, the player gets up and he has to sit back down. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has aggravated us a little bit and it seems very common in the Premier League and it is something we haven\u2019t really had to deal with in the Championship.\u201d Steve Bruce has been speaking glowingly about Miguel Almiron despite his lack of goals since arriving at Newcastle. He said: \u201cI understand that he hasn\u2019t scored. After speaking to a lot of people about last year in January when he arrived, he gave the impetus to the team, and really nothing has changed in that respect, as far as I\u2019m concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s a smashing player who we all enjoy playing in the team, and as long as he contributes to the team... \u201cLook, we\u2019d love him to score a few more goals, of course we would, but he works every day as if it is his last, he\u2019s a wonderful professional, a great lad, good player, so I\u2019ve got no problems with Almiron because of what he gives the team and the threat he causes a team. \u201cIf he can add a few goals to it, great, but at the moment, I\u2019m very, very pleased with him.\u201d An interesting David Conn story from yesterday ... Anyway ... back to disappointing football-related Xmas presents. Two years ago my mum purchased me a football annual, something similar to Match. I was 30 at the time and therefore far too old for it, so gave it away to a child on Boxing Day and she did not speak to me for 24 hours. Jamie Jackson has the very latest from Manchester United. Albert Camus and t-shirts: Tomorrow\u2019s 3pm kick-offs are not the most exciting on paper. which is the pick of the matches? Aston Villa v Southampton AFC Bournemouth v Burnley Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Sheffield United Newcastle United v Crystal Palace Norwich City v Wolverhampton Wanderers I think this is what they describe as a \u2018healthy\u2019 addiction. Norwegian media reported this morning that Erling Haaland was on his way to Manchester for talks but Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has quickly quashed that claim. \u201cI know the boy and his friends and he\u2019s on a Christmas holiday,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r explained in his pre-match conference. MORE BIG NEWS! The list is complete. Who has come top? Has Scott Carson made it in? Is this further proof that democracy does not work? Check out the list to find out and then shout into void your own view. The big news we\u2019ve all be waiting for in north London ... Defender Toby Alderweireld has signed a new deal with Tottenham which will run until 2023, the club have announced. Newcastle could have two key players back this weekend after they missed out against Burnley. Miguel Almiron and Jonjo Shelvey are in contention to face Crystal Palace following hamstring and calf issues, respectively. Steve Bruce has a few injury problems, though. \u201cAlmiron and Shelvey have a chance. They trained yesterday. As we speak at the moment, we haven\u2019t seen them just yet, but they both seemed OK yesterday,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early for (Allan) Saint-Maximin, and Ki (Sung-yueng) and Ciaran Clark are still struggling. Matt Ritchie and (Jamaal) Lascelles are not there either, but from what we had last week anyway, Almiron and Jonjo have got a chance.\u201d Arteta is an exciting gamble, says David Hytner. Elsewhere in English football ... Macclesfield were docked six points yesterday and their game with Plymouth tomorrow is currently in doubt. Daniel Serridge asks: \u201cI was wondering, will this weekend\u2019s game between Everton and Arsenal be the first time both teams have new managers, as the cliche goes, \u2018in the stands\u2019 to watch their new clubs?\u201d I cannot remember a similar time. Can we think of a game when both managers have been caretakers? There\u2019s been plenty happening at Arsenal this week, including Mesut Ozil\u2019s run-in with China. Eni Aluko wrote about speaking out: Sky Sports News are going across the country, ground-hopping as they go. I offer similar commitment to Premier League press conferences by watching SSN while drinking coffee from London. It is a waiting game but Arsenal still expect to announce Mikel Arteta\u2019s appointment imminently, with a mid-afternoon press conference to unveil him looking highly likely. Still expecting him to take on a watching brief at Everton tomorrow, along of course with Carlo Ancelotti. Chris from Stockport emails in a question: \u201cJust wondering what you think made Arsenal think \u2013 other than desperation \u2013 that Arteta is more ready to be gaffer now than he was when they appointed Emery?\u201d Well ... I think they panicked last time and did not want to take the risk, so went with a safer, more experienced pair of hands. Seeing as that was a massive failure, it\u2019s time to take a punt on someone with potential. After missing the semi-final victory over Monterray, Virgil van Dijk was seen as a doubt for the Club World Cup final but the Dutch defender trained briefly on Friday. Jurgen Klopp did send Van Dijk straight back to the team hotel after the media section of the session closed, meaning he could still be absent on Saturday. Van Dijk\u2019s compatriot Georginio Wijnaldum was absent, though, so could miss out on the final. Some top top rumours this morning. Arsenal were supposed to hold their pre-match press conference yesterday but cancelled it at short notice due to the fact Mikel Arteta\u2019s appointment will be confirmed later today. It is likely though that Freddie Ljungberg will be the man in the dugout when they face Everton, with Arteta in the stands. Ten things! While following this blog, you will probably be searching the internet for Christmas presents to purchase for people you have forgotten about or dislike. What is the worst football-related Christmas present you have ever received? Barney Ronay has done the research to find out about the process of picking a new manager. Good morning! Today we can expect at least one major managerial appointment in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta will be announced as the Arsenal boss sooner or later (probably this afternoon). The Basque is heading into his first top job and will have a long to do list when he arrives at Colney. Players are looking restless and he needs to build a coaching staff in double quick time as Arsenal look to get back in the top six. Will he keep Freddie Ljungberg on? Will he cheer up Mesut \u00d6zil? Can we sort out the defence? We might start getting answers today. Additionally, Carlo Ancelotti could return to England at Everton after plenty of time away in Spain, France and Italy. The Toffees host Arsenal on Saturday, meaning you could be forgiven for forgetting all the other games. Duncan Ferguson, admittedly, will definitely be in charge at the weekend, so we have one final game of the wristband at the helm. In a match involving two managers not facing the sack, Pep Guardiola faces Brendan Rodgers as third play second on Saturday evening as the race to finish runners-up to Liverpool hots up. Speaking of the Reds, they could become the best team in the world on Saturday night if they get the better of Flamengo in Qatar. Lots to get through!",

This week Boris Johnson\u2019s new government announced plans to introduce legislation to give MI5, MI6 and GCHQ \u201cthe tools they need to disrupt hostile state activity\u201d. The NUJ said it was concerned that the Conservatives wanted \u201cto regurgitate flawed proposals\u201d drawn up by the Law Commission in 2017 as a starting point for changes to laws dating back to 1911 and 1989. An NUJ spokesperson said: \u201cThe union expressed opposition at the time because the proposals included making it easier to prosecute journalists and increased the likelihood of conviction.\u201d At the time, the Law Commission argued that offences relating to official secrets \u201cshould be capable of being committed by someone who not only communicates information, but also by someone who obtains or gathers it\u201d \u2013 a definition that would encompass any reporter. Other proposals made by the commission included broadening the definition of official secrets to \u201cinformation that affects the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom in so far as it relates to national security\u201d. Journalists have periodically been prosecuted under existing rules.

The arrests in Cyprus involve a Cypriot-registered company called WiSpear, owned by Tal Dilian, an Israeli described in local media as a former intelligence officer with customers in Africa, the Gulf and far east. In a bizarre twist, Dilian had been interviewed by Forbes magazine on Cyprus this year boasting of the surveillance capabilities of the vehicle involved, a former GMC ambulance fitted out with about $9m worth of equipment, which he claimed could intercept phones and social messaging apps including WhatsApp from a distance of a kilometre. A Forbes video, showing the blacked-out van packed with equipment, provoked a media frenzy in Cyprus after it went viral last month provoking calls for an investigation into its activities. The arrests on Thursday follow the seizure of the van last month.

Claims of any wrongdoing are denied by Dilian and WiSpear who claim the van was on the island for demonstration purposes and that claims made by the company to Forbes had been wilfully misconstrued.

As the reporter watched, messages from the test subject\u2019s WhatsApp account appeared on a monitor in WiSpear\u2019s van.

Dilian later founded Intellexa, which claims it can spy on encrypted communications, and WiSpear, whose prospectus offers long-range interception vans.

      "body": "<p>When John Briley, who has died aged 94 of a blood disorder, was first approached by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/25/richard-attenborough\" title=\"\">Richard Attenborough</a> with the idea of turning the life of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1948/jan/31/india.fromthearchive1\" title=\"\">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</a> into a film, the screenwriter was sceptical about its appeal. \u201cI was certain that no one in the Detroit of my boyhood or my adopted town in semi-rural England would want to pay to see a film about an old man who sat on a rug in a loincloth and spouted words about peace and passive resistance,\u201d he said. There were his own career prospects to consider: \u201cI had had one or two disasters and really didn\u2019t want another, even a grand one.\u201d But the mystery of the subject, and of Attenborough\u2019s long-held enthusiasm, was unlocked for Briley once he began reading Gandhi\u2019s letters and articles. \u201cGradually the personality of this open, questing, unpretentious man began to unfold for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1504ed71f340816f600b1ad63c2acce6aa52fb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1504ed71f340816f600b1ad63c2acce6aa52fb0a/0_0_3016_2028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Kingsley and Ian Charleson in Gandhi (1982)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Kingsley and Ian Charleson in Gandhi (1982).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were bumps along the way. He resisted the director\u2019s idea of casting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ben-kingsley\" title=\"\">Ben Kingsley</a> in the lead, for example, pushing instead for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/28/john-hurt-obituary\" title=\"\">John Hurt</a>. But the resulting script for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1982/dec/05/features.philipfrench\" title=\"\">Gandhi</a> (1982) brought him the academy award for best original screenplay, one of eight Oscars won by that picture. In his acceptance speech, Briley thanked Attenborough for \u201cputting up with me\u201d and was effusive about Kingsley\u2019s performance, describing it as \u201cbeyond dreams\u201d. Writer and director teamed up again five years later on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/cry-freedom-richard-attenborough-reel-history\" title=\"\">Cry Freedom</a> (1987), which depicted the friendship between the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/20/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Donald Woods</a> (played by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000177/\" title=\"\">Kevin Kline</a>) and the South African activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/18/steve-biko-south-africa-struggle\" title=\"\">Steve Biko</a> (Denzel Washington), who was killed in police custody in 1977.</p> <p>Briley was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the US, and raised in Detroit. He was the sixth of seven children of William, a salesman, and his wife, Stella (nee Daly), a sales assistant in a department store. He was educated at Southwestern high school, Detroit, where he wrote educational radio scripts that won him a scholarship sponsored by a local radio station. His education was interrupted by the war: he spent three years in the US air force, rising to the rank of second lieutenant before resuming his studies at the University of Michigan. One of his professors, the noted Shakespeare scholar GB Harrison, encouraged him to pursue a PhD at the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, in the UK, where he found himself under the supervision of another literary scholar, Allardyce Nicoll.</p> <p>He remained in Britain after finishing his doctorate, and began writing for television, theatre and film.

      "bodyText": "When John Briley, who has died aged 94 of a blood disorder, was first approached by Richard Attenborough with the idea of turning the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi into a film, the screenwriter was sceptical about its appeal. \u201cI was certain that no one in the Detroit of my boyhood or my adopted town in semi-rural England would want to pay to see a film about an old man who sat on a rug in a loincloth and spouted words about peace and passive resistance,\u201d he said. There were his own career prospects to consider: \u201cI had had one or two disasters and really didn\u2019t want another, even a grand one.\u201d But the mystery of the subject, and of Attenborough\u2019s long-held enthusiasm, was unlocked for Briley once he began reading Gandhi\u2019s letters and articles. \u201cGradually the personality of this open, questing, unpretentious man began to unfold for me.\u201d There were bumps along the way. He resisted the director\u2019s idea of casting Ben Kingsley in the lead, for example, pushing instead for John Hurt. But the resulting script for Gandhi (1982) brought him the academy award for best original screenplay, one of eight Oscars won by that picture. In his acceptance speech, Briley thanked Attenborough for \u201cputting up with me\u201d and was effusive about Kingsley\u2019s performance, describing it as \u201cbeyond dreams\u201d. Writer and director teamed up again five years later on Cry Freedom (1987), which depicted the friendship between the journalist Donald Woods (played by Kevin Kline) and the South African activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), who was killed in police custody in 1977. Briley was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the US, and raised in Detroit. He was the sixth of seven children of William, a salesman, and his wife, Stella (nee Daly), a sales assistant in a department store. He was educated at Southwestern high school, Detroit, where he wrote educational radio scripts that won him a scholarship sponsored by a local radio station. His education was interrupted by the war: he spent three years in the US air force, rising to the rank of second lieutenant before resuming his studies at the University of Michigan. One of his professors, the noted Shakespeare scholar GB Harrison, encouraged him to pursue a PhD at the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, in the UK, where he found himself under the supervision of another literary scholar, Allardyce Nicoll. He remained in Britain after finishing his doctorate, and began writing for television, theatre and film. The shows he had written and produced for US air force employees attracted the attention of MGM, which hired him as a staff writer. His work on the horror film Children of the Damned (1964) \u2013 a loose sequel to Village of the Damned (1960), which was itself an adaptation of John Wyndham\u2019s novel The Midwich Cuckoos \u2013 brought him success, though he was unhappy with changes made by the studio to his script. The frustrations he experienced and the drastic recutting of his historical drama Pope Joan (1972), starring Liv Ullmann, led him to bemoan the lowly place of the writer in the film-making process. \u201cYour \u2018creativity\u2019 must be exercised within boundaries set by a budget, by other people\u2019s imaginations, by the vagaries of agents and someone else\u2019s judgment of public taste,\u201d he said in 1981. Other screenplays included That Lucky Touch (1975), a romantic caper with Roger Moore and Susannah York; The Medusa Touch (1978), a preposterous but gripping psychological horror starring Richard Burton as a man compelled to cause death and disaster; and Eagle\u2019s Wing (1979), a ruminative western with Martin Sheen and Harvey Keitel. After winning the Oscar for Gandhi, he wrote Marie (1985), starring Sissy Spacek as a woman fighting corruption in the US prison system. Thereafter he specialised in historical dramas: Tai-Pan (1986), Sandino (1991) and the unloved Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992) in which Marlon Brando gave, according to the critic Roger Ebert, his \u201cworst performance in memory\u201d as Torquemada. He adapted Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible for 20th Century Fox, but the playwright disliked Briley\u2019s version and wrote his own, which was filmed in 1996. Briley also wrote several novels including The Traitors (1969), which questioned America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam. \u201cHe\u2019s a difficult bugger, a bit of a prima donna,\u201d Attenborough said of him in 1987, \u201cbut the bastard\u2019s brilliant.\u201d He was married, first to Dorothy Reichart; they were divorced in the early 1990s after four decades of marriage.

      "body": "<p>The New Zealander Peter Snell, who has died of a heart attack aged 80, was a colossus in the world of athletics who won three Olympic gold medals in middle-distance running during the early 1960s. </p> <p>Having won the 800 metres <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H3waG11yH8\" title=\"\">at the Rome Olympics of 1960</a> as an almost unknown 21-year-old, Snell went on to set a world mile record of 3min 54.4sec (on grass) in 1962, and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7UtoLeBBDA\" title=\"\">a world 800m record</a> of 1:44.3 (also on turf). He arrived at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as carrier of his nation\u2019s flag at the opening ceremony, and was favourite to win the first Olympic 800m/1500m double by a man since Great Britain\u2019s Albert Hill had achieved the feat in Antwerp 44 years earlier.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H3waG11yH8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1H3waG11yH8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Snell wins the 800m gold in dramatic fashion in Rome, 1960.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He realised that dream with two final runs of utter brilliance. Standing at 5ft 10in and weighing just under 13 stone, Snell traded on his power, strength and stamina rather than outright speed. In the 800m final, boxed in at 400m, he had to battle his way past the leaders <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMYiXom88JE\" title=\"\">to win by five metres</a> before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVJQoo70Lic\" title=\"\">taking the 1500m</a> with a superlative performance as he hit the front at 300m out, annihilating the world\u2019s best to win by more than 10m.</p> <p>Sebastian Coe, who later won Olympic medals at the same distances, credited Snell with changing the way athletes prepared for middle-distance running \u2013 both physically and mentally. \u201cHe would think nothing of a 20-mile training run,\u201d said Coe. \u201cHe was unbelievably fit, with the physique of a rugby player. For four years he never lost in global competition, and he would still be a medal contender in Tokyo 2020 with the sort of times and runs he was producing in 1964.</p> <p>\u201cI tried twice to do the double in 1980 and 1984, and finished twice with a gold and a silver. So I know just how hard it is. It isn\u2019t just the physicality, it\u2019s the mental toughness that\u2019s required.

      "bodyText": "The New Zealander Peter Snell, who has died of a heart attack aged 80, was a colossus in the world of athletics who won three Olympic gold medals in middle-distance running during the early 1960s. Having won the 800 metres at the Rome Olympics of 1960 as an almost unknown 21-year-old, Snell went on to set a world mile record of 3min 54.4sec (on grass) in 1962, and then a world 800m record of 1:44.3 (also on turf). He arrived at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as carrier of his nation\u2019s flag at the opening ceremony, and was favourite to win the first Olympic 800m/1500m double by a man since Great Britain\u2019s Albert Hill had achieved the feat in Antwerp 44 years earlier. He realised that dream with two final runs of utter brilliance. Standing at 5ft 10in and weighing just under 13 stone, Snell traded on his power, strength and stamina rather than outright speed. In the 800m final, boxed in at 400m, he had to battle his way past the leaders to win by five metres before taking the 1500m with a superlative performance as he hit the front at 300m out, annihilating the world\u2019s best to win by more than 10m. Sebastian Coe, who later won Olympic medals at the same distances, credited Snell with changing the way athletes prepared for middle-distance running \u2013 both physically and mentally. \u201cHe would think nothing of a 20-mile training run,\u201d said Coe. \u201cHe was unbelievably fit, with the physique of a rugby player. For four years he never lost in global competition, and he would still be a medal contender in Tokyo 2020 with the sort of times and runs he was producing in 1964. \u201cI tried twice to do the double in 1980 and 1984, and finished twice with a gold and a silver. So I know just how hard it is. It isn\u2019t just the physicality, it\u2019s the mental toughness that\u2019s required. And you only had to be in his company to realise how hard it would have been to have beaten him.\u201d New Zealanders still recognise Snell as their greatest Olympian, and his golden double in the 800m and 1500m has not been replicated since. Yet his time at the top was short. In late 1964 he bettered his existing mile world record with a time of 3:54.1, but by the end of 1965, after a number of unexpected defeats and a season where that record fell to the Frenchman Michel Jazy, he announced his retirement at the age of 26. After a spell in public relations he moved into academia. Snell was born in the small North Island town of Opunake to George, an electrical engineer, and his wife, Margaret.

In a statement on his website published shortly after the vote, Healey said: \u201cIn a Brexit referendum and a Brexit election the public have now been clear, and so should Labour: our fight must be about the type of Brexit and the huge difference between Labour and Conservative visions of our economy. Any question about whether Brexit goes ahead has been closed.\u201d Johnson won a thumping Commons majority at last week\u2019s general election by promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and his manifesto included the promise of taking the next step towards leaving the EU before parliament\u2019s Christmas break. Lewell-Buck was joined in the aye lobby by Labour colleagues Jon Cruddas, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins, Sarah Champion and Rosie Cooper. Labour has wrestled ever since the Brexit referendum with how to show that it respected the result, while satisfying its half-million members, the overwhelming majority of whom are pro-remain. Starmer, who helped to push his party towards adopting a policy of holding a second referendum, told MPs that, as a result of the general election result, \u201cwe will have left the EU within the next six months.

Several prominent Labour frontbenchers who had previously warned about the risks of the party being seen to block Brexit obeyed the whip on Friday and voted against Johnson\u2019s deal. These included the potential leadership candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey, and deputy leadership contenders Richard Burgon and Angela Rayner. In total, 162 Labour MPs voted to oppose the bill: 32 short of Labour\u2019s complement in the new parliament of 202 MPs, once the six who voted for the bill and the two tellers who count the votes are taken into account. Labour whips estimated that approximately 20 of the MPs who failed to vote against had deliberately decided to defy the leadership and abstain \u2013 with others either paired with Conservatives, or were given permission to be absent. No disciplinary action is expected to be taken immediately against frontbenchers who disobeyed the whip \u2013 and parliament is now in recess until 7 January, when MPs will continue their scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill.",

It\u2019s The Trial, a documentary about the imprisonment of Russian-Ukrainian film-maker Oleg Sentsov. In it Sentsov \u2013 who has since been released \u2013 mocks the Russian legal system and laughs when his sentence is extended. It\u2019s a film about being scared but not afraid, like Hatsura-Yavorska and her team \u2013 almost all women \u2013 are scared but not afraid.

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has been referred to the police watchdog over her handling of Operation Midland, the force\u2019s investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse by members of the British establishment. The Mayor of London\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) said it made the referral to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) after it received a complaint from a member of the public last month. Operation Midland was launched in 2014 after Carl Beech \u2013 known initially by the pseudonym \u201cNick\u201d \u2013 began making a series of shocking and macabre claims about child sexual abuse and murder by members of Britain\u2019s elite. The inquiry lasted a year and a half and cost \u00a32.5m, and ended without a single arrest. In July this year Beech, 51, was found guilty of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud over his claims. He was jailed for 18 years. A spokesperson for the IOPC said the complaint related to comments made by Dick about the operation, as well as an allegation that she \u201cfailed to take action to correct a statement made to the media by an Operation Midland detective\u201d. In October, Harvey Proctor, a former Conservative MP accused of being a part of the non-existent VIP paedophile ring, urged Dick to \u201cconsider her position\u201d after a report revealed that senior officers agreed at the outset of the investigation to publicly say they believed the allegations. Subsequently, Det Supt Kenny McDonald, who retired on the eve of Beech\u2019s trial, told the media: \u201c\u2018Nick\u2019 has been spoken to by experienced officers from the child abuse team and experienced officers from the murder investigation team. They and I believe what \u2018Nick\u2019 is saying is credible and true.\u201d A Met police spokesperson said the force received the complaint against Dick on 31 October as part of a referral from Northumbria police and passed it on to Mopac as the appropriate authority. The IOPC said: \u201cWe are assessing the information provided to determine whether an investigation is necessary and, if so, what level of involvement is required by the IOPC.\u201d Mopac\u2019s role as the appropriate authority means it will bring disciplinary proceedings against the commissioner if directed to do so by the watchdog\u2019s investigators.",

This reputation means he is likely to maintain the Bank\u2019s position on interest rates of slow and incremental increases. He is not a macroeconomist and has not been a member of the monetary policy committee, which he will chair and meets eight times a year to set interest rates. Yet his previous roles at the Bank include private secretary to the governor and leading the international economic analysis division in monetary analysis, a technical job that provides the information needed to set interest rates.",

Michael, Sheffield</em></p> <p>The need for voter ID could be very significant in my opinion. It was pleasing to see in the Queen\u2019s speech that the government suggested that those who did not have ID could apply for a free local electoral identity document. However impersonation at an election is extremely low, which makes this new rule seem heavy handed. The concern is that those on lower incomes who do not have the right documents will be put off voting.</p> <p><em>Q: Hi Kate, There is going to be an inevitable push and pull between left and centre-left in the Labour party for the forthcoming leadership election. What do you think the new leader needs to do to reconnect with lost votes, bearing in mind the policies under Corbyn seemed pretty popular? Nat, 26, local government officer, London</em></p> <p>It\u2019s true that the policies were popular but that many did not find Corbyn credible as a leader in order to deliver them. A leftwing manifesto may work again but scaled down as voters felt overwhelmed by the significant offer of policies. I think a new leader needs to work extremely hard in building a profile in the north of England and the Midlands. I felt some of the rallies in the election campaign were in the wrong places and there was no visibility of Labour in town centres, high streets and on market days. <br></p> <p>Even if it does not feel easy, leaders really need to do on the ground walkabouts and take the criticism head on. I think it may be sensible to try to bring a shadow cabinet together that has people with slightly different views from the leader on domestic policy.

Jon, 40, administrator, Sheffield</em></p> <p>Yes, he can abolish it and plans to do so in the first few months of 2020. It is something of a priority for the government. The previous arrangements of an election being held every five years will come back into force. Even if the FTPA existed, Johnson\u2019s majority means it would be very unlikely that MPs would try to call for an early election anyway.</p> <p><em>Q: What\u2019s happened to the report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum? Fred, London</em></p> <p>We are still awaiting its publication, although Boris Johnson \u2013 after securing his majority \u2013 decided that the government was now in a position to release it. Expect pressure to mount for its publication in the early new year but it could still take months. The fact it was not printed pre-election was highly controversial and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was the intelligence and security committee chair, said the reasons given were \u201cbogus\u201d. The report was compiled by the committee but a new chair and members will need to be elected, which could hold things up. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T14:02:03.590Z\">at 2.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcbefd8f087e8308e61b4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:41:20.171Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of your questions so far have been about the opposition and a second referendum on Scottish independence:<br></p> <p><em>Q: This is the first big majority in parliament in over a decade. How will the opposition now operate in parliament since they are unlikley to be able to defeat the government on any legislation? Craig, 36, works in the public sector, Stirling</em></p> <p>The majority Conservative government is new ground for many opposition MPs and for those who took their seats in 2017. They have never operated in a majority scenario before. You might expect tighter whipping as the last thing Labour needs is to look divided in the face of huge majority votes that pass with ease. When there\u2019s only 202 Labour MPs, every vote counts. <br></p> <p>You might also see informal discussions with the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green on votes and working as a bloc. While they will not be able to overcome the Tory majority of 80, unity between those parties is in the very least a visual message to the public that the government is scrutinised and opposed. There will also be a scramble for opposition MPs to get the chair position on select committees, which is a powerful way of holding the government to account.</p> <p><em>Q: The SNP received a larger share of the vote in Scotland (45%) to the Conservatives in the UK (44%). Do you think that Boris\u2019 position to \u201cnot permit\u201d a second referendum on Scottish independence is democratically sustainable? James Munro, 53, architect, Glasgow</em></p> <p>Boris Johnson was extremely firm on this in the Queen\u2019s speech when the SNP brought up independence. He is 100 per cent against it and the power to grant another independence vote is in his hands. I think he will stick to this and will not bend to pressure. That does not of course stop the debate raging within the Commons throughout his entire premiership. I do think the first 12 months will be the time for Sturgeon to capitalise on her share of the vote in Scotland and I think we can expect her coming down to Westminster to hold press conferences and meetings with her MPs with more frequency.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:45:39.609Z\">at 12.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcbf928f085eda5c10b49e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:36:20.672Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SDLP\u2019s <strong>Claire Hanna</strong> used her maiden Commons speech to warn that Brexit \u201creopens old wounds\u201d in Northern Ireland.

Here it is with a few gaps for interjections:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I beg to move that the bill be read a second time and that we come together as a new Parliament, to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done.</p> <p> Now is the moment \u2013 as we leave the European Union \u2013 to reunite our country and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share with our European neighbours \u2013 to find renewed expression in one great new national project of building a deep, special and democratically accountable partnership with those nations we are proud to call our closest friends.</p> <p> Because this bill, and this juncture in our national story, Mr Speaker must not be seen as a victory for one party or one faction over another.</p> <p> This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain in fact the very words seem tired to me as defunct as big enders and little enders or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny,and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us.</p> <p> And the whole purpose of our withdrawal agreement is to set this in motion and avoid any further delay. And in the hope that the honourable gentleman does not wish to have any further delay I will give way to him.</p> <p>... I think most people looking at the negotiation would agree that it strengthens our negotiating position. If we have learned anything from the experience of the last three years it is that drift and dither means more acrimony, and anguish Mr Speaker and there would be nothing more dangerous for the new future that we want to build than allowing the permanent possibility of extending \u2013 I think I\u2019m coming to the point that the right honourable members wish to discuss- the implementation period in a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back as all right honourable members in the House will recall \u2013 and then growing back only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever</p> <p> This bill learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament unlike members opposite and rejects any further delay. It ensures that we depart from the EU on 31 January \u2013 and at that point Brexit will be done.</p> <p> It will be over. The sorry story of the last three-and-a-half years will be at an end and we will be able to move forward Mr Speaker together</p> <p> The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31December next year \u2013 with no possibility of an extension. </p> <p> And it paves the way for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours, based on an ambitious free trade agreement, with no alignment on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws, and close and friendly relations.</p> <p> Mr Speaker, this vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many is now \u2013 if this new parliament allows \u2013 only hours from our grasp the oven is on so to speak. It is set at gas mark 4 we can have it done by lunch time or late lunch</p> <p> And the new deal that I negotiated with our European friends will restore our great institutions to their rightful place as the supreme instruments of British self-governance.</p> <p> Once again this house will be the only assembly able to legislate for this United Kingdom. British courts will be the sole arbiters of those laws.</p> <p> And above them all, the sovereign British people masters of their own fate, controlling their own borders, laws, money and trade.</p> <p> And throughout our new immigration system, we will not only welcome those with talent but go out of our way to attract people of ability regardless of nationality or background.</p> <p> And we are only able to do this because the freedoms offered by our European Union partners \u2013 by leaving the EU \u2013 allow us once again to control overall numbers and bear down on unskilled immigration with our new points-based system.</p> <p> And if the honourable lady if she is against our new control of immigration I would like to hear her explain why</p> <p>.... We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children and will continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of Dubs amendment but this is not the place in this bill to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so. And amongst many other advantages of this bill Mr Speaker is of course that we will be able to sign free trade deals with the booming markets of the world, a power that no British government has enjoyed for the last 46 years.</p> <p>We will cast off the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\">common agricultural policy</a> that has too often frustrated and burdened our farmers we will release our fishermen from the tangled driftnets of arcane quota systems ...</p> <p> I remind the House and I remind the members opposite that there is of course on party in this House that is committed to reversing will of the people and handing back control of Scotland\u2019s outstanding marine wealth to Brussels \u2013 the SNP. That\u2019s what they would do.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing them explain why they continue to support this abject policy and abject surrender. This house will also under this bill regain the authority to set the highest possible standards and we will take advantage of these new freedoms to legislate in parallel on the environment, on workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights.</p> <p> And I reject the inexplicable fear \u2013 and I will give way for the last time \u2013 the right honourable lady may wish to talk about this ... </p> <p>The very essence of the opportunity of Brexit is we will no longer outsource these decisions.</p> <p> With renewed national self-confidence we will take them ourselves and answer to those who sent us here.</p> <p> It was this parliament \u2013 this parliament \u2013 in this country that led the whole of Europe and the world in passing the Factory Acts \u2013 the clean air Acts of the nineteenth century \u2013 which improved industrial working conditions by law. And this house should never doubt its ability to pioneer the standards of the fourth industrial revolution just as we did the first.</p> <p> And that epoch-making transformation \u2013 as with all the pivotal achievements of British history \u2013 reflected the combined national genius of every corner of this United Kingdom.</p> <p> In this new era our success, once again, will be achieved as one nation.</p> <p> This new deal in this bill ensures that the United Kingdom will leave the EU whole and entire with an unwavering dedication to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in our union ... Let me just remind the House Mr Speaker that the special provisions applying to Northern Ireland \u2013 which ensure after all one very important thing \u2013 that there is no hard border across Ireland and Northern Ireland are subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland assembly.</p> <p> And unless the assembly specifically withholds its consent unless indeed the assembly insists on continuing with this approach then those arrangements automatically lapse into full alignment with the rest of the UK.</p> <p> I believe these arrangements serve the interests of Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole. And it is a great deal for our whole country. And we must now begin building our future relationship with the EU.</p> <p> Our aim is to provide a close friendship, between sovereign equals, to promote our common interests inspired by pride in our European heritage and civilisation.</p> <p> And Clause 3 of the political declaration invokes that spirit \u2013 establishing \u2013 and I quote \u201cthe parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership\u201d rooted in our shared \u201chistory and ideals\u201d and \u201cstanding together against threats to rights and values from without or within\u201d.</p> <p> I am absolutely determined that this great project will not be the project of one government or one party but of the British nation as a whole.</p> <p> So parliament as I have said will be kept fully informed about progress of these negotiations. And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 and policy of Lib Dems is now to have another referendum \u2013 so when they have worked their policy out I\u2019ll give way.</p> <p>And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 have been tested as never before if this house comes together now to support this bill as I hope it will history will record that the first act of this new parliament in its earliest days was to break the ice floes and find a new way \u2013 a new passage through - to unsuspected oceans of opportunity.</p> <p> Now is the moment to come together and write a new and exciting chapter in our national story to forge a new partnership with our European friends to stand tall in the world and to begin the healing for which the whole people of this country yearn.</p> <p> And it is in that spirit of unity that I commend this bill to the House.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:41:46.599Z\">at 12.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcb51b8f08c3972263df27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T11:52:20.246Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who came to the UK as a refugee in 1939 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/18/british-compassion-politics-kindertransport-cross-party-movement\">on the Kindertransport </a>and forced the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, has reacted with dismay to the removal of these provisions from the bill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlfDubs/status/1207989712398508033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These are among the most vulnerable children imaginable - unaccompanied and alone. <br>We&#39;re not talking large numbers.

They were fighting the election in the last ten days over Brexit\u201d. </p> <p>Asked whether continued Tory refusal would, as Sturgeon has suggested, increase support for independence, Jack warned that the first minister\u2019s call to devolve the power to hold referendums permanently to Holyrood would result in \u201cperpetual neverendums\u201d. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfca8c48f085eda5c10b35b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T10:58:24.316Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tory backbencher <strong>Suella Braverman </strong>claims trust in politicians was stretched to breaking point in the last parliament. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfca7228f08c3972263de68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T10:55:16.621Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeffrey Donaldson</strong>, the leader of DUP in the Commons, says that European Union will continue to have a say in Northern Ireland affairs under the bill. </p> <p>I want the prime minister to treat my part of the United Kingdom the same as the rest of the country when it comes to leaving the European Union, Donaldson says. </p> <p>We don\u2019t want barriers to trade with the rest of the country, he said.

It will not protect or strengthen our rights or support our manufacturing industry and vital trading relationships, or protect our natural world in a time of a climate crisis.</p> <p>Neither will it address the deep inequality in our system or secure the interests of every nation and region in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Instead under the Conservatives this deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path of yet more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines to benefit the giant US drugs corporations.</p> <p>That will take us away from the essential principles we believe in, of a country that looks after everybody and protects those communities left behind by the excesses of runaway capitalism.</p> <p>This deal doesn\u2019t bring certainty for communities or for business and workforces. In fact it does the opposite and hardwires in the risk of a no-deal Brexit in a year\u2019s time.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure that will delight many of those on the benches opposite but not those who will suffer the consequences in communities and workplaces across Britain.</p> <p>That is why Labour will not support this Bill as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU.</p> <p>One which would not risk ripping our communities apart, selling out our public services or sacrificing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process.</p> <p>This deal is a roadmap for the reckless direction in which the government and the Prime Minister are determined to take our country. They have done their utmost to hide its likely impact and continue to use gimmicks and slogans to turn attention away from their real intentions.</p> <p>And nothing exposes this more than the steps they have already taken on workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>For all the promises over the past few weeks that they are the party to protect rights at work, at the very first opportunity they have removed the basic provisions they had said would be part of this bill.</p> <p>That does not bode well for the separate bill the prime minister is now saying he will bring forward on workers\u2019 rights</p> <p>If he wants to assure people that their rights are safe in his hands he should commit to legislate to ensure workers rights in Britain will never fall behind EU standards in the future and support amendments to enshrine this commitment within this bill.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, I want to make it absolutely clear how appalled I am to see the government remove the protections in this Bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum.</p> <p>Throughout the last Parliament and for his whole life my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice are given sanctuary in this country.</p> <p>Now this government, in its first week in office has ripped up those hard won commitments.</p> <p>This is a move the director of the charity Safe Passage has described as, and I quote: \u201ctruly shocking\u201d Saying it could have and I quote again: \u201cpotentially tragic consequences\u201d. </p> <p>Shame on this government for abandoning children in this way.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, on the environment and food safety standards this deal points to a complete realignment towards the far weaker protections and standards that operate in Donald Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p>If this government is set on pursuing a Trump trade deal with precious few bargaining chips to hand the brutal reality is that Britain will have to lower its standards.</p> <p>The EU has made it clear that a future trade deal with them will depend on maintaining a level playing field in standards and protections.</p> <p>So the choice we now face is between keeping the highest environmental and food standards in order to get that future deal with the EU or slashing food standards to match the US, where what are called \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed, just so we can strike a new race-to-the-bottom deal with Donald Trump.</p> <p>Turning to the arrangements with Northern Ireland the Prime Minister has emphatically claimed, and I quote:\u201cthere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB\u201d</p> <p> And that: \u201cwe have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together as we come of the EU\u201d</p> <p> These claims are simply not true.</p> <p>We know from the analysis carried out by his own Treasury that under his deal there will, in fact, be an abundance of checks and customs declarations in the Irish Sea.</p> <p>Not only will this have a huge impact on Northern Irish business and society, it will also have implications for the rest of Britain\u2019s economy and manufacturing industry.</p> <p>The Treasury\u2019s own analysis spells it out: the more the government diverges from EU trading regulations in the future the more checks and disruption will be put in place between Britain and our biggest trading partner.</p> <p>More checks and more disruption would be deeply damaging for trade and for our manufacturing sector and threatens to take a wrecking ball to our vital supply chains and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on them.</p> <p>From car manufacturers to the chemical industry disruption to our just-in-time supply chains will have a devastating impact.</p> <p>This all makes it even more incredible that since agreeing its deal the government has yet to produce a single bit of evidence or analysis to show it will have a positive impact on the economy or our communities in any way. We scarcely need to ask ourselves, why?</p> <p> I say to all members new and old that it is our job to question to scrutinise and to hold the government of the day to account.</p> <p>If we believe the government is taking the wrong approach we should not be afraid to oppose.</p> <p>And when it comes to our future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world we cannot let this government act in an undemocratic and secretive manner.</p> <p>Trade deals with the EU, the US, or anybody else for that matter must be done transparently.

To do that, we must open up power like never before. An inequality of power underpins the inequalities of wealth and opportunity that scar our country. The trade unions were founded to give power and a voice to working class people. They founded the Labour Party, and by winning power we built the NHS, free state education and the welfare state.</p> <p>The rich and privileged have always had the power they need to shape their lives and to shape world in their own interests. Labour\u2019s historic task is to open up power to everyone else so we can build the fairer world we believe in. We call it socialism because we believe in the transformative power of society and communities. That historic mission remains our mission today.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t do it on our own. The point about a movement is it brings everyone together in a common cause. Labour must learn from the social movements that people create to fight injustice: renters\u2019 unions, delivery drivers\u2019 unions, movements to prevent social cleansing of estates. We need to embed this party deep into the everyday lives of people in areas that feel hopeless and abandoned.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer calls for Labour to broaden its appeal and widen its ideological stance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Labour tradition has never drawn from a single ideology: at its best, it is an alliance of different traditions. The challenge of leadership is to draw out the best from them, and get them working towards the single goal of an electoral majority.</p> <p>We have so much more in common than that which divides us, and each of us has something to teach and something to learn.

After comfortably passing its second reading by 358 votes to 234, the withdrawal agreement bill is on track to complete its passage through both houses of parliament in time to allow Britain to leave the European Union at the end of January. Speaking ahead of the vote, Boris Johnson called on the British public to discard the labels of leave and remain as MPs prepared to take a historic step towards withdrawing the UK from the EU. Labour opposed the bill, but six of the party\u2019s MPs voted with the government and a further 32 abstained, including three shadow cabinet members. Ahead of the vote, Corbyn said: \u201cThis deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path towards more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines. We remain certain there is a better and fairer way for Britain to leave the EU.\u201d A former Tory MP breached the ministerial code by using force against a climate change protester at a black-tie City dinner, a government investigation has found. Mark Field, who stood down from parliament after being suspended as a Foreign Office minister, grabbed a Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, by the neck and forced her out of the event. Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK financial watchdog, has been named as the next governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced the replacement for Mark Carney, who is due to stand down from the role at the end of January after six-and-a-half years in the job. The new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has revealed he was diagnosed with diabetes days before the general election, and vowed it will not prevent him from carrying out the prestigious role. Hoyle, 62, said he had lost three stone in recent months and said he was still in shock over the diagnosis. Here\u2019s a nice interactive showing how each MP voted in the withdrawal agreement bill vote this afternoon. In more news regarding alleged ministerial code breaches ... Former Tory MP Mark Field is found to have breached the code by using force against a climate change protester at a black-tie City dinner. Field, who stood down from parliament after being suspended as a Foreign Office minister, grabbed a Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, by the neck and forced her out of the event. The Cabinet Office investigation found that he had to make a \u201csplit-second decision\u201d and \u201chad the option of simply blocking her way\u201d during the incident in London\u2019s Mansion House in June. You can read more here \u2013 A Cabinet Office investigation into Tory MP Alun Cairns, who quit the Cabinet during the election campaign, has not upheld allegations of a breach of the ministerial code, the PA news agency reports. The former Welsh secretary announced he was standing down from the Cabinet last month over his links to a Conservative candidate accused of sabotaging a rape trial. The report, published today, found it \u201cunlikely\u201d that the MP was not told anything about his former staff member\u2019s role, but concluded that the evidence did not support the allegations of a breach. You can read the full story here \u2013 And here\u2019s shadow housing secretary John Healey on why he abstained \u2013 Six Labour members voted for the bill \u2013 Sarah Champion, Rosie Cooper, Jon Cruddas, Emma Lewell-Buck, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins. Here is Lewell-Buck\u2019s speech, in which she says that it is with a heavy heart that she has decided she couldn\u2019t vote with the Labour party. Some Labour MPs have written on Twitter about why they decided to abstain in this afternoon\u2019s vote. Sharon Hodgson, MP for Washington and Sunderland West, said she had always said she would not vote for a form of Brexit that would harm those she represented, but she recognised that her constituents wanted to see the UK leave the EU. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has responded to the announcement by the Crown Prosecution Service that they will be charging the wife of a US intelligence officer with causing the death by dangerous driving of the 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn. I welcome the taking of a charging decision which is an important step towards justice for Harry and towards solace for his family, but it is not the end. I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realise the right thing to do is to come back to the UK and cooperate with the criminal justice process. Charles Michel, the president of the European council, welcomed the vote, tweeting that it was an \u201cimportant step in the article 50 ratification process\u201d. He added: \u201cA level playing field remains a must for any future relationship,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s demand for fair competition in exchange for a free-trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas. The European parliament expects to ratify the withdrawal treaty on 29 January, if the next stages at Westminster go to plan, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. This is from BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. He says as many as 30 Labour MPs abstained or stayed away from the vote on the Brexit bill this afternoon. You can read our story on the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill at second reading here. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart writes: Parliament has passed a historic milestone towards leaving the European Union, backing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill by a thumping majority of 124, a week after the Conservatives won a landslide victory in the general election. After comfortably passing its second reading by 358 votes to 234, the withdrawal agreement bill is on track to complete its passage through both houses of parliament in time to allow Britain to leave the European Union at the end of January. The clear support for the bill marked a decisive break with the parliamentary gridlock that marked the past two years. The programme motion has been passed by 353 votes to 243. The deputy speaker wishes members a very peaceful Christmas and they file out. There is now an adjournment debate on the \u201cprogress of Southend towards city status\u201d and then parliament breaks up til 7 January. The Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett has tweeted some pictures of the prime minister signing copies of the withdrawal agreement bill for MPs: This, from the Mirror\u2019s deputy political editor Ben Glaze: MPs are now voting on the programme motion, which sets out the timetable for getting the bill through parliament by 31 January. It\u2019s a good time to share another explainer on what happens after the Brexit bill passes. (Spoiler alert \u2013 Brexit will not be done.) Some reaction from political journalists \u2013 MPs have voted on the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill at the second reading. With Boris Johnson\u2019s 80-strong majority, the bill was passed by a comfortable margin, with 358 voting for and 234 against. Here\u2019s an explainer from Guardian Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on what\u2019s new in this version of the bill: Today\u2019s vote means MPs have approved the general principles of the bill and it will now move to what is known as \u201ccommittee stage\u201d, where a more detailed examination takes place. Here\u2019s a guide as to what happens next from parliament\u2019s website. As we are waiting for the outcome of the vote on the WAB, reports that the prime minister is signing copies of the bill for MPs. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the general election had delivered a clear instruction to parliament to leave the EU and so MPs should respect that decision and back the bill. This bill is not a victory for one side over the other. The time has come to discard the old labels to move from the past divisions and to come together as one United Kingdom. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who is predicted to run for the Labour leadership, warned Conservative MPs to \u201cbe careful\u201d. \u201cDoing things because the government has a majority doesn\u2019t mean those things are right,\u201d he said. He said the move to water down commitments to child refugees was an example of that. \u201cThat is a moral disgrace,\u201d he said. I turn to my own benches. We may have lost the general election, but we have not lost our values and our beliefs and we must fight for them \u2013 day in, day out \u2013 in this parliament and we will. Starmer said the result of the general election means that Brexit will happen. \u201cWe will have left the EU within the next six months,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever side we were on \u2013 or no side at all \u2013 the leave/remain argument goes with it.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that the deal negotiated by the prime minister is a good deal. It isn\u2019t. It was a bad deal in October when it was signed. It was a bad deal when it was first debated in this house in October. It was a bad deal last Thursday and it\u2019s a bad deal today. Starmer says that, in fact, it is a worse deal today because the government has removed the role of parliamentarians to vote on negotiating objectives and has sidelined workers\u2019 rights. He also says that the clause that prevents the government from asking for an extension is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d. You can read the background on his point here. Lee Rowley, the Conservative MP for North East Derbyshire, said it was just over a year since he announced \u201cwith great regret\u201d he would not be supporting the government on the initial iteration of the withdrawal agreement bill. \u201cI think all of us who served in the previous parliament, particularly on these benches, regret what happened over the past year or so,\u201d he said. \u201cWherever we stood, whatever our views, there was a fog that descended over this place, which meant that people here, otherwise rational, otherwise willing to look at the wider picture, were unable to do so, and it paralysed our politics. And today marks an important stage for many of us that we can start to move on.\u201d Meg Hillier, the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, thanked Rowley for speaking \u201ccharacteristically thoughtfully and without triumphalism\u201d. But she said there were very valid reasons why the \u201crushed bill and rushed debate on it\u201d would lead to very real problems in the future. Debbie Abrahams, Labour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said there is \u201cso much\u201d wrong with the withdrawal agreement bill, much more than before. She says that a free trade agreement of the sort sought by the government would have a terrible impact on the economy and on constituencies like hers. I am going to withhold any firm views until I\u2019ve seen the British election survey when it\u2019s published \u2013 the most reliable evidence that you can get on the election \u2013 in the new year, but I can\u2019t ignore what constituents were saying to me. They ignored or didn\u2019t believe the evidence or even worse, they didn\u2019t care and I think there\u2019s a lot we need to take from that about how we conduct ourselves. Politics and politicians really need to take that on board. The emotional response to Brexit \u2013 and that is what it has been \u2013 has been a lesson for all of us. Mike Wood, the Conservative MP for Dudley South, said he spoke to many former Labour voters during the campaign who said they would be voting for him. He said the phrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d did not come from election posters, but from the doorstep. \u201cIn those areas that for many, many years have been returning Labour members to this house, the overwhelming sense was frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were tired of being ignored by their representatives and Brexit was an obvious example.\u201d They were tired of being patronised by so many people who would claim to represent them, and we\u2019ve even heard some of those sentiments today from the members opposite. The suggestion that, whether it was in the general election or in the referendum campaign, that the voters who firstly voted for Brexit and now for a Conservative government \u2026 that they either didn\u2019t understand the question or they were mislead by the slogans, or perhaps their prejudices meant they couldn\u2019t make a fair decision ... Thanks for all your questions Here are a few more of your questions answered. Q: Where can I go to be part of a \u2018rejoin the EU\u2019 fight back? I am feeling a terrible powerlessness and don\u2019t want it to become hopelessness. Alistair Levie, bed and breakfast owner, Torquay There is the Final Say group if you\u2019re looking to try to push for a confirmatory public vote. Details on this are easy to find online. A rejoiners group set up shortly after the election is being run by the leadership and membership of the Open Britain/People\u2019s Vote campaign group. It does not have a website so it appears hard to know how to get engaged but as ever, Twitter might be able to provide connections to people who feel the same way. Q: If we had proportional representation, with the same voting system, what would be the number of seats allocated to each party? Kay, Felixstowe Some research done by the Conversation website, and not by the Guardian, looked at both the German and Dutch models of PR. They concluded that under both systems the Conservatives would have won the most seats but not an outright majority, coming in at fewer than 300 MPs, and inevitably leading to a hung parliament. The Lib Dems do better and the Scottish National party fared worse in both forms of PR. The Brexit party and the Greens would have done mildly better under a Dutch system but not the German one. Hello, it\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over the live blog from Matthew Weaver. Ruth Cadbury, the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth, has been speaking in the house. She said parliament had a duty to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement bill. She said 53% of people voted for parties that wanted a second referendum in the general election and opinion polls showed most people were now in favour of remaining in the EU. Never have we had a prime minister that spent so much effort avoiding scrutiny. We\u2019ve noticed in recent weeks that when he can\u2019t avoid the question he responds with a posh bloke version of Little Britain\u2019s Vicky Pollard: \u2018Nah but ya, but nah but yah.\u2019 Just over 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election results and what happens next. Send them in to us here. Q: How significantly will voter ID and the new constituency boundaries influence future elections? Michael, Sheffield The need for voter ID could be very significant in my opinion. It was pleasing to see in the Queen\u2019s speech that the government suggested that those who did not have ID could apply for a free local electoral identity document. However impersonation at an election is extremely low, which makes this new rule seem heavy handed. The concern is that those on lower incomes who do not have the right documents will be put off voting. Q: Hi Kate, There is going to be an inevitable push and pull between left and centre-left in the Labour party for the forthcoming leadership election. What do you think the new leader needs to do to reconnect with lost votes, bearing in mind the policies under Corbyn seemed pretty popular? Nat, 26, local government officer, London It\u2019s true that the policies were popular but that many did not find Corbyn credible as a leader in order to deliver them. A leftwing manifesto may work again but scaled down as voters felt overwhelmed by the significant offer of policies. I think a new leader needs to work extremely hard in building a profile in the north of England and the Midlands. I felt some of the rallies in the election campaign were in the wrong places and there was no visibility of Labour in town centres, high streets and on market days. Even if it does not feel easy, leaders really need to do on the ground walkabouts and take the criticism head on. I think it may be sensible to try to bring a shadow cabinet together that has people with slightly different views from the leader on domestic policy. However, they should not have a shadow cabinet that is push and pull on Brexit. That will be too hard to navigate and it\u2019s been proven that it makes the public think there is not a cohesive top level of leadership. You have been sending in your questions about the general election results, which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Can Johnson abolish the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and not replace it with anything else, meaning there will be no local means of an election being called? Jon, 40, administrator, Sheffield Yes, he can abolish it and plans to do so in the first few months of 2020. It is something of a priority for the government. The previous arrangements of an election being held every five years will come back into force. Even if the FTPA existed, Johnson\u2019s majority means it would be very unlikely that MPs would try to call for an early election anyway. Q: What\u2019s happened to the report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum? Fred, London We are still awaiting its publication, although Boris Johnson \u2013 after securing his majority \u2013 decided that the government was now in a position to release it. Expect pressure to mount for its publication in the early new year but it could still take months. The fact it was not printed pre-election was highly controversial and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was the intelligence and security committee chair, said the reasons given were \u201cbogus\u201d. The report was compiled by the committee but a new chair and members will need to be elected, which could hold things up. Some of your questions so far have been about the opposition and a second referendum on Scottish independence: Q: This is the first big majority in parliament in over a decade. How will the opposition now operate in parliament since they are unlikley to be able to defeat the government on any legislation? Craig, 36, works in the public sector, Stirling The majority Conservative government is new ground for many opposition MPs and for those who took their seats in 2017. They have never operated in a majority scenario before. You might expect tighter whipping as the last thing Labour needs is to look divided in the face of huge majority votes that pass with ease. When there\u2019s only 202 Labour MPs, every vote counts. You might also see informal discussions with the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green on votes and working as a bloc. While they will not be able to overcome the Tory majority of 80, unity between those parties is in the very least a visual message to the public that the government is scrutinised and opposed. There will also be a scramble for opposition MPs to get the chair position on select committees, which is a powerful way of holding the government to account. Q: The SNP received a larger share of the vote in Scotland (45%) to the Conservatives in the UK (44%). Do you think that Boris\u2019 position to \u201cnot permit\u201d a second referendum on Scottish independence is democratically sustainable? James Munro, 53, architect, Glasgow Boris Johnson was extremely firm on this in the Queen\u2019s speech when the SNP brought up independence. He is 100 per cent against it and the power to grant another independence vote is in his hands. I think he will stick to this and will not bend to pressure. That does not of course stop the debate raging within the Commons throughout his entire premiership. I do think the first 12 months will be the time for Sturgeon to capitalise on her share of the vote in Scotland and I think we can expect her coming down to Westminster to hold press conferences and meetings with her MPs with more frequency. The SDLP\u2019s Claire Hanna used her maiden Commons speech to warn that Brexit \u201creopens old wounds\u201d in Northern Ireland. She said: \u201cFor Northern Ireland in particular, Brexit has sharpened all of the lines that the Good Friday agreement was designed to soften around identity, around borders, around sovereignty. \u201cWe should have been spending the last few years talking about reconciliation, talking about regeneration, talking about social justice and equality. \u201cThat\u2019s what all political action should really be about but instead we\u2019ve spent morning, noon and night talking about Brexit \u2013 a problem that didn\u2019t need to exist and which, particularly in Northern Ireland, reopens old wounds and limits our horizons.\u201d Hanna said Brexit \u201cfed off\u201d people who felt lost and disenfranchised in the political system, adding: \u201cI fear it will leave them feeling much worse.\u201d She also said: \u201cBeyond the economy, Brexit upends the delicate balance that in Northern Ireland has allowed us to imagine our shared and equal future together. \u201cWe in Northern Ireland know the value of the EU and, as my political hero and predecessor in this house, John Hume, so often said, the EU is the greatest peace-building and conflict resolution project anywhere in the world and those of us particularly affected by conflict have a duty to reflect its principles. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the concerns we have have been dismissed by those of you who won\u2019t ever have to live with the consequences of these actions.\u201d I\u2019m Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering any questions you have on the general election results today. I have been covering politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian I worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political correspondent. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Mark Francois, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group, said the election has broken the logjam of the last parliament over Brexit. He said he wished anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray, a \u201chappy and silent retirement\u201d after he came sixth in the seat of Cynon Valley for the Liberal Democrats in the election. \u201cAll I want to for Christmas is not EU,\u201d Francois said. At the end of her speech backbench Tory MP Rachel Maclean said: \u201cI want to wish everybody a very Merry Brexmas.\u201d Labour\u2019s Catherine McKinnell (Newcastle upon Tyne North) said the Conservative election slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was misleading. She said: \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t going to be done. The challenges of the next stage are infinitely more complex than the first.\u201d Matthew Pennycook, Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, added: \u201cThere is no question it did its job, but after 31 January the slogan Get Brexit Done will be exposed as the fiction it is. \u201cBecause when this bill becomes law, as it will, it will not mean that Brexit is done, and every single honourable and right honourable member on the benches opposite who parroted that line during the recent election campaign knows full well that is the case. \u201cBrexit is a process not an act and the passage of this legislation and the full implementation of the agreement by both parties is only the end of the beginning of that process and a prelude to a far more challenging phase of it.\u201d Number 10 has released the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech opening the debate. Here it is with a few gaps for interjections: I beg to move that the bill be read a second time and that we come together as a new Parliament, to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done. Now is the moment \u2013 as we leave the European Union \u2013 to reunite our country and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share with our European neighbours \u2013 to find renewed expression in one great new national project of building a deep, special and democratically accountable partnership with those nations we are proud to call our closest friends. Because this bill, and this juncture in our national story, Mr Speaker must not be seen as a victory for one party or one faction over another. This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain in fact the very words seem tired to me as defunct as big enders and little enders or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny,and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us. And the whole purpose of our withdrawal agreement is to set this in motion and avoid any further delay. And in the hope that the honourable gentleman does not wish to have any further delay I will give way to him. ... I think most people looking at the negotiation would agree that it strengthens our negotiating position. If we have learned anything from the experience of the last three years it is that drift and dither means more acrimony, and anguish Mr Speaker and there would be nothing more dangerous for the new future that we want to build than allowing the permanent possibility of extending \u2013 I think I\u2019m coming to the point that the right honourable members wish to discuss- the implementation period in a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back as all right honourable members in the House will recall \u2013 and then growing back only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever This bill learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament unlike members opposite and rejects any further delay. It ensures that we depart from the EU on 31 January \u2013 and at that point Brexit will be done. It will be over. The sorry story of the last three-and-a-half years will be at an end and we will be able to move forward Mr Speaker together The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31December next year \u2013 with no possibility of an extension. And it paves the way for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours, based on an ambitious free trade agreement, with no alignment on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws, and close and friendly relations. Mr Speaker, this vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many is now \u2013 if this new parliament allows \u2013 only hours from our grasp the oven is on so to speak. It is set at gas mark 4 we can have it done by lunch time or late lunch And the new deal that I negotiated with our European friends will restore our great institutions to their rightful place as the supreme instruments of British self-governance. Once again this house will be the only assembly able to legislate for this United Kingdom. British courts will be the sole arbiters of those laws. And above them all, the sovereign British people masters of their own fate, controlling their own borders, laws, money and trade. And throughout our new immigration system, we will not only welcome those with talent but go out of our way to attract people of ability regardless of nationality or background. And we are only able to do this because the freedoms offered by our European Union partners \u2013 by leaving the EU \u2013 allow us once again to control overall numbers and bear down on unskilled immigration with our new points-based system. And if the honourable lady if she is against our new control of immigration I would like to hear her explain why .... We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children and will continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of Dubs amendment but this is not the place in this bill to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so. And amongst many other advantages of this bill Mr Speaker is of course that we will be able to sign free trade deals with the booming markets of the world, a power that no British government has enjoyed for the last 46 years. We will cast off the common agricultural policy that has too often frustrated and burdened our farmers we will release our fishermen from the tangled driftnets of arcane quota systems ... I remind the House and I remind the members opposite that there is of course on party in this House that is committed to reversing will of the people and handing back control of Scotland\u2019s outstanding marine wealth to Brussels \u2013 the SNP. That\u2019s what they would do. I look forward to hearing them explain why they continue to support this abject policy and abject surrender. This house will also under this bill regain the authority to set the highest possible standards and we will take advantage of these new freedoms to legislate in parallel on the environment, on workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights. And I reject the inexplicable fear \u2013 and I will give way for the last time \u2013 the right honourable lady may wish to talk about this ... The very essence of the opportunity of Brexit is we will no longer outsource these decisions. With renewed national self-confidence we will take them ourselves and answer to those who sent us here. It was this parliament \u2013 this parliament \u2013 in this country that led the whole of Europe and the world in passing the Factory Acts \u2013 the clean air Acts of the nineteenth century \u2013 which improved industrial working conditions by law. And this house should never doubt its ability to pioneer the standards of the fourth industrial revolution just as we did the first. And that epoch-making transformation \u2013 as with all the pivotal achievements of British history \u2013 reflected the combined national genius of every corner of this United Kingdom. In this new era our success, once again, will be achieved as one nation. This new deal in this bill ensures that the United Kingdom will leave the EU whole and entire with an unwavering dedication to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in our union ... Let me just remind the House Mr Speaker that the special provisions applying to Northern Ireland \u2013 which ensure after all one very important thing \u2013 that there is no hard border across Ireland and Northern Ireland are subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland assembly. And unless the assembly specifically withholds its consent unless indeed the assembly insists on continuing with this approach then those arrangements automatically lapse into full alignment with the rest of the UK. I believe these arrangements serve the interests of Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole. And it is a great deal for our whole country. And we must now begin building our future relationship with the EU. Our aim is to provide a close friendship, between sovereign equals, to promote our common interests inspired by pride in our European heritage and civilisation. And Clause 3 of the political declaration invokes that spirit \u2013 establishing \u2013 and I quote \u201cthe parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership\u201d rooted in our shared \u201chistory and ideals\u201d and \u201cstanding together against threats to rights and values from without or within\u201d. I am absolutely determined that this great project will not be the project of one government or one party but of the British nation as a whole. So parliament as I have said will be kept fully informed about progress of these negotiations. And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 and policy of Lib Dems is now to have another referendum \u2013 so when they have worked their policy out I\u2019ll give way. And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 have been tested as never before if this house comes together now to support this bill as I hope it will history will record that the first act of this new parliament in its earliest days was to break the ice floes and find a new way \u2013 a new passage through - to unsuspected oceans of opportunity. Now is the moment to come together and write a new and exciting chapter in our national story to forge a new partnership with our European friends to stand tall in the world and to begin the healing for which the whole people of this country yearn. And it is in that spirit of unity that I commend this bill to the House. Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who came to the UK as a refugee in 1939 on the Kindertransport and forced the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, has reacted with dismay to the removal of these provisions from the bill. Today, Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer your questions about the general election result and what happens next between 12.30 and 1.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. Here\u2019s a brief morning summary: Boris Johnson has called on the British public to discard the labels of leave and remain as MPs prepared to take a historic step towards withdrawing the UK from the EU. Opening the debate on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill he said: \u201cWe come together as a new parliament to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed his party would continue to oppose the bill despite calls in his shadow cabinet to move on from the referendum by supporting it. He said: \u201cThis deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path towards more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines. We remain certain there is a better and fairer way for Britain to leave the EU.\u201d Johnson has claimed he is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families after Brexit, in the face of opposition anger at removing those provisions from the Wab. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy said Johnson had \u201cnot earned the right to shoehorn into this legislation measures that are a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world\u201d. Downing Street has refused to say whether the government has carried out any analysis into potential benefits of any trade deals with third countries after Brexit. Pressed repeatedly on the matter, the official said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing preparatory work in relation to trade deals and we will now be able to sit down and have those talks properly.\u201d Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK financial watchdog, has been named as the next governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced the replacement for Mark Carney, who is due to stand down from the role at the end of January after six-and-a-half years in the job. The new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has revealed he was diagnosed with diabetes days before the general election, and vowed it will not prevent him from carrying out the prestigious role. Hoyle, 62, said he had lost three stone in recent months and said he was still in shock over the diagnosis. Johnson has claimed his government is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families after Brexit, PA reports. The prime minister was accused of using key Brexit legislation to \u201cbring up the drawbridge\u201d and stop the right of unaccompanied minors coming to the United Kingdom. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford labelled changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said it showed \u201cwho are the real separatists\u201d. For Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said it was \u201cone of the most appalling sections\u201d of the legislation and told MPs: \u201cComing to up to Christmas, shame on this Government for abandoning children in this way.\u201d Labour MP Lisa Nandy (Wigan) also questioned the PM\u2019s reluctance to help child refugees. She said that, while Johnson is right to say he has won a mandate to get Brexit done, he has \u201cnot earned the right to shoehorn into this legislation measures that are a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world\u201d. The government, as part of a redrafted Brexit Bill, appears to have rowed back on an original commitment to strike a deal with the EU so child refugees in Europe can continue to be reunited with their families in the UK, even after free movement ends. Clause 37 of the Bill replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to \u201cmake a statement\u201d on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete. Nandy told the Commons: \u201cIf he thinks that people in towns like mine who believe that we should deliver Brexit want to see us turn our back on decency and tolerance and kindness and warmth and empathy, he is wrong. \u201cWill he take these measures on child refugees out of this Bill?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cShe is wrong on this point. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we continue in this country to receive unaccompanied children, as we have done. \u201cI reject the idea that our proceedings must be somehow overseen and invigilated by the EU and measured against their benchmarks.\u201d SNP justice spokeswoman Joanna Cherry asked: \u201cCan the primeminister tell me why he is making this mean-spirited and nasty move?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cThe honourable lady has totally misunderstood or possibly misrepresented the purpose of what we are doing here. \u201cWe remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children. We\u2019ll continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of the Dubs amendment but this is not the place, in this Bill, to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so.\u201d Downing Street has refused to say whether the government has carried out any analysis into potential benefits of any trade deals with third countries after Brexit. Asked if analysis had been performed on the economic benefits of any deal with the US or other nations, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe whole point is that when we get Brexit done on January 31 that we will be free to then sit down with all other countries around the world, emerging economies, and we will be able to start the talks on what those trade negotiations might be and what sort of deals they might deliver. \u201cThere are great opportunities out there for the United Kingdom.\u201d Pressed repeatedly on the matter, the official said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing preparatory work in relation to trade deals and we will now be able to sit down and have those talks properly.\u201d Boris Johnson has insisted leave and remain labels are now defunct as he moved to push Brexit legislation through Parliament, according to PA\u2019s write up of the prime minister\u2019s speech. After months of delay and deadlock, the PM said now is the time to act and forge a new relationship with the rest of Europe. Johnson, moving the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill at second reading, urged parliament to come together and allow the \u201cwarmth and natural affection that we all share\u201d for the UK\u2019s European neighbours to \u201cfind renewed expression in one great new national project\u201d. The PM told MPs the bill must not be seen as a victory for one party or faction before adding: \u201cThis is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain. \u201cIn fact, the very words seem tired to me \u2013 as defunct as Big-enders and Little-enders, or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play. \u201cNow is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cWe will be able to move forward together. The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31 January with no possibility of an extension. \u201cAnd it paves the path for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours based on an ambitious free-trade agreement, with no alignment ... on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws and close and friendly relations. \u201cThis vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many, is now if this parliament, this new parliament allows, only hours from our grasp. \u201cThe oven is on, so to speak, it is set at gas mark 4, we can have it done by lunchtime, or late lunch.\u201d SNP spin doctors have been described as at best \u201cpatronising\u201d after the leak of an email to broadcasters giving them tips on how to interview Tories about Scottish independence. The Times Scotland reports this morning that the SNP\u2019s email to journalists offered advice on how to ensure Tory interviewees are \u201ctied in knots\u201d over their opposition to a second referendum, and urged broadcasters to \u201crigorously\u201d scrutinise their answers. This came as news to all those journalists who thought that they were already doing just that to all politicians, regardless of party. Indeed, one recent example might by the interview of Scottish secretary Alister Jack, on Good Morning Scotland earlier today. Interestingly, Jack did not immediately dismiss Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s formal request for transfer of powers to hold a second vote: he said that Johnson would \u201cgive it careful consideration and reply in the new year\u201d. Challenged about whether the Tories were ignoring the election mandate, Jack insisted that recent polling showed Scots did not want another referendum, and said accused the SNP of changing their argument at the end of the election campaign \u201caway from indyref2 because they were losing, and they hardened their position on Brexit. They were fighting the election in the last ten days over Brexit\u201d. Asked whether continued Tory refusal would, as Sturgeon has suggested, increase support for independence, Jack warned that the first minister\u2019s call to devolve the power to hold referendums permanently to Holyrood would result in \u201cperpetual neverendums\u201d. Tory backbencher Suella Braverman claims trust in politicians was stretched to breaking point in the last parliament. Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of DUP in the Commons, says that European Union will continue to have a say in Northern Ireland affairs under the bill. I want the prime minister to treat my part of the United Kingdom the same as the rest of the country when it comes to leaving the European Union, Donaldson says. We don\u2019t want barriers to trade with the rest of the country, he said. Citing a Treasury report also mentioned by Corbyn, Donaldson said it is clear that checks will take place despite Johnson\u2019s pledge of no border checks. He added: \u201cWe want to work with the government to mitigate the impact on Northern Ireland business of the requirement for those checks, and again that\u2019s something we want to hear more from the government on and we will be looking towards committee stage to see what we can do to reflect the commitment in the agreement and the commitment from the prime minister that there will be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in relation to trade.\u201d The former de facto deputy prime minister, Damian Green, urges those who voted to remain to accept the result of the referendum and stop trying to subvert Brexit. \u201cPlease accept the decision and move on,\u201d Green said. Green adds: \u201cWe should stop defining ourselves as leavers or remainers. The last few years have been miserable for democracy. The longer we fight past battles the longer that misery will persist.\u201d Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn says the PM has chosen to gamble with a cliff edge Brexit by trying to outlaw extending the implementation period in the bid. He says the government will need to be confident no extension is needed by the end of June. Benn also laments the lack of an economic impact assessment on the future trading relationship with the EU. He says history will judge this as deeply irresponsible. Labour has released the full text of Corbyn\u2019s speech on the withdrawal bill: Over the last three-and-a-half years the government\u2019s mishandling of Brexit has delivered nothing but political gridlock, chaos and economic uncertainty. It has paralysed our political system, divided our communities and nations and become a national embarrassment on an unprecedented scale. For people outside Westminster the constant argument and pointless posturing in parliament has only served to demonstrate the political system is not working for them. So we recognise the clear message from the British public last week, however they voted in the referendum of 2016, and understand their determination to end the never-ending cycle of Brexit debate and get back to solving the day-to-day issues and challenges they face in their lives. We must listen and understand that we cannot go on forever debating what happened in 2016. We have to respect that decision and move on. But Mr Speaker, understanding all this doesn\u2019t mean we as a party and a movement should abandon basic principles or give up the demand for a fairer and more just society. We warned before the general election that the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal was a terrible deal for our country and we still believe it is a terrible deal today. It will not protect or strengthen our rights or support our manufacturing industry and vital trading relationships, or protect our natural world in a time of a climate crisis. Neither will it address the deep inequality in our system or secure the interests of every nation and region in the United Kingdom. Instead under the Conservatives this deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path of yet more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines to benefit the giant US drugs corporations. That will take us away from the essential principles we believe in, of a country that looks after everybody and protects those communities left behind by the excesses of runaway capitalism. This deal doesn\u2019t bring certainty for communities or for business and workforces. In fact it does the opposite and hardwires in the risk of a no-deal Brexit in a year\u2019s time. I\u2019m sure that will delight many of those on the benches opposite but not those who will suffer the consequences in communities and workplaces across Britain. That is why Labour will not support this Bill as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU. One which would not risk ripping our communities apart, selling out our public services or sacrificing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. This deal is a roadmap for the reckless direction in which the government and the Prime Minister are determined to take our country. They have done their utmost to hide its likely impact and continue to use gimmicks and slogans to turn attention away from their real intentions. And nothing exposes this more than the steps they have already taken on workers\u2019 rights. For all the promises over the past few weeks that they are the party to protect rights at work, at the very first opportunity they have removed the basic provisions they had said would be part of this bill. That does not bode well for the separate bill the prime minister is now saying he will bring forward on workers\u2019 rights If he wants to assure people that their rights are safe in his hands he should commit to legislate to ensure workers rights in Britain will never fall behind EU standards in the future and support amendments to enshrine this commitment within this bill. Mr Speaker, I want to make it absolutely clear how appalled I am to see the government remove the protections in this Bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum. Throughout the last Parliament and for his whole life my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice are given sanctuary in this country. Now this government, in its first week in office has ripped up those hard won commitments. This is a move the director of the charity Safe Passage has described as, and I quote: \u201ctruly shocking\u201d Saying it could have and I quote again: \u201cpotentially tragic consequences\u201d. Shame on this government for abandoning children in this way. Mr Speaker, on the environment and food safety standards this deal points to a complete realignment towards the far weaker protections and standards that operate in Donald Trump\u2019s America. If this government is set on pursuing a Trump trade deal with precious few bargaining chips to hand the brutal reality is that Britain will have to lower its standards. The EU has made it clear that a future trade deal with them will depend on maintaining a level playing field in standards and protections. So the choice we now face is between keeping the highest environmental and food standards in order to get that future deal with the EU or slashing food standards to match the US, where what are called \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed, just so we can strike a new race-to-the-bottom deal with Donald Trump. Turning to the arrangements with Northern Ireland the Prime Minister has emphatically claimed, and I quote:\u201cthere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB\u201d And that: \u201cwe have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together as we come of the EU\u201d These claims are simply not true. We know from the analysis carried out by his own Treasury that under his deal there will, in fact, be an abundance of checks and customs declarations in the Irish Sea. Not only will this have a huge impact on Northern Irish business and society, it will also have implications for the rest of Britain\u2019s economy and manufacturing industry. The Treasury\u2019s own analysis spells it out: the more the government diverges from EU trading regulations in the future the more checks and disruption will be put in place between Britain and our biggest trading partner. More checks and more disruption would be deeply damaging for trade and for our manufacturing sector and threatens to take a wrecking ball to our vital supply chains and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on them. From car manufacturers to the chemical industry disruption to our just-in-time supply chains will have a devastating impact. This all makes it even more incredible that since agreeing its deal the government has yet to produce a single bit of evidence or analysis to show it will have a positive impact on the economy or our communities in any way. We scarcely need to ask ourselves, why? I say to all members new and old that it is our job to question to scrutinise and to hold the government of the day to account. If we believe the government is taking the wrong approach we should not be afraid to oppose. And when it comes to our future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world we cannot let this government act in an undemocratic and secretive manner. Trade deals with the EU, the US, or anybody else for that matter must be done transparently. This country is about to embark on a major change of direction as we leave a 40-year economic partnership for an unknown future, under the terms of this withdrawal deal. The government needs to be honest with the people about the real choices and the real risks that lie ahead. So stop the posturing and the gimmicks and ditch the unachievable red lines that will only lead to another no-deal cliff edge, with all the anxiety and uncertainty that brings. The prime minister may believe that fuelling division and confrontation has helped him realise his personal political ambition. But it\u2019s no way to heal the deep divisions in our society or find the common ground we need to move beyond Brexit. We need an approach that puts jobs and living standards first and builds the strongest cooperation with our European neighbours based on openness, solidarity and internationalism. That is the approach that will bring an end to the Brexit crisis and bring our country together. Sajid Javid is still on message: Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP in the Commons, says the PM has no mandate to drag Scotland out of the EU against its will. He said Scotland will be made poorer by Brexit and it is already having an impact on the Scottish economy. Former international trade secretary, Liam Fox, says the bill is about fulfilling a promise to the British people. Corbyn challenges Johnson\u2019s commitment to have no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He says more checks will have a devastating impact on the economy. Corbyn urges the PM to commit to ensure that workers\u2019 rights don\u2019t slip behind those in the EU. He says the removal of the commitment to refugee children is an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d. Quoting the charity Safe Passage he says the move is \u201cshocking\u201d and could result in tragic consequences. \u201cI want to make it clear that I see the government\u2019s removal of the protection in this bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum is nothing short of an absolute disgrace and a piece of dishonesty toward those people who, at the moment, are clearly very, very concerned. \u201cThroughout the last parliament, and for his whole life, and I was talking to him last night, my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice can be given sanctuary in this country. \u201cNow this government in its first week in office has ripped up those very hard-won commitments.\u201d \u201cI simply say this: coming to up to Christmas shame on this government for abandoning children in this way.\u201d Responding Jeremy Corbyn says Labour recognises the nation\u2019s desire to move on from the referendum debate. But he says the Brexit deal will be used as a battering ram to deregulate the UK and leave it open to the excesses of the free market. He claims the deal is a roadmap for the reckless direction the prime minister is determined to take the UK. \u201cWe remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU,\u201d Corbyn says. Johnson says: \u201cIf this house comes together now to support this bill ... history will record that the first act of this new parliament in its earliest days was to break the ice flows and find a new way through. \u201cNow is the moment to come together and write a new chapter in this nation\u2019s history,\u201d he says in closing his remarks. The possible Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy intervenes to challenge Johnson to show \u201cdecency\u201d on child refugees. \u201cIf he thinks that people in towns like mine \u2026 want to see us turn our back on decency and tolerance and kindness and warmth and empathy he is wrong,\u201d she said. Johnson says the UK will accept unaccompanied children but not overseen by the EU. He says the essence of the opportunity of Brexit is that parliament can take decisions for itself on this and environmental standards. He goes on to talk about the government\u2019s \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. Steven Swinford picks out these lines: Johnson insists the government is commitment to taking unaccompanied refugee children from Europe despite the withdrawal of provisions on this from the bill. Johnson insists that ruling out an extension to the implementation period will strengthen the UK\u2019s bargaining position with the EU. \u201cThe oven is on, it is set at gas mark 4, we can have it done by lunch or late lunch,\u201d Johnson tells MPs. Boris Johnson is opening the debate for the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill in the Commons. The prime minister calls on parliament to come together to get Brexit done and reunite the country by doing so. This bill should not be seen as a victory for one party or a one faction, Johnson says. \u201cNow is the time to act together,\u201d he says. Keir Starmer has set out another pitch for the Labour leadership. The shadow Brexit secretary has still not officially confirmed he is running, but an article for Labour List suggests this is very much his plan. Starmer writes: My case file, and that of most Labour MPs, is filled with the cases of people suffering stress, anxiety and hunger because of universal credit. I want to transform our party into a movement that empowers them to speak for themselves. To do that, we must open up power like never before. An inequality of power underpins the inequalities of wealth and opportunity that scar our country. The trade unions were founded to give power and a voice to working class people. They founded the Labour Party, and by winning power we built the NHS, free state education and the welfare state. The rich and privileged have always had the power they need to shape their lives and to shape world in their own interests. Labour\u2019s historic task is to open up power to everyone else so we can build the fairer world we believe in. We call it socialism because we believe in the transformative power of society and communities. That historic mission remains our mission today. But we can\u2019t do it on our own. The point about a movement is it brings everyone together in a common cause. Labour must learn from the social movements that people create to fight injustice: renters\u2019 unions, delivery drivers\u2019 unions, movements to prevent social cleansing of estates. We need to embed this party deep into the everyday lives of people in areas that feel hopeless and abandoned. Starmer calls for Labour to broaden its appeal and widen its ideological stance. The Labour tradition has never drawn from a single ideology: at its best, it is an alliance of different traditions. The challenge of leadership is to draw out the best from them, and get them working towards the single goal of an electoral majority. We have so much more in common than that which divides us, and each of us has something to teach and something to learn. With the whole party and whole movement pulling together rather than pulling apart, we can, and we will, win. The Brexit secretary, Steven Barclay, has defended the government\u2019s decision to strip out commitments on workers\u2019 rights from the withdrawal agreement bill. Speaking on TalkRadio he said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to them [workers\u2019 rights] but it\u2019s about having the right legislation vehicle. This legislation is about implementing into domestic law the international agreement that we reached with the EU. We\u2019ve got other legislation through the Queen\u2019s speech in terms of workers\u2019 rights, because quite often the UK has gone further than the European Union in terms of workers\u2019 rights. \u201cIf you look at things like paternity and maternity rights, the UK has higher standards than many countries in Europe, so we don\u2019t need the EU to set those standards. We can do that through the UK parliament answerable to the British people. Barclay also claimed the disbanding of his Department for Exiting the European Union was an \u201can exciting opportunity in government\u201d. He said after the department is scrapped former officials will be redeployed to other departments. Barclay said: \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity actually to pay tribute to the many officials in the department who have built up a massive amount of expertise. And what we can then do is socialise that expertise across Whitehall into the many departments that will be dealing with trade, because all areas of the government will then be involved in the future trade deal.\u201d Sajid Javid has announced that the head of Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, will be the new governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor said he was the \u201cstand out candidate\u201d to succeed Mark Carney. Bailey will take over in March. Our Business blog has more. European parliament vice president, Pedro Silva Pereira, said officials in Brussels expect to conclude the ratification process in the European parliament by 29 January. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always respected the choice of the British people, but it is true that it was a very long process.\u201d Asked what kind of trade deal can be negotiated and how \u201cdeep\u201d it can be if it is to be completely concluded by the end of 2020, he said: \u201cWe have a very short timeframe available. \u201cEleven months to negotiate such a complex trade agreement is unprecedented. It is a different situation. We come from a level of economic integration which has no comparison with other trade agreements that we\u2019ve done before.\u201d He added: \u201cThe key issue will be what kind of regulatory dis-alignment we will have. The political declaration that we\u2019ve agreed with the UK envisaged a very ambitious trading relationship with zero tariffs, zero quotas. But this can only be achieved if we ensure some regulatory alignment.\u201d Boris Johnson is due to open today\u2019s second reading debate on the withdrawal agreement bill at 9.30am. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is set to close the debate and MPs are expected to start voting at about 2.30pm. Barclay\u2019s department is due to be scrapped by the end of January, along with the word \u201cBrexit\u201d if No 10 gets its way. According to the Huffington Post, the prime minister has ordered officials to drop the term \u201cBrexit\u201d once the Wab passes and the UK leaves the EU on 31 January as planned. Some shadow cabinet members representing pro-leave seats are understood to have suggested the Labour party should not vote against the Wab in today\u2019s second reading vote. But the party remains split on Brexit. Labour MP Anneliese Dodds said she is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the bill. Speaking to the Today programme, she said: \u201cI really don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s really matching up to many of the commitments that were given by previous Conservative governments, and as a result we really have to reject that bill. \u201cI mean, clearly, with a government majority of the size that it is at the moment, it is likely that it will pass, but I think we\u2019ve got to represent our constituents\u2019 concerns and do at least what we can to make sure these issues are heard.\u201d After the election there had been speculation that the size of Johnson\u2019s majority meant he might pursue a softer Brexit and and could afford to face down his hardline Eurosceptics. But a hard version of Brexit is still very much on the agenda following changes set out in the Brexit bill. And the European Research Group (ERG) is delighted. The Eurosceptic MP Bernard Jenkin said the ERG is \u201cquite happy\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt was the remainers that wrecked Boris Johnson\u2019s ability to get the agreement through parliament. \u201cEvery member of the ERG supported Boris Johnson\u2019s agreement, so we\u2019re generally quite happy about how all this is proceeding. It\u2019s a compromise deal.\u201d Jenkin added: \u201cI\u2019m just reminding myself what was in our manifesto \u2013 take back control of our laws, take back control of our money, control our trade policy, introduce an Australian-style points immigration system, raise standards in areas like workers rights, animal welfare, agriculture and the environment, and ensure we\u2019re in full control of our fishing waters. I mean, we\u2019re the manifesto support group now.\u201d Welcome to Politics Live a week on from the morning the nation woke up to news of Boris Johnson\u2019s thumping election win. His 80-seat majority means there is no doubt that MPs will pass the withdrawal agreement bill when it comes up for a second reading vote on Friday afternoon. This will be put Johnson\u2019s government on course to meet the election pledge of getting out of the EU by 31 January. The Brexit Bill set out in Thursday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech has been greeted with dismay by opposition MPs. It strips out protections for workers\u2019 rights, waters down a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, and removes parliament\u2019s say on the future relationship. It also inserts a ban on the government extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis has declared his candidacy for Labour leader. And Nicola Sturgeon has called for the Scottish parliament to be given permanent powers to hold subsequent referendums on independence from the UK.",

Princess Anne (previously portrayed in The Windsors as a sort of terrifying vampire) turned out to be the breakout star of The Crown. Played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2019/dec/04/princess-anne-is-having-a-moment\">Erin Doherty</a>, she was funny, sardonic and exactly the right character to counter the dreary poshos that make up the rest of her awful family \u2013 even if they did miss out the (surely intrigue-heavy) kidnap attempt against her.</p> <h2>Nadia Vulvokov, Russian Doll</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f56f9b5ea4822e2e3ada9cbac864a5f336dc1f84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f56f9b5ea4822e2e3ada9cbac864a5f336dc1f84/0_5_2679_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll: the role she was born to play.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll: the role she was born to play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The role that Natasha Lyonne was born to play in the show she was born to star in, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/16/stuck-on-repeat-what-is-netflixs-russian-doll-actually-about\">Russian Doll</a>\u2019s Nadia is a walking, talking wall of scar tissue. The only thing that can soften her up are several traumatising deaths and rebirths. But the miracle of Nadia is that even this isn\u2019t a complete success. By the end of the series she has changed, but remains still just as knotted and grouchy as before. What a concept. What a character.</p> <h2>Ebenezer Scrooge, I Think You Should Leave</h2> <p>The story of Scrooge traditionally ends with him embracing the spirit of Christmas and asking a boy to buy him a turkey. But only I Think You Should Leave showed the true heroism at the heart of the man. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/10/i-think-you-should-leave-netflix-tim-robinson\">bizarre Netflix comedy,</a> Scrooge was then visited by The Ghost of Christmas Way Future, who came with a dark warning about the future of humanity. By Christmas 3050, Skeletrex and his bone brigade have enslaved the human race. Only Scrooge, with his newfound sense of Christmas cheer, can defeat the bonies by smashing their brains out with his cane. Possibly the one real hero in all of television this year.</p> <h2>Jennie Gresham, Alan Partridge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"191d47546e3a0c02aaa6c16b3384fb04b569c571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/191d47546e3a0c02aaa6c16b3384fb04b569c571/0_0_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018From dismissal to fear to disgust\u2019 ...

She veered from dismissal to fear to disgust to fury to something that briefly approximated seduction, all hidden behind a 6ft blast door of practised BBC cheeriness. Her emotions seeped out only through the sort of involuntary twitches and glances that tend to occur when you sit next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/25/this-time-with-alan-partridge-review-an-excruciating-white-knuckle-ride\">Alan Partridge.</a> A complete professional.</p> <h2>Dr Manhattan, Watchmen</h2> <p>Although the finale ended up doubling as a critique of the man \u2013 a god who lost interest in humanity \u2013 Dr Manhattan was still the lynchpin of Damon Lindelof\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/21/watchmen-review-the-perfect-superhero-story-for-our-tattered-times-hbo-alan-moore\">Watchmen reboot</a>. He spent decades exploring the universe until he came to see existence as little more than an abstract. But, still, at the moment of his death, he chose to replay the memories he made with a woman he loved. His last act of selflessness springs the story into exciting new territory.</p> <h2>Suzie, Stranger Things</h2> <p>A largely unseen presence who \u2013 for the majority of the season \u2013 we assumed was invented, it was Dustin\u2019s long-distance girlfriend who ultimately saved the world from destruction. She knew Planck\u2019s constant, which was the key to defeating the giant blood monster. But she only gave it up on the proviso that Dustin first agreed to perform a duet of Never Ending Story by Limahl in its entirety with her. This is a woman with an appropriate sense of perspective.</p> <h2>Hamster, Seven Worlds, One Planet</h2> <p>Only in 2019 could an act of wanton grave desecration count as heroism, but there we are. Of course, it helps that the figure doing the desecration was a chubby cheeked Austrian hamster, carefully bobbing across a graveyard on its way to eat a meal of flowers and candle wax. But as ever, there was a moral to be found. If you\u2019re going to eat candles, be prepared to get your head stuck in a jar.</p> <h2>Bran Stark, Game of Thrones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97bf28468e97f8ee687909ca2f54309b158611f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97bf28468e97f8ee687909ca2f54309b158611f6/59_45_3239_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living like a king ...

While the final season \u2013 and, in particular, the final episode \u2013 of Game of Thrones looks set to go down as a historic misfire, at least we have Bran Stark to look up to. A weird little boy who did nothing to help anyone and ended up ruling the world anyway, Bran is everything we should aspire to. May his reign be fruitful and, more importantly, untelevised.</p> <h2><br>Villains:<br>Mitch Kessler, The Morning Show</h2> <p>The big bad on Apple TV+\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/29/the-morning-show-tv-so-excellent-it-will-make-you-totally-resent-friends-jennifer-aniston\">The Morning Show</a> looked and acted like a friendly dad. Mitch Kessler \u2013 played by Steve Carell at the exact midpoint between Michael Scott and John du Pont \u2013 was the anchor of a beloved breakfast TV show. The series started at the moment when his world began to crumble at the hands of #MeToo allegations, but it was only as the series progressed that you began to realise what a vile, grasping, self-obsessed monster he really was.

      "bodyText": "Heroes: Princess Anne, The Crown The royal family didn\u2019t exactly cover itself in glory in 2019, but salvation came from a most unexpected place. Princess Anne (previously portrayed in The Windsors as a sort of terrifying vampire) turned out to be the breakout star of The Crown. Played by Erin Doherty, she was funny, sardonic and exactly the right character to counter the dreary poshos that make up the rest of her awful family \u2013 even if they did miss out the (surely intrigue-heavy) kidnap attempt against her. Nadia Vulvokov, Russian Doll The role that Natasha Lyonne was born to play in the show she was born to star in, Russian Doll\u2019s Nadia is a walking, talking wall of scar tissue. The only thing that can soften her up are several traumatising deaths and rebirths. But the miracle of Nadia is that even this isn\u2019t a complete success. By the end of the series she has changed, but remains still just as knotted and grouchy as before. What a concept. What a character. Ebenezer Scrooge, I Think You Should Leave The story of Scrooge traditionally ends with him embracing the spirit of Christmas and asking a boy to buy him a turkey. But only I Think You Should Leave showed the true heroism at the heart of the man. In the bizarre Netflix comedy, Scrooge was then visited by The Ghost of Christmas Way Future, who came with a dark warning about the future of humanity. By Christmas 3050, Skeletrex and his bone brigade have enslaved the human race. Only Scrooge, with his newfound sense of Christmas cheer, can defeat the bonies by smashing their brains out with his cane. Possibly the one real hero in all of television this year. Jennie Gresham, Alan Partridge Arguably the television performance of 2019, Susannah Fielding\u2019s Jennie Gresham felt more strongly about things than any other character this year. She veered from dismissal to fear to disgust to fury to something that briefly approximated seduction, all hidden behind a 6ft blast door of practised BBC cheeriness. Her emotions seeped out only through the sort of involuntary twitches and glances that tend to occur when you sit next to Alan Partridge. A complete professional. Dr Manhattan, Watchmen Although the finale ended up doubling as a critique of the man \u2013 a god who lost interest in humanity \u2013 Dr Manhattan was still the lynchpin of Damon Lindelof\u2019s Watchmen reboot. He spent decades exploring the universe until he came to see existence as little more than an abstract. But, still, at the moment of his death, he chose to replay the memories he made with a woman he loved. His last act of selflessness springs the story into exciting new territory. Suzie, Stranger Things A largely unseen presence who \u2013 for the majority of the season \u2013 we assumed was invented, it was Dustin\u2019s long-distance girlfriend who ultimately saved the world from destruction. She knew Planck\u2019s constant, which was the key to defeating the giant blood monster. But she only gave it up on the proviso that Dustin first agreed to perform a duet of Never Ending Story by Limahl in its entirety with her. This is a woman with an appropriate sense of perspective. Hamster, Seven Worlds, One Planet Only in 2019 could an act of wanton grave desecration count as heroism, but there we are. Of course, it helps that the figure doing the desecration was a chubby cheeked Austrian hamster, carefully bobbing across a graveyard on its way to eat a meal of flowers and candle wax. But as ever, there was a moral to be found. If you\u2019re going to eat candles, be prepared to get your head stuck in a jar. Bran Stark, Game of Thrones All hail the king. While the final season \u2013 and, in particular, the final episode \u2013 of Game of Thrones looks set to go down as a historic misfire, at least we have Bran Stark to look up to. A weird little boy who did nothing to help anyone and ended up ruling the world anyway, Bran is everything we should aspire to. May his reign be fruitful and, more importantly, untelevised. Villains: Mitch Kessler, The Morning Show The big bad on Apple TV+\u2019s The Morning Show looked and acted like a friendly dad. Mitch Kessler \u2013 played by Steve Carell at the exact midpoint between Michael Scott and John du Pont \u2013 was the anchor of a beloved breakfast TV show.

Ferrero, the world\u2019s third largest chocolate company, is struggling to address concerns that multiple farms where it sources hazelnuts for its chocolate products may use child labour. Ferrero buys roughly 30% of all the hazelnuts it uses in its products \u2013 including Ferrero Rocher \u2013 in Turkey, where child labour is widespread. According to the most recent government records available, in 2012 there were an estimated 900,000 children working in different industries, including farming, across Turkey. Of these, 11,300 were between the ages of six and 14. Many children working as seasonal agricultural workers do not attend the beginning of the school year and, in 2018, an estimated 67 children and teens lost their lives while working, according to the campaign group the Centre for Child Rights in Turkey. In a statement to the Guardian, Ferrero acknowledged the problem of child labour in Turkey\u2019s agricultural sector and said that they are \u201cdetermined to prevent and eliminate child labour all along our supply chains\u201d. Ferrero said it neither owned nor managed hazelnut farms in Europe, but worked with farmers to ensure good agricultural and social standards. \u201cThe complexity of the hazelnut supply chain means it cannot be transformed by one single actor,\u201d said a Ferrero spokesperson. \u201cCooperation is absolutely essential to tackling the issue of child labour.\u201d Interviews with child workers filmed by UK campaigning group WeMove Europe and the Centre for Child Rights, and seen by the Guardian, include children allegedly as young as 11 claiming that they are forced to work for up to 12 hours a day in the Black Sea region.

      "bodyText": "Glance quickly at the Premiership table and it looks upside down. The bottom four clubs have won 27 of the 32 titles since English rugby adopted the league system in 1987 and while Saracens are below the rest because of the 35 points deducted for breaching the salary cap regulations, the three clubs immediately above them, Leicester, Wasps and Bath, are down there due to results. These are early days with only five rounds completed, but with three more being staged over the next two weeks and just one other before clubs lose their England players for the Six Nations, it is the time of year when fears become injected with a shot of reality. Saracens, Leicester, Bath and Wasps supplied 21 players to England\u2019s World Cup campaign. The first three can expect to be inconvenienced again and for Saracens, who expect to have to win at least 16 of their 22 matches to avoid relegation, it will add to pressure the club has not experienced for more than a decade. At least they are accustomed to winning, a habit their rivals above them will be looking for in their Christmas stocking. Leicester, Bath and Wasps have won 22 league titles between them, but their league form this season has reflected how they finished the 2018-19 campaign: the Tigers have lost 11 of their last 14 Premiership matches, Wasps 10 and Bath eight. \u201cPeople expect Wasps, Leicester and Bath, really big clubs with lots of history, tradition and success, to be up there in the top four,\u201d said the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, who welcomes back his England second-row Joe Launchbury for Saturday\u2019s visit of Harlequins to the Ricoh Arena. \u201cSadly, the reality is that isn\u2019t quite the case at the minute. \u201cIt is tough for us. We are down there and we have to shoulder that. The expectations on us as clubs will not go away and we do not want them to. We want to be considered a big club and we need to get back up there, which we are working hard to do. Every club is spending up to the salary cap now, making a tough league even tougher.\u201d Leicester\u2019s only league victory this season was achieved late at home to Gloucester and they have not picked up a bonus point in their four defeats. They have an unbeaten record in the European Challenge Cup, in which they are competing for the first time, but they laboured away against the part-timers Calvisano last weekend and Exeter at home on Saturday will be a few notches above. \u201cWe showed elements of grit and determination at Calvisano with a young side,\u201d said the club\u2019s director of rugby, Geordan Murphy. \u201cWe did not perform as well as we could have done, but the players worked really hard for each other. Exeter\u2019s have been hugely impressive in the last five years. We know the challenge that faces us and where we need to be better.\u201d Leicester will be armed with their six England World Cup players while Exeter are resting Jack Nowell and Luke Cowan-Dickie, although Henry Slade leads the side. It is an indication of where the Tigers are that the Chiefs feel, with the strength in depth they have developed, they can also afford to give Alec Hepburn, Sam Simmonds and Nic White the weekend off before next weekend\u2019s home encounter with Saracens. Bath are at London Irish on Sunday. Two seasons ago, the Exiles went down with a whimper but this time they have an experienced coaching team and made a number of high-profile signings, including the Australia second-row Adam Coleman, who makes his first Premiership start this weekend. \u201cWe have spoken about drawing a line in the sand from the first couple of months and starting again,\u201d said Bath\u2019s Lions and Wales centre Jamie Roberts as the club looks to recover from Sunday\u2019s battering at Clermont Auvergne. \u201cI have been through periods like this before in my career and when you reflect on them you learn how not to do things.

At that moment, we really understood what our interdependence means. My hope is that as humankind we not only recognise that the fight to prevent dangerous climate change is urgent, but also that it is achievable, if we put our minds to it. To do this, however, we must put to one side the politics of division and learn to work together better.<br><em>Hilary Benn is a Labour politician</em></p> <h2>Ore Ogunbiyi: \u2018I want to see more black women at the top\u2019</h2> <p>We are living in a world suffering from the consequences of climate change, and rife with racism and sexism that seem too deeply embedded to be overthrown. It is hard to be optimistic about anything. Hope is what you do in spite of that. To remain optimistic about a world that feels crippled with despair is in itself radical. So hope, to me, is optimism. Radical optimism.</p> <p>My hope is that I get to see more black women at the top. It\u2019s no fun celebrating \u201cfirsts\u201d if you\u2019re the first and only. I hope more of us find new ways to break down institutional barriers that have kept us out of the spaces where we rightfully belong.<br><em>Ore Ogunbiyi is the co-author of Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change, published by #Merky Books</em></p> <h2>Luciana Berger: \u2018We must do more than hope: we must act\u2019</h2> <p>People driven by progressive values are motivated by the idea of hope. We believe that we are not flotsam on an ocean of immovable forces or unavoidable consequences, but that we can shape our destinies. Pretty much everything good in our world has been made by optimists, from the NHS to electric cars. And pessimists have always been there to drag us down.</p> <p>I want my children to inherit a better world. I hope they don\u2019t experience racism, or encounter people with hate in their hearts. I hope they don\u2019t fear the climate crisis like we do, or see a world racked by poverty and conflict. For that to become true, we must do more than hope: we must also argue, organise and act to make it so.<br><em>Luciana Berger is a former MP</em></p> <h2>Minna Salami: \u2018I hope we\u2019ll turn to elevating our minds\u2019</h2> <p>I hope we will use technology positively. I hope that the coming decade will be one where humanity reconnects to creativity, compassion and community, and moves away from the patriarchal and competitive mindset that is dulling society and causing suffering in people\u2019s individual and collective lives. My hope is that we will become as invested in elevating our minds as we are in developing our technologies.<br><em>Minna Salami is the founder of the MsAfropolitan blog</em></p> <h2>Ahir Shah: \u2018I want my blocked nose to go away\u2019</h2> <p>I often think, when I have a cold and a blocked nose, \u201cI am sure I used to be able to breathe freely.\u201d I\u2019ve spent a while now trying to work out what hope means to me, and all I can conclude is that, for what feels like the longest time, I have been a person with a blocked nose trying to remember what breathing feels like. I hope to hope again, to breathe again.<br><em>Ahir Shah\u2019s standup show Dots is on UK tour until March</em></p> <h2>Carole Cadwalladr: \u2018There will be a reckoning. Just not soon\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m pretty despairing much of the time. It is hard to keep going as a journalist at a time in which no one is ever held to account. But I do think the truth will out. Facebook is on the run. And while this generation of politicians is prepared to ignore the fact that we now know the EU referendum was a corrupt and illegitimate vote, the abject refusal to acknowledge this will horrify future generations. There will be a reckoning. Just not any time soon.<br><em>Carole Cadwalladr is an award-winning Guardian and Observer journalist</em></p> <h2>Elif Shafak: \u2018I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll rise up against toxic populism\u2019</h2> <p>Too much optimism makes us too comfortable, if not complacent. Too much pessimism wears us down. We need a healthy dose of each. We need, in the words of Gramsci, the pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will. Because we are facing massive global challenges \u2013 from the climate crisis to inequality, from extremism to the dark side of digital technology \u2013 none of which can be solved without global solidarity.</p> <p>I am hoping humanity will rise against the tide of nationalism, tribalism, isolationism and toxic populism. May 2020 be the year of tackling inequality head-on, embarking on the net-zero-carbon target, promoting empathy, and may it be the year of citizens of humanity.<br><em>Elif Shafak\u2019s How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division is published by Profile and Wellcome Collection in July 2020</em></p> <h2>Ed Gamble: \u2018If the planet doesn\u2019t melt, I can redo my kitchen\u2019</h2> <p>As a comedian, hope is very important. I probably use the phrases \u201cI hope this goes well\u201d and \u201cwe can only hope\u201d more than any others. Before I face a new audience, before I try out new material, before I record a television show. It\u2019s a way of positively navigating the chaos of a life in entertainment without ever confronting what is essentially a mess of events that has no real order or sense. Other than that, it\u2019s a laugh being a comic. I do like it, I swear. You can never truly know what an audience will be like (unless you are in Maidenhead, where they stare). You can only hope.</p> <p>My hopes for the next decade are depressingly personal and probably not global enough, however ashamed I am to admit that. Sure, I hope that the planet doesn\u2019t melt, but mainly so I can finally redo the kitchen. I think this is the angle Extinction Rebellion is missing. It is, rightly, speaking on a global level, but people can\u2019t wrap their heads around that. We need less of \u201cthe forests are burning\u201d and more of: \u201cIf you don\u2019t start recycling, you, Steve Thompson, will never get to see Hamilton.\u201d Personally, I have seen Hamilton, so my main hope for the next decade is a sequel.<br><em>Ed Gamble is live at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, London, on 20 December</em></p> <h2>Azadeh Moaveni: \u2018Hope is like the humbling part of loving someone\u2019</h2> <p>Hope to me is a spiritual duty, however unfashionable that might sound, not unlike the humbling, laborious parts of loving someone. Persian poetry is replete with allusions to moments of dark political decline, where hope feels ignorant and almost outlandish. My hope is that I can infuse my daily life with higher purpose, that I can somehow impart a Persian worldview to my children, who I sometimes fear are citizens of nowhere, and that Iran, where by now you can tell I am from, comes out of its isolation and gets to occupy a few years of light.<br><em>Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s Guest House for Young Widows: Among the Women of Isis was shortlisted for this year\u2019s Baillie Gifford prize</em></p> <h2>Shoshana Zuboff: \u2018Too many of us fall into numb passivity\u2019</h2> <p>My hope is the resurrection of hope itself. After all, what is hope but the deepest conviction that the future can be better than the present? As technological power grows and democracy stumbles, too many of us fall into numb passivity. We trade hope for resignation and succumb to the propaganda of inevitability. But the present is never a good predictor of what may come. Hope thrives on the knowledge that we make the future. Each life is testament to this wild miracle. We begin. We falter. We begin again.<br><em>Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power is published by Profile</em></p> <h2>Natasha Devon: \u2018Hope is about harnessing your anger for change\u2019</h2> <p>A lot of people have told me they\u2019ve stopped engaging with politics, current affairs or anything beyond their home and job this year, because it\u2019s all too awful. I understand the sentiment, but I also think that\u2019s how evil wins. Hope is the ability to sustain your anger and harness it to bring about change.</p> <p>In a year\u2019s time, I hope my workplace mental health campaign Where\u2019s Your Head At? will have succeeded in changing the law. We\u2019re lobbying for provision of mental health first aid to be mandatory in workplaces in the same way as its physical counterpart. So far, all the politicians we have discussed it with have thought it was a great idea, but there have been so many changes of cabinet, and everyone has been so consumed with Brexit, we haven\u2019t been able to push it through.</p> <p>I also hope next year will be the year we start to understand that our mental health affects cognitive ability. Young people\u2019s mental health has enjoyed greater prominence recently, but it\u2019s always as an \u201cadd-on\u201d to academic attainment \u2013 a \u2018wellbeing week\u2019 in the middle of an otherwise highly pressured term.<br><em>Yes You Can: Ace Your Exams Without Losing Your Mind by Natasha Devon is published by Macmillan in April</em></p> <h2>Judy Murray: \u2018I hope to get the Murray Tennis Centre started\u2019</h2> <p>Hope is wishful thinking. I hope my family stays happy and healthy and I also hope to press the button on the Murray Tennis Centre and start building what will be our family legacy for the sport in Scotland. For the new decade I hope to live <br> to see it up and running.<br><em>Judy Murray is a tennis coach and the mother of Jamie and Andy Murray</em></p> <h2><strong>Chelsea Kwakye: \u2018</strong>Dare yourself to imagine a different way of life\u2019</h2> <p>Hope is essential to action and can be a driving force for change. Sometimes hoping can be overwhelming because, for a minute or two, you dare yourself to imagine a different way of life and what the future could look like. Above all, hope to me is the countless people and voices, often on the periphery of society, who are leading with their selflessness, knowledge and compassion.</p> <p>In the new decade I hope to see accountability, from politicians to CEOs, meaningful change and transparency. On a personal level, my hopes are quite simple: good health for all my loved ones, staying mentally and physically healthy and continuing to learn from those around me.<br><em>Chelsea Kwakye is the co-author of Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change, published by #Merky Books</em></p> <h2>Peter Pomerantsev: \u2018I aim for a shrug of doomed optimism\u2019</h2> <p>There\u2019s something desperate about hope that I want to avoid. It reminds me too much of its own necessity. Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not been a great year for some of the things I cherish, for the woolly cosmopolitan liberalism I\u2019ve always worn as a warm jumper. But the opposite of hope, cynicism, I want to avoid, too, comforting as it is. In times like these I turn to something eastern European inside me: a shrug of doomed optimism. In my birth country of Ukraine I\u2019ve learnt to love that shrug: it expects nothing good will happen, but knows things could be a lot worse, and that we might as well give it a go anyway. It\u2019s much more resilient than hope. So for the future: less hope \u2013 more doomed optimism.<br><em>Peter Pomerantsev\u2019s This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality is published by Faber</em></p>",

Minna Salami is the founder of the MsAfropolitan blog Ahir Shah: \u2018I want my blocked nose to go away\u2019 I often think, when I have a cold and a blocked nose, \u201cI am sure I used to be able to breathe freely.\u201d I\u2019ve spent a while now trying to work out what hope means to me, and all I can conclude is that, for what feels like the longest time, I have been a person with a blocked nose trying to remember what breathing feels like. I hope to hope again, to breathe again. Ahir Shah\u2019s standup show Dots is on UK tour until March Carole Cadwalladr: \u2018There will be a reckoning. Just not soon\u2019 I\u2019m pretty despairing much of the time. It is hard to keep going as a journalist at a time in which no one is ever held to account. But I do think the truth will out. Facebook is on the run. And while this generation of politicians is prepared to ignore the fact that we now know the EU referendum was a corrupt and illegitimate vote, the abject refusal to acknowledge this will horrify future generations. There will be a reckoning. Just not any time soon. Carole Cadwalladr is an award-winning Guardian and Observer journalist Elif Shafak: \u2018I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll rise up against toxic populism\u2019 Too much optimism makes us too comfortable, if not complacent. Too much pessimism wears us down. We need a healthy dose of each. We need, in the words of Gramsci, the pessimism of the intellect and the optimism of the will. Because we are facing massive global challenges \u2013 from the climate crisis to inequality, from extremism to the dark side of digital technology \u2013 none of which can be solved without global solidarity. I am hoping humanity will rise against the tide of nationalism, tribalism, isolationism and toxic populism. May 2020 be the year of tackling inequality head-on, embarking on the net-zero-carbon target, promoting empathy, and may it be the year of citizens of humanity. Elif Shafak\u2019s How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division is published by Profile and Wellcome Collection in July 2020 Ed Gamble: \u2018If the planet doesn\u2019t melt, I can redo my kitchen\u2019 As a comedian, hope is very important. I probably use the phrases \u201cI hope this goes well\u201d and \u201cwe can only hope\u201d more than any others. Before I face a new audience, before I try out new material, before I record a television show. It\u2019s a way of positively navigating the chaos of a life in entertainment without ever confronting what is essentially a mess of events that has no real order or sense. Other than that, it\u2019s a laugh being a comic. I do like it, I swear. You can never truly know what an audience will be like (unless you are in Maidenhead, where they stare). You can only hope. My hopes for the next decade are depressingly personal and probably not global enough, however ashamed I am to admit that. Sure, I hope that the planet doesn\u2019t melt, but mainly so I can finally redo the kitchen. I think this is the angle Extinction Rebellion is missing. It is, rightly, speaking on a global level, but people can\u2019t wrap their heads around that. We need less of \u201cthe forests are burning\u201d and more of: \u201cIf you don\u2019t start recycling, you, Steve Thompson, will never get to see Hamilton.\u201d Personally, I have seen Hamilton, so my main hope for the next decade is a sequel. Ed Gamble is live at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, London, on 20 December Azadeh Moaveni: \u2018Hope is like the humbling part of loving someone\u2019 Hope to me is a spiritual duty, however unfashionable that might sound, not unlike the humbling, laborious parts of loving someone. Persian poetry is replete with allusions to moments of dark political decline, where hope feels ignorant and almost outlandish. My hope is that I can infuse my daily life with higher purpose, that I can somehow impart a Persian worldview to my children, who I sometimes fear are citizens of nowhere, and that Iran, where by now you can tell I am from, comes out of its isolation and gets to occupy a few years of light. Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s Guest House for Young Widows: Among the Women of Isis was shortlisted for this year\u2019s Baillie Gifford prize Shoshana Zuboff: \u2018Too many of us fall into numb passivity\u2019 My hope is the resurrection of hope itself. After all, what is hope but the deepest conviction that the future can be better than the present? As technological power grows and democracy stumbles, too many of us fall into numb passivity. We trade hope for resignation and succumb to the propaganda of inevitability. But the present is never a good predictor of what may come. Hope thrives on the knowledge that we make the future. Each life is testament to this wild miracle. We begin. We falter. We begin again. Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power is published by Profile Natasha Devon: \u2018Hope is about harnessing your anger for change\u2019 A lot of people have told me they\u2019ve stopped engaging with politics, current affairs or anything beyond their home and job this year, because it\u2019s all too awful. I understand the sentiment, but I also think that\u2019s how evil wins. Hope is the ability to sustain your anger and harness it to bring about change. In a year\u2019s time, I hope my workplace mental health campaign Where\u2019s Your Head At? will have succeeded in changing the law. We\u2019re lobbying for provision of mental health first aid to be mandatory in workplaces in the same way as its physical counterpart. So far, all the politicians we have discussed it with have thought it was a great idea, but there have been so many changes of cabinet, and everyone has been so consumed with Brexit, we haven\u2019t been able to push it through. I also hope next year will be the year we start to understand that our mental health affects cognitive ability. Young people\u2019s mental health has enjoyed greater prominence recently, but it\u2019s always as an \u201cadd-on\u201d to academic attainment \u2013 a \u2018wellbeing week\u2019 in the middle of an otherwise highly pressured term. Yes You Can: Ace Your Exams Without Losing Your Mind by Natasha Devon is published by Macmillan in April Judy Murray: \u2018I hope to get the Murray Tennis Centre started\u2019 Hope is wishful thinking. I hope my family stays happy and healthy and I also hope to press the button on the Murray Tennis Centre and start building what will be our family legacy for the sport in Scotland. For the new decade I hope to live to see it up and running. Judy Murray is a tennis coach and the mother of Jamie and Andy Murray Chelsea Kwakye: \u2018Dare yourself to imagine a different way of life\u2019 Hope is essential to action and can be a driving force for change. Sometimes hoping can be overwhelming because, for a minute or two, you dare yourself to imagine a different way of life and what the future could look like. Above all, hope to me is the countless people and voices, often on the periphery of society, who are leading with their selflessness, knowledge and compassion. In the new decade I hope to see accountability, from politicians to CEOs, meaningful change and transparency. On a personal level, my hopes are quite simple: good health for all my loved ones, staying mentally and physically healthy and continuing to learn from those around me. Chelsea Kwakye is the co-author of Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change, published by #Merky Books Peter Pomerantsev: \u2018I aim for a shrug of doomed optimism\u2019 There\u2019s something desperate about hope that I want to avoid. It reminds me too much of its own necessity. Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not been a great year for some of the things I cherish, for the woolly cosmopolitan liberalism I\u2019ve always worn as a warm jumper. But the opposite of hope, cynicism, I want to avoid, too, comforting as it is. In times like these I turn to something eastern European inside me: a shrug of doomed optimism. In my birth country of Ukraine I\u2019ve learnt to love that shrug: it expects nothing good will happen, but knows things could be a lot worse, and that we might as well give it a go anyway. It\u2019s much more resilient than hope. So for the future: less hope \u2013 more doomed optimism.

While the prosecutor\u2019s office has argued that its \u201cprimary position\u201d is that Palestine is a state for the purposes of the treaty that established it, in his legal opinion on Friday Mandelblit argued that because Palestine was not a sovereign state the court had no jurisdiction. \u201cThe claim that the Palestinians have purported to join the Rome statute does not meet, nor can it replace, the substantive test requiring criminal jurisdiction to have been delegated to the court by a sovereign state with a defined territory,\u201d he said. A full ICC investigation could lead to possible charges being brought against individuals. States cannot be charged by the ICC. The nearly five-year preliminary investigation has looked at the 2014 war, which left 2,251 dead on the Palestinian side, the majority of whom were civilians, and 74 on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. It has also looked at violence near the Israel-Gaza border in 2018. Earlier this month, the ICC prosecutor refused to press charges over a deadly 2010 Israeli raid on a flotilla bringing aid to Gaza, and urged that investigation to be shut. Nine Turkish citizens died in May 2010 when Israeli marines stormed the Mavi Marmara, which was among eight ships trying to break a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. One more died in hospital in 2014.",

      "body": "<p>Standing in the shadow of Delhi\u2019s historic red fort, SA Khan pushed angrily against the wall of police barricades blocking his way. Khan, like thousands of others, had planned to take part in a peaceful march through the capital to voice his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/india-citizenship-law-protesters-across-country-defy-ban\">opposition to India\u2019s new citizenship law</a>, but the authorities had other plans.</p> <p>\u201cThey are denying us our basic right to protest, so how can we still call India a democracy?\u201d said Khan. \u201cModi has underestimated the Indian people if he thinks he can tear apart our constitution and try to divide us all down religious lines with this citizenship act. We stand here today united as Indians, Muslim brothers with Hindu brothers, and we will stay out here on these streets until the citizenship act is revoked and Modi is on his knees.\u201d</p> <p>After a week of nationwide protests, some of the largest in India for almost four decades, Narendra Modi\u2019s government had banned gatherings of more than four people in turbulent areas across the country in an attempt to quell dissent. But thousands of protesters \u2013 Hindu and Muslim, young and old, farmers, students and academics \u2013 were not to be stopped.</p> <p>On the streets of Delhi, Bangalore, Lucknow and elsewhere, demonstrators took to the streets in droves for peaceful protests in breach of the section 144 orders. Police responded with force, brandishing batons and rounding up all those participating in civil disobedience. More than 1,000 people were detained in Delhi, and in Bangalore police did not have enough buses to transport all those they had arrested. Police jails began to overflow.</p> <p>One arrest in particular prompted horror. Footage of one of India\u2019s most eminent historians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/gandhi-before-india-ramachandra-guha-review\">Ramachandra Guha</a>, being carted off by police officers went viral. He had been standing peacefully on a street in Bangalore brandishing a picture of B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sign of a paranoid, insecure regime who can not deal with dissent in any way,\u201d Guha said after he was released from detention. \u201cWe\u2019ve had difficult times in our republic but this is one of the worst I\u2019ve seen in my 60-year lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>The unrest was sparked by the passing of citizenship law that many believe brazenly discriminates against Muslims and could tear apart the secular foundations of India.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/18/india-clamps-down-against-citizenship-law-protests\">law states</a> that all Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants who arrived from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before 2014 will be allowed to claim Indian citizenship. The same will not apply for Muslim immigrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"727223e2f540208be8f7337ab3c880bccb3a5695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/727223e2f540208be8f7337ab3c880bccb3a5695/0_239_3566_2139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Delhi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government has defended the legislation as a benevolent act meant to offer protection to Hindus who have faced persecution in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries. But put into the context of decades of discriminatory rhetoric and actions perpetrated by Modi, his home minister, Amit Shah, and their political party, the BJP, the motives have been seen by many observers as sinister.</p> <p>Modi\u2019s rise to power was built on religious polarisation, fomenting anti-Muslim sentiment and the oppression of dissent, critics say. As chief minister of Gujarat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/28/india-fantasy-gujarat-modi-hindus\">in 2002</a> he was accused of allowing or even encouraging the massacre of thousands of Muslims when sectarian rioting and violence broke out in the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/08/narendra-modi-bjp-india\">A new India is emerging, and it is a country ruled by fear | Amit Chaudhuri</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is how Modi ran Gujurat, with a completely iron fist,\u201d said Guha. \u201cThey manipulated universities, they intimidated the media, threatened the judiciary \u2013 and they think they can extend that to all of India. This regime hates Muslims and now, more clearly than ever, it is exposed for what it is: authoritarian and sectarian and spectacularly bigoted.\u201d</p> <p>When Modi came to power in 2014, his government began enacting what looked to many to be a Hindu nationalist agenda that aimed to recast India as a Hindu nation rather than a secular one as laid out in the constitution.</p> <p>For the first five-year term, this manifested mainly in sectarian rhetoric and the assertion that to be Indian was to be Hindu.

      "bodyText": "Standing in the shadow of Delhi\u2019s historic red fort, SA Khan pushed angrily against the wall of police barricades blocking his way. Khan, like thousands of others, had planned to take part in a peaceful march through the capital to voice his opposition to India\u2019s new citizenship law, but the authorities had other plans. \u201cThey are denying us our basic right to protest, so how can we still call India a democracy?\u201d said Khan. \u201cModi has underestimated the Indian people if he thinks he can tear apart our constitution and try to divide us all down religious lines with this citizenship act. We stand here today united as Indians, Muslim brothers with Hindu brothers, and we will stay out here on these streets until the citizenship act is revoked and Modi is on his knees.\u201d After a week of nationwide protests, some of the largest in India for almost four decades, Narendra Modi\u2019s government had banned gatherings of more than four people in turbulent areas across the country in an attempt to quell dissent. But thousands of protesters \u2013 Hindu and Muslim, young and old, farmers, students and academics \u2013 were not to be stopped. On the streets of Delhi, Bangalore, Lucknow and elsewhere, demonstrators took to the streets in droves for peaceful protests in breach of the section 144 orders. Police responded with force, brandishing batons and rounding up all those participating in civil disobedience. More than 1,000 people were detained in Delhi, and in Bangalore police did not have enough buses to transport all those they had arrested. Police jails began to overflow. One arrest in particular prompted horror. Footage of one of India\u2019s most eminent historians, Ramachandra Guha, being carted off by police officers went viral. He had been standing peacefully on a street in Bangalore brandishing a picture of B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s the sign of a paranoid, insecure regime who can not deal with dissent in any way,\u201d Guha said after he was released from detention. \u201cWe\u2019ve had difficult times in our republic but this is one of the worst I\u2019ve seen in my 60-year lifetime.\u201d The unrest was sparked by the passing of citizenship law that many believe brazenly discriminates against Muslims and could tear apart the secular foundations of India. The law states that all Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants who arrived from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before 2014 will be allowed to claim Indian citizenship. The same will not apply for Muslim immigrants. The government has defended the legislation as a benevolent act meant to offer protection to Hindus who have faced persecution in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries. But put into the context of decades of discriminatory rhetoric and actions perpetrated by Modi, his home minister, Amit Shah, and their political party, the BJP, the motives have been seen by many observers as sinister. Modi\u2019s rise to power was built on religious polarisation, fomenting anti-Muslim sentiment and the oppression of dissent, critics say. As chief minister of Gujarat, in 2002 he was accused of allowing or even encouraging the massacre of thousands of Muslims when sectarian rioting and violence broke out in the state. \u201cThis is how Modi ran Gujurat, with a completely iron fist,\u201d said Guha. \u201cThey manipulated universities, they intimidated the media, threatened the judiciary \u2013 and they think they can extend that to all of India. This regime hates Muslims and now, more clearly than ever, it is exposed for what it is: authoritarian and sectarian and spectacularly bigoted.\u201d When Modi came to power in 2014, his government began enacting what looked to many to be a Hindu nationalist agenda that aimed to recast India as a Hindu nation rather than a secular one as laid out in the constitution. For the first five-year term, this manifested mainly in sectarian rhetoric and the assertion that to be Indian was to be Hindu. But after Modi\u2019s re-election in May, when he won a huge parliamentary majority, the agenda picked up the pace. First came the revocation of the special status of the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir. Then, in November, the supreme court ruled that India\u2019s most hotly contested religious site, Ayodhya \u2013 which Hindus regard as the birthplace of Rama and where a 16th-century Mughal mosque was demolished in 1992 \u2013 belonged to just Hindus rather than both communities, which Modi\u2019s government claimed as a political triumph. The brazenness of the citizenship law has galvanised the masses in opposition in a way that public lynchings of Muslims, low-level sectarian violence and the Kashmir decision all failed to do. \u201cThis citizenship legislation is at the core of their Hindu nationalist project, where the relegation of Muslims to second-class citizens is fundamental,\u201d said Niraja Gopal Jayal, a professor at the Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, at India\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University. \u201cIn Modi\u2019s first term you saw it gradually through the fostering of an ecosystem that was hostile to Muslims, where for example those who carried out vigilante lynchings of Muslims could act with complete impunity. \u201cBut in the past six months, the alacrity with which they have escalated the Hindu nationalist project, first with revoking article 370 in Kashmir, then banning the triple Talaq [an instant divorce allowed in Islam], then the favourable verdict for the Ram Mandir [the temple in Ayodhya], there is this sense that they are on a roll and can accomplish whatever they want. \u201cSo this legislation, where Muslims will be lucky if they are counted second-class citizens and not just thrown in a detention centre, is an inevitable culmination of that project. But judging by the protests, it is also possible that this time they have gone too far and never anticipated this kind of response.\u201d Jayal said the demonstrations were part of \u201ca battle for democracy, a battle for civil liberties, a battle for secularism and the plural character of Indian society.\u201d For one of the first times since Modi came to power, his slick social media and spin operation has failed to shift the narrative in his favour. The diverse makeup of participants in the protests means Modi\u2019s attempts to dismiss them as self-loathing liberals and hopeless cosmopolitans have been met with derision. \u201cI think Modi and Shah had grown so over-confident, had grown so arrogant that they thought they could get away with it, because they were convinced they had consolidated the country around the idea of a Hindu majority nation, and the country and the media would go with them,\u201d said Kapil Komireddi, the author of Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India. \u201cBut they did not bank on this outpouring of resentments that has accumulated over a long time.\u201d Like many observers, Komireddi drew comparisons between this week\u2019s unrest and the protests that preceded Indira Gandhi declaring a state of emergency in 1975 and suspending the constitution. \u201cWhat we are living in now is already a kind of undeclared emergency, where in effect in many parts of India democracy has effectively been suspended by Modi\u2019s government,\u201d Komireddi said.

      "bodyText": "An update from Caspar Llewellyn Smith \u2013 7 April 2020: Since the end of last year we have been running more tests on our site to encourage more Guardian digital users to sign in. This is an ongoing process to help ensure the Guardian is financially stable and we can fund quality, independent journalism, and you can read about our rationale in my December 2019 blogspot below. We will be running another series of tests with our global audience in April, and I want to explain what you might see and why. A small proportion of our users will be asked to sign in. They will be given a number of options \u2013 to sign in and register for free, to find out more information or to click \u2018not now\u2019, and continue their journey on the Guardian. This is not a paywall, nor a step to one. Guardian journalism is free for everyone to read on our website. We have long chosen not to put up a paywall because we believe everyone should have access to fair and factual reporting. This will not change \u2013 and it\u2019s especially important in the face of a global pandemic. The need for open and reliable journalism has never been greater. Reporting in these times has never been more urgent or challenging, and the business models that underpin the funding of journalism are being severely tested. Asking readers to sign in provides us with more information that we can use to personalise our approach in asking for support, to serve advertising (with readers\u2019 consent) and to create a better user experience. Above all, it helps us to keep Guardian journalism free to access for all. When you sign in you can still control your own data \u2013 if you are happy to sign in to give us more insight into how our journalism is read, but would rather we didn\u2019t offer you personalised advertising you can manage your choices in our privacy setting and in your \u2018manage my account\u2019 space.

Why signing in is important to the Guardian We want Guardian journalism to reach as many readers as possible in order for it to have an impact on society. This means we don\u2019t have a paywall on theguardian.com and that readers will always be able to find a Guardian story without being charged to read it.

      "bodyText": "This is the second version of the withdrawal agreement bill, which was first published in October. It is needed to enshrine the deal Boris Johnson struck with the EU in October in UK law and legitimise the transition period before full departure on 31 December 2020. But, in a reflection of the freedoms delivered by an 80-seat majority, this new version removes previous concessions to opposition parties as well as signalling to Eurosceptics in his own party that Brexit will not just be done, but done the Boris Johnson way. It includes several key changes that reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit bill and give the government freedom to conduct negotiations without parliamentary approval. Three clauses and one entire schedule have been removed. Five clauses have been added and several clauses modified. What stays the same? Powers to make the Brexit deal legal domestically. The legislation enabling the transition period allowing the UK to stay in the customs union and single market between 1 February and 21 December 2020. Powers to ensure key elements of the European Communities Act of 1972 remain applicable domestically. The UK will remain a rule-taker and not a rule maker. Extensive powers to ministers and devolved governments to deal with the separation issues. So-called \u201cHenry VIII powers\u201d, under which ministers can repeal or amend an act of parliament without going back to MPs, allowing them to implement the protocol on special arrangements intended to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. These are \u201ca bit of a blank cheque\u201d, says Joe Owen, Brexit director at the Institute for Government. But as nobody knows the detail of how they will operate they reflect the complexity of the consequences of the divorce from the EU. Powers and arrangements to ensure EU citizens\u2019 rights laid out in the withdrawal agreement are implemented. What has been removed? The clauses that give parliamentary say on future Brexit deals, negotiating objectives or the extension period have been removed. Specifically they are: The clause giving MPs the right to approve an extension to the transition period. The clause 31 requirement for parliamentary approval for negotiations on the future relationship in the October bill has gone. Under the old bill, the House of Commons would have had to approve the negotiating objectives of the government in the next phase of talks. The parliamentary approval process for any future relationship treaty subsequently negotiated with the EU has also gone. The removal of clauses pledging alignment with the EU on workers\u2019 rights. The government on Thursday promised in the Queen\u2019s speech that workers\u2019 rights would instead be \u201cprotected and enhanced\u201d under an employment bill. Legal protections for refugee children reunited with family members in the UK have been watered down. The bill removes, via clause 37, obligations in regard to unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the EU with an obligation to make a statement within two months of passing the act. The promise that the government\u2019s position on negotiating the future relationship will be in line with the political declaration that accompanied the withdrawal agreement. What\u2019s new? A clause outlawing an extension to the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December is included. A clause locking in Brexit at the stroke of midnight, 31 December. The only way that can change is if the EU changes its summer daylight saving. The bill gives the government new powers in several areas, including Northern Ireland, to change Brexit-related laws through secondary legislation rather than primary, which has the potential to reduce parliamentary scrutiny. Time limits on any discussion of the divorce bill payments, removing the option of debate up to March 2021. This is in line with the other clauses removing any chance of an extension to the transition period. It gives the House of Lords\u2019 EU committee the right to scrutinise developments in EU law of \u201cvital national interest\u201d to the UK during the transition or implementation period. The House of Commons already had these powers under the October bill. An independent monitoring authority to allow EU nationals in the UK to appeal against decisions relating to their rights has slightly changed, with the authority given the power to delegate decisions to launch inquiries. What happens next? After being approved at its second reading on Friday afternoon by 124 votes, the bill will go to its next stage after the Christmas recess. The government has set aside three days, 7, 8 and 9 January, for this, indicating its confidence that any of the previous obstacles \u2013 such as attempts to get a second referendum \u2013 will neither be mooted or will fail. Opposition parties say three days is not enough time to scrutinise one of the most important pieces of legislation in parliamentary history but the government disagrees.",

The MPC otherwise risks seeing the UK economy slow to a point where the central bank has few tools to help. <br></p> <p>Haskell was one of two policymakers on the nine-member panel who voted to cut interest rates in both November and December.</p> <p>He explains his rationale:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic outlook for the UK has weakened during the last year: Brexit uncertainties have weighed on the economy and the world\u2019s economic outlook has deteriorated. Inflation is low and projected to stay low. Thus, I believe current data justifies looser monetary policy</p> <p>Looking forward, I believe that downside risks are lingering over our forecast. In particular, Brexit uncertainties may remain entrenched. Brexit is a process not an event.</p> <p>In addition, I wish to reduce the probability of the economy of getting stuck at the effective lower bound, since it may be harder to get it out of that situation given our current monetary policy ammunition.

      "bodyText": "At 8:45am this morning, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced that the government had chosen FCA CEO Andrew Bailey as the new Bank of England governor Outgoing BoE governor Mark Carney was set to leave the Bank at the end of January but his term was extended to 15 March 2020 to ensure a smooth transition. It\u2019s not a stretch to assume that the looming Brexit date on 31 January and the delayed appointment due to the general election both played a part in that decsion. Bailey will take over from Carney on 16 March 2020 Bailey said it was an honour to be chosen and pledged to put public interest at the heart of the Bank of England mission. However, critics have been quick to outline his failings In other economic news, UK\u2019s GDP growth for the third quarter was revised up to 0.4% from previous estimates of 0.3% Then, one of Andrew Bailey\u2019s new colleagues Jonathan Haskel pushed for a near-term interest rate cut, and explained why he\u2019d voted for a reduction during the last two MPC meetings And as MPs voted in the Brexit withdrawal deal bill, markets seemed little moved... That\u2019s all from us today. Have a great weekend and we\u2019ll see you on Monday! KM Markets dont seem too excited by the passing of the withdrawal agreement bill in parliament this afternoon. It\u2019s still looking pretty tame as we head into the holiday period. MPs voted 358 to 234 to pass the bill, but with Boris Johnson having secured such a large majority last week, this was largely priced in by investors. The pound is up just 0.2% against the US dollar. Stocks are also subdued in the final week before Christmas, with the FTSE 100 still trading relatively flat. You can get your Brexit withdrawal deal fill over at our politics live blog: Can Andrew Bailey be the \u201cpeople\u2019s governor\u201d? That is the challenge put forward by Dame Helena Morrissey, who was in the running to replace Mark Carney. Morrissey, the former head of personal investing at Legal &amp; General Investment Management told the Mail on Sunday that she was still in the running back for the BoE\u2019s top job in November, but didn\u2019t seem to be holding her breath. She told Financial News (\u00a3) today: Bailey\u2019s appointment does feel a bit out of sync with the zeitgeist - I felt we needed a \u2018people\u2019s governor\u2019, someone who would prioritise building the public\u2019s trust in the financial system right across the country. I would also have welcomed someone who\u2019s an experienced market practitioner (not necessarily me) who might be more likely to spot the next potential crisis. Morrissey, who has nine children, is one of the City\u2019s most high-profile Brexiters. But now that she is done with the job interview circuit, she may have more time to focus on her burgeoning Instagram hobby: Turning back to the man of the hour, Andrew Bailey is continuing to draw criticism from some heavy hitters across Westminster and the City. Financial News (\u00a3) has spoken to former business secretary and LibDem leader Sir Vince Cable and prominent anti-Brexit campaign Gina Miller who have not been too glowing in their reactions. Cable said Bailey was: A very unimaginative appointment, someone who won\u2019t ruffle feathers in government or the banking sector. We can all go to sleep until the next financial crisis. Miller, who also is a founder of investment firm SCM Direct, did not pull any punches: It is truly astonishing that an individual who has shown an arrogant contempt for the best interests of the British public, costing them billions of pounds of losses through his complete failure to supervise and enforce the UK financial services industry, should be rewarded with such an important position. Bailey has failed to enforce Mifid II fee transparency, failed to prevent the failure of a series of peer-to-peer lending platforms, failed to properly supervise Woodford, failed to ensure open-ended property funds were fit for purpose, and failed to arrest a growing greenwashing scandal across the investment industry. What did the British public do to deserve this? Data flash: The US economy grew by 2.1% in the third quarter, compared to a year earlier, the US Commerce Department has confirmed. That\u2019s according to the final estimate GDP growth, which confirms previous estimates and is in line with economist expectations. However, consumer spending was stronger than previously reported, which helped offset downward revisions to investment in housebuilding. Imports were also higher than previously estimates. And for those of you trying to spend your cash during the Christmas rush, HSBC customers are reporting problems with their mobile and online banking. The BBC is reporting that it\u2019s the second glitch to hit the bank\u2019s digital service in 24 hours, with the first hitting customers after 8pm Thursday but was fixed three hours later. HSBC was apparently having a bit of Christmas fun with it (though customers probably weren\u2019t as jolly): The second fault hit customers overnight and is still affecting some customers today. The central bank news just keeps coming. The Bank of England has now released its quarterly bulletin which gives a slightly worrying view of consumer spending. The fact that households have been so willing to part with their cash has been a bright spot for the UK economy despite continued uncertainty. But the survey found that the net balance of households that expect to spend more over the next 12 months fell to zero, with most expecting Brexit to increase the price of goods. In the 2019 H2 survey, households were asked why they expected to change their spending over the next 12 months due to Brexit. Most households expecting to change spending due to the referendum result reported that higher prices were the key reason, with fewer households citing changes in income/income expectations or changes in job security. If you really want to get stuck-in, the full 16-page speech can be found here: For anyone worried that a near-term rate cut might overstimulate the economy, or get us closer to the point where lowering rates becomes futile, Haskel has a simple solution: just reverse the car and raise \u2018em: The insurance might be quite cheap. Even if it turns out that the policy-maker has overstated the probability of ending up at the ELB [effective lower bound interest rate*] , we can undo the stimulus by raising interest rates, given the much larger policy space we have available in terms of tighter policy. In this sense, I believe the costs of reversing policy would be quite low as expectations are unlikely to be de-anchored from looser monetary policy after so many years of \u2018lower for longer\u2019. *Because we all need a reminder sometimes, the effective lower bound rate is the level at which interest rate cuts end up having no tangible effect on the economy. One of Andrew Bailey\u2019s new colleagues has been speaking on the economy, at an event at the aforementioned Resolution Foundation in London. Jonathan Haskel, who is one of the nine members of the monetary policy committee, has argued that the Bank of England should cut interest rates now. The MPC otherwise risks seeing the UK economy slow to a point where the central bank has few tools to help. Haskell was one of two policymakers on the nine-member panel who voted to cut interest rates in both November and December. He explains his rationale: The economic outlook for the UK has weakened during the last year: Brexit uncertainties have weighed on the economy and the world\u2019s economic outlook has deteriorated. Inflation is low and projected to stay low. Thus, I believe current data justifies looser monetary policy Looking forward, I believe that downside risks are lingering over our forecast. In particular, Brexit uncertainties may remain entrenched. Brexit is a process not an event. In addition, I wish to reduce the probability of the economy of getting stuck at the effective lower bound, since it may be harder to get it out of that situation given our current monetary policy ammunition. Following a risk management argument, I favour a cut as insurance against this. The borrowing figures will reduce the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre, said the Resolution Foundation. If the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body tasked with monitoring the government\u2019s finances, cuts its forecats that would leave even less headroom for borrowing for Sajid Javid, the chancellor. Economists\u2019 reactions to the voluminous data from earlier have come in. GDP figures were revised upwards (to the slight surprise of economists). In the third quarter growth rose by 0.4%, but it may be more timing distortion than signal for the future, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The third quarter may well have overstated the economy\u2019s underlying strength, just as the second quarter overstated its weakness and the first quarter its strength. Economic activity has been distorted by a number of factors during 2019, most notably stockbuilding developments influenced by Brexit deadlines. Certainly, the economy was faltering at the end of the third quarter. GDP dipped 0.1% month-on-month in September after falling 0.2% in August. Third quarter GDP growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter was therefore highly dependent on strong activity in July when growth was 0.3% month-on-month. Has Christmas come early, asks Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics? The festive cheer will probably be short-lived seeing as [the upgrade] was driven by a larger boost to net trade than in the previous figures which we know has already started to unwind. The underlying picture is still that there is very little momentum in the economy. A controversy has erupted in the world of central banking animals, amid conflicting reports about new Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s experiences (or not) with bears. The Telegraph reports that Bailey has an ursine affinity. Bailey is \u201cso cool under pressure he once reportedly faced down a marauding grizzly bear with his American wife at their US holiday home\u201d, the paper said. However, the Daily Mirror says it was Bailey\u2019s wife, Cheryl, who faced down the visitor to their holiday home in Idaho, citing an FT report from 2016. Mr Bailey gave \u201cmoral telephonic support\u201d to Cheryl, because he was trapped in London trying to halt the collapse of Northern Rock. On another occasion, the FT reported in 2016, a bear had sunk its teeth into their sofa and was trying to drag it out of the window. Central bank watchers are familiar with zoo visits. \u201cHawks\u201d want interest rates to soar to keep inflation down and stop debt building up; \u201cdoves\u201d think rates should flutter lower, keeping the supply of money going so that growth doesn\u2019t stall. The European Central Bank\u2019s new boss Christine Lagarde introduced the \u201cwise owl\u201d to the economics world earlier this month. Annual accounts have dropped for the Daily Mail\u2019s publisher, DMGT. It has had a good year on the stock market, and the rewards for executives appear to be in the same vein, reports the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. Here are the shares over the past year: But some people clearly think it won\u2019t last. The hedge fund owned by billionaire investor George Soros has a short position betting shares will fall. Former Scottish National Party MP George Kerevan gives a flavour of some of the criticisms that Bailey will face. Kerevan briefly considered trying to lead the Treasury select committee, before losing his seat, and has worked with various groups of people critical of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s approach to regulating big banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland. And a reminder that the top regulatory jobs can be... complicated: Right, back to some reaction to the Bailey appointment. The City appears to have welcomed a familiar face moving from the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s Stratford offices to the Bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: He has never served on the [interest rate-setting] monetary policy committee so we don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s a dove, a hawk or somewhere in between (perhaps an \u201cowl\u201d as new ECB President Christine Lagarde describes herself!). Perhaps the biggest challenge will be dealing with the next severe downturn, which will probably take pace during his eight-year term. That may require some innovative thinking given that the Bank is unlikely to enter it with much interest rate ammunition and as the current arsenal of unconventional policies are not considered very effective. Catherine McGuinness, the policy chair at the City of London Corporation, which lobbies for the financial services sector (as well as running things like housing and police) said: Mark Carney has done a fantastic job since becoming governor in 2013, helping to raise the global profile of the Bank\u2019s work, and often leading the way on challenges and opportunities of the future such as climate change and fintech. Andrew is well placed to continue this important work to ensure that the Bank plays a leading role on the international stage. The investment industry highlights his familiarity with the City. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said: Andrew\u2019s extensive experience and able leadership, demonstrated at the FCA, will enable him to successfully guide the Bank during this critical period for the UK as we prepare to leave the EU. In a bumper data release, we also have the UK\u2019s public sector borrowing figures, the government\u2019s spending deficit. The government borrowed \u00a35.6bn in November, according to the Office for National Statistics \u2013 below the \u00a36.3bn expected by economists but the highest November borrowing figure in two years. Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, from April 2019 to November, was \u00a350.9bn, \u00a35.1bn more than in the same period last year; this is the highest April-to-November borrowing for two years. Business investment saw no growth between the second and third quarters of 2019, in a sign that the UK\u2019s longer-term economic prospects were likely hit by the uncertainty of the last year. The figures from the Office for National Statistics confirm that the UK has endured an investment slump this year: Investment only grew by 0.1% in the second quarter. Business investment is crucial to improve the longer-term productivity of the British economy. Nevertheless, the GDP figures give double confirmation that the UK avoided recession, after output fell in the second quarter. The revision reflected \u201cincreased levels of volatility in the first half of the year that largely reflect changes in the timing of activity related to the UK\u2019s original planned exit date from the European Union in late March\u201d, the Office for National Statistics said. But Breaking off from Bailey\u2019s announcement, the final UK GDP figures are out: they show third-quarter growth revised up. In the third quarter the UK economy expanded by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics, faster than the 0.3% previously reported. At the same time, the ONS also revised down its numbers for 2018: growth for the year was only 1.3%, down from the 1.4% reported before. Some more reaction (from before and after the announcement became official). Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, was effusive in his praise. John McDonnell, still Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor for the time being, gives something of a hint that he might have made a different choice had the general election result been different. Angus Armstrong, the economist who leads research body Rebuild Macroeconomics, said: One of the first priorities for Bailey \u2013 and indeed for outgoing governor Mark Carney \u2013 will be to shore up the Bank of England\u2019s security, after a hugely embarrassing breach that potentially allowed hedge funds to hear market-moving information before anyone else. This report from the Guardian\u2019s Graeme Wearden highlights the sensitivity of the governor\u2019s role, with traders around the world hanging off every word, and even what they don\u2019t say. See how that can move markets here: Some more facts from the Treasury\u2019s announcement: Andrew Bailey will be the 121st governor in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history and the ninth to be appointed since the Bank\u2019s nationalisation in 1946. Mr Bailey has been appointed for an eight-year term and will receive a salary of \u00a3495,000. (Being the most important economist in Britain has its perks.) To ensure continuity, an interim chief executive of the FCA will be appointed well ahead of Mr Bailey\u2019s departure to manage the organisation until a permanent successor is chosen by HM Treasury. The Bank of England\u2019s governor-to-be, Andrew Bailey, said: It is a tremendous honour to be chosen as governor of the Bank of England and to have the opportunity to serve the people of the United Kingdom, particularly at such a critical time for the nation as we leave the European Union. The Bank has a very important job and, as governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does. It is important to me that the Bank continues to work for the public by maintaining monetary and financial stability and ensuring that financial institutions are safe and sound. I am committed to the Bank being an accessible and approachable institution, as well as an open and diverse place to work. I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues at the Financial Conduct Authority for their support during my time as chief executive and the excellent work they do. Outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: I am delighted to welcome Andrew Bailey back to the Bank as its next Governor. An extraordinary public servant, Andrew brings unparalleled experience, built over three decades of dedicated service across all policy areas of the Bank, and most recently as CEO of the FCA. Andrew is widely and deeply respected for his leadership managing the financial crisis, developing the new regulatory frameworks, and supporting financial innovation to better serve UK households and businesses. Over the years, I benefited greatly from his support and wise counsel. I wish Andrew and the Bank continued success in their work to serve the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. Gluttons for punishment can read the Bank of England\u2019s full press release here. And the chancellor has tweeted it: Why has the process taken so long? It was a carefully considered process, Javid says. I would have made an appointment earlier but felt it was a decision to be made by a new government, Javid says. He wants an orderly transition, and that is why he has asked Mark Carney to stay on as governor until 15 March. And that is the end of a very brief press conference. No questions about the operational difficulties facing the Bank. Now a brief Q&amp;A. Was Brexit a factor? What mattered most was the experience that they bring to the table, Javid says. Do you want Bailey to challenge you, publish challenging forecasts, and look at the Bank\u2019s remit? I want him to uphold vigorously the independence of the institution, Javid says. He wants the BoE to make any decisions necessary without government intervetion. Bailey will take over on 16 March, leaving time for an orderly transition, Javid says. Bailey will serve an eight-year term until 2028, Javid says. Mark Carney, the current governor, will stay on until 15 March to oversee a smooth transition. *This post has been edited: it previously said Bailey would take over on 15 March. Javid praises Bailey\u2019s work during the financial crisis. Bailey took over the organisation at a difficult time, and he transformed it, Javid says. He praises his commitment to diversity. The breadth and depth of his experience is unmatched. Sajid Javid says he had no hesitation in appointing Andrew Bailey. He was the standout candidate in a competitive field, he says. With the Bank of England announcement due shortly, a few thoughts from around the City on what Andrew Bailey would mean. Although he has a firm monetary policy grounding, Bailey has been intimately involved with regulating the financial sector during the financial crisis and throughout the last decade. Although that closeness could have big implications. Will the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigations of the Bank of England\u2019s breach, revealed yesterday, be affected? FCA employees will be investigating an organisation run by their former boss. An interesting note from long-serving Conservative backbencher John Redwood: a call for the promotion of growth from the Bank. Whether the rest of his colleagues agree remains to be seen, but coupled with a new mood of government spending it could herald a new economic era for the UK. Markets have opened. You might be able to guess that it\u2019s the last Friday before Christmas. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.05%. NMC Health is the biggest faller, down by 2.9% (a bit more on that to come). Across Europe Italy is the biggest mover \u2013 up by only 0.6%. Stop the press: Relx, the FTSE-100 listed group formerly known as Reed Elsevier, has offloaded 85-year old Farmers Weekly, ending a decade-long process of magazine sales. Relx, which has sold all but one of its portfolio of 300 business-to-business magazines in 65 deals over the last decade, said the sale symbolically represents the last step in a transformation from a print to a digital business. Farmers Weekly is in good health with a circulation of nearly 42,000, with more than 26,000 of those subscribers, and it employs 54 staff. It started in 1934. Estates Gazette is Relx\u2019s last remaining title, and there are no plans to sell it. British consumer confidence increased in December, according to GfK\u2019s measure, with the pollsters saying it points to a \u201cclear sense of change\u201d. A seven-point increase in the reading for the coming year is the strongest increase since the summer of 2016, the time of the EU referendum, GfK reported. The polling of British consumers took place before the general election on 12 December, so may be further impacted next month by the clear result. That helped their overall index to a three-point rise, although still at a low, negative level of 11 points \u2013 only three points higher than last month and the same time last year. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said: There\u2019s a clear sense of a change in consumer sentiment this month. The picture for the year to come is much stronger with a two-point improvement in how consumers view their personal financial prospects and a very healthy seven-point jump on how they see the wider economy next year. We haven\u2019t seen such a robust increase in confidence about our economic future since the summer of 2016. Despite official warning signs about the flatlining of Britain\u2019s economy, we know that record high employment and below target levels of inflation are helping to boost consumers\u2019 expectations for the year ahead. You might be familiar with the name Andrew Bailey if you pay close attention to your cash: his signature used to adorn bank notes that were printed when he was chief cashier at the Bank of England. Now his name is expected to adorn the door to the governor\u2019s office. The Financial Times (\u00a3) on Thursday night reported that a decision to appoint Bailey had been made, and is expected to be made this morning. Bailey would be seen as a safe choice for chancellor Sajid Javid. The potential governor is a creature of the Bank, having served as a private secretary to a previous governor and taking a key role in the bank bailouts of 2008. He is perhaps better known now across the City for helming the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since July 2016. However, he is not without his critics. During his time the FCA has been hit by intense criticism of its handling of multiple financial scandals, including the liquidity issues surrounding former star fund manager Neil Woodford and the mini-bond misselling scandal at London Capital &amp; Finance. The new govenror will have a bulging in-tray \u2013 likely taking over on the day that the UK leaves the EU, 1 February. The FT reported that Bailey\u2019s Brexit views were a \u201ckey factor\u201d, citing people close to the process. Minouche Shafik, the former Bank deputy governor who now heads the London School of Economics, was reportedly ruled out because of her criticism of Brexit. If anyone needed any reminder of the possible challenges facing a new governor, the last 24 hours have given a timely nudge. First off, the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer is facing calls to resign after a damaging lapse in security that allowed hedge funds to pay for early access to current governor Mark Carney\u2019s words at Bank of England press conferences. The eight seconds those investors may have gained from a high-speed audio-only connection could have given a vital edge to investors. And secondly, new economic data published overnight suggests that uncertainty over the economy was still a factor at least up until the election. Data from GfK, which do not cover the post-election period, suggest that consumer confidence increased slightly, but still at the low levels seen over the last three years. More detail on this to come \u2013 although the real story will be what impact Boris Johnson\u2019s majority will have.

      "body": "<p>Stormzy has said Britain is \u201cdefinitely, 100%\u201d racist and that this has worsened under Boris Johnson because his comments have emboldened people with racist views.</p> <p>The grime artist, who has just released his second album, Heavy is the Head, made the comments in an interview with the Italian newspaper <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/anteprima/2019/12/18/news/stormzy_ghali_intervista_doppia_trap_rap_brexit_salvini_boris_johnson-243704497/?refresh_ce\">La Repubblica</a>. When asked if Britain was still racist, the musician said \u201cdefinitely, 100%\u201d even if it was \u201chidden\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re not racist\u2019. But there\u2019s a lot of racism in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difficult thing with the UK is, as you said, in Italy it\u2019s a clear problem, whereas trying to explain that Britain is a racist country [to a British person] is the most difficult thing ever. They think: \u2018No, it\u2019s not. Stormzy you\u2019re successful. Look at London, there\u2019s loads of black people \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a more difficult case to fight.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy said the prime minister was a \u201cfigurehead\u201d whose actions had made it more acceptable to say racist things in British society. \u201cIf the top person can openly say this racist thing \u2013 the \u2018piccaninnies\u2019 remarks, \u2018watermelon smiles\u2019, comparing Muslim women to a letter box \u2013 if that is our figurehead, the top man, the leader we have to follow, and he openly says these things, he encourages hate among others.\u201d</p> <p>He said since Johnson had been in office the situation had deteriorated, with people who hold racist views feeling emboldened to express them in public.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, people had to hide their racism. If you felt something bad about about black people, about Muslims, you had to shut up. Now these people have the confidence to come out in public to say everything. This is scary to me, that scares the shit out of me.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy, whose real name is Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo, said he would have to carefully consider whether or not he would accept an honour such as an MBE or OBE if offered one. He said it would be difficult to accept an honour \u201cbecause of the British empire\u201d, but that his mother would be proud if he was offered one.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got a very dark history. You know, Britain colonised everywhere. It\u2019s something I\u2019d look into and decide in case of.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy has been a vocal critic of the Conservative government, and Johnson in particular. His single Vossi Bop contained the line \u201cFuck the government, and fuck Boris\u201d, which became the slogan of a campaign aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/black-brown-women-unseat-boris-johnson-fckboris\">unseating him at the recent general election</a>.</p> <p>This week he was criticised by the TV presenter Piers Morgan for telling a group of children at his old primary school in Thornton Heath, south London, that Johnson was a \u201cbad man\u201d.</p> <p>Morgan tweeted: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done this, and shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to do this.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a> responded: \u201cThe kid asked me a question and I replied truthfully, nothing wrong with that Piers lol.\u201d</p> <p>In the buildup to the general election, Stormzy gave his support to Labour, signing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/musicians-backing-jeremy-corbyns-labour\">open letter to the Guardian</a> along with several other cultural figures that backed the party\u2019s pledge to end austerity. In later tweets he described the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as being the first man in a position of power who is \u201ccommitted to giving power back to the people and helping those who need a helping hand from the government the most\u201d.</p> <p>He was also involved in a Twitter dispute with the Conservative MP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1199304826468876288\">Michael Gove who quoted his lyrics</a> and criticised his decision to back Labour. Observers said a white, middle-class politician imitating a young black grime MC on social media was the equivalent of \u201cTwitter blackface\u201d.</p> <p>During his headline Glastonbury set in June, Stormzy wore a stab vest with a union flag on it, designed by Banksy. As he performed the words \u201cknife crime\u201d appeared lit up behind him, and there was an excerpt from a speech by the Labour MP<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-lammy\"> David Lammy</a> on the issue. Lammy tweeted that Stormzy had used the performance to \u201cspeak out about the injustice of young black kids being criminalised\u201d.</p> <p>In the Repubblica interview, Stormzy explained how his style and approach to music had changed. \u201cNow I am rich, I no longer live in the dark streets of Croydon, I am no longer as angry as before,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything changes and so you look for a new voice. But the important thing is always to be honest with yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy is the latest high-profile black British cultural figure to say they would consider turning down an OBE or MBE. The spoken-word artist and podcaster George the Poet said he rejected an honour earlier this year because of the \u201cpure evil\u201d perpetrated by the British empire. The poet, whose real name is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/george-mpanga\">George Mpanga</a>, told the Guardian the honours system needed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/30/george-the-poet-if-i-accepted-an-mbe-what-would-my-descendants-think\">a dramatic overhaul</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can get me \u2013 a child of Africa, whose grandfather died in exile as a result of British meddling in Uganda, whose great-great-grandfather resisted the British invasion of his country \u2013 to accept an MBE, what would my descendants make of that? What would my ancestors make of that?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that in order to accept this accolade, in order to accept this recognition, I have to submit to that interpretation of empire.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy\u2019s new album went to the top of the streaming charts when it was released on 13 December, with several songs appearing in the top 40 singles charts. </p>",

When asked if Britain was still racist, the musician said \u201cdefinitely, 100%\u201d even if it was \u201chidden\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re not racist\u2019. But there\u2019s a lot of racism in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difficult thing with the UK is, as you said, in Italy it\u2019s a clear problem, whereas trying to explain that Britain is a racist country [to a British person] is the most difficult thing ever. They think: \u2018No, it\u2019s not. Stormzy you\u2019re successful. Look at London, there\u2019s loads of black people \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a more difficult case to fight.\u201d Stormzy said the prime minister was a \u201cfigurehead\u201d whose actions had made it more acceptable to say racist things in British society. \u201cIf the top person can openly say this racist thing \u2013 the \u2018piccaninnies\u2019 remarks, \u2018watermelon smiles\u2019, comparing Muslim women to a letter box \u2013 if that is our figurehead, the top man, the leader we have to follow, and he openly says these things, he encourages hate among others.\u201d He said since Johnson had been in office the situation had deteriorated, with people who hold racist views feeling emboldened to express them in public. \u201cBefore, people had to hide their racism. If you felt something bad about about black people, about Muslims, you had to shut up. Now these people have the confidence to come out in public to say everything. This is scary to me, that scares the shit out of me.\u201d Stormzy, whose real name is Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo, said he would have to carefully consider whether or not he would accept an honour such as an MBE or OBE if offered one. He said it would be difficult to accept an honour \u201cbecause of the British empire\u201d, but that his mother would be proud if he was offered one. \u201cIt\u2019s got a very dark history. You know, Britain colonised everywhere. It\u2019s something I\u2019d look into and decide in case of.\u201d Stormzy has been a vocal critic of the Conservative government, and Johnson in particular. His single Vossi Bop contained the line \u201cFuck the government, and fuck Boris\u201d, which became the slogan of a campaign aimed at unseating him at the recent general election. This week he was criticised by the TV presenter Piers Morgan for telling a group of children at his old primary school in Thornton Heath, south London, that Johnson was a \u201cbad man\u201d. Morgan tweeted: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done this, and shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to do this.\u201d Stormzy responded: \u201cThe kid asked me a question and I replied truthfully, nothing wrong with that Piers lol.\u201d In the buildup to the general election, Stormzy gave his support to Labour, signing an open letter to the Guardian along with several other cultural figures that backed the party\u2019s pledge to end austerity. In later tweets he described the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as being the first man in a position of power who is \u201ccommitted to giving power back to the people and helping those who need a helping hand from the government the most\u201d. He was also involved in a Twitter dispute with the Conservative MP Michael Gove who quoted his lyrics and criticised his decision to back Labour. Observers said a white, middle-class politician imitating a young black grime MC on social media was the equivalent of \u201cTwitter blackface\u201d. During his headline Glastonbury set in June, Stormzy wore a stab vest with a union flag on it, designed by Banksy. As he performed the words \u201cknife crime\u201d appeared lit up behind him, and there was an excerpt from a speech by the Labour MP David Lammy on the issue. Lammy tweeted that Stormzy had used the performance to \u201cspeak out about the injustice of young black kids being criminalised\u201d. In the Repubblica interview, Stormzy explained how his style and approach to music had changed. \u201cNow I am rich, I no longer live in the dark streets of Croydon, I am no longer as angry as before,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything changes and so you look for a new voice. But the important thing is always to be honest with yourself.\u201d Stormzy is the latest high-profile black British cultural figure to say they would consider turning down an OBE or MBE. The spoken-word artist and podcaster George the Poet said he rejected an honour earlier this year because of the \u201cpure evil\u201d perpetrated by the British empire. The poet, whose real name is George Mpanga, told the Guardian the honours system needed a dramatic overhaul. \u201cIf you can get me \u2013 a child of Africa, whose grandfather died in exile as a result of British meddling in Uganda, whose great-great-grandfather resisted the British invasion of his country \u2013 to accept an MBE, what would my descendants make of that? What would my ancestors make of that?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that in order to accept this accolade, in order to accept this recognition, I have to submit to that interpretation of empire.\u201d Stormzy\u2019s new album went to the top of the streaming charts when it was released on 13 December, with several songs appearing in the top 40 singles charts.",

That extraordinary change is partly down to a slight dwindling at Manchester City but the chief cause is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">improvement at Leicester</a> under Rodgers. Which is attributable to a change of practices and communication.</p> <p>Mocking of Rodgers for supposed David Brentisms will always find an audience but at Leicester his communication skills have complemented his technical knowhow, helping to raise standards and morale. Communication was not a forte of Rodgers\u2019 predecessor, Claude Puel, who did much good work but was at times too cold, at others too imprecise.</p> <p>To develop the team Puel had to phase out older players who had served the club well, but the way he went about that caused unnecessary ill-will. Puel\u2019s eagerness to advance to a post-Jamie Vardy era seems particularly ludicrous in the light of the striker\u2019s renewed lethality under Rodgers; but the treatment of the long-serving midfielder Andy King, who said he had little meaningful dialogue with Puel before eventually leaving the club in February 2018, also caused resentment.</p> <p>Rodgers, too, has inherited members of the 2016 title-winning squad whom he will have to move on but he has chosen to treat them as assets for as long as they are at the club rather than alienate them. Wes Morgan and Christian Fuchs were even awarded new contracts shortly after Rodgers\u2019 arrival and continue to make valuable contributions from the bench as well as sharing their experience of staying around the top of the league.</p> <p>Rodgers\u2019 most significant communication triumph, however, has been the clarity of his training and how it translates into matches. Under Puel too many players felt there was a discrepancy between how they practised and how they were expected to perform at the weekend. Vardy memorably complained that the team felt they were preparing for a marathon but were then expected to compete in a 100m dash, and that is why they often fell short.</p> <p>Now Leicester are able to play with exceptional intensity because that is how they train. According to the midfielder Hamza Choudhury, \u201cthe intensity has gone through the roof\u201d. James Maddison has explained that is not simply a question of fitness, it is also about concentration and choreographed deployment. \u201cI think the word \u2018intensity\u2019 confuses people,\u201d he said a couple of months into Rodgers\u2019 reign. \u201cThey think it just means running around 100mph but it\u2019s not. We\u2019ve worked on pressing a lot and that is intense by nature and there are a lot of tactical elements involved. We\u2019re constantly learning.\u201d</p> <p>Even though Leicester tend to have more possession than their opponents, no team have won more tackles than them in the Premier League this season. The individual members of Leicester\u2019s defence are excellent and Wilfried Ndidi is a magnificent screener in midfield, but the team\u2019s well-synchronised dynamism is the main reason they have conceded fewer goals than anyone else. Rodgers\u2019 message and method are understood and applied.</p> <p>Last season Leicester had a revealing bad habit: they and Watford had the joint-worst record for goals conceded in the first 15 minutes, exposing a measure of muddle in preparations. Watford have not solved their problem \u2013 they have the worst record for conceding early goals again \u2013 but for Leicester it is no longer an issue (though the biggest test comes on Saturday, as Manchester City have scored more early goals than anyone else).</p> <p>But Leicester\u2019s biggest improvement has been in their attacking. It seems incredible now that Watford scored more goals than them last season, and even Crystal Palace managed as many. Now Leicester go forward. Leicester\u2019s discipline and tenacity are attacking qualities. Now Leicester penetrate much more often because they have become more knowing. They are not simply more energetic but also more patient.</p> <p>The message that Puel never quite seemed to be able to get through is that being patient does not mean being slow. Leicester pass and move with great speed but have learned to wait for the right moment to go for the kill.</p> <p>They have had similar amounts of possession in matches this season as last but have completed an average of 22% more passes per match because they are constantly trying to pull opponents out of shape.</p> <p>It takes admirable clarity of thought, as well as talent, to upset the established order.</p>",

Wes Morgan and Christian Fuchs were even awarded new contracts shortly after Rodgers\u2019 arrival and continue to make valuable contributions from the bench as well as sharing their experience of staying around the top of the league. Rodgers\u2019 most significant communication triumph, however, has been the clarity of his training and how it translates into matches. Under Puel too many players felt there was a discrepancy between how they practised and how they were expected to perform at the weekend. Vardy memorably complained that the team felt they were preparing for a marathon but were then expected to compete in a 100m dash, and that is why they often fell short. Now Leicester are able to play with exceptional intensity because that is how they train. According to the midfielder Hamza Choudhury, \u201cthe intensity has gone through the roof\u201d. James Maddison has explained that is not simply a question of fitness, it is also about concentration and choreographed deployment. \u201cI think the word \u2018intensity\u2019 confuses people,\u201d he said a couple of months into Rodgers\u2019 reign. \u201cThey think it just means running around 100mph but it\u2019s not. We\u2019ve worked on pressing a lot and that is intense by nature and there are a lot of tactical elements involved. We\u2019re constantly learning.\u201d Even though Leicester tend to have more possession than their opponents, no team have won more tackles than them in the Premier League this season. The individual members of Leicester\u2019s defence are excellent and Wilfried Ndidi is a magnificent screener in midfield, but the team\u2019s well-synchronised dynamism is the main reason they have conceded fewer goals than anyone else. Rodgers\u2019 message and method are understood and applied. Last season Leicester had a revealing bad habit: they and Watford had the joint-worst record for goals conceded in the first 15 minutes, exposing a measure of muddle in preparations. Watford have not solved their problem \u2013 they have the worst record for conceding early goals again \u2013 but for Leicester it is no longer an issue (though the biggest test comes on Saturday, as Manchester City have scored more early goals than anyone else). But Leicester\u2019s biggest improvement has been in their attacking. It seems incredible now that Watford scored more goals than them last season, and even Crystal Palace managed as many. Now Leicester go forward. Leicester\u2019s discipline and tenacity are attacking qualities. Now Leicester penetrate much more often because they have become more knowing. They are not simply more energetic but also more patient. The message that Puel never quite seemed to be able to get through is that being patient does not mean being slow. Leicester pass and move with great speed but have learned to wait for the right moment to go for the kill. They have had similar amounts of possession in matches this season as last but have completed an average of 22% more passes per match because they are constantly trying to pull opponents out of shape. It takes admirable clarity of thought, as well as talent, to upset the established order.",

It wasn\u2019t a hard sell (one thing I inherited from my mother is needing no excuse to party). The issue wasn\u2019t religion or culture: it was scheduling. My siblings and I only had our mum growing up, and she worked in a shop; Christmas Eve and Boxing Day were major shopping days and on Christmas Day she was beat. So I promised to take care of everything. Being 14, it was obviously an unmitigated disaster. I served prawns covered in ketchup and mayo in a mug (\u201cPrawn cocktail,\u201d I explained). I ruined my sister\u2019s tights by cutting them up for stockings. I overloaded several extension cords with lights (the electrician was impressed: only true Christmasheads would have dinner by candlelight). It was probably quite tense, too, what with me shouting \u201cBe jolly!\u201d at anyone who dared to rest their face. In my family, Christmas remains \u201cmy\u201d holiday. But I no longer feel the need to subscribe to a cookie-cutter version. This year, for the first time, I\u2019ve delegated. Mum\u2019s on food and encouraged to use spice; brother is on movies (the more chin-strokey the better); sister is soundtracking the day with rap; English boyfriend has no role other than to not look mortified. My older cousin messaged me a millennial-goading joke: \u201cThis year will you be leaving Santa avocado toast?\u201d \u201cWhy not,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas \u2013 we can do whatever we want.\u201d",

Pressure has become so great that thousands of patients a week are waiting with ambulance crews for at least half an hour outside A&amp;E because they are too busy to accept them. Last week 11,785 patients waited 30-60 minutes to get into an A&amp;E and another 4,469 faced a delay of at least an hour, figures from NHS England show. That meant one in six patients waited at least 30 minutes compared with one in 10 in the same week last year.

      "body": "<p>It may strike you that there are two main camps when it comes to Christmas prep: those who have everything done and dusted by mid-November, and the rest of us, who take things to the wire and end up shopping on Christmas Eve. But there is, in fact, a third group: those who have cracked most of the shopping, but suddenly remember they\u2019ve forgotten something \u2013 most commonly, a bottle to take to their host.</p> <p>I\u2019ve touched on this subject before in the context of \u201cgifting\u201d (gah!), but sweet or fortified wines are likely to be appreciated more than wines to go with the first or main courses, which your hosts will most probably have already lined up.</p> <p>But which type to buy? Sauternes is always well received (Booths does a really good, 13% one under its own label for \u00a314 the half-bottle), but it\u2019s a bit light for many of the classic Christmas puds. So you\u2019d be better off going for a richer dessert wine, such as a moscatel or the passito di pantelleria below, that tastes of apricots and marmalade or, indeed, of the Christmas pudding itself.</p> <p>Half-bottles of sherry always go down well with aficionados \u2013 again, considering the time of year, I\u2019d go for a richer style than the crisp finos and manzanillas you might be inclined to drink in summer. Palo cortado is my personal favourite, while the sweet-toothed will swoon over a bottle of PX (pedro xim\u00e9nez), which is way cooler than a cream sherry these days.</p> <p>If you\u2019re thinking more along the lines of port, the Aussies have their own version, which they call liqueur muscat and which tastes (deliciously) like sticky toffee pudding. I personally prefer tawny ports to sweeter, more brambly, late-bottled vintage ones \u2013 Morrisons has a really good <strong><a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Wm-Morrison-10-Year-Old-Tawny-Port-/310363011\" title=\"\">10-Year-Old Tawny</a></strong> (20%) in its The Best range, which is currently on offer at \u00a310 and tastes enticingly of salted caramel.</p> <p>And if you\u2019re wondering whether you should take along one of those seemingly endless new riffs on Irish cream, what can I say? Fifteen quid seems a fair amount to pay for a <strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-to-order/adventures-in-food/christmas-gin?OmnitureRedirect=snowglobe%20gin\" title=\"\">Clementine Gin Liqueur Snow Globe</a></strong> (at Marks &amp; Spencer), though it might be better stockpiling that for a Eurovision party. It\u2019s preferable, in any case, to the same store\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-to-order/not-just-any-food/food-news/trifle?OmnitureRedirect=trifle%20flavour%20cream\" title=\"\">Trifle Flavour Cream</a></strong> (\u00a310), which tastes spookily like a liquid Victoria sponge.

      "bodyText": "It may strike you that there are two main camps when it comes to Christmas prep: those who have everything done and dusted by mid-November, and the rest of us, who take things to the wire and end up shopping on Christmas Eve. But there is, in fact, a third group: those who have cracked most of the shopping, but suddenly remember they\u2019ve forgotten something \u2013 most commonly, a bottle to take to their host. I\u2019ve touched on this subject before in the context of \u201cgifting\u201d (gah!), but sweet or fortified wines are likely to be appreciated more than wines to go with the first or main courses, which your hosts will most probably have already lined up. But which type to buy? Sauternes is always well received (Booths does a really good, 13% one under its own label for \u00a314 the half-bottle), but it\u2019s a bit light for many of the classic Christmas puds. So you\u2019d be better off going for a richer dessert wine, such as a moscatel or the passito di pantelleria below, that tastes of apricots and marmalade or, indeed, of the Christmas pudding itself. Half-bottles of sherry always go down well with aficionados \u2013 again, considering the time of year, I\u2019d go for a richer style than the crisp finos and manzanillas you might be inclined to drink in summer. Palo cortado is my personal favourite, while the sweet-toothed will swoon over a bottle of PX (pedro xim\u00e9nez), which is way cooler than a cream sherry these days. If you\u2019re thinking more along the lines of port, the Aussies have their own version, which they call liqueur muscat and which tastes (deliciously) like sticky toffee pudding. I personally prefer tawny ports to sweeter, more brambly, late-bottled vintage ones \u2013 Morrisons has a really good 10-Year-Old Tawny (20%) in its The Best range, which is currently on offer at \u00a310 and tastes enticingly of salted caramel. And if you\u2019re wondering whether you should take along one of those seemingly endless new riffs on Irish cream, what can I say? Fifteen quid seems a fair amount to pay for a Clementine Gin Liqueur Snow Globe (at Marks &amp; Spencer), though it might be better stockpiling that for a Eurovision party. It\u2019s preferable, in any case, to the same store\u2019s Trifle Flavour Cream (\u00a310), which tastes spookily like a liquid Victoria sponge. Personally, I\u2019d stick to the Clementine &amp; Cranberry Bucks Fizz (4%), which is a definite improvement on the basic OJ version and a snip at its current price of \u00a34 a bottle. Four treats to take your host this Christmas Duca di Castelmonte Passito di Pantelleria 2017 \u00a311.99 (50cl) Lidl, 14.5%. This rich Sicilian dessert wine, with its heady scent of apricots and marmalade, is normally much pricier than this. Perfect with the Christmas pud. De Bortoli Sumptuously Rich Pudding Wine \u00a38.99 a half-bottle Aldi, 18%. The label may say pudding wine, but it basically tastes of Xmas pudding with a touch of sticky toffee pud and gingerbread thrown in. Outrageously good. Co-op Irresistible PX Sherry \u00a36 a half-bottle, 17%. Less for the mince pies, more for the Black Magic (or, better still, chocolate brownies), this ultra-sweet, raisiny sherry is too good to leave out for Santa. Kirk &amp; Sweeney 12-Year-Old Rum \u00a328 (on offer) Sainsbury\u2019s, \u00a336.95 Royal Mile Whiskies, 37.5%. Rum is supposed to be the new gin (I\u2019ll believe it when I spot as many bottles in friends\u2019 houses), but this handsomely bottled, fudgy rum from Dominica is a real treat. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve worked in a Path-connected building for over a decade, long enough to remember a time when it had smoking rooms. A couple of years back, I began to notice a guy sitting outside my building, wearing cargo shorts and a T-shirt, huffing a brick-sized vape while gaming on his phone. Summer turned to fall turned to winter, and still the shorts remained, his aloof pose untempered by the sleet or snow. He seemed to me to embody the apotheosis of Pathitude. For him, weather seemed an obsolete curio of a less-evolved time.</p> <p>Take a walk through Toronto\u2019s financial district and you probably won\u2019t realise that you stand atop the largest underground shopping complex in the world. You might see the occasional doorway at street level bearing the words \u201cRetail Concourse\u201d in a nondescript font, but for the most part the more than 100 entrances to this labyrinth, known as the Path, are accessible only from within the office towers.</p> <p>The stats certainly inspire awe, of a sort: 30km of networked passageways; 75 connected buildings; 1,200 stores, eateries, and services; 200,000 daily users; 4m sq ft feet of retail; C$1.7bn (\u00a31bn) in annual sales. But the Path is a monolith that at no point feels monolithic. When I asked a financial district-employed friend of mine how he felt about it, he could not muster a single feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b82d1c1fb126ae4a7840e0d6be72e7bce0d55f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b82d1c1fb126ae4a7840e0d6be72e7bce0d55f1/0_514_7680_4609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1bdccce83f95f66ce30c8e6d5259d90c1a62cd4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bdccce83f95f66ce30c8e6d5259d90c1a62cd4f/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Path comprises 30km of networked passageways; 75 connected buildings and 1,200 stores, eateries, and services.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"91f8a511cbdc66e84fb560dedef67b67cc309d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91f8a511cbdc66e84fb560dedef67b67cc309d25/0_0_7174_4785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Path comprises 30km of networked passageways; 75 connected buildings and 1,200 stores, eateries, and services.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings.

Functional. A convenience rather than a destination, which its transformation into ghost town on evenings and weekends reaffirms. It\u2019s largely beige in colour and in spirit.

People down here walk quickly, with a purpose in their step, whether they be power brokers or the support workers who service them. Rolling briefcases whirr along the marble floors. The morning rush hour introduces a crush of unidirectional movement from Union Station to the financial district; the workday\u2019s end reverses this.

Many of the eateries, from the much-loved independent Korean joint HoGa to the French macaron vendor Laduree or any of the 13 branches of Starbucks, roll out an array of airport-style, retractable-belted stanchions to tame the swarms. Groups of people perch around laptops, proving that if some merely go directly from the boardroom to the food court, the true alphas bring the boardroom to the food court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85b04592533e3f3ec4dc737938d06d27b1417e15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b04592533e3f3ec4dc737938d06d27b1417e15/0_190_7871_4723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The network includes 1,200 stores, eateries, and services.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The network includes 1,200 stores, eateries, and services.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The network includes 1,200 stores, eateries, and services. Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</p></li> </ul> <p>Across the world, these tunnel cities are spreading. Montreal\u2019s R\u00e9so system is slightly bigger than Toronto\u2019s Path, boasting 33km and 2,000 retail spaces, though in three disconnected sections. Sydney has one; Singapore, too; and Riyadh is building a pedestrian tunnel network above ground for the new King Abdullah Financial District.</p> <p>Helsinki has probably dug furthest, with more than 200km of tunnels spread across 500 disconnected spaces, though only a small fraction of it is open to the public, with the rest used for wastewater treatment, energy distribution and other infrastructure. Helsinki is also the most playfully designed: undulating cave walls painted white are festooned with the occasional vertical garden, and there is an underground museum, church, swimming pool, and hockey rink \u2013 just the sort of thing that gets brought up when people speak idealistically of the Nordic countries.</p> <p>But in terms of sheer continuous commercial distance, Toronto remains king. Though its magnitude suggests top-down urban planning, in reality the Path emerged patchwork-like over the course of a century. The first tunnel was built in 1900 between the T Eaton department store and its discount annex across the street (possibly in an effort to one-up Simpson\u2019s, its rival directly to the south). By 1917, five Eaton buildings were connected. In 1929, a tunnel connected Union Station and the newly-built Royal York Hotel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"937403453ef7f4ec841f0a2c430e2e5fde546df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937403453ef7f4ec841f0a2c430e2e5fde546df1/0_0_7412_4944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in the Path\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"783f3712bcc7cb699fbc0a0ed1f79c24f2e1f691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/783f3712bcc7cb699fbc0a0ed1f79c24f2e1f691/0_398_7911_4747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in the Path\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"34c7cf85927dd1bfd9825f57c1531abdc91a2a35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34c7cf85927dd1bfd9825f57c1531abdc91a2a35/0_197_7908_4745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shops in the Path\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But it was from 1954, when Scottish engineer Matthew Lawson was put in charge of city planning, that Path began to take shape. Lawson foresaw overcrowded sidewalks, as the newly growing financial district increasingly privileged massive lobbies over street-level retail. He envisioned a connected, subterranean network as a kind of <em>realpolitik</em> solution: below-grade retail was exempted from density restrictions, promoting expansion downward, and the city also agreed to split tunnel construction costs with the building owners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Path transformed what would otherwise be reasonably cheap and undesirable commercial basement real estate into some of the priciest in the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cost-splitting was revoked in 1976 by a reformist city council, hostile to such megaprojects, but by then the flurry of financial district construction had rendered it moot: Commerce Court West, First Canadian Place (still Canada\u2019s tallest office building) and the multitower Mies van der Rohe-designed Toronto-Dominion Centre each had its own underground shopping concourse, with further connections between buildings proliferating throughout the 1980s.</p> <p>The Path as we know it today was unified in 1995 by a thoroughly ineffective wayfinding system \u2013 small grey signs that only directed you to the building immediately adjacent. The ineffectiveness was partially by design. Property managers worried that if certain routes were encouraged over others, non-artery retail would suffer and rents would fall. And so commenced the tension between the Path\u2019s civic and commercial interests, between people trying to get from point A to point B and the property managers who wanted people shopping in their stores. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8b28db19b2a5257d565e91e7fcc7e655dd79bcf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b28db19b2a5257d565e91e7fcc7e655dd79bcf9/0_312_4935_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Santiago Calatrava-designed Brookfield Place office complex in Toronto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Santiago Calatrava-designed Brookfield Place office complex in Toronto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Santiago Calatrava-designed Brookfield Place office complex in Toronto. Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty</p></li> </ul> <p>A new wayfinding system has improved matters somewhat, but just as Berlin superclub Berghain forgoes mirrors (or reflective surfaces of any kind), the Path still forgoes the concepts of north, south, east, and west. The signs never explicitly tell you which way you\u2019re going, barring a few hard-to-find compasses on the ceiling. The psychic fencing has proved effective: show me a person who can effortlessly walk the two kilometres from the Toronto Coach Station to the waterfront and I will show you an obsessive.</p> <p>Some have wondered if more explicit nods to the compass would even do any good. Since its layout is dictated by the vertical architecture of the buildings above, only tenuous homage is paid to the street grid. And despite its pastiche of architectural styles, you\u2019re generally overcome by the crushing sameness of it all. The white Italian Carrara marble of First Canadian Place gives way to the Swedish Red Napoleon granite of Scotia Plaza, but there aren\u2019t really landmarks to sink the teeth of memory into, though there are at least 20 Tim Hortons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"741bcd1e297b0f0a1a2d721a57c073af9a830eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/741bcd1e297b0f0a1a2d721a57c073af9a830eae/184_1286_4581_6440/711.jpg\" alt=\"6,000 people are employed by the shops and services below Toronto.\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">6,000 people are employed by the shops and services below Toronto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, there are pockets of grandeur. Climbing up into the galleria of Brookfield Place\u2019s six-storey parabolic canopy could certainly be called grand. Similarly, entering the Royal York\u2019s ornate lobby from below, where duelling winding staircases rise along opposite halves of a large circular floor slice, verges on cinematic. Meanwhile, Van der Rohe\u2019s aesthetic exactitude shapes the passageways beneath the Toronto-Dominion Centre in arch-modernist style: shops with the glass panels, black aluminium and backlit white lettering selected by Mies, right down to the austere sans serif font. The rules were relaxed in the 1990s, however, ruffling the feathers of Bauhausian purists and peppering the window displays with all manner of multi-coloured graphical cringe.</p> <p>But for many the Path is a place to work. So what of those workers,some 6,000 of whom toil in the Path\u2019s sunless hallways? </p> <p>\u201cThe worst job I ever had was being a barista down there,\u201d said a friend who logged two years at the Path outpost of a local cafe chain. \u201cI would cry in the washroom a lot. It feels like a classist dystopian hellscape.</p> <p>\u201cAs a service worker you\u2019re essentially ignored by the business people. But there is a solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe traded food and drinks with other businesses. Janitors are assigned one hallway that they mop all day long, so you get to know them really well and build a bond because they\u2019re also mistreated or invisible.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve worked in a Path-connected building for over a decade, long enough to remember a time when it had smoking rooms. A couple of years back, I began to notice a guy sitting outside my building, wearing cargo shorts and a T-shirt, huffing a brick-sized vape while gaming on his phone. Summer turned to fall turned to winter, and still the shorts remained, his aloof pose untempered by the sleet or snow. He seemed to me to embody the apotheosis of Pathitude. For him, weather seemed an obsolete curio of a less-evolved time. Take a walk through Toronto\u2019s financial district and you probably won\u2019t realise that you stand atop the largest underground shopping complex in the world. You might see the occasional doorway at street level bearing the words \u201cRetail Concourse\u201d in a nondescript font, but for the most part the more than 100 entrances to this labyrinth, known as the Path, are accessible only from within the office towers. The stats certainly inspire awe, of a sort: 30km of networked passageways; 75 connected buildings; 1,200 stores, eateries, and services; 200,000 daily users; 4m sq ft feet of retail; C$1.7bn (\u00a31bn) in annual sales. But the Path is a monolith that at no point feels monolithic. When I asked a financial district-employed friend of mine how he felt about it, he could not muster a single feeling. The Path is a labyrinth comprising 30km of networked passageways and 75 connected buildings. Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian Unlike the ornate subways of Moscow or the macabre catacombs of Paris, the Path does not call out for attention. It is workmanlike. Functional. A convenience rather than a destination, which its transformation into ghost town on evenings and weekends reaffirms. It\u2019s largely beige in colour and in spirit. If the catacombs are Alien Sex Fiend, then the Path is Pearl Jam. It is not a place for wanderers. People down here walk quickly, with a purpose in their step, whether they be power brokers or the support workers who service them. Rolling briefcases whirr along the marble floors. The morning rush hour introduces a crush of unidirectional movement from Union Station to the financial district; the workday\u2019s end reverses this. Walter Benjamin and other members of the fl\u00e2neur class would grimace. Lunchtime is more chaotic, occasionally resembling a less intense Shibuya-style scramble. Many of the eateries, from the much-loved independent Korean joint HoGa to the French macaron vendor Laduree or any of the 13 branches of Starbucks, roll out an array of airport-style, retractable-belted stanchions to tame the swarms. Groups of people perch around laptops, proving that if some merely go directly from the boardroom to the food court, the true alphas bring the boardroom to the food court. The network includes 1,200 stores, eateries, and services. Photograph: Yuula Benivolski/The Guardian Across the world, these tunnel cities are spreading. Montreal\u2019s R\u00e9so system is slightly bigger than Toronto\u2019s Path, boasting 33km and 2,000 retail spaces, though in three disconnected sections. Sydney has one; Singapore, too; and Riyadh is building a pedestrian tunnel network above ground for the new King Abdullah Financial District. Helsinki has probably dug furthest, with more than 200km of tunnels spread across 500 disconnected spaces, though only a small fraction of it is open to the public, with the rest used for wastewater treatment, energy distribution and other infrastructure. Helsinki is also the most playfully designed: undulating cave walls painted white are festooned with the occasional vertical garden, and there is an underground museum, church, swimming pool, and hockey rink \u2013 just the sort of thing that gets brought up when people speak idealistically of the Nordic countries. But in terms of sheer continuous commercial distance, Toronto remains king. Though its magnitude suggests top-down urban planning, in reality the Path emerged patchwork-like over the course of a century. The first tunnel was built in 1900 between the T Eaton department store and its discount annex across the street (possibly in an effort to one-up Simpson\u2019s, its rival directly to the south). By 1917, five Eaton buildings were connected. In 1929, a tunnel connected Union Station and the newly-built Royal York Hotel. But it was from 1954, when Scottish engineer Matthew Lawson was put in charge of city planning, that Path began to take shape. Lawson foresaw overcrowded sidewalks, as the newly growing financial district increasingly privileged massive lobbies over street-level retail. He envisioned a connected, subterranean network as a kind of realpolitik solution: below-grade retail was exempted from density restrictions, promoting expansion downward, and the city also agreed to split tunnel construction costs with the building owners. The cost-splitting was revoked in 1976 by a reformist city council, hostile to such megaprojects, but by then the flurry of financial district construction had rendered it moot: Commerce Court West, First Canadian Place (still Canada\u2019s tallest office building) and the multitower Mies van der Rohe-designed Toronto-Dominion Centre each had its own underground shopping concourse, with further connections between buildings proliferating throughout the 1980s. The Path as we know it today was unified in 1995 by a thoroughly ineffective wayfinding system \u2013 small grey signs that only directed you to the building immediately adjacent. The ineffectiveness was partially by design. Property managers worried that if certain routes were encouraged over others, non-artery retail would suffer and rents would fall. And so commenced the tension between the Path\u2019s civic and commercial interests, between people trying to get from point A to point B and the property managers who wanted people shopping in their stores. The Santiago Calatrava-designed Brookfield Place office complex in Toronto. Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty A new wayfinding system has improved matters somewhat, but just as Berlin superclub Berghain forgoes mirrors (or reflective surfaces of any kind), the Path still forgoes the concepts of north, south, east, and west. The signs never explicitly tell you which way you\u2019re going, barring a few hard-to-find compasses on the ceiling. The psychic fencing has proved effective: show me a person who can effortlessly walk the two kilometres from the Toronto Coach Station to the waterfront and I will show you an obsessive. Some have wondered if more explicit nods to the compass would even do any good. Since its layout is dictated by the vertical architecture of the buildings above, only tenuous homage is paid to the street grid. And despite its pastiche of architectural styles, you\u2019re generally overcome by the crushing sameness of it all. The white Italian Carrara marble of First Canadian Place gives way to the Swedish Red Napoleon granite of Scotia Plaza, but there aren\u2019t really landmarks to sink the teeth of memory into, though there are at least 20 Tim Hortons. Still, there are pockets of grandeur. Climbing up into the galleria of Brookfield Place\u2019s six-storey parabolic canopy could certainly be called grand. Similarly, entering the Royal York\u2019s ornate lobby from below, where duelling winding staircases rise along opposite halves of a large circular floor slice, verges on cinematic. Meanwhile, Van der Rohe\u2019s aesthetic exactitude shapes the passageways beneath the Toronto-Dominion Centre in arch-modernist style: shops with the glass panels, black aluminium and backlit white lettering selected by Mies, right down to the austere sans serif font. The rules were relaxed in the 1990s, however, ruffling the feathers of Bauhausian purists and peppering the window displays with all manner of multi-coloured graphical cringe. But for many the Path is a place to work. So what of those workers,some 6,000 of whom toil in the Path\u2019s sunless hallways? \u201cThe worst job I ever had was being a barista down there,\u201d said a friend who logged two years at the Path outpost of a local cafe chain. \u201cI would cry in the washroom a lot. It feels like a classist dystopian hellscape. \u201cAs a service worker you\u2019re essentially ignored by the business people. But there is a solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe traded food and drinks with other businesses. Janitors are assigned one hallway that they mop all day long, so you get to know them really well and build a bond because they\u2019re also mistreated or invisible. In the winter I would go down when it was dark and leave when it was dark and wouldn\u2019t see the sun.\u201d Katie Whittaker, owner of the non-Path bar Thirsty and Miserable, used to work at an LCBO (the government-owned liquor retailer). \u201cWe sold lots of 375ml bottles of vodka to businessmen at the Royal Bank Plaza store,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would buy handfuls of them at once. Handy for GO Train commuting back to the \u2018burbs. Also easy to hide drinking in the office.\u201d In these and other ways, the Path feels less Jane Jacobs \u2013 the champion of messy street-level urbanism who adopted Toronto as her home \u2013 than Robert Moses, her arch nemesis from New York, albeit minus the wanton bulldozing and mass displacement of minority communities.

They sell instructions for these unofficial sets, which range from an epic \u201cHogwarts diorama\u201d to souped up Batmobiles. There are close to 20,000 MOC designs listed on BrickLink and fans fear this unauthorised creativity is vulnerable with \u201cBig Brother\u201d watching.</p> <p>But Lego, which sells \u00a34bn worth of plastic bricks a year, has batted away such concerns. Owning BrickLink is about \u201cstrengthening\u201d ties with its 1.1 million members not destroying them \u2013 not least given the company\u2019s overarching goal of fostering creativity.</p> <p>Lego\u2019s chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, says the site will continue to run independently from its US base. \u201cIt has been a very effective marketplace, so you don\u2019t want to interfere with that,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe will always listen to fans. This is about getting much closer and understanding what the community needs in order to continue expanding and thriving.\u201d</p> <p>Lego, which is controlled by the billionaire Kristiansen family, was forced into a major rethink in 2017 after suffering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/06/lego-sales-fall-growth-job-cuts\">a rare slump</a> in sales and profits. The Billund-based company confessed it had become too bureaucratic and its product development poor at a time when the toy industry is battling the internet for kids\u2019 attention.</p> <p>The toymaker has been investing in \u201cdigital play experiences\u201d, such as the Hidden Side series which combines its plastic bricks with an augmented reality app \u2013 effectively enabling children to bring their models to life. Recent toy sales suggest Lego is back on song, with Harry Potter-themed sets and a \u00a3160 Land Rover Defender kit among the most sought after toys this Christmas.</p> <p>Lego\u2019s 2017 wake-up call may explain the company\u2019s interest in a niche site like BrickLink which was started in 2000 by Dan Jezek (an AFOL who wanted to find others). In 2013 the site was sold to NXMH, a business owned by the Korean entrepreneur Jung-Ju \u2018Jay\u2019 Kim. The scale of transactions on the site is not known but over the years it has grown in stature, building a network of 10,000 sellers in 70 countries.</p> <p>The jury is still remains out though. \u201cThis is terrible news,\u201d writes Peppermint_M, in a thread on the Eurobricks forum. \u201cNothing good can come of a monopoly on brick sources.\u201d Another suggests it could spell restrictions for sellers and \u201cmight make many of them close their shops\u201d.</p> <p>But Minifigforlife owner Andrew Watts, who has been selling on BrickLink for nearly 17 years, is sanguine about the deal. Yes it gives Lego a stake in the secondhand market, he says, but eBay and Facebook are far bigger markets for used bricks. He suggests the biggest prize is the treasure trove of data provided by the site\u2019s passionate users \u2013 and also sees room for improvement because the site is hard for the uninitiated to use.</p> <p>\u201cSecondhand sales to AFOLs will give Lego quality data about what sells and how often,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThis information can improve its knowledge of what is popular and to perhaps bring back parts and themes that they had written off.\u201d</p> <p>There have been skirmishes between Lego and the strident AFOL community before, Watts adds. In 2004 Lego tweaked the colour of grey and brown bricks to make them more appealing to the children: \u201cTo this date this has been the change that infuriated the community the most.\u201d</p>",

They sell instructions for these unofficial sets, which range from an epic \u201cHogwarts diorama\u201d to souped up Batmobiles. There are close to 20,000 MOC designs listed on BrickLink and fans fear this unauthorised creativity is vulnerable with \u201cBig Brother\u201d watching. But Lego, which sells \u00a34bn worth of plastic bricks a year, has batted away such concerns. Owning BrickLink is about \u201cstrengthening\u201d ties with its 1.1 million members not destroying them \u2013 not least given the company\u2019s overarching goal of fostering creativity. Lego\u2019s chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, says the site will continue to run independently from its US base. \u201cIt has been a very effective marketplace, so you don\u2019t want to interfere with that,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe will always listen to fans. This is about getting much closer and understanding what the community needs in order to continue expanding and thriving.\u201d Lego, which is controlled by the billionaire Kristiansen family, was forced into a major rethink in 2017 after suffering a rare slump in sales and profits. The Billund-based company confessed it had become too bureaucratic and its product development poor at a time when the toy industry is battling the internet for kids\u2019 attention. The toymaker has been investing in \u201cdigital play experiences\u201d, such as the Hidden Side series which combines its plastic bricks with an augmented reality app \u2013 effectively enabling children to bring their models to life. Recent toy sales suggest Lego is back on song, with Harry Potter-themed sets and a \u00a3160 Land Rover Defender kit among the most sought after toys this Christmas. Lego\u2019s 2017 wake-up call may explain the company\u2019s interest in a niche site like BrickLink which was started in 2000 by Dan Jezek (an AFOL who wanted to find others). In 2013 the site was sold to NXMH, a business owned by the Korean entrepreneur Jung-Ju \u2018Jay\u2019 Kim. The scale of transactions on the site is not known but over the years it has grown in stature, building a network of 10,000 sellers in 70 countries. The jury is still remains out though. \u201cThis is terrible news,\u201d writes Peppermint_M, in a thread on the Eurobricks forum. \u201cNothing good can come of a monopoly on brick sources.\u201d Another suggests it could spell restrictions for sellers and \u201cmight make many of them close their shops\u201d. But Minifigforlife owner Andrew Watts, who has been selling on BrickLink for nearly 17 years, is sanguine about the deal. Yes it gives Lego a stake in the secondhand market, he says, but eBay and Facebook are far bigger markets for used bricks. He suggests the biggest prize is the treasure trove of data provided by the site\u2019s passionate users \u2013 and also sees room for improvement because the site is hard for the uninitiated to use. \u201cSecondhand sales to AFOLs will give Lego quality data about what sells and how often,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThis information can improve its knowledge of what is popular and to perhaps bring back parts and themes that they had written off.\u201d There have been skirmishes between Lego and the strident AFOL community before, Watts adds. In 2004 Lego tweaked the colour of grey and brown bricks to make them more appealing to the children: \u201cTo this date this has been the change that infuriated the community the most.\u201d",

Many people in Port Talbot have called for a contemporary gallery to be created with the Banksy as a centrepiece, and there has been criticism from some quarters that the Welsh government should be doing more to make this happen.</p> <p>Drakeford said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the things the Welsh government has done, there wouldn\u2019t be an exhibition of any sort. This is not the end of the road. There is a bigger debate about creating a new contemporary art gallery for Wales and how that should be done. There\u2019s a strong lobby from Port Talbot that it should be somewhere like there.</p> <p>\u201cThere are other people who prefer a different model in which we\u2019d have a dispersed collection that many people in many parts would enjoy. The future of the Banksy is caught up in that wider debate, which is why we haven\u2019t come to final conclusions.

      "bodyText": "The Welsh first minister has defended his government\u2019s handling of the festive Banksy work Season\u2019s Greetings, which is to be locked behind closed doors in a former police station after being briefly put on show to the public. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government had preserved the Banksy, which appeared on a steelworker\u2019s garage in Port Talbot just before last Christmas, and continued to work on the best way of making sure it is eventually seen by as many people as possible. In the summer the government paid for the Banksy to be moved to the former police station in the town centre and for three days this week Neath and Port Talbot opened the building to visitors. From 3pm on Friday, however, the doors were being closed again and the long-term future of the mural remains unclear. Many people in Port Talbot have called for a contemporary gallery to be created with the Banksy as a centrepiece, and there has been criticism from some quarters that the Welsh government should be doing more to make this happen. Drakeford said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the things the Welsh government has done, there wouldn\u2019t be an exhibition of any sort. This is not the end of the road. There is a bigger debate about creating a new contemporary art gallery for Wales and how that should be done. There\u2019s a strong lobby from Port Talbot that it should be somewhere like there. \u201cThere are other people who prefer a different model in which we\u2019d have a dispersed collection that many people in many parts would enjoy. The future of the Banksy is caught up in that wider debate, which is why we haven\u2019t come to final conclusions. In the meantime, we\u2019ve worked hard to preserve that painting.\u201d The Banksy appeared in Taibach, close to the Tata steelworks. From one angle, it shows a child in a bobble hat with a sled, apparently enjoying a snow shower and trying to catch the flakes on their tongue. But from another it becomes clear that what is falling on the child is ash. Banksy confirmed the work was his by releasing a video of the mural accompanied by the Christmas song Little Snowflake. The camera rises above the garage and shows Port Talbot\u2019s rooftops and the billowing chimneys of the steelworks and other industrial buildings. The art dealer John Brandler bought the Banksy from Ian Lewis, who owned the garage and thus the artwork, for a six-figure sum and promised it would stay in Port Talbot for at least three years. Brandler is frustrated that the immediate future of the piece remains unclear. He said: \u201cIt is my guess that the authorities are saying we opened it to the public but only \u2018X\u2019 people came so there\u2019s no point in opening a museum.

If all goes to plan at Westminster, the European parliament will ratify the withdrawal agreement on 29 January 2020, and Brexit will happen two days later. What happens on 31 January? Brexit day: after 11pm on 31 January, revoking article 50, the formal process of exiting the EU, is no longer possible. The UK will have passed the point of no return and will no longer be a member of the EU. What will be different? Life will generally carry on the same, as the UK will enter an 11-month transition period, to allow both the government and EU to work out what the future relationship should be. The UK will remain in the customs union and the single market, meaning trade will carry on as normal.

      "body": "<p>Sitting down to watch Top of the Pops on Christmas Day with your family is a festive tradition of sorts. Less depressing than the Queen\u2019s Speech, funnier than Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys, it\u2019s on at the perfect time of 11.35am \u2013 after breakfast, before lunch, but best get that special Christmas biscuit tin out just in case. To help avoid any awkward family chat, here\u2019s how to explain all the acts to your grandparents.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/james-blunt\">James Blunt</a></strong> You remember him: nice posh bloke, always on Radio 2. Had that huge hit 15 years ago and has refused to go away ever since. He\u2019s 20 years older than anyone else on this show, so is probably having the other acts explained to him in the exact same way.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/03/dermot-kennedy-review-hammersmith-apollo-london\">Dermot Kennedy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/24/jack-savoretti-review-o2-academy-glasgow\">Jack Savoretti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/28/tom-walker-what-a-time-to-be-alive-review-relentless-records-love-island-brit-award\">Tom Walker</a></strong> Looking at the Christmas TOTP lineup you\u2019d think that pop in 2019 was dominated by white men with guitars. It wasn\u2019t. Interestingly, Dermot Kennedy, Jack Savoretti and Tom Walker aren\u2019t exactly the same person \u2013 look, Tom is wearing a hat! Dermot is Irish! Jack is the one that Mum fancies! OK, no, our mistake. They\u2019re all just a slight variation on James Blunt.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/11/the-script-no-sound-without-silence\">The Script</a></strong> You know the white men with guitars we just described? Put them in a band and that\u2019s the Script. Inexplicably popular, the frontman, Danny-from-the-Script, was a judge on The Voice; the other two blokes you wouldn\u2019t be able to pick out of a lineup if they mugged you and left their driving licences behind.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/10/lewis-capaldi-theyre-screaming-americas-sweetheart-at-me-its-wild\">Lewis Capaldi</a></strong> Honestly, we promise: there <em>was </em>more to pop in 2019 than white men with guitars. Lewis Capaldi is like Cliff Richard but if he knew \u201cthe social medias\u201d. Like Ed Sheeran but put through a hot wash. Like a meme got out of control and was somehow made human. No, Nan, we\u2019ll cover memes later.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/mabel-interview-boris-johnson-its-not-a-world-that-i-want-to-be-a-part-of\">Mabel</a></strong> Mabel should be huge: her mum is a pop legend (Neneh Cherry!), Don\u2019t Call Me Up is a banger and she\u2019s written this year\u2019s most depressing Christmas song, Loneliest Time of the Year. And yet \u2026 here she is, on the Christmas TOTP with a load of B-listers. Fingers crossed she\u2019ll be too big for all this in 2020.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/14/jax-jones-instruction-track-of-week\">Jax Jones</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/03/this-weeks-new-tracks\">Ella Henderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/11/sigala-surges-71-places-to-score-this-weeks-uk-chart-no-1\">Sigala</a> f</strong><strong>t Becky Hill</strong> As a rule, most songs fit into one of two categories: massive party bangers and songs that make you cry. It\u2019s called the Mariah Carey rule. But now, pop has a mysterious third category: playlist filler. Songs that sound the same, but with different reality show also-rans on vocals. You hear them everywhere \u2013 local radio, Spotify playlists, in lifts, in shops \u2013 but they\u2019re so generic, you will never be able to sing them back or name them. Conveniently, Becky Hill and Ella Henderson have made tracks with both Jax Jones and Sigala, so this booking is extremely cost-effective.</p>",

Less depressing than the Queen\u2019s Speech, funnier than Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys, it\u2019s on at the perfect time of 11.35am \u2013 after breakfast, before lunch, but best get that special Christmas biscuit tin out just in case. To help avoid any awkward family chat, here\u2019s how to explain all the acts to your grandparents. James Blunt You remember him: nice posh bloke, always on Radio 2. Had that huge hit 15 years ago and has refused to go away ever since. He\u2019s 20 years older than anyone else on this show, so is probably having the other acts explained to him in the exact same way. Dermot Kennedy, Jack Savoretti and Tom Walker Looking at the Christmas TOTP lineup you\u2019d think that pop in 2019 was dominated by white men with guitars. It wasn\u2019t. Interestingly, Dermot Kennedy, Jack Savoretti and Tom Walker aren\u2019t exactly the same person \u2013 look, Tom is wearing a hat! Dermot is Irish! Jack is the one that Mum fancies! OK, no, our mistake. They\u2019re all just a slight variation on James Blunt. The Script You know the white men with guitars we just described? Put them in a band and that\u2019s the Script. Inexplicably popular, the frontman, Danny-from-the-Script, was a judge on The Voice; the other two blokes you wouldn\u2019t be able to pick out of a lineup if they mugged you and left their driving licences behind. Lewis Capaldi Honestly, we promise: there was more to pop in 2019 than white men with guitars. Lewis Capaldi is like Cliff Richard but if he knew \u201cthe social medias\u201d. Like Ed Sheeran but put through a hot wash. Like a meme got out of control and was somehow made human. No, Nan, we\u2019ll cover memes later. Mabel Mabel should be huge: her mum is a pop legend (Neneh Cherry!), Don\u2019t Call Me Up is a banger and she\u2019s written this year\u2019s most depressing Christmas song, Loneliest Time of the Year. And yet \u2026 here she is, on the Christmas TOTP with a load of B-listers. Fingers crossed she\u2019ll be too big for all this in 2020. Jax Jones &amp; Ella Henderson, Sigala ft Becky Hill As a rule, most songs fit into one of two categories: massive party bangers and songs that make you cry. It\u2019s called the Mariah Carey rule. But now, pop has a mysterious third category: playlist filler. Songs that sound the same, but with different reality show also-rans on vocals. You hear them everywhere \u2013 local radio, Spotify playlists, in lifts, in shops \u2013 but they\u2019re so generic, you will never be able to sing them back or name them. Conveniently, Becky Hill and Ella Henderson have made tracks with both Jax Jones and Sigala, so this booking is extremely cost-effective.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Under normal circumstances, it would be considered a huge breach of etiquette to let you know that yet again I have been overlooked in the New Year\u2019s honours list before its publication. An astonishing omission, I agree, but there you are. But with the announcement of Nicky Morgan\u2019s peerage, I feel that the rules have already been broken and I might as well come clean now. Because exactly when the once and present culture secretary first discovered she was going to be made a baroness is now a matter of some confusion.</p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say Morgan has been on a bit of a journey. Shortly after the referendum she was one of the loudest voices for remain on the Tory benches, then about a year ago she almost overnight became a passionate leaver. But it was when she, having overseen the internal review into a grant awarded to Boris Johnson\u2019s friend Jennifer Arcuri, concluded \u2013 after almost no investigation \u2013 that the prime minister had behaved with total propriety, that I wrote in a sketch that the only possible explanation for her transformation was that she had been offered a peerage.</p> <p>Morgan insisted otherwise. She said exactly the same at an election poster campaign launch I attended in late November. Asked outright if she had been offered a peerage or some other job in government in return for being the only woman allowed out to face the media \u2013 despite having told her constituents that she wouldn\u2019t be seeking re-election as an MP because she wanted to spend more time with her family \u2013 Morgan categorically said no on both counts.</p> <p>So she must be more amazed than anyone to find that her peerage has been rushed through in what would otherwise be record time, and for her to find herself part of the people\u2019s government as an unelected cabinet minister. The Lords move in mysterious ways.</p> <h2><strong>Tue</strong>s<strong>day</strong></h2> <p>The election has had a disastrous effect on the haul of Christmas cards from MPs the lobby team has received this year. Theresa May always used to send one to all of us \u2013 even me \u2013 but this year Johnson has not bothered to put any of us on his list. Maybe he spilled wine on our batch of cards. The only party leader to have bothered to send out cards \u2013 though not to me \u2013 has been Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>But as he sent two to one of the team by mistake, I have claimed one for my desk. Otherwise it has been incredibly thin pickings, mostly from MPs who should know better. Liz Truss\u2019s card is a picture of ... Liz Truss, dressed in a Santa hat standing in front of a few casks of whisky. In what parallel universe was that ever a good idea?</p> <p>Still, no one can beat the Tory MP Nigel Evans for narcissism. His card features a Christmas tree with 21 baubles on it. Each one of which features a different picture of Nigel Evans. And that\u2019s just for starters. On the inside there\u2019s another photo of Nigel, this time with the anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray \u2013 Nigel the Brexiter single-handedly uniting the country \u2013 and on the back there are four more photos of Nigel. Three of him with other random MPs and one of him on his own. I\u2019d suggest that what Nigel really needs for Christmas is several sessions working on his low self-esteem with a therapist.</p> <p>The classiest card came from the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who has a lovely photo of his dog on the front. A dog is always a good substitute for not having a personality. My wife\u2019s and my best ever Christmas card was of our dog looking miserable in a blue Santa hat below the words \u201cHappy Fucking Christmas\u201d. Even my Mum loved it.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve always given a swerve to the Christmas drinks for lobby journalists at No 10. I don\u2019t drink, I am going deaf, I am socially gauche and find parties an ordeal at the best of times. And one where I\u2019m trying to avoid a prime minister I\u2019ve spent most of the year satirising comes with an added government health warning. But this year I relented. I was curious to see the inside of Downing Street \u2013 I\u2019ve only previously been allowed in through the tradesmen\u2019s entrance for joint press conferences \u2013 and wanted to observe Johnson up close in his natural habitat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/the-world-king-doesnt-let-anyone-spoil-his-big-day-not-even-the-queen\">The world king doesn't let anyone spoil his big day, not even the Queen | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having dumped my coat and phone and been ushered to an upstair reception room, I milled around happily nattering to friends and colleagues, while rather wondering if Johnson was ever going to show his face. The first sign of activity came about half an hour before the party was due to end, when Dominic Cummings appeared in a shirt that was unbuttoned almost to the waist \u2013 think a latter-day Adam Ant, only without the hair or the looks \u2013 and swaggered across the room. He then lounged against a wall and held court, as a swarm of hacks buzzed round him. For someone who has always said he prefers to lurk in the shadows, he gave a good impression of loving the attention.</p> <p>Johnson bumbled in shortly afterwards and gave speech. It was meant to be funny, but was laced with passive-aggression. His real message was that he didn\u2019t need any of us any more. Cheerleaders would be rewarded and critics frozen out. The media was now just another arm of the state. The people\u2019s lobby for the people\u2019s government. He then mingled for a bit, but he didn\u2019t pull nearly as large a crowd as Classic Dom. It wasn\u2019t hard to see where the real power lay.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>How much is too much? What is the tipping point between merely earning an acceptably large amount of money and having an income that is clearly excessive?</p> <p>This, I should point out, is an entirely academic question for me \u2013 it probably makes me a bad person, but I could happily earn a lot more without feeling too guilty \u2013 but it might just be one that keeps Denise Coates awake at night. And if it doesn\u2019t, then maybe it should. Coates is the boss of the gambling firm Bet365 and this week it was revealed that she is the UK\u2019s largest earner with an income for the last year of \u00a3323m. Or \u00a337,000 per hour.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t know where to start with that kind of cash. I don\u2019t want to move house, the car works just fine and once I\u2019d bought a few ceramics, some rare books and a new TV I\u2019d be pretty much done.</p> <p>But apart from the staggering sums involved, there\u2019s also the manner in which Coates earns her money. For some of Bet365\u2019s profits will have been generated from problem gamblers. People will have ended up in debt, marriages will have been destroyed and some may have even have taken their own lives. To assuage any guilt the company may feel towards its customers, Bet365 last year donated \u00a3868,000 to gambling charities. So we now know that Coates spends about one day a year worrying about the devastation her business can cause in order that none of her employees ever have to give it a second thought. Leading from the top. But I guess it\u2019s her money, she\u2019s earned it and she can do what she likes with it.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>So that\u2019s just about it from me. Once I\u2019ve finished today\u2019s sketch I will be off on hols. The last year has been pretty much full on and I could do with a break. I\u2019m also hoping that my flu jab keeps doing the business as my wife has been laid up in bed feeling wretched for a week now; if it does, it will be the best \u00a312.99 I\u2019ve spent all year.</p> <p>It will also be the first Christmas we\u2019ve ever spent without our daughter \u2013 her flight back to the US was not without incident as not only did the airline lose her bags, we also managed to drop her at the wrong airport: not our finest hour \u2013 but our son and his girlfriend are coming to stay so we can\u2019t moan too much. Mostly, though, I intend to do as little as humanly possible. Just spend time reconnecting with those I love and watching Spurs. I regret to say that after recent results I can already feel myself being drawn to the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho dark side. I\u2019m becoming the fan I despise. Whoops. I clearly am that shallow.</p> <p>The best present I could receive, though, would be to be given a break from the nightmares that dog my sleep almost every night. This morning I woke from a long dream about trying to bury bodies that kept rising up from the ground. Much more of this and I will turn into Dominic Raab. It\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve seen my therapist due to work mania: I think we\u2019re going to have a lot of work to do in the new year. So thanks for reading me this year. Your interest, feedback and support means a lot to me. And if you\u2019d like to talk to me in person and donate to the Guardian\u2019s charity appeal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/20/guardian-and-observer-charity-telethon-call-our-writers-to-donate\">I will be on the phone desk between 10am and 12pm on Saturday</a>. In the meantime, see you on the other side and have a fab Boris-free Xmas.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Good feedback is specific, timely and actionable, therefore the Guardian\u2019s Digital team decided to distill and centralise the information coming from Amazon Web Services. Whilst we have now started using AWS StackSets for other purposes, one of our first applications was aggregating the security reports from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/\">Trusted Advisor</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>What is Trusted Advisor and why is it awesome?</strong></p> \n<p>Trusted Advisor is an optimisation tool for AWS, with an entire section dedicated to security. It is a good place to get started and we use it to check all our S3 bucket configurations.</p> \n<p>Trusted Advisor will also flag open or overly permissive <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html\">security groups</a>. Security groups are the virtual firewalls of AWS and you can use them to control the traffic to your instances.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>a system should only be able to access the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>If you think you have locked down your Security Groups and Trusted Advisor is findings false positives, be aware that if a security group has more than one rule for a specific port, then it is the <strong>most permissive rule</strong> that will be applied. Trusted Advisor helped us uncover and remove some duplicated rules. You may also find it necessary to delete overly permissive rules after creating rules that are more restrictive.</p> \n<p>Trusted Advisor can help developers adhere to the principle of least-privilege. This means a system should only be able to access the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.</p> \n<p><strong>Why did we need to aggregate reports?</strong></p> \n<p>Most of our infrastructure is held in AWS, divided across many accounts that are owned and managed by different development teams. Reviewing the Trusted Advisor reports for each account by logging into the console would be a long and repetitive task for anyone to be attempting on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>Centrally monitoring accounts simplifies the task of checking, and can also widen access to the reports and findings, which hopefully empowers more developers to raise questions or take corrective actions.</p> \n<p><strong>Getting started with AWS StackSets</strong></p> \n<p>AWS StackSets are not a security tool directly, but they are a tool that can help you on your quest towards improving AWS security, or at least your AWS monitoring. In the context of AWS, a stack is a collection of resources that can be managed as a single unit. StackSets are a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">CloudFormation</a> tool that extends the functionality of stacks by allowing the creation, update, or deletion of stacks across multiple accounts.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html\">initial setup</a> of a StackSet is quite manual, however if you think you will use more than one StackSet it is definitely worth doing.</p> \n<p>You will need to select one of your accounts to become the StackSet Administrator and give it a <em>stackset-admin</em> role. The other accounts will require a <em>stackset-target</em> role. The <em>stackset-admin</em> can also be a <em>stackset-target</em> for itself, which is fun.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f62f69ad78e62dc342c16d790c9c54f78cde5dc0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62f69ad78e62dc342c16d790c9c54f78cde5dc0/0_0_2808_1140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"diagrams of AWS accounts and the stacks required to establish a trusted relationship and then resources being created using a StackSet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adding roles to AWS accounts that establish a trusted relationship, then create resources using a StackSet</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Whalen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Be aware that whichever account you have made the <em>stackset-admin</em> now holds incredible power over every <em>stackset-target</em>, so choose it wisely and consider how to minimise the risks.</p> \n<p>Creating a trusted relationship between accounts may weaken or break some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/real-world-software-security-lessons\">security controls</a> that are currently in place, so consider where in the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2044/\">sandboxing lifecycle</a> you are and what trade-offs you are willing to make.</p> \n<p>A dedicated account that is only used for StackSet administration is one mitigation we have in place. Developers can request access to the account as needed and relinquish permissions when they are done.</p> \n<p>Working with StackSets is also a good opportunity to pair on deployment with someone. Talking someone through each step as you do it is a great opportunity to share knowledge, along with letting them double-check your work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cfee56d3-053e-46e7-9d03-ec0704b3d476\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Where can I find open positions?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Apply for one of our open positions <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/careers/digital-development/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can I expect from the interview process?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process. Similar to other organisations, there is a CV screening, phone interview, coding exercise and a face to face interview. Read more about what to expect and apply now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2019/apr/26/applying-to-the-guardians-digital-department\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>StackSets in practice</strong></p> \n<p>We used StackSets to create a role in each of our accounts that our centralised tool (Security HQ) can assume. The role has the required permissions for the services we want to request information from with API calls.</p> \n<p>If we want to expand the permissions so we can integrate more services with Security HQ we can use the StackSet to update all of the roles at once with a single CloudFormation change.</p> \n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p> \n<p>StackSets can open you up to a new form of CloudFormation drift, as nothing prevents a stack that is part of a StackSet from being modified or deleted from within the account. However, is possible to perform <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html\">drift detection</a> on a StackSet so you can at least identify which stacks have been modified.</p> \n<p>Since we were creating stacks in accounts that may have other teams managing them, we found it helpful to add an \u2018Owner\u2019 tag to resources created by the StackSet. This gives teams some guidance on who to ask about strange roles and resources suddenly appearing in their accounts.</p> \n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> \n<p>If you are using one or more cloud platforms, it is worth investigating ways to centrally audit and monitor your environment. StackSets and Trusted Advisor, along with some internal tooling for aggregating and enriching reports, has helped standardise security checks across our AWS accounts and make them accessible in a single location, rather than requiring someone to check each account.</p> \n<p>Finally, if we are giving developers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2015/jan/05/delivering-continuous-delivery-continuously\">ownership of building and deploying</a> our infrastructure we should be giving them ownership of securing it. We should aim for a culture where we share security expertise and responsibility the same ways we share operations expertise and responsibility.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Good feedback is specific, timely and actionable, therefore the Guardian\u2019s Digital team decided to distill and centralise the information coming from Amazon Web Services. Whilst we have now started using AWS StackSets for other purposes, one of our first applications was aggregating the security reports from Trusted Advisor. What is Trusted Advisor and why is it awesome? Trusted Advisor is an optimisation tool for AWS, with an entire section dedicated to security. It is a good place to get started and we use it to check all our S3 bucket configurations. Trusted Advisor will also flag open or overly permissive security groups. Security groups are the virtual firewalls of AWS and you can use them to control the traffic to your instances. a system should only be able to access the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose If you think you have locked down your Security Groups and Trusted Advisor is findings false positives, be aware that if a security group has more than one rule for a specific port, then it is the most permissive rule that will be applied. Trusted Advisor helped us uncover and remove some duplicated rules. You may also find it necessary to delete overly permissive rules after creating rules that are more restrictive. Trusted Advisor can help developers adhere to the principle of least-privilege. This means a system should only be able to access the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose. Why did we need to aggregate reports? Most of our infrastructure is held in AWS, divided across many accounts that are owned and managed by different development teams. Reviewing the Trusted Advisor reports for each account by logging into the console would be a long and repetitive task for anyone to be attempting on a regular basis. Centrally monitoring accounts simplifies the task of checking, and can also widen access to the reports and findings, which hopefully empowers more developers to raise questions or take corrective actions. Getting started with AWS StackSets AWS StackSets are not a security tool directly, but they are a tool that can help you on your quest towards improving AWS security, or at least your AWS monitoring. In the context of AWS, a stack is a collection of resources that can be managed as a single unit. StackSets are a CloudFormation tool that extends the functionality of stacks by allowing the creation, update, or deletion of stacks across multiple accounts. The initial setup of a StackSet is quite manual, however if you think you will use more than one StackSet it is definitely worth doing. You will need to select one of your accounts to become the StackSet Administrator and give it a stackset-admin role. The other accounts will require a stackset-target role. The stackset-admin can also be a stackset-target for itself, which is fun. Be aware that whichever account you have made the stackset-admin now holds incredible power over every stackset-target, so choose it wisely and consider how to minimise the risks. Creating a trusted relationship between accounts may weaken or break some of the security controls that are currently in place, so consider where in the sandboxing lifecycle you are and what trade-offs you are willing to make. A dedicated account that is only used for StackSet administration is one mitigation we have in place. Developers can request access to the account as needed and relinquish permissions when they are done. Working with StackSets is also a good opportunity to pair on deployment with someone. Talking someone through each step as you do it is a great opportunity to share knowledge, along with letting them double-check your work. StackSets in practice We used StackSets to create a role in each of our accounts that our centralised tool (Security HQ) can assume. The role has the required permissions for the services we want to request information from with API calls. If we want to expand the permissions so we can integrate more services with Security HQ we can use the StackSet to update all of the roles at once with a single CloudFormation change. Challenges StackSets can open you up to a new form of CloudFormation drift, as nothing prevents a stack that is part of a StackSet from being modified or deleted from within the account. However, is possible to perform drift detection on a StackSet so you can at least identify which stacks have been modified. Since we were creating stacks in accounts that may have other teams managing them, we found it helpful to add an \u2018Owner\u2019 tag to resources created by the StackSet. This gives teams some guidance on who to ask about strange roles and resources suddenly appearing in their accounts. Conclusion If you are using one or more cloud platforms, it is worth investigating ways to centrally audit and monitor your environment. StackSets and Trusted Advisor, along with some internal tooling for aggregating and enriching reports, has helped standardise security checks across our AWS accounts and make them accessible in a single location, rather than requiring someone to check each account. Finally, if we are giving developers ownership of building and deploying our infrastructure we should be giving them ownership of securing it. We should aim for a culture where we share security expertise and responsibility the same ways we share operations expertise and responsibility.",

Shea is a far-right figure who holds extremist Christian, nationalist and Islamophobic beliefs. The report said it had made the judgment over terrorism by his actions before and during an armed takeover and standoff at the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016 in Oregon. The report further contends that in a document entitled the Biblical Basis for War, Shea \u201cadvocated the replacement of US democracy with a theocracy and the killing of all males who do not agree\u201d. In its conclusion, while commenting that Shea is not an \u201cimminent direct threat \u2026 it is more probable than not that Representative Shea is likely to plan, direct and engage in additional future conflicts that could carry with them significant risk of bloodshed and loss of life\u201d. It adds: \u201cRepresentative Shea presents a present and growing threat of risk to others through political violence.\u201d In response to the report, the Washington Republican state legislative minority leader, JT Wilcox, announced on Twitter that Shea had been suspended from the house Republican caucus. The report was commissioned by the house and produced by an outside agency, the Rampart Group, following reporting from the Guardian and other local and national outlets on Shea\u2019s activities. It says Shea \u201cplanned the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge; engaged in the conflict by directing Cows (Coalition of Western States) members and militias in support of the takeover; and traveled to Burns, Oregon, and met with refuge armed occupiers contrary to appeals and warnings from law enforcement and Oregon state elected officials\u201d. The occupation of the wildlife refuge near Burns lasted 41 days in January and February 2016. During that time one of the occupiers, LaVoy Finicum, was shot dead at a roadblock by Oregon state police. The report says that Shea \u201cparticipated in a total of four meetings with [occupation leader] Ammon Bundy that took place within three to five days in advance of the armed takeover\u201d, meetings which were corroborated by three witnesses. The report implicates other Republican politicians from western states in Shea\u2019s activities during the occupation. On the first day of the occupation, Shea circulated a \u201cmilitary style operations plan\u201d, codenamed \u201cOperation Cold Reality\u201d, via encrypted email to Cows members. They included the Idaho state representative Heather Scott, the Nevada assemblywoman Michele Fiore, Shea associates Anthony Bosworth and Jack Robertson, and Anne Byrd, whose husband, Barry, is the pastor for the secretive, patriot movement-aligned Marble community church in Stevens county, Washington. Shea\u2019s instructions to members of the network included directions to \u201cconduct reconnaissance \u2026 collect intelligence on law enforcement and government operations \u2026 establish counterintelligence and counter-recon teams\u201d. A major target was the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Shea set out the goal of \u201cputting pressure on federal, state and local officials to address BLM tyranny\u201d, the report said. He continued to communicate with this network via email throughout the occupation. Bosworth later directly participated in the occupation of the federal facility under Shea\u2019s instructions, where he \u201clikely committed criminal acts\u201d including the theft of surveillance cameras. The report further details Shea\u2019s extensive participation in other militant patriot movement activities, including two more confrontations with the federal government \u2013 at Bunkerville, Nevada, and Priest River, Idaho. At Bunkerville in 2014, when the Bundy family and their supporters staged an armed confrontation with federal authorities over unpaid grazing fees, the report says Shea first despatched Bosworth to the area, issued a call to arms so that others in the patriot movement would make the journey, and eventually traveled there himself . At this time he also formed the Coalition of Western States, a group of patriot movement-friendly legislators and activists. Throughout the Bunkerville incident, says the report, his actions revealed \u201cevidence of his planning and promoting political violence against employees of the US government and law enforcement officers who were lawfully attempting to execute a federal court order\u201d. The report accuses Shea of participating in or condoning intimidation of political opponents, government officials, and minorities. The evidence for this includes chats between Shea and his associates first reported in the Guardian. It also alleges that Shea engaged in counter-surveillance of law enforcement agencies. At one point Shea emailed a \u201cdetailed extensive law enforcement confidential information laying out the command and control structure of Washington state law enforcement agencies\u201d, including \u201crosters of local FBI joint terrorism taskforce (JTTF) agents, Swat team member lists complete with names and badge numbers and the joint harbor operations command (JHOC) building schematics\u201d.

The landmark ruling is likely to send shockwaves through the French business world. It is the first time managers have been held criminally responsible for implementing a general strategy of bullying even if they had not dealt directly with the staff involved. The former state-owned firm, which has since been rebrandedas Orange, was given the maximum fine of \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000). The ex-chief executive Didier Lombard, his former deputy Louis-Pierre Wenes and the human resources director Olivier Barberot were each given a one-year sentence, with eight months suspended, and fined \u20ac15,000. They were found guilty for offences that took place in 2007 and 2008 when cost-cutting plans were put in place. Lombard\u2019s lawyer said he would appeal. The court heard harrowing accounts of what one employee had called a terrifying management strategy to destabilise workers. Families described systematic psychological abuse against staff as bosses focused ruthlessly on cost-cutting and job cuts. Between 2008 and 2009, 35 employees killed themselves. The company had been privatised and was undertaking a restructuring plan during which bosses set out to cut more than a fifth of the workforce \u2013 more than 22,000 jobs. The investigation focused on the cases of 39 employees, 19 of whom killed themselves, 12 who attempted to, and eight who suffered from acute depression or were signed off sick as a result of the pressure. Many of the workers, including one who jumped out of a fifth-floor window in front of her colleagues, left notes expressing deep unhappiness at work or saying the company had made their lives unbearable. In July 2009, a 51-year-old technician from Marseille killed himself, leaving a letter accusing bosses of \u201cmanagement by terror\u201d. No\u00e9mie Louvradoux had told the court how her father, R\u00e9my Louvradoux, a 57-year-old public sector worker at France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, killed himself days before her 18th birthday.

He lived in the Paris area but was relocated to Besan\u00e7on, 280 miles (450km) from his family, and his tasks were never defined. \u201cImagine the isolation I felt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was as if I was nothing \u2026 a parasite.\u201d The widow of Michel Bugead, another worker who killed himself, said he had written by email to management to express concerns. She said he, like many others, \u201cwas very attached to the company which had allowed him to rise up the ladder in society\u201d. Lombard denied management bore any responsibility for the deaths. He denied saying in 2006 that he would \u201cget people to leave one way or another, either through the window or the door\u201d. He told the court: \u201cThe transformations a business has to go through aren\u2019t pleasant, that\u2019s just the way it is, there\u2019s nothing I could have done.\u201d Lombard, who was forced to step down in 2010, a few months after the suicides became headline news, argued that he was battling to save France T\u00e9l\u00e9com from bankruptcy after its privatisation in 2004. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

God forbid the idea of waiting longer in the morning for their posh coffee.\u201d Then there was Owen Smith, in an Observer interview from the year before, deliberately taking journalist Daniel Boffey to a local cafe to paint this scene: after receiving what he chooses to call a \u201cfrothy coffee\u201d (a cappuccino), Smith tells the interviewer, \u201cI tell you it is the first time I have ever been given little biscuits and a posh cup in here \u2026 Seriously, I would have a mug normally\u201d \u2013 expressing his anxiety that the mere act of drinking from a cup would make him look out of touch. Can anyone in Labour please tell me what hot beverages the working poor are allowed to drink without accidentally transmogrifying into the metropolitan yuppie elite? Is it just thinned-down Bovril served in a chipped mug that says, \u201cEY UP\u201d across the brim? A sausage on the side for dipping? PG Tips from a teabag that your dad\u2019s already squeezed five meek little cups out of? Drips of tar collected off the Tyne bridge and thinned down with rain water? The condensation from the wall of an outdoor toilet, warmed in a pan and drunk in the morning? What? It\u2019s been a while since I left the grim grey north but I still vaguely remember hot water being there, and milk, and alternative milks, and the concept of frothing those alternative milks to serve with an espresso shot, and, like, green tea. I can\u2019t help but feel that these weak culture-war stabs at aligning with the crumbling remains of the \u201cred wall\u201d by suggesting a cortado is a bit beyond people who live there is, you know, actually incredibly condescending. You know Costa exists beyond the M25, right, yes? You know that getting mad at Twinings being served in a London borough where 38% of children are living in poverty is perhaps not the exquisite own you think it is? Come back to us, Workington man, and we\u2019ll pretend we don\u2019t know the difference between a latte and an americano! It\u2019s either that or the Liberal Democrats offer you a \u201ccoffee wallet\u201d, while the Conservatives just stick with Kenco and Brexit. Difficult choices in the bleak years ahead. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant",

      "body": "<p>MI5\u2019s partially secret policy allowing agents and informants to participate in serious crimes is lawful, judges have ruled by a three-to-two majority.</p> <p>In a 56-page judgment, the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), which hears legal complaints about the intelligence agencies, declared that the guidelines do not breach human rights or grant absolute immunity to those who commit offences such as murder or torture.</p> <p>It is the first time the IPT has published dissenting judgments, both of which in this case are highly critical of the statutory framework surrounding the handling of agents. Many of the key arguments turned on the exploitation of informants within the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles.</p> <p>The coalition of civil liberty groups that brought the challenge \u2013 Reprieve, the Pat Finucane Centre, Privacy International and the Committee for the Administration of Justice \u2013 announced immediately they would appeal.</p> <p>Opening the majority judgment, Lord Justice Singh, Lord Boyd and Sir Richard McLaughlin acknowledged: \u201cThis case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers for the civil liberty organisations argued that what is known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/04/mi5-sought-immunity-for-agents-criminal-acts-tribunal-told\">third direction</a>\u201d \u2013 guidelines permitting agents to become involved in criminal conduct, which were revealed in March 2018 \u2013 were illegal.</p> <p>Crucial details of the guidelines specifying whether there are limits on such criminal activity remain secret. Part of the IPT hearing was held behind closed doors with the media and lawyers for the claimants excluded. The tribunal has also published a secret or \u201cclosed\u201d version of its final judgment.</p> <p>Explaining that the third direction guidelines are still not published in full, the majority judgment states: \u201cFor the reasons which are set out in our closed judgment, there is no more of the text of the guidelines which can properly be put into the public domain.\u201d</p> <p>Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe IPT\u2019s knife-edge judgment, with unprecedented published dissenting opinions, shows just how dubious the government\u2019s secret policy is. Our security services play a vital role in keeping this country safe, but history has shown us time and again the need for proper oversight and common sense limits on what agents can do in the public\u2019s name.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Ilia Siatitsa, a legal officer at Privacy International, said: \u201cToday the investigatory powers tribunal decided that MI5 can secretly give informants permission to commit grave crimes in the UK, including violence. But two of its five members produced powerful dissenting opinions, seeking to uphold basic rule of law standards.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the bare majority of the IPT got it seriously wrong. We will seek permission to appeal to protect the public from this abusive secretive power.\u201d</p> <p>The majority decision said: \u201c[European] convention [of human] rights issues do not arise as a matter of substance in this challenge to the policy of the security service .\u2026 The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence-gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the effect of either [MI5\u2019s] submissions or the judgment of the majority in this tribunal that the security service has the power to confer any immunity from the ordinary criminal law of this country or the civil law.\u201d</p> <p>The security service, known as MI5, has issued guidelines on the use of agents who participate in criminality, the judgment points out, which say that representations are made to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service about whether criminal charges would be in the public interest.</p> <p>The guidelines state that official authorisation does not confer immunity but instead act as \u201cthe service\u2019s explanation and justification of its decision should the criminal activity of the agent come under scrutiny by an external body, eg the police or prosecuting authorities\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, the authorisation process and associated records may form the basis of representations by the service to the prosecuting authorities that prosecution is not in the public interest.\u201d</p> <p>In the first dissenting decision, Charles Flint QC said: \u201cI entirely accept the operational necessity for the service to run agents who may need to participate in serious criminal activity.\u201d</p> <p>However, he added, the policy under challenge \u201chas been exercised with scrupulous care by the security service so as to discharge its essential functions in protecting national security, whilst giving proper regard to the human rights of persons who may be affected by the activities of agents\u201d.</p> <p>But, he concluded he was \u201cunable to find that the 1989 [Security Service] Act provides any legal basis for the policy under challenge\u201d. Flint said the existing law left agents and handlers \u201cunduly exposed\u201d and \u201ccannot be regarded as being in accordance with the law under the European convention on human rights\u201d.</p> <p>In the second dissenting judgment, Prof Graham Zellick QC, was more critical, arguing that parliament had never authorised such a policy. And he added: \u201cTo accede to [MI5\u2019s] argument would open the door to the lawful exercise of other powers of which we have no notice or notion, creating uncertainty and a potential for abuse.\u201d</p> <p>During the hearing, Ben Jaffey QC, representing the coalition of civil liberty groups, said the policy in effect meant that MI5 was granting immunity to its agents. He pointed out that police have recently recommended that more than 20 people, including senior officials, should be prosecuted for murder, kidnap, torture and perverting the course of justice following an investigation by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/05/stakeknife-inquiry-recommends-charges-against-sinn-fein-figure\">Operation Kenova</a> into the handling of agents inside the IRA during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles.</p>",

In a 56-page judgment, the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), which hears legal complaints about the intelligence agencies, declared that the guidelines do not breach human rights or grant absolute immunity to those who commit offences such as murder or torture. It is the first time the IPT has published dissenting judgments, both of which in this case are highly critical of the statutory framework surrounding the handling of agents. Many of the key arguments turned on the exploitation of informants within the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles. The coalition of civil liberty groups that brought the challenge \u2013 Reprieve, the Pat Finucane Centre, Privacy International and the Committee for the Administration of Justice \u2013 announced immediately they would appeal. Opening the majority judgment, Lord Justice Singh, Lord Boyd and Sir Richard McLaughlin acknowledged: \u201cThis case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law.\u201d Lawyers for the civil liberty organisations argued that what is known as the \u201cthird direction\u201d \u2013 guidelines permitting agents to become involved in criminal conduct, which were revealed in March 2018 \u2013 were illegal. Crucial details of the guidelines specifying whether there are limits on such criminal activity remain secret. Part of the IPT hearing was held behind closed doors with the media and lawyers for the claimants excluded. The tribunal has also published a secret or \u201cclosed\u201d version of its final judgment. Explaining that the third direction guidelines are still not published in full, the majority judgment states: \u201cFor the reasons which are set out in our closed judgment, there is no more of the text of the guidelines which can properly be put into the public domain.\u201d Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe IPT\u2019s knife-edge judgment, with unprecedented published dissenting opinions, shows just how dubious the government\u2019s secret policy is. Our security services play a vital role in keeping this country safe, but history has shown us time and again the need for proper oversight and common sense limits on what agents can do in the public\u2019s name.\u201d Dr Ilia Siatitsa, a legal officer at Privacy International, said: \u201cToday the investigatory powers tribunal decided that MI5 can secretly give informants permission to commit grave crimes in the UK, including violence. But two of its five members produced powerful dissenting opinions, seeking to uphold basic rule of law standards. \u201cWe think the bare majority of the IPT got it seriously wrong. We will seek permission to appeal to protect the public from this abusive secretive power.\u201d The majority decision said: \u201c[European] convention [of human] rights issues do not arise as a matter of substance in this challenge to the policy of the security service .\u2026 The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence-gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats. \u201cIt is not the effect of either [MI5\u2019s] submissions or the judgment of the majority in this tribunal that the security service has the power to confer any immunity from the ordinary criminal law of this country or the civil law.\u201d The security service, known as MI5, has issued guidelines on the use of agents who participate in criminality, the judgment points out, which say that representations are made to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service about whether criminal charges would be in the public interest. The guidelines state that official authorisation does not confer immunity but instead act as \u201cthe service\u2019s explanation and justification of its decision should the criminal activity of the agent come under scrutiny by an external body, eg the police or prosecuting authorities\u201d. \u201cIn particular, the authorisation process and associated records may form the basis of representations by the service to the prosecuting authorities that prosecution is not in the public interest.\u201d In the first dissenting decision, Charles Flint QC said: \u201cI entirely accept the operational necessity for the service to run agents who may need to participate in serious criminal activity.\u201d However, he added, the policy under challenge \u201chas been exercised with scrupulous care by the security service so as to discharge its essential functions in protecting national security, whilst giving proper regard to the human rights of persons who may be affected by the activities of agents\u201d. But, he concluded he was \u201cunable to find that the 1989 [Security Service] Act provides any legal basis for the policy under challenge\u201d. Flint said the existing law left agents and handlers \u201cunduly exposed\u201d and \u201ccannot be regarded as being in accordance with the law under the European convention on human rights\u201d. In the second dissenting judgment, Prof Graham Zellick QC, was more critical, arguing that parliament had never authorised such a policy. And he added: \u201cTo accede to [MI5\u2019s] argument would open the door to the lawful exercise of other powers of which we have no notice or notion, creating uncertainty and a potential for abuse.\u201d During the hearing, Ben Jaffey QC, representing the coalition of civil liberty groups, said the policy in effect meant that MI5 was granting immunity to its agents. He pointed out that police have recently recommended that more than 20 people, including senior officials, should be prosecuted for murder, kidnap, torture and perverting the course of justice following an investigation by Operation Kenova into the handling of agents inside the IRA during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles.",

The fact people have mentioned it, it\u2019s already an honour but it\u2019s not been something I\u2019ve been chasing in my life.\u201d Hamilton was beaten into second place by Ben Stokes for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award but the former cricketer Darren Gough also said Hamilton should be honoured. \u201cI\u2019m a massive F1 fan and Lewis Hamilton doesn\u2019t get the credit I think he deserves. He should have a knighthood by now. Six world titles, 84 grand prix wins but he\u2019s just got caught in a year where Ben Stokes has been out of this world.\u201d",

Most of us have one oven, which means getting everything golden, perfect and hot at once can be a juggle. So do yourself a favour and make sides that can be cooked in advance, put to one side then heated up at the last minute (in fact, if you don\u2019t even get to the heating bit, they will still be delicious). This year, I will be making this cauliflower cheese, some roast potatoes and garlic- and lemon-sauteed greens. And, yes, I hear you ask, roast potatoes can be reheated \u2013 it\u2019s how they do it in restaurants and they are all the better for it.</p> <p>I think sides on Christmas Day \u2013 and with any roast \u2013 should fit into three categories: fresh and green, crunchy and crispy, and indulgent and saucy. You should have at least one of each, and this is a saucy one. Confit garlic makes everything better, so I make a load and keep under oil in a jar in my fridge (I urge you to do the same).

Gently cook over a very low heat for 30 minutes, until the garlic is pale, soft and buttery inside but hasn\u2019t browned. Be careful not to turn the heat up too much and boil, or the garlic and oil will burn: be patient, it will be well worth it.</p> <p>Leave the garlic to cool in the oil, then remove with a slotted spoon on to some kitchen paper, reserving the oil for later. This confit garlic is delicious simply spread on toast and will keep for a few weeks in its oil, if you want to make a few extra bulbs for another occasion.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat, then stir in the flour until it forms a paste. Cook for a minute or so, then add the milk a little at a time, whisking continuously into a smooth, white sauce. Squeeze out the soft garlic from one of the bulbs into the bechamel sauce, add half the cheddar, gruyere and seasoning, and mix. It should be quite a loose: sauce it will thicken up as it bakes, so add a little more milk if needed.</p> <p>Arrange the cauliflower florets and some of the smaller leaves in a baking dish that will fit everything in nicely, then squeeze out the garlic from the other bulb into the spaces between the cauliflower. Pour the garlicky cheese sauce evenly over the cauliflower, then top with the remaining cheese.</p> <p>Mix the breadcrumbs with the lemon zest, remaining thyme leaves and chopped sage, then sprinkle over the cheesy cauliflower. Finally, spoon over some of the oil from the confit garlic and bake for an hour, until the cauliflower is soft and golden.</p> <h2><strong>Ultimate roast potatoes</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5a10e65dd38861e44dbf7de8c93143574370e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5a10e65dd38861e44dbf7de8c93143574370e8/0_0_2251_2458/916.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 ultimate roast potatoes.\" width=\"916\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 ultimate roast potatoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me, the linchpin of a good Christmas dinner is the roast potato: golden and crunchy on the outside, soft and cloudy inside.

Most of us have one oven, which means getting everything golden, perfect and hot at once can be a juggle. So do yourself a favour and make sides that can be cooked in advance, put to one side then heated up at the last minute (in fact, if you don\u2019t even get to the heating bit, they will still be delicious). This year, I will be making this cauliflower cheese, some roast potatoes and garlic- and lemon-sauteed greens. And, yes, I hear you ask, roast potatoes can be reheated \u2013 it\u2019s how they do it in restaurants and they are all the better for it. I think sides on Christmas Day \u2013 and with any roast \u2013 should fit into three categories: fresh and green, crunchy and crispy, and indulgent and saucy. You should have at least one of each, and this is a saucy one. Confit garlic makes everything better, so I make a load and keep under oil in a jar in my fridge (I urge you to do the same).

      "bodyText": "Australian author Chris Hammer\u2019s second novel, Silver (Wildfire, \u00a316.99), picks up journalist Martin Scarsden\u2019s career a few months after the events of his impressive debut, Scrublands, which won a Crime Writers\u2019 Association award this year. Scarsden has been writing a book about why a priest in the outback opened fire on his congregation, and he is now about to set up home with Mandalay Blonde, the woman he met while he was reporting on the case. They plan to move to Port Silver on the coast of New South Wales, the town where he grew up and where \u2013 by a fairly hefty coincidence \u2013 she has inherited a large, rundown property. Arriving at their rented house, Scarsden finds the corpse of local estate agent Jasper Speight, and a dazed Blonde with blood on her hands. As he tries to prove her innocence, old grievances and tensions over land ownership come to light, and it\u2019s clear his own disturbing past isn\u2019t going to stay buried.

He wears the latter lightly and seems almost a little shy about opening his palms to reveal the intricate ink work adorning the inside of both wrists but it explains an awful lot about his journey from steamy, sub-tropical Asunci\u00f3n to Tyneside.</p> <p>While the Paraguay playmaker\u2019s right arm has been inscribed with a Biblical quotation in Spanish, namely \u201cI am the way, the truth, the life\u201d, from John 14:6, the left bears an image of a football encircled by \u201cEl tiempo de Dios es perfecto\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It means \u201cGod\u2019s timing is perfect\u201d and has helped sustain Almir\u00f3n, first as a teenager told he was too frail to play professionally and, more recently, in his guise as Newcastle United\u2019s non-scoring \u00a321m forward.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a believer, for sure,\u201d says the 25-year-old as he sits chatting, through an interpreter, in a quiet corner of his club\u2019s training ground. \u201cI don\u2019t go to church in England \u2013 although that\u2019s down to the language barrier \u2013 and I don\u2019t spend all my time studying the Bible but I do sit down and read it from time to time, just to refresh my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps a reminder that, sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways also helps reaffirm the football faith of a creator who scored freely at his previous club, Atlanta United, in the US and continues to do so for Paraguay.</p> <p>His Newcastle tally of zero remains a source of frustration, yet that cold statistic is cruelly deceptive. Before Almir\u00f3n\u2019s arrival in January Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side were relegation candidates but his move from Georgia to Geordieland enabled Ben\u00edtez to switch to a winning 3-4-3 formation. Once deployed alongside Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, the newcomer\u2019s startling change of pace, sharp dribbling skills, often stunning movement and sheer hard work changed the narrative, prefacing an eventual mid-table finish.</p> <p>If Ben\u00edtez was unworried by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/burnley-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">litany of near misses</a>, deflected shots and faulty penalty area connections, Steve Bruce exhibits similar faith in a left-footed wide player still to be deployed in arguably his strongest role, as a No 10.</p> <p>With R\u00f3nd\u00f3n and P\u00e9rez departed, the \u00a340m Brazilian striker Joelinton struggling and the influential winger Allan Saint-Maximin injured, increased responsibility rests on Almir\u00f3n\u2019s slender shoulders but Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor is confident he can rise to it.</p> <p>\u201cMiggy\u2019s absolutely sensational, a top player,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cIn 20 years of management I\u2019ve never seen anyone cover the distances and play with the intensity he does. He\u2019s multi-talented; once he scores one goal, he\u2019ll score a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8218864288d71cc2653943a4ffd2f8547ad790b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8218864288d71cc2653943a4ffd2f8547ad790b9/0_5_3500_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miguel Almir\u00f3n goes in search against Southampton of his first Newcastle goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miguel Almir\u00f3n goes in search against Southampton of his first Newcastle goal. \u2018I\u2019m not too anxious, I\u2019m not beating myself up,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ten-year-old Lucas Rochford will be among those applauding. The ballboy from South Shields touchingly consoled him following a glaring miss against Wolves courtesy of a sympathetic thumbs-up sign. Typically, Almir\u00f3n implored the club to locate Lucas and invited him for a day-long reunion at the training ground.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a lovely, special moment,\u201d Almir\u00f3n says. \u201cI\u2019m desperate for the first goal, I can\u2019t wait for that moment \u2026 but the most important thing is that I\u2019m helping the team create chances, results have generally been good, we\u2019re 11th, we\u2019re on the right track and the squad\u2019s really together.</p> <p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m not too anxious, I\u2019m not beating myself up about not actually scoring. I feel very much at ease at this club and in this city and I know, if I stay calm and relaxed, the goals will come. But I do think the day when I get my first one will be very happy.\u201d</p> <p>He hopes it will arrive on Saturday at home against Crystal Palace but it is not the first time Almir\u00f3n has required patience. As a schoolboy in Asunci\u00f3n he routinely rose at 5am for a three-hour round trip across Paraguay\u2019s capital to football training before classes.</p> <p>Despite possessing abundant skill, exquisite technique and an intelligent football brain, he was small and exceptionally slight and, at 15, his club, Cerro Porte\u00f1o, pronounced he would never make the professional grade.</p> <p>With his mother and father earning low wages but working long hours as a supermarket worker and security guard respectively and the family home in the modest San Pablo <em>barrio</em> extremely cramped, Almir\u00f3n felt obliged to start paying his way.</p> <p>He came close to giving up football and accepting a job collecting supermarket trolleys but his parents refused to let the dream die. \u201cI was frustrated and angry,\u201d he concedes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking things out properly but then I sat down and had a chat with my mum and dad. I told them that I loved football so much and I still thought I could do it for a living; happily they supported me.\u201d</p> <p>Cerro Porte\u00f1o offered him a final chance and, this time, he broke into the first team. After that came a spell excelling at Argentina\u2019s Lan\u00fas before catching Ben\u00edtez\u2019s eye in Atlanta and becoming Newcastle\u2019s most expensive signing since Michael Owen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc04a999a1fc8e2a2e8d1d0aafd39adfc8d5f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc04a999a1fc8e2a2e8d1d0aafd39adfc8d5f39/0_401_6019_3612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miguel Almir\u00f3n caught Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s eye with Atlanta, here celebrating their 2018 MLS Cup triumph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miguel Almir\u00f3n caught Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s eye with Atlanta, here celebrating their 2018 MLS Cup triumph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Kirkland/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bruce has ended up the longer-term beneficiary but, if Almir\u00f3n \u2013 who has bought his parents a spacious house \u2013 found his installation a culture shock, he is not letting on. \u201cThe differences between Rafa and Steve aren\u2019t that great,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey both have different ways of looking at the game, their own theories. Rafa\u2019s outwardly slightly calmer and more relaxed but Steve\u2019s very good at talking to you one to one. Essentially their message is the same; they want hard work but also for me to relax and enjoy football. If you can\u2019t relax, you can\u2019t play well; on the pitch you need to keep loose.\u201d</p> <p>With the thermometer plunging, that is easier said than done. \u201cBut I like the cold, I like the cold,\u201d Almir\u00f3n interjects for the first and only time in English, hallmark smile turned up to full wattage as he points, proudly, to his short-sleeved training top. \u201cSnow won\u2019t worry me.

It means \u201cGod\u2019s timing is perfect\u201d and has helped sustain Almir\u00f3n, first as a teenager told he was too frail to play professionally and, more recently, in his guise as Newcastle United\u2019s non-scoring \u00a321m forward. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a believer, for sure,\u201d says the 25-year-old as he sits chatting, through an interpreter, in a quiet corner of his club\u2019s training ground. \u201cI don\u2019t go to church in England \u2013 although that\u2019s down to the language barrier \u2013 and I don\u2019t spend all my time studying the Bible but I do sit down and read it from time to time, just to refresh my mind.\u201d Perhaps a reminder that, sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways also helps reaffirm the football faith of a creator who scored freely at his previous club, Atlanta United, in the US and continues to do so for Paraguay. His Newcastle tally of zero remains a source of frustration, yet that cold statistic is cruelly deceptive. Before Almir\u00f3n\u2019s arrival in January Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side were relegation candidates but his move from Georgia to Geordieland enabled Ben\u00edtez to switch to a winning 3-4-3 formation. Once deployed alongside Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, the newcomer\u2019s startling change of pace, sharp dribbling skills, often stunning movement and sheer hard work changed the narrative, prefacing an eventual mid-table finish. If Ben\u00edtez was unworried by the litany of near misses, deflected shots and faulty penalty area connections, Steve Bruce exhibits similar faith in a left-footed wide player still to be deployed in arguably his strongest role, as a No 10. With R\u00f3nd\u00f3n and P\u00e9rez departed, the \u00a340m Brazilian striker Joelinton struggling and the influential winger Allan Saint-Maximin injured, increased responsibility rests on Almir\u00f3n\u2019s slender shoulders but Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor is confident he can rise to it. \u201cMiggy\u2019s absolutely sensational, a top player,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cIn 20 years of management I\u2019ve never seen anyone cover the distances and play with the intensity he does. He\u2019s multi-talented; once he scores one goal, he\u2019ll score a lot.\u201d Ten-year-old Lucas Rochford will be among those applauding. The ballboy from South Shields touchingly consoled him following a glaring miss against Wolves courtesy of a sympathetic thumbs-up sign. Typically, Almir\u00f3n implored the club to locate Lucas and invited him for a day-long reunion at the training ground. \u201cIt was a lovely, special moment,\u201d Almir\u00f3n says. \u201cI\u2019m desperate for the first goal, I can\u2019t wait for that moment \u2026 but the most important thing is that I\u2019m helping the team create chances, results have generally been good, we\u2019re 11th, we\u2019re on the right track and the squad\u2019s really together. \u201cIt means I\u2019m not too anxious, I\u2019m not beating myself up about not actually scoring. I feel very much at ease at this club and in this city and I know, if I stay calm and relaxed, the goals will come. But I do think the day when I get my first one will be very happy.\u201d He hopes it will arrive on Saturday at home against Crystal Palace but it is not the first time Almir\u00f3n has required patience. As a schoolboy in Asunci\u00f3n he routinely rose at 5am for a three-hour round trip across Paraguay\u2019s capital to football training before classes. Despite possessing abundant skill, exquisite technique and an intelligent football brain, he was small and exceptionally slight and, at 15, his club, Cerro Porte\u00f1o, pronounced he would never make the professional grade. With his mother and father earning low wages but working long hours as a supermarket worker and security guard respectively and the family home in the modest San Pablo barrio extremely cramped, Almir\u00f3n felt obliged to start paying his way. He came close to giving up football and accepting a job collecting supermarket trolleys but his parents refused to let the dream die. \u201cI was frustrated and angry,\u201d he concedes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking things out properly but then I sat down and had a chat with my mum and dad. I told them that I loved football so much and I still thought I could do it for a living; happily they supported me.\u201d Cerro Porte\u00f1o offered him a final chance and, this time, he broke into the first team. After that came a spell excelling at Argentina\u2019s Lan\u00fas before catching Ben\u00edtez\u2019s eye in Atlanta and becoming Newcastle\u2019s most expensive signing since Michael Owen. Bruce has ended up the longer-term beneficiary but, if Almir\u00f3n \u2013 who has bought his parents a spacious house \u2013 found his installation a culture shock, he is not letting on. \u201cThe differences between Rafa and Steve aren\u2019t that great,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey both have different ways of looking at the game, their own theories. Rafa\u2019s outwardly slightly calmer and more relaxed but Steve\u2019s very good at talking to you one to one. Essentially their message is the same; they want hard work but also for me to relax and enjoy football. If you can\u2019t relax, you can\u2019t play well; on the pitch you need to keep loose.\u201d With the thermometer plunging, that is easier said than done. \u201cBut I like the cold, I like the cold,\u201d Almir\u00f3n interjects for the first and only time in English, hallmark smile turned up to full wattage as he points, proudly, to his short-sleeved training top. \u201cSnow won\u2019t worry me. I\u2019ve got five amigos from Paraguay arriving on 2 January and they want to see some snow!\u201d While his wife, Alexia, a former Zumba teacher, prepares a guided tour of the region for their guests \u2013 \u201cshe loves travel and sightseeing, she\u2019s a real tourist, we\u2019ve been to so many places,\u201d says Almir\u00f3n \u2013 much of his time is absorbed by the language lessons he began in America. \u201cI\u2019m trying my hardest and I can understand a lot now,\u201d he says. \u201cI know speaking English will benefit me enormously but it\u2019s difficult to loosen up enough to have the confidence to start a conversation in a new language.\u201d What price his debut interview in English coming very shortly after that long-awaited first goal?",

      "body": "<p>I love Christmas. At this very special time of year, when the sun appears only fleetingly to those of us living in the northern hemisphere, I feel a deep connection with ancient ancestors. I like to go for wintry walks, on crisp days in pale winter sunshine, finding a Neolithic monument or an iron age hillfort to explore with my children. It also feels right to hunker down, to be with friends and family, to celebrate friendship with the exchange of gifts, and to give to good causes. I love creating cosiness at home \u2013 a bit of Danish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/11/hygge-the-danish-art-of-living-cosily-on-its-way-to-uk-bookshops\" title=\"\">hygge</a> \u2013 with candles and firelight, holly and pine cones. It\u2019s all \u201cgood for the soul\u201d.</p> <p>Occasionally, friends who know I\u2019m a humanist \u2013 that I don\u2019t believe in any sort of gods, or indeed an immortal soul \u2013 have questioned why I would celebrate Christmas. But while Christians may choose to commemorate the birth of Jesus on 25 December, I don\u2019t see any reason why others shouldn\u2019t enjoy a midwinter ritual whose roots go back much further than the origins of Christianity.</p> <p>In the late third century AD, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/roman-treasure-found-in-swiss-orchard-exceeds-4000-coins\" title=\"\">Roman emperor Aurelian</a> established an official religion, based on a popular sun cult, to help bond the empire together. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242330197_Temples_and_Priests_of_Sol_in_the_City_of_Rome\" title=\"\">Priests of Sol </a>were elevated to membership of the senatorial elite \u2013 rather like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/01/catherine-bennett-lords-reform-bishops\" title=\"\">bishops</a> gaining automatic seats in the House of Lords today. In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine was still stamping the solar deity on his coins, as well as declaring <em>dies Solis</em>, Sunday, an official day of rest. But the sun\u2013god just didn\u2019t seem to have the power to prevent the Roman empire from falling apart.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a fairly obscure Jewish apocalyptic cult from Roman Palestine had grown, over three centuries, to become part of the fabric of Roman towns and cities. Constantine seems to have had a change of heart, or at least of policy. Perhaps this relatively new\u2013fangled religion could help give the empire the common focus and identity it needed. In AD313, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-2301,00.html\" title=\"\">Constantine</a> decriminalised various cults, including Christianity. Twelve years later, he convened the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/21/religion1\" title=\"\">Council of Nicaea</a> \u2013 a gathering of Christian bishops from across the empire \u2013 in what is now Turkey. He processed through the assembly, resplendent in purple robes decorated with gold and precious gems. Christianity had gained an imperial seal of approval. Just before Constantine died, he was baptised. After his death in AD337, coins were minted, not with Jupiter or the sun\u2013god, but with the hand of a Christian god reaching down towards the deceased emperor.</p> <p>By the end of the fourth century, Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman empire. And the early church had selected four \u201cofficial\u201d gospels \u2013 about the life of Jesus \u2013 for inclusion in the New Testament. Only two \u2013 Luke and Matthew \u2013 describe, with some contradictions, the birth of Jesus. The historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ronald-hutton\" title=\"\">Ronald Hutton</a> describes how the Jesus of those two gospels enters the world as an archetypal hero, fulfilling Hebrew prophecy. In Luke, shepherds go to find Jesus. In Matthew, an unspecified number of wise men, sometimes portrayed as kings, arrive. Nativity plays usually throw all the elements together, with kings and shepherds beating a path to the stable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d30ec62f446ee2ef9ad152c8a28d1cb27a0f351\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d30ec62f446ee2ef9ad152c8a28d1cb27a0f351/0_0_2000_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"nativity play in guildford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nativity plays usually throw all the elements together, with kings and shepherds beating a path to the stable.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowhere in the gospels is the date of Jesus\u2019s birth specified.

The date seems to have been chosen to replace the prior festival, decreed by Aurelian, of the unconquered sun \u2013 Sol Invictus.</p> <p>As a midwinter festival of the sun, the date makes celestial sense. It falls just after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/21/when-is-winter-solstice\" title=\"\">solstice</a>, when the days are perceptibly lengthening.

      "bodyText": "I love Christmas. At this very special time of year, when the sun appears only fleetingly to those of us living in the northern hemisphere, I feel a deep connection with ancient ancestors. I like to go for wintry walks, on crisp days in pale winter sunshine, finding a Neolithic monument or an iron age hillfort to explore with my children. It also feels right to hunker down, to be with friends and family, to celebrate friendship with the exchange of gifts, and to give to good causes. I love creating cosiness at home \u2013 a bit of Danish hygge \u2013 with candles and firelight, holly and pine cones. It\u2019s all \u201cgood for the soul\u201d. Occasionally, friends who know I\u2019m a humanist \u2013 that I don\u2019t believe in any sort of gods, or indeed an immortal soul \u2013 have questioned why I would celebrate Christmas. But while Christians may choose to commemorate the birth of Jesus on 25 December, I don\u2019t see any reason why others shouldn\u2019t enjoy a midwinter ritual whose roots go back much further than the origins of Christianity. In the late third century AD, the Roman emperor Aurelian established an official religion, based on a popular sun cult, to help bond the empire together. Priests of Sol were elevated to membership of the senatorial elite \u2013 rather like bishops gaining automatic seats in the House of Lords today. In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine was still stamping the solar deity on his coins, as well as declaring dies Solis, Sunday, an official day of rest. But the sun\u2013god just didn\u2019t seem to have the power to prevent the Roman empire from falling apart. Meanwhile, a fairly obscure Jewish apocalyptic cult from Roman Palestine had grown, over three centuries, to become part of the fabric of Roman towns and cities. Constantine seems to have had a change of heart, or at least of policy. Perhaps this relatively new\u2013fangled religion could help give the empire the common focus and identity it needed. In AD313, Constantine decriminalised various cults, including Christianity. Twelve years later, he convened the Council of Nicaea \u2013 a gathering of Christian bishops from across the empire \u2013 in what is now Turkey. He processed through the assembly, resplendent in purple robes decorated with gold and precious gems. Christianity had gained an imperial seal of approval. Just before Constantine died, he was baptised. After his death in AD337, coins were minted, not with Jupiter or the sun\u2013god, but with the hand of a Christian god reaching down towards the deceased emperor. By the end of the fourth century, Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman empire. And the early church had selected four \u201cofficial\u201d gospels \u2013 about the life of Jesus \u2013 for inclusion in the New Testament. Only two \u2013 Luke and Matthew \u2013 describe, with some contradictions, the birth of Jesus. The historian Ronald Hutton describes how the Jesus of those two gospels enters the world as an archetypal hero, fulfilling Hebrew prophecy. In Luke, shepherds go to find Jesus. In Matthew, an unspecified number of wise men, sometimes portrayed as kings, arrive. Nativity plays usually throw all the elements together, with kings and shepherds beating a path to the stable. Nowhere in the gospels is the date of Jesus\u2019s birth specified. The first time it\u2019s pinned down to 25 December, or at least to the \u201cEighth day before the Kalends of January\u201d is the year AD354, in the Roman calendar of Philocalus. The date seems to have been chosen to replace the prior festival, decreed by Aurelian, of the unconquered sun \u2013 Sol Invictus. As a midwinter festival of the sun, the date makes celestial sense. It falls just after the solstice, when the days are perceptibly lengthening. Pagan Romans started their midwinter celebrations with the feast of Saturnalia on 17 December, ending them with a new year festival, the Kalendae Januariae, at the start of January \u2013 both were celebrated with parties and the exchange of gifts. It\u2019s difficult to know what festivals were celebrated by our pagan ancestors in pre\u2013Roman times \u2013 as this takes us into prehistory, which is defined by a lack of history. A few prehistoric monuments are lined up with the position of the sun on the horizon at key times: the solstices and the equinoxes. The monumental Neolithic passage grave at Newgrange, in Ireland, is aligned with sunrise around the time of the winter solstice, and Maes Howe on Orkney is lined up with sunset on that day. In Dorset, there\u2019s a huge, six\u2013mile cursus, defined by parallel banks and ditches, and perhaps used for processions, which is also lined up with the midwinter sunset. Stonehenge is famously aligned with midsummer sunrise, and possibly also intentionally with midwinter sunset. Archaeological excavations at nearby Durrington Walls suggest that people were gathering and feasting there during winter months. So perhaps these monuments were used as part of solstice\u2013related festivals. Despite all of those, and others, it\u2019s important to note that most prehistoric monuments have no such solar alignments. Old pagan myths make their way down to us in early medieval Irish and Welsh literature \u2013 but those ancient stories were written down by Christians, and contain few hints about earlier festivals. St Patrick gave us a clue about surviving pagan beliefs, though, in the fifth century, when he condemned sun worship: \u201cAll those who adore it shall descend into misery and punishment.\u201d In Anglo\u2013Saxon literature, the feast of the nativity is simply described as \u201cmidwinter\u201d \u2013 which could possibly hark back to the pre\u2013Christian festival. It\u2019s not until the 11th century that the festival gets its familiar English name, Cristes Maesse \u2013 Christmas. In the same century, with the Danish king Cnut ruling England, the Scandinavian name for the midwinter festival \u2013 juul or Yule \u2013 also became popular. There are plenty of historical hints \u2013 if not definitive traces \u2013 of a pre\u2013Christian midwinter festival in northwest Europe. So I don\u2019t see any hypocrisy in celebrating a festival which predated Christianity, and which reflects a real, celestial rhythm. It comes at a time of year when we can \u2013 in a very scientific frame of mind \u2013 celebrate the moment when we reach that point in our orbit when the days have contracted and are just starting to lengthen again.

Unless, of course, they happen to be dear friends of both the PM and his partner, Carrie Symonds.</p> <p>Tory outrage directed at unelected placemen making our laws seems to stop at the Channel.

With almost 800 members \u2013 the largest legislature in any democracy \u2013 the House of Lords is estimated to cost the taxpayer some \u00a320m a year in allowances and expenses.</p> <p>It was somewhat surprising, then, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc8f0c22-201d-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96\" title=\"\">read this week</a> that aides to the prime minister are considering radical plans to reform the upper house. It would be nice to think that the proposed changes were motivated by a commitment to democratic principles, such as those that led Tony Blair to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/26/lordreform.constitution\" title=\"\">slash by 90%</a> the number of hereditary peers sitting in the Lords. Given that this initiative appears to have emerged from the busy brow of Dominic Cummings, however, it is much more likely to be his latest attempt to subvert the constitution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/whitehall-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-civil-servants\">Watch out, Whitehall. Dominic Cummings has some tough love in store for us | The civil servant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A second chamber is crucial to a functioning democracy. Not only does it offer an opportunity to revise legislation, it also plays an important role in helping the primary chamber to hold the executive to account. It\u2019s this latter role that may have drawn the attention of Cummings. Having delivered a majority for his boss, the new power behind the throne is eager to usurp any forces that might curb his aspiration to move fast and break things. The Tories have no majority in the Lords. Their 242 peers are heavily outnumbered by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Even if the crossbenchers vote in a manner broadly supportive of the Conservatives, the Lords is capable of doing something that Cummings abhors: subjecting the government to scrutiny.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see how the Tories could engineer a majority in the upper house without changing the way it is composed. As peers can\u2019t be removed, the Electoral Reform Society <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mZfDj8NSpjk\" title=\"\">estimates</a> that, under the existing system, any attempt to replicate the current balance of power in the Commons would necessitate the appointment of hundreds of new peers.</p> <p>If, as reported, government insiders are instead considering an elected second chamber, reformers will have to ensure that the primacy of the Commons is not undermined. When we put a cross against the name of our chosen candidate to be an MP, we are giving that person a primary mandate to govern. If the upper chamber is to retain its revising role in our constitution, reformers will have to devise a means of giving its members a secondary mandate, which ensures they cannot overrule the will of MPs.</p> <p>A simple way to achieve this would be to divide all the seats in the upper house in direct proportion to the votes cast in the general election \u2013 what I call the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.secondarymandate.org/how.html\" title=\"\">secondary mandate</a>\u201d method. Under first past the post, votes for failed candidates go in the bin. But if the secondary mandate method was introduced, all votes cast would be tallied in each of the 12 regions and nations of the UK and 25 members elected in each, in a manner that reflected all the votes cast.</p> <p>This method of indirect election would require some democratic input, in the form of local primaries. The end result would be an upper house of 300 members that represented the will of people as expressed at the general election. Crucially, their legitimacy would be one step removed from that of the Commons, preserving the principle of primacy.</p> <p>Under Blair, Labour made the running, not just on Lords reform, but on a whole range of issues designed to devolve power away from the centre. Sadly, he lost his appetite during his third term and the party has since paid only lip service to constitutional issues. While the Tories threaten to dismantle the checks and balances that prevent them from acting with impunity, the new Labour leader should take the initiative by convening a constitutional convention \u2013 inviting political parties, local authorities, civic groups and faith communities to come together to build a consensus for a new settlement between the people of the UK and their government.

      "bodyText": "It didn\u2019t take long. One of Boris Johnson\u2019s first acts on being returned to Westminster with a thumping majority was to announce that his old pal Zac Goldsmith, turfed out by the voters of Richmond Park just days before, would be appointed to the House of Lords. There\u2019s nothing new about prime ministers handing out peerages like baubles to their supporters, but eyebrows were raised at such a blatant use of patronage. Surely this ran contrary to the declaration in the Conservative manifesto that the party will \u201ccontinue to support the first-past-the-post system of voting, as it allows voters to kick out politicians who don\u2019t deliver, both locally and nationally\u201d? Unless, of course, they happen to be dear friends of both the PM and his partner, Carrie Symonds. Tory outrage directed at unelected placemen making our laws seems to stop at the Channel. Those who rail against the Brussels gravy train seem to have a blind spot when it comes to the tax-free \u00a3305-a-day attendance fee paid to peers. With almost 800 members \u2013 the largest legislature in any democracy \u2013 the House of Lords is estimated to cost the taxpayer some \u00a320m a year in allowances and expenses. It was somewhat surprising, then, to read this week that aides to the prime minister are considering radical plans to reform the upper house. It would be nice to think that the proposed changes were motivated by a commitment to democratic principles, such as those that led Tony Blair to slash by 90% the number of hereditary peers sitting in the Lords. Given that this initiative appears to have emerged from the busy brow of Dominic Cummings, however, it is much more likely to be his latest attempt to subvert the constitution. A second chamber is crucial to a functioning democracy. Not only does it offer an opportunity to revise legislation, it also plays an important role in helping the primary chamber to hold the executive to account. It\u2019s this latter role that may have drawn the attention of Cummings. Having delivered a majority for his boss, the new power behind the throne is eager to usurp any forces that might curb his aspiration to move fast and break things. The Tories have no majority in the Lords. Their 242 peers are heavily outnumbered by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Even if the crossbenchers vote in a manner broadly supportive of the Conservatives, the Lords is capable of doing something that Cummings abhors: subjecting the government to scrutiny. It\u2019s hard to see how the Tories could engineer a majority in the upper house without changing the way it is composed. As peers can\u2019t be removed, the Electoral Reform Society estimates that, under the existing system, any attempt to replicate the current balance of power in the Commons would necessitate the appointment of hundreds of new peers. If, as reported, government insiders are instead considering an elected second chamber, reformers will have to ensure that the primacy of the Commons is not undermined. When we put a cross against the name of our chosen candidate to be an MP, we are giving that person a primary mandate to govern. If the upper chamber is to retain its revising role in our constitution, reformers will have to devise a means of giving its members a secondary mandate, which ensures they cannot overrule the will of MPs. A simple way to achieve this would be to divide all the seats in the upper house in direct proportion to the votes cast in the general election \u2013 what I call the \u201csecondary mandate\u201d method. Under first past the post, votes for failed candidates go in the bin. But if the secondary mandate method was introduced, all votes cast would be tallied in each of the 12 regions and nations of the UK and 25 members elected in each, in a manner that reflected all the votes cast. This method of indirect election would require some democratic input, in the form of local primaries. The end result would be an upper house of 300 members that represented the will of people as expressed at the general election. Crucially, their legitimacy would be one step removed from that of the Commons, preserving the principle of primacy. Under Blair, Labour made the running, not just on Lords reform, but on a whole range of issues designed to devolve power away from the centre. Sadly, he lost his appetite during his third term and the party has since paid only lip service to constitutional issues. While the Tories threaten to dismantle the checks and balances that prevent them from acting with impunity, the new Labour leader should take the initiative by convening a constitutional convention \u2013 inviting political parties, local authorities, civic groups and faith communities to come together to build a consensus for a new settlement between the people of the UK and their government. At its heart should be a series of citizens\u2019 assemblies whose recommendations guide the process. By putting constitutional reform on the agenda, the Tories are offering us a chance to reinvigorate our democracy. If Labour can rediscover its tradition of devolving power, the drive to give people greater agency over their lives could form the basis of the party\u2019s revival. \u2022 Billy Bragg is a singer-songwriter and activist",

How toxic TV tourists took over Chernobyl HBO\u2019s dramatisation of the Chernobyl disaster was perhaps the most acclaimed TV show of 2019. But like the Soviet nuclear power program, it had unintended consequences. Julie McDowall reports on the boom in unwelcome visitors to Ukraine\u2019s exclusion zone. Trump\u2019s trade wars lay waste to the midwest Demand for farming equipment has shrunk amid Donald Trump\u2019s trade war on China, which explains why John Deere is laying off factory workers in Iowa. Michael Sainato finds out how the dispute between Washington and Beijing is driving communities to despair in America\u2019s manufacturing and farming heartland. Martin Scorsese on making 2019\u2019s best movie The Guardian\u2019s film critic Peter Bradshaw has crowned Martin Scorsese\u2019s 209-minute crime epic The Irishman his No 1 film of 2019. Scorsese tells Andrew Pulver why his latest film felt like a culmination: \u201cI know that I\u2019m at the end of a long, long ride.\u201d Opinion If you thought impeachment would pose a reporting challenge for conservative media, think again, says Jason Wilson. The president\u2019s defenders have once again used the news as an excuse to attack his perceived enemies and to explain why this is actually good for Trump. A careful and rigorous impeachment process appears to have changed few minds. Conservative media are working to ensure that its aftermath doesn\u2019t either. Sport The 11-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater has missed out on a slot on the US Olympic surfing team after losing his semi-final heat at the Billabong Pipe Masters in Hawaii. That left the 47-year-old without sufficient points from the season to make it into the two-man team for Tokyo 2020. As the season nears its halfway point, second-placed Leicester have a chance to go seven points clear of Manchester City when they face the reigning champions at the Etihad on Saturday. Frank Lampard will meet his old boss Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when Lampard\u2019s Chelsea visit Tottenham for their London derby on Sunday.

I recommend watching the video, though: the Sharpie-moustached musician hops from sparkling gown to red silk kimono to cream faux fur with all the energy of someone who lives for Christmas party season.</p> <h2><strong>Jimi Somewhere </strong><br><strong>1st Place</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487OgydZ1pQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/487OgydZ1pQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We are now at this weird stage when the artists whom Frank Ocean and Odd Future influenced, such as Kevin Abstract and his band Brockhampton, are now influencing an even younger generation, like this 21-year-old green-haired dude from Norway. 1st Place is Jimi\u2019s best-known track and it\u2019s hard to pin down: honey-sweet vocals, pop-punk jangles, cinematic production.

      "bodyText": "And so towards year-end and a juicy Christmas present for you this week, dear Upsider. In an unprecedented act, we are going to tell you about a piece we haven\u2019t even published yet. With the decade about to turn, there have been a slew of articles about how terrible the 2010s were, sort of like the 1970s with extra carbon dioxide or the 1340s without the plague. Ever one to champion the underdog, we asked Guardian writers to look for the silver lining and pinpoint the super-trends of the twenty-tens (for that is what they are called) that were full of progress, promise or at least didn\u2019t result in people calling each other rude names or telling barefaced lies. The answers in no particular order: renewables, streaming, veganism, environmental activism, poverty reduction, smartphones, mental health awareness, trans issues, anti-plastics, women\u2019s sport (particularly football). Read the full piece on Friday 27 December. After two days of Christmas, you\u2019ll want something to cleanse the palate. Back to the here and now. As this is our last newsletter of 2019, we thought we\u2019d do two lists: the best pieces of the week, and the best pieces of the year. So without further ado, this week we gave you: \u2022 The simple fix that helped end the world\u2019s first climate change war. Three-minute read \u2022 Dreaming of a green Christmas. Four-minute read \u2022 We opened our doors to a Syrian refugee family. What happened next? Two-minute read \u2022 An entire series on how to be hopeful. A lifetime\u2019s work \u2022 How I escaped the vicious cycle of homelessness. 90-second read And this year, we particularly enjoyed giving you: \u2022 How to play cricket with only one arm. Five-day test \u2022 The kindest thing I ever saw. Five minutes of life affirming joy \u2022 The rise and rise of Bangladesh. Three-minute read \u2022 The age of the four-day week? Four days \u2022 How to plant billions of trees. Ages Lucky numbers There has been a sharp fall in the number of journalists killed worldwide this year, though 49 is clearly 49 too many. Meanwhile, most indicators affecting the poorest people on the planet are moving in the right direction, according to the World Bank. What we liked A new collaborative US project to examine the homelessness project and tease out solutions. This short piece from CNN on the 71 species discovered in 2019.

Vilma Kalman And finally, we are indebted to Huw Morgan for sending us four Christmas carols, rewritten for an environmentally anxious age.

Young.</p> <h2><strong>Comments</strong></h2> <p>166 entries, a few with THREAD for THREE-D, which can only have been a guess, I imagine. Fifteen clues received votes for clue of the month, the clear winner (with 14 votes) being \u2018J. Laurie\u2019s ardent one giving him orders at Walmington?\u2019 for ALOWE, from \u2018Like Adam after Eve\u2019s arrival, in green mode of existence?\u2019 for ECOSTATE (11 votes). The reference to <em>Dad\u2019s Army</em> may have been puzzling to some overseas competitors, though I dare say repeats of the show may still be shown in various countries around the world. (I\u2019ve never found the series very funny myself, though the frequent reruns on British television clearly indicate its wide following.)</p> <p>For once, the choice of clue word received almost unanimous approval. It\u2019s not hard to see why. An intriguingly odd lexical item, it combines a friendly set of letters, a pleasing topicality, abundant anagram possibilities, and obvious opportunities for \u2018&amp; lit.\u2019 treatment. It\u2019s strange that <em>Chambers </em>does not mention the literal origin of the term, as other dictionaries do if they include it at all. The clues quoted above give a good idea of the range of possible options available, making the judge\u2019s task a pleasurable but tricky one. Congratulations all round for a high-quality entry overall.</p> <p>This is always a busy time for me, with the Christmas competition coming shortly, closely followed by the January one, so I\u2019ll be brief. You\u2019ll have seen the announcement about the lunch to mark Azed No. 2,500 in May 2020; I hope to see as many of you there, and I must sincerely thank all those who sent cards and Christmas greetings to my family and I. Your continued devotion to the Azed series is enormously gratifying.</p>",

Comments 166 entries, a few with THREAD for THREE-D, which can only have been a guess, I imagine. Fifteen clues received votes for clue of the month, the clear winner (with 14 votes) being \u2018J. Laurie\u2019s ardent one giving him orders at Walmington?\u2019 for ALOWE, from \u2018Like Adam after Eve\u2019s arrival, in green mode of existence?\u2019 for ECOSTATE (11 votes). The reference to Dad\u2019s Army may have been puzzling to some overseas competitors, though I dare say repeats of the show may still be shown in various countries around the world. (I\u2019ve never found the series very funny myself, though the frequent reruns on British television clearly indicate its wide following.) For once, the choice of clue word received almost unanimous approval. It\u2019s not hard to see why. An intriguingly odd lexical item, it combines a friendly set of letters, a pleasing topicality, abundant anagram possibilities, and obvious opportunities for \u2018&amp; lit.\u2019 treatment. It\u2019s strange that Chambers does not mention the literal origin of the term, as other dictionaries do if they include it at all. The clues quoted above give a good idea of the range of possible options available, making the judge\u2019s task a pleasurable but tricky one. Congratulations all round for a high-quality entry overall. This is always a busy time for me, with the Christmas competition coming shortly, closely followed by the January one, so I\u2019ll be brief. You\u2019ll have seen the announcement about the lunch to mark Azed No. 2,500 in May 2020; I hope to see as many of you there, and I must sincerely thank all those who sent cards and Christmas greetings to my family and I. Your continued devotion to the Azed series is enormously gratifying.",

      "body": "<p>Across the street from the Workers\u2019 Stadium in Beijing, the venue of Arsenal\u2019s first ever match in China in 1995, shoppers at an Adidas store ignore a rack of puffer jackets, football shirts and backpacks bearing the football club\u2019s name.</p> <p>One, inspecting a range of Adidas clothing released for Chinese New Year, says he had once been a fan of Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil, but since the star midfielder had condemned China\u2019s treatment of the country\u2019s Uighur minority, he has changed his mind.</p> <p>\u201cNow I think he\u2019s irresponsible. What he said damages national unity. As a football star with so many fans, he should not get into politics,\u201d the shopper says. The man then goes on to admit that he is, in fact, a Manchester United supporter.</p> <p>Controversy over \u00d6zil\u2019s remarks this week has shone a light on the challenges \u2013 and compromises \u2013 foreign organisations face in trying to do business in China. But it also draws attention to the unique role played by sport, both in contemporary China and in exerting soft power for western countries abroad.</p> <p>Eight days ago, \u00d6zil, a practising Muslim of Turkish descent, posted a message on Instagram urging support for the Uighur Muslim population in the north-western Chinese state on Xinjiang, more than a million of whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/02/this-isnt-true-uighur-families-angered-by-china-claim-relatives-freed\">are believed to have been interned in detention camps</a>. In response, Arsenal distanced themselves from their own player. Hastily issuing a statement via Chinese social network Weibo, the club said: \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion. As a football club, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal\">Arsenal</a> has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d</p> <p>A week of controversy followed, with the debate reaching diplomatic circles. Arsenal were widely criticised in British media for washing their hands of \u00d6zil, and accused of only having eyes for their bottom line. The German found one unlikely ally, meanwhile, in the shape of the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who tweeted: \u201cChina\u2019s Communist party propaganda outlets can censor Mesut \u00d6zil \u2026 but the truth will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>In China, there was an immediate response too, with Arsenal\u2019s fixture against Manchester City pulled from the TV schedules by state broadcaster CCTV. \u00d6zil was also the subject of individual sanctions when his social media accounts were blocked on the Chinese internet and his likeness removed from the Chinese version of the video game Pro Evolution Soccer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca5222bcf387411973021407e545dd8a758dab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca5222bcf387411973021407e545dd8a758dab8/352_0_4159_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinese supporters\u2019 banner hangs from Arsenal\u2019s Emirates stadium before last weekend\u2019s match against Manchester City, which was banned from being screened in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Chinese supporters\u2019 banner hangs from Arsenal\u2019s Emirates stadium before last weekend\u2019s match against Manchester City, which was banned from being screened in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this way, the \u00d6zil affair echoed actions taken earlier in the year by the Chinese against NBA team the Houston Rockets, who found themselves persona non grata after their general manager, Daryl Morey, expressed support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.

      "bodyText": "Across the street from the Workers\u2019 Stadium in Beijing, the venue of Arsenal\u2019s first ever match in China in 1995, shoppers at an Adidas store ignore a rack of puffer jackets, football shirts and backpacks bearing the football club\u2019s name. One, inspecting a range of Adidas clothing released for Chinese New Year, says he had once been a fan of Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil, but since the star midfielder had condemned China\u2019s treatment of the country\u2019s Uighur minority, he has changed his mind. \u201cNow I think he\u2019s irresponsible. What he said damages national unity. As a football star with so many fans, he should not get into politics,\u201d the shopper says. The man then goes on to admit that he is, in fact, a Manchester United supporter. Controversy over \u00d6zil\u2019s remarks this week has shone a light on the challenges \u2013 and compromises \u2013 foreign organisations face in trying to do business in China. But it also draws attention to the unique role played by sport, both in contemporary China and in exerting soft power for western countries abroad. Eight days ago, \u00d6zil, a practising Muslim of Turkish descent, posted a message on Instagram urging support for the Uighur Muslim population in the north-western Chinese state on Xinjiang, more than a million of whom are believed to have been interned in detention camps. In response, Arsenal distanced themselves from their own player. Hastily issuing a statement via Chinese social network Weibo, the club said: \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d A week of controversy followed, with the debate reaching diplomatic circles. Arsenal were widely criticised in British media for washing their hands of \u00d6zil, and accused of only having eyes for their bottom line. The German found one unlikely ally, meanwhile, in the shape of the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who tweeted: \u201cChina\u2019s Communist party propaganda outlets can censor Mesut \u00d6zil \u2026 but the truth will prevail.\u201d In China, there was an immediate response too, with Arsenal\u2019s fixture against Manchester City pulled from the TV schedules by state broadcaster CCTV. \u00d6zil was also the subject of individual sanctions when his social media accounts were blocked on the Chinese internet and his likeness removed from the Chinese version of the video game Pro Evolution Soccer. In this way, the \u00d6zil affair echoed actions taken earlier in the year by the Chinese against NBA team the Houston Rockets, who found themselves persona non grata after their general manager, Daryl Morey, expressed support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.

The announcement completes the Jamie Lloyd Company\u2019s starry season at the Playhouse theatre, which opened with a new version of Cyrano de Bergerac featuring a shaven-headed James McAvoy (without prosthetic nose), which has rap battles in lieu of sword fights. The season will close with A Doll\u2019s House, in a version by Frank McGuinness, in which Jessica Chastain will make her West End debut. The Seagull opens on 19 March, with previews from 11 March and runs until 30 May.",

      "bodyText": "Canadian police were prepared to shoot Indigenous land defenders blockading construction of a natural gas pipeline in northern British Columbia, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Notes from a strategy session for a militarized raid on ancestral lands of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation show that commanders of Canada\u2019s national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), argued that \u201clethal overwatch is req\u2019d\u201d \u2013 a term for deploying an officer who is prepared to use lethal force. The RCMP commanders also instructed officers to \u201cuse as much violence toward the gate as you want\u201d ahead of the operation to remove a roadblock which had been erected by Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en people to control access to their territories and stop construction of the proposed 670km (416-mile) Coastal GasLink pipeline (CGL). In a separate document, an RCMP officer states that arrests would be necessary for \u201csterilizing [the] site\u201d. Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en people and their supporters set up the Gidimt\u2019en checkpoint in December 2018 to block construction of the pipeline through this region of mountains and pine forests 750 miles north of Vancouver. On 7 January, RCMP officers \u2013 dressed in military-green fatigues and armed with assault rifles \u2013 descended on the checkpoint, dismantling the gate and arresting 14 people. The checkpoint lies 22km east of a camp operated by a house group of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en called the Unist\u2019ot\u2019en, which has been at the center of the struggle against the pipeline. The camp is one of several instances where Indigenous people in British Columbia have reinhabited ancestral territory that falls outside of demarcated reservations, in what they refer to as \u201creoccupation\u201d. Unist\u2019ot\u2019en spokesperson Freda Huson (Howilhkat) said that the RCMP\u2019s militarized posture during the raid was consistent with a long history of colonial violence. \u201cIn our experience, since first contact, RCMP have been created by the federal government to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands,\u201d Huson said. \u201cThey have proven [that] through their harassment of my people to support Coastal GasLink in invading our territories.\u201d Police records seen by the Guardian include transcripts from police strategy sessions, reports filed after the raid and audio and video files. One document noted that the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en possessed \u201cfirearms for hunting/sustenance\u201d but police intelligence indicated that there was \u201cno single threat indicating that [land defenders] will use firearms\u201d. An RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content of the documents, saying they were merely carrying out a December 2018 injunction against people who interfere with the CGL pipeline. \u201cDuring the planning for the enforcement of the court-ordered injunction, the RCMP took the remote location of the Morice River Bridge into account and ensured that enough police officers were present in the area to keep the peace,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe also took into consideration the unpredictable nature of what we could face in the remote area, and so we moved additional police resources including members of the tactical and emergency response teams to provide support.\u201d The revelations come as the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en camps brace for a provincial supreme court ruling on an injunction applied for by the pipeline builder TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), which seeks to permanently restrict the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en from blocking access to pipeline work sites. The pipeline would run from the Dawson Creek area of northern British Columbia to a facility near Kitimat on the Pacific coast. CGL has begun road-building and clear-cutting on the right-of-way, and the company intends to start construction in early-2020. Founded in 2009, Unist\u2019ot\u2019en camp was the first among a constellation of Indigenous-led uprisings against fossil fuel pipelines in North America \u2013 including Keystone XL, Trans Mountain, Enbridge Line 3, Dakota Access and Bayou Bridge. Like most Indigenous people in British Columbia, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en have never relinquished their land to the Canadian government by treaty, land sale or surrender. In a 1997 ruling, the supreme court of Canada determined that aboriginal land ownership had never been given up across the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en\u2019s 22,000 km sq of territory. Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en leaders say they are defending their right to protect themselves and future generations from irreparable harm. The pipeline would run directly beneath the Morice River, a river system several municipalities rely on. The documents show that ahead of the raid, the RCMP deployed an array of surveillance, including heavily armed police patrols, a jet boat, helicopter, drone technology, heat-sensing cameras and close monitoring of key land defenders\u2019 movements and social media postings. Police established a \u201cmedia exclusion zone\u201d, blocking reporters from accessing the area. They took care to hide their carbine rifles on the approach to the roadblock because the \u201coptics\u201d of the weapons were \u201cnot good\u201d, according to one of the documents. The documents also show close collaboration between the RCMP and TC Energy: police officers attended company planning sessions and daily \u201ctailgate\u201d meetings, and were privy to CGL\u2019s legal strategy. The RCMP were prepared to arrest children and grandparents: \u201cNo exception, everyone will be arrested in the injunction area,\u201d a document reads. Another makes reference to possible child apprehension by social services \u2013 a troubling disclosure given the violent history of residential schooling in Canada and the disproportionate number of Indigenous children currently in the child welfare system. \u201cThe police are here to support the invasion of Indigenous territories,\u201d said Tlingit land defender Anne Spice. \u201cIt is what they\u2019ve always done. Now, they watch us when we travel to pick berries. They \u2018patrol\u2019 the roads where we hunt. They harass us and profile us under the guise of \u2018public safety\u2019.\u201d Since the January raid, an RCMP detachment known as the Community Industry Safety Office has maintained a large presence in an effort to forestall any resistance to pipeline construction. Armed RCMP officers can be seen patrolling the area, and three police trailers are tucked away in the woods alongside the access road. Drones and helicopters often circle overhead. CGL has also retained two private security firms that track Indigenous people\u2019s movements. According to the RCMP spokesperson, the police detachment will remain in place in Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en lands \u201cas long as deemed necessary\u201d. The RCMP Community Industry Response Group (CIRG) has also recently been deployed to monitor and suppress Indigenous people fighting the proposed Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline, which would pass through a separate area of British Columbia and which officially began construction last month. One of the Gidimt\u2019en land protectors, Molly Wickham (Sleydo\u2019), from the clan\u2019s Grizzly House, described the CIRG detachment in her people\u2019s territory as a violation of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d between a settler state and Indigenous people -- a principle enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed over the last year is not only violent oppression by RCMP and the state on 7 January, but the continuing occupation of our territories and surveillance of our people and camp by CIRG,\u201d she said. The RCMP\u2019s suppression of Indigenous dissent against resource extraction is rooted in its founding as a paramilitary entity 150 years ago. In the late 1800s, the RCMP (formerly the Northwest Mounted Police) carried out surveillance, violent displacement and relocation of Indigenous peoples onto reserves, and the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families in order to place them in residential schools. Advocates say it was the police force which enabled the Canadian government to seize Indigenous homelands and undermine Native sovereignty. More recently, the Canadian state has thrown its national security apparatus behind oil and gas development \u2013 often directly at Indigenous people\u2019s expense. The 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act, Bill C-51, sanctions the criminalization of Indigenous environmentalists by enhancing surveillance and legal powers against any potential interference with Canada\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d or \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d. Land defenders such as Freda Huson have been identified in RCMP intelligence reports as \u201caboriginal extremists\u201d. Despite the onset of winter, Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en land defenders remain at the camps to protect their lands and waters. As construction crews dynamite the land in preparation for laying pipe, and RCMP and private security forces patrol the territory, they trap for food and build new cabins. \u201cWe will continue to resist, to insist on respect for our way of life,\u201d said Spice. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 December 2019. An earlier version described \u201clethal overwatch\u201d as \u201ca term for deploying snipers\u201d. To clarify, it describes the deployment of an officer who is prepared to use lethal force, who may or may not be positioned as a sniper. An earlier version also included the quote \u201csterilizing the site\u201d from an RCMP record. The word \u201cthe\u201d does not actually appear in the record.",

We started the exercise in 2012 and Messi won the inaugural award as well as the year after, 2015 and 2017.</p> <p>He remains, at 32, a joy to watch and there were, as always, breathtaking moments throughout the year, with the free-kick against Liverpool in the first Champions League semi-final and the winning goal against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in La Liga in December only two examples.</p> <p>Every single judge had Messi on their voting slip, compared to 235 for the second-placed Virgil van Dijk. The fact that the Barcelona No 10 was 20 places ahead of his nearest club-mate, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, speaks volumes of how he has somehow become even more important for his side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-19T10:55:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Messi\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-19T10:55:18/embed.html\">Messi</a> </figure>  <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is out of the top two for the first time since we launched it and it may be a painful decline from here on in. He has done better than his former team-mate though, Luka Modric, who drops to 45th a year after he was crowned the best player in the world. Messi finished 309 points ahead of Van Dijk with the Dutchman almost 500 points in front of the third placed Sadio Man\u00e9.</p> <p>The Champions League winners Liverpool have 10 players in the top 100. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side had six on the list after losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid in 2018 but their triumph over Tottenham coupled with their relentless pursuit of the Premier League title has seen their marauding full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, enter the list, together with Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Fabinho. James Milner, strangely, drops out if the top 100.</p> <p>Manchester City, however, top the list with 11 players while Brazil, winners of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, knock Spain off top stop when it comes to nationalities.

      "bodyText": "Lionel Messi returns to the top of the Guardian\u2019s top 100 male footballers list after losing out to Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018. He did not win the Champions League, nor did he win the Copa Am\u00e9rica, but yet it still feels indisputably right to see the Argentinian genius selected as the very best in the world again. It is the fifth time Messi has topped our list, which had a record number of judges again this year, 239 from 63 countries. We started the exercise in 2012 and Messi won the inaugural award as well as the year after, 2015 and 2017. He remains, at 32, a joy to watch and there were, as always, breathtaking moments throughout the year, with the free-kick against Liverpool in the first Champions League semi-final and the winning goal against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in La Liga in December only two examples. Every single judge had Messi on their voting slip, compared to 235 for the second-placed Virgil van Dijk. The fact that the Barcelona No 10 was 20 places ahead of his nearest club-mate, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, speaks volumes of how he has somehow become even more important for his side. Cristiano Ronaldo is out of the top two for the first time since we launched it and it may be a painful decline from here on in. He has done better than his former team-mate though, Luka Modric, who drops to 45th a year after he was crowned the best player in the world. Messi finished 309 points ahead of Van Dijk with the Dutchman almost 500 points in front of the third placed Sadio Man\u00e9. The Champions League winners Liverpool have 10 players in the top 100. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side had six on the list after losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid in 2018 but their triumph over Tottenham coupled with their relentless pursuit of the Premier League title has seen their marauding full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, enter the list, together with Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Fabinho. James Milner, strangely, drops out if the top 100. Manchester City, however, top the list with 11 players while Brazil, winners of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, knock Spain off top stop when it comes to nationalities. Spain had had the most number of players on all our list from the start in 2012 but now find themselves in joint fifth. England are joint second, their highest ever position. Young players keep banging on the door and this year we have, for the first time, two players on the list born on this side of the millennium, Erling Braut Haaland and Jadon Sancho. It was lovely to see Santi Cazorla return make the list for the first time since 2016, the wonderful playmaker returning from horrific injury problems to shine for Villarreal and even making a comeback for Spain. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is another player, and the oldest on the list, to return, his year at LA Galaxy winning enough votes to finish in 96th. There is, as always, a lot of anger towards lists like these and there always seems to be a bias towards the players who have done well in the period between August and November, with the voting closing in the beginning of December. We also have the problem of players\u2019 whole careers being taken into account when it should be only the calendar year of 2019 that counts, hence Paul Pogba and Christian Eriksen, for example, finishing way higher than they really should be. For me, as always, the players who finish between 100 and 200 are sometimes even more interesting than the ones who make it. Keylor Navas, for example, finished in 102nd and Paco Alc\u00e1cer two places behind him in 104th, only 12 and 15 points from a place on the list. Dani Parejo, F\u00e1bian Ruiz and Luka Jovic were another three players who narrowly missed out. You can see all the votes that were cast and all the positions of all the players here. Three-hundred and twenty-one players received votes this year, a testament to the broad variety and knowledge of our judges. But there can be only one winner and for the fifth time we raise our hat to the wonderful player that is Leo Messi. Let\u2019s see if anyone can unseat him in 2020.",

However, his appointment has been concluded. \u201cThe terms of reference fall with the end of his appointment. The government is currently considering options relating to a future review.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not contesting this legal challenge. The next steps for the review will be considered in due course. We would like to thank Lord Carlile for his work on the review so far and for his continued contribution to security and counter-terrorism.\u201d Lord Carlile is understood not to be making any comment.",

But with Republican senators circling the wagons and majority leader Mitch McConnell vowing to work \u201cin total coordination\u201d with the White House on Trump\u2019s defense, that outcome appears extremely unlikely despite the vow of \u201cimpartial justice\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, McConnell and his fellow Republicans have signaled they will seek to move the impeachment trial on and off the national stage as quickly as possible, with zero witnesses testifying and unclear allowances for Democrats to make their case.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Senate blesses this historically low bar, we will invite the impeachment of every future president,\u201d McConnell said in a floor speech Thursday. Earlier he had declared: \u201cI\u2019m not an impartial juror\u201d.</p> <p>The basic expectation is that Trump skates, with all 53 Republican senators taking the above oath and then, with the phrase \u201cso help me God\u201d still echoing in the chamber, voting to acquit. A two-thirds majority of senators \u2013 67 if everyone votes \u2013 voting to convict would be required to remove Trump from office.</p> <p>\u201cEven in spite of the president\u2019s clear misconduct, everything for Senate Republicans comes down to politics right now,\u201d said Elliot Williams, a former justice department official and principal with <a href=\"https://rabengroup.com/people/elliot-williams/\">the Raben Group</a>, a public affairs and strategic communications firm.</p> <p>\u201cThe president is immensely popular with Republican voters, and he has shown that he is willing to declare war on any Republican who steps out of line.

So the twists and turns of the actual trial are not something that can be envisioned by just reading the rules.\u201d</p> <p>In the weeks leading up to impeachment, an intriguing split developed between McConnell, with his quickie game plan, and Trump, who has expressed a desire to produce the trial as reality TV tailored for conspiracy theorists and Trump superfans.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1202573673863008256?lang=en\">dared</a> the House to impeach him \u201cfast\u201d, \u201cso we can have a fair trial in the Senate,\u201d with a parade of witnesses who would \u201creveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.\u201d The president\u2019s draft witness list includes House intelligence chair Adam Schiff, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Joe and Hunter Biden \u201cand many more\u201d.</p> <p>In reply, Senate Democrats have proposed a witness list of their own, including former national security adviser John Bolton, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two officials from the office of management and budget, all of whom the White House blocked from testifying previously.</p> <p>House speaker Nancy Pelosi injected added uncertainty to the process on the night of Trump\u2019s impeachment, by saying the House would wait to refer articles of impeachment to the Senate until the terms of the Senate trial were made clear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8c9463a88d9919c077d1d01c2e2122bd2055645\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8c9463a88d9919c077d1d01c2e2122bd2055645/0_130_4196_2517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House speaker Nancy Pelosi said McConnell \u2018says it\u2019s OK for the foreman of the jury to be in cahoots with the lawyers of the accused \u2026 That doesn\u2019t sound right to us.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">House speaker Nancy Pelosi said McConnell \u2018says it\u2019s OK for the foreman of the jury to be in cahoots with the lawyers of the accused \u2026 That doesn\u2019t sound right to us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McConnell \u201csays it\u2019s OK for the foreman of the jury to be in cahoots with the lawyers of the accused,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right to us.\u201d</p> <p>The flagrant advertising by McConnell and colleagues such as Lindsey Graham \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here,\u201d Graham has said \u2013 of their intention to acquit Trump is \u201cutterly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and bestselling author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Nation-After-Trump-Disillusioned-ebook/dp/B06XW24YY6\">One Nation After Trump</a>.</p> <p>\u201cImagine if somebody\u2019s up on a murder trial, and it turns out that the foreman of the jury has worked with the defense team before the trial started to make sure that the outcome was just what they wanted,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cWe would view it as outrageous.\u201d</p> <p>The peril, for Republicans, lies in a potential political price to be paid for seeming too dismissive of the allegations against Trump \u2013 and in the possibility that a small, renegade faction of four Republican senators could decide to hobble McConnell, if the majority leader is seen as moving too dismissively.</p> <p>While such a breakaway faction of elected Republicans has yet to materialize on any Trump-related question, there remains the possibility that Republican senators who are either relatively free from Trump\u2019s political power \u2013 Mitt Romney of Utah \u2013 or senators facing difficult re-election bids in 2020 \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine; Cory Gardner of Colorado; Dan Sullivan of Alaska; Joni Ernst of Iowa; Martha McSally of Arizona \u2013 could congeal to form some sort of temporary resistance.</p> <p>\u201cYou have four, five, six Senate Republicans up in 2020 who are going to have to answer for those votes,\u201d said Ornstein. \u201cSo this is frankly pretty tricky business.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how vulnerable Republican senators might act, given that for three years, we\u2019ve heard maddening stories about how in private, Republican senators seem to be quite concerned about the president\u2019s conduct \u2013 but they simply refuse to engage in their constitutional duties and hold the president accountable.\u201d</p> <p>Roberts is another wild card. The two chief justices to have previously presided at Senate impeachment trials \u2013 William Rehnquist in 1999 and Salmon Chase in 1868 \u2013 left two opposing models for the role, said Hurd, with Chase treating the Senate like a courtroom in which he ruled frequently, and Rehnquist treating it like a political theater in which he played a limited role.</p> <p>\u201cRoberts is obviously Rehnquist\u2019s proteg\u00e9,\u201d said Hurd. \u201cHow he decides to approach this is anybody\u2019s guess, and I imagine this is going to have a huge effect on how the different strategies will work themselves out.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake in the Senate goes beyond the political fate of any member of Congress, Williams said.</p> <p>\u201cThe core question here is what standard do we want to set for future presidents,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIf we accept that future presidents can invite foreign meddling in our elections, then senators are free to condone that.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a very sad day for American democracy.\u201d</p>",

But with Republican senators circling the wagons and majority leader Mitch McConnell vowing to work \u201cin total coordination\u201d with the White House on Trump\u2019s defense, that outcome appears extremely unlikely despite the vow of \u201cimpartial justice\u201d. Instead, McConnell and his fellow Republicans have signaled they will seek to move the impeachment trial on and off the national stage as quickly as possible, with zero witnesses testifying and unclear allowances for Democrats to make their case. \u201cIf the Senate blesses this historically low bar, we will invite the impeachment of every future president,\u201d McConnell said in a floor speech Thursday. Earlier he had declared: \u201cI\u2019m not an impartial juror\u201d. The basic expectation is that Trump skates, with all 53 Republican senators taking the above oath and then, with the phrase \u201cso help me God\u201d still echoing in the chamber, voting to acquit. A two-thirds majority of senators \u2013 67 if everyone votes \u2013 voting to convict would be required to remove Trump from office. \u201cEven in spite of the president\u2019s clear misconduct, everything for Senate Republicans comes down to politics right now,\u201d said Elliot Williams, a former justice department official and principal with the Raben Group, a public affairs and strategic communications firm. \u201cThe president is immensely popular with Republican voters, and he has shown that he is willing to declare war on any Republican who steps out of line. That will largely affect Republican senators\u2019 behavior and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Political and legal analysts warn the senate impeachment trial might not run so smoothly as McConnell might wish, however. Under historic senate rules, a simple majority of 51 votes would be enough to prevent a quick dismissal of the case, and to upend McConnells\u2019 minimalist preferences on everything from calling witnesses to presenting evidence. Further uncertainty will be introduced by the role of supreme court chief justice John Roberts, whose presence at the trial is prescribed in the constitution but whose actual role appears largely up to his own discretion. \u201cThe rules give us a lot of specific stage instructions about what certain actors are supposed to say, the oaths they take, and at what time of day certain events are supposed to occur,\u201d said Hilary Hurd, a JD candidate at Harvard Law who has dissected the procedure for the Lawfare blog. \u201cBut when it comes to the major aspects of how this trial is actually going to work, it lays out some guidelines, but they\u2019re default guidelines that can be changed with 51 votes. So the twists and turns of the actual trial are not something that can be envisioned by just reading the rules.\u201d In the weeks leading up to impeachment, an intriguing split developed between McConnell, with his quickie game plan, and Trump, who has expressed a desire to produce the trial as reality TV tailored for conspiracy theorists and Trump superfans. Trump dared the House to impeach him \u201cfast\u201d, \u201cso we can have a fair trial in the Senate,\u201d with a parade of witnesses who would \u201creveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is.\u201d The president\u2019s draft witness list includes House intelligence chair Adam Schiff, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Joe and Hunter Biden \u201cand many more\u201d. In reply, Senate Democrats have proposed a witness list of their own, including former national security adviser John Bolton, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two officials from the office of management and budget, all of whom the White House blocked from testifying previously. House speaker Nancy Pelosi injected added uncertainty to the process on the night of Trump\u2019s impeachment, by saying the House would wait to refer articles of impeachment to the Senate until the terms of the Senate trial were made clear. McConnell \u201csays it\u2019s OK for the foreman of the jury to be in cahoots with the lawyers of the accused,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right to us.\u201d The flagrant advertising by McConnell and colleagues such as Lindsey Graham \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here,\u201d Graham has said \u2013 of their intention to acquit Trump is \u201cutterly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and bestselling author of One Nation After Trump. \u201cImagine if somebody\u2019s up on a murder trial, and it turns out that the foreman of the jury has worked with the defense team before the trial started to make sure that the outcome was just what they wanted,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cWe would view it as outrageous.\u201d The peril, for Republicans, lies in a potential political price to be paid for seeming too dismissive of the allegations against Trump \u2013 and in the possibility that a small, renegade faction of four Republican senators could decide to hobble McConnell, if the majority leader is seen as moving too dismissively. While such a breakaway faction of elected Republicans has yet to materialize on any Trump-related question, there remains the possibility that Republican senators who are either relatively free from Trump\u2019s political power \u2013 Mitt Romney of Utah \u2013 or senators facing difficult re-election bids in 2020 \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine; Cory Gardner of Colorado; Dan Sullivan of Alaska; Joni Ernst of Iowa; Martha McSally of Arizona \u2013 could congeal to form some sort of temporary resistance. \u201cYou have four, five, six Senate Republicans up in 2020 who are going to have to answer for those votes,\u201d said Ornstein. \u201cSo this is frankly pretty tricky business.\u201d Williams said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how vulnerable Republican senators might act, given that for three years, we\u2019ve heard maddening stories about how in private, Republican senators seem to be quite concerned about the president\u2019s conduct \u2013 but they simply refuse to engage in their constitutional duties and hold the president accountable.\u201d Roberts is another wild card. The two chief justices to have previously presided at Senate impeachment trials \u2013 William Rehnquist in 1999 and Salmon Chase in 1868 \u2013 left two opposing models for the role, said Hurd, with Chase treating the Senate like a courtroom in which he ruled frequently, and Rehnquist treating it like a political theater in which he played a limited role. \u201cRoberts is obviously Rehnquist\u2019s proteg\u00e9,\u201d said Hurd. \u201cHow he decides to approach this is anybody\u2019s guess, and I imagine this is going to have a huge effect on how the different strategies will work themselves out.\u201d What\u2019s at stake in the Senate goes beyond the political fate of any member of Congress, Williams said. \u201cThe core question here is what standard do we want to set for future presidents,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIf we accept that future presidents can invite foreign meddling in our elections, then senators are free to condone that. \u201cThat would be a very sad day for American democracy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Over the course of four albums, Louisville, Kentucky singer-songwriter Joan Shelley has built up a considerable reputation as a purveyor of fine, heartfelt folk and country. Her fifth is a magnificent addition to the canon. Recorded in Iceland with regular collaborators Nathan Salsburg and James Elkington alongside Icelandic musicians (and Will Oldham on Coming Down for You and The Fading), the 12 songs chart the course of a relationship like the changing seasons. There\u2019s a hint of classic Joni Mitchell to the 34-year-old\u2019s simultaneously pure and world-weathered tones. Recorded close to the microphone, with banjos, guitar, piano, drums and occasional strings never overpowering the beautiful vocals, she sounds personal and intimate. \u201cI\u2019m coming down for you as you always knew I would,\u201d she sings. \u201cAll your tender parts exposed.\u201d At times, her poetic imagery is dazzling: the superb Teal sees \u201cthe fresh air and wind and waves\u201d get set to \u201ctear apart summer\u2019s stuffy and stale rooms\u201d. If The Sway is a superlative, sensual, devotional love song, others document the breakup process in devastating increments: the drift from friendship into sensuality, the unexplained late arrivals home and the mournful epitaph of seeing others \u201cso entwined, as you and I used to be\u201d. And yet, these are timeless songs of renewal, not sadness, underpinned with quiet, steely resolution and the knowledge that emotions and loves arrive like those four seasons, to be savoured while they last.",

Those sounds are more than just another layer of Americana cosplay: her obsession with American archetypes, once dismissed as superficial, has matured into an acute understanding of how they are created and frustration at what they conceal. A subtly defiant assertion that Del Rey is here for the long haul, no matter what. <strong>Laura Snapes </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/best-albums-2019-no-1-lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>2</strong></h2> <h2>Dave \u2013 Psychodrama</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"174f5420ca6b0f8de5d2f48a5e04b1e391dc817b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/174f5420ca6b0f8de5d2f48a5e04b1e391dc817b/0_518_5826_3497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reflective \u2026 Dave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Magowan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until this year, rapper Dave was a singles artist \u2013 he managed 11 before his debut album was released \u2013 but Black marked a sea change: serious, reflective and grown-up. And from album opener Psycho onwards, where he\u2019s positioned as a patient telling all to a therapist, we meet a rapper as agitated as he is angry. An absentee father, a sibling in prison (his brother Christopher is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden), a burgeoning, pressurised music career \u2013 it all gets mixed into an urban opera that plays out intensely, and internally. <strong>Lanre Bakare </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/19/best-albums-2019-no-2-dave-psychodrama\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>3</strong></h2> <h2>Billie Eilish \u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</h2> <p>The singles that heralded its arrival were spectacular \u2013 the crawling menace of You Should See Me in a Crown; Bury a Friend\u2019s warped, unsettling glam stomp; Bad Guy\u2019s cocktail of sharp lyrics and 60s spy thriller theme pastiche \u2013 but they aren\u2019t significantly better than the rest of the album. It\u2019s adventurous, beautifully crafted, devoid of filler, packed not just with hooks but finely wrought sonic details. <strong>Alexis Petridis </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/18/best-albums-2019-no-3-billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>4</strong></h2> <h2>Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3149bffe4ad6e71ffa57d61596fc6758447ce6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3149bffe4ad6e71ffa57d61596fc6758447ce6fb/0_394_6720_4086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Van Etten.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophisticated \u2026 Sharon Van Etten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though it used sounds and textures familiar from the 80s, Remind Me Tomorrow didn\u2019t sound like an 80s record. But it summoned to mind that strain of 80s pop when older musicians would reach the top end of the charts with sophisticated, modern records that used production techniques from records for teenagers, and applied them to songs unmistakably written about adult life. Remind Me Tomorrow was a grown-up record that didn\u2019t sound jaded.

Tracks either abruptly snap off like an unfinished thought or dissolve into the silent distance. While Tyler has always been chameleonic, on Igor his restlessness feels like a conscious choice for the first time, not just the jittering impatience of a young star looking to explore new sounds. <strong>Ammar Kalia</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/16/best-albums-2019-no-5-tyler-the-creator-igor\">Read the full review.</a></p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>Angel Olsen \u2013 All Mirrors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a44460154e5d06ed5a895a6d9dec7e19b4107db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a44460154e5d06ed5a895a6d9dec7e19b4107db/0_0_5071_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Olsen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking up and moving on \u2026 Angel Olsen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A breakup record that muses on the nature of relationships without romanticising them, All Mirrors sees Olsen drill down into the damaging power-play of past loves, interrogating how they have made her feel less-than, as well as the self-knowledge and peace their endings have occasioned. It\u2019s a body of work that\u2019s comforting and heartening in the way a journey towards enlightenment should be, but it\u2019s also challenging, full of ambivalence and irresolvable confusion. <strong>Rachel Aroesti </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/best-albums-2019-no-6-angel-olsen-all-mirrors\">Read the full review.</a></p> <h2><strong>7</strong></h2> <h2>FKA twigs \u2013 Magdalene</h2> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting and hoping I\u2019m not enough,\u201d she sings on Cellophane in the album\u2019s final moments, contemplating the fallout from the end of her relationship. It\u2019s a moment of fragility, but one that\u2019s undercut by what has come before it \u2013 FKA twigs has proved that she is more than enough, someone who can sing, write, produce and pole-dance, all of it brilliantly. Some breakup albums wallow, but this one carries itself with the strength and tenacity of its namesake. <strong>Ben Beaumont-Thomas</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/12/best-albums-2019-no-7-fka-twigs-magdalene\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>8</strong></h2> <h2>Nick Cave \u2013 Ghosteen</h2> <p>There are spectral strings and synths, bells, electronics, a smattering of piano notes. The slow, meditative sound echoes the album\u2019s themes of acceptance; relative calm after the angry, anguished Skeleton Tree. There are moments when Cave appears to be slowly coming to terms with what has happened: \u201cSometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way,\u201d he sings. <strong>Kathryn Bromwich</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/11/best-albums-2019-no-8-nick-cave-bad-seeds-ghosteen\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>9</strong></h2> <h2>Slowthai \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df258b16d2cb8e9b97dd60dd1cd7422d80a517e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df258b16d2cb8e9b97dd60dd1cd7422d80a517e0/1332_462_3871_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing the jester \u2026 Slowthai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing the jester \u2026 Slowthai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel DeSlover/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slowthai wryly evokes the forgotten parts of the country through snapshots of working-class life: tea and biscuits, hiding drugs, fallouts with a stepfather, EastEnders\u2019 Phil Mitchell.

Unburdened by modish musical trends \u2013 no guests, no genre crossovers \u2013 it was a feat of immersive beauty, the kind of record you might put on an old-fashioned stereo, dim the lights and sit through in one indulgent sitting, the better to appreciate its three-dimensional production washing over your skin like a gong bath. <strong>Kitty Empire</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/09/best-albums-2019-no-10-weyes-blood-titanic-rising\">Read the full review.</a></p> <h2><strong>11</strong></h2> <h2>Caroline Polachek \u2013 Pang</h2> <p>Pang details a rebirth \u2013 the end of a marriage, a new start, a new creative partnership with producer Danny L Harle \u2013 and its avant-garde mix of airy synthesis and human tactility glistens with wonder. Polachek explores and is often overcome by this new reality, reflecting her sense of discovery in choruses that loop like Escher staircases (Door) and vocal runs so startling (Ocean of Tears) they seem to suggest the invention of entirely new emotions. <strong>LS</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/20/caroline-polachek-pang-review\">Read the full review.</a></p> <h2><strong>12</strong></h2> <h2>Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 Kiwanuka</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d18c119af3548237347ab9a930126cf23ea9e996\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18c119af3548237347ab9a930126cf23ea9e996/0_427_6495_3897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kiwanuka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharp \u2026 Michael Kiwanuka</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Rose</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Too many artists stick unnecessary interludes between album tracks this year; Kiwanuka is a rare exception, a properly immersive album that offers space for reflection between Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s close considerations of where hope might live among love, immigration and civil rights.

It\u2019s goofy and utopian, an idealism that blows through Father of the Bride with its Edenic genre inclusivity, jam-band brightness and Ezra Koenig\u2019s odes to love and marriage.

In these brawny, meandering folk songs, a butcher spouts anti-immigrant bile, an anxious jogger hears of racial violence, and workers in a warehouse flog themselves half to death; at a more intimate level, there are infidelities and loneliness.

Del Rey\u2019s stately sixth album is completely out of step with contemporary trends: as if a Brill Building stablehand went west on a Laurel Canyon recon mission. Those sounds are more than just another layer of Americana cosplay: her obsession with American archetypes, once dismissed as superficial, has matured into an acute understanding of how they are created and frustration at what they conceal. A subtly defiant assertion that Del Rey is here for the long haul, no matter what. Laura Snapes Read the full review. 2 Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Until this year, rapper Dave was a singles artist \u2013 he managed 11 before his debut album was released \u2013 but Black marked a sea change: serious, reflective and grown-up. And from album opener Psycho onwards, where he\u2019s positioned as a patient telling all to a therapist, we meet a rapper as agitated as he is angry. An absentee father, a sibling in prison (his brother Christopher is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden), a burgeoning, pressurised music career \u2013 it all gets mixed into an urban opera that plays out intensely, and internally. Lanre Bakare Read the full review. 3 Billie Eilish \u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? The singles that heralded its arrival were spectacular \u2013 the crawling menace of You Should See Me in a Crown; Bury a Friend\u2019s warped, unsettling glam stomp; Bad Guy\u2019s cocktail of sharp lyrics and 60s spy thriller theme pastiche \u2013 but they aren\u2019t significantly better than the rest of the album. It\u2019s adventurous, beautifully crafted, devoid of filler, packed not just with hooks but finely wrought sonic details. Alexis Petridis Read the full review. 4 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow Though it used sounds and textures familiar from the 80s, Remind Me Tomorrow didn\u2019t sound like an 80s record. But it summoned to mind that strain of 80s pop when older musicians would reach the top end of the charts with sophisticated, modern records that used production techniques from records for teenagers, and applied them to songs unmistakably written about adult life. Remind Me Tomorrow was a grown-up record that didn\u2019t sound jaded. It was alive with possibility. Michael Hann Read the full review. 5 Tyler, the Creator \u2013 Igor Performing concerts in support of the album while dressed in a Warhol wig, shades and dazzling neon suits, Tyler cavorted all over the stage celebrating an even greater breadth to his music. Tracks either abruptly snap off like an unfinished thought or dissolve into the silent distance. While Tyler has always been chameleonic, on Igor his restlessness feels like a conscious choice for the first time, not just the jittering impatience of a young star looking to explore new sounds. Ammar Kalia Read the full review. 6 Angel Olsen \u2013 All Mirrors A breakup record that muses on the nature of relationships without romanticising them, All Mirrors sees Olsen drill down into the damaging power-play of past loves, interrogating how they have made her feel less-than, as well as the self-knowledge and peace their endings have occasioned. It\u2019s a body of work that\u2019s comforting and heartening in the way a journey towards enlightenment should be, but it\u2019s also challenging, full of ambivalence and irresolvable confusion. Rachel Aroesti Read the full review. 7 FKA twigs \u2013 Magdalene \u201cThey\u2019re waiting and hoping I\u2019m not enough,\u201d she sings on Cellophane in the album\u2019s final moments, contemplating the fallout from the end of her relationship. It\u2019s a moment of fragility, but one that\u2019s undercut by what has come before it \u2013 FKA twigs has proved that she is more than enough, someone who can sing, write, produce and pole-dance, all of it brilliantly. Some breakup albums wallow, but this one carries itself with the strength and tenacity of its namesake. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Read the full review. 8 Nick Cave \u2013 Ghosteen There are spectral strings and synths, bells, electronics, a smattering of piano notes. The slow, meditative sound echoes the album\u2019s themes of acceptance; relative calm after the angry, anguished Skeleton Tree. There are moments when Cave appears to be slowly coming to terms with what has happened: \u201cSometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way,\u201d he sings. Kathryn Bromwich Read the full review. 9 Slowthai \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain Slowthai wryly evokes the forgotten parts of the country through snapshots of working-class life: tea and biscuits, hiding drugs, fallouts with a stepfather, EastEnders\u2019 Phil Mitchell. By playing the jester, he became the voice of a British generation at the turn of a turbulent decade. Hannah Ewens Read the full review. 10 Weyes Blood \u2013 Titanic Rising As slow and stately as a tanker turning, and as waterlogged as its title implies, Titanic Rising was a curio in 2019. Unburdened by modish musical trends \u2013 no guests, no genre crossovers \u2013 it was a feat of immersive beauty, the kind of record you might put on an old-fashioned stereo, dim the lights and sit through in one indulgent sitting, the better to appreciate its three-dimensional production washing over your skin like a gong bath. Kitty Empire Read the full review. 11 Caroline Polachek \u2013 Pang Pang details a rebirth \u2013 the end of a marriage, a new start, a new creative partnership with producer Danny L Harle \u2013 and its avant-garde mix of airy synthesis and human tactility glistens with wonder. Polachek explores and is often overcome by this new reality, reflecting her sense of discovery in choruses that loop like Escher staircases (Door) and vocal runs so startling (Ocean of Tears) they seem to suggest the invention of entirely new emotions. LS Read the full review. 12 Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 Kiwanuka Too many artists stick unnecessary interludes between album tracks this year; Kiwanuka is a rare exception, a properly immersive album that offers space for reflection between Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s close considerations of where hope might live among love, immigration and civil rights. Producers Danger Mouse and Inflo make his retro soul sharp enough to strike a match on, giving it an edge to match Brittany Howard\u2019s equally expansive Jaime (see No 32 below). LS Read the full review. 13 Vampire Weekend \u2013 Father of the Bride The artwork for Vampire Weekend\u2019s fourth album is pure Windows 97 ClipArt, earnest United Colors of Benetton graphics, CD-era prosperity in its prominent positioning of Sony\u2019s label. It\u2019s goofy and utopian, an idealism that blows through Father of the Bride with its Edenic genre inclusivity, jam-band brightness and Ezra Koenig\u2019s odes to love and marriage. Yet the darkness of their first three albums is never far from the door, antisemitism and apocalypse snapping a little harder at the heels of a new father and husband who\u2019s realised how much more he has to lose. LS Read the full review. 14 Little Simz \u2013 Grey Area The best work yet from the London rapper \u2013 she was already one of the most technically accomplished MCs in the country, but broadens and popularises her craft here with affecting song forms. On Boss, she goes in as hard as an aggrieved Wu-Tang member over a raw bluesy beat; on the very next song, Selfish, these spikes are melted into smooth R&amp;B. With every twist, Simz is already on top of the beat. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Read the full review. 15 Richard Dawson \u2013 2020 2019\u2019s not been great \u2013 in fact, things haven\u2019t been great for a while \u2013 and Richard Dawson\u2019s album suggests it\u2019s not going to get any better in 2020. In these brawny, meandering folk songs, a butcher spouts anti-immigrant bile, an anxious jogger hears of racial violence, and workers in a warehouse flog themselves half to death; at a more intimate level, there are infidelities and loneliness. Nevertheless, human decency still feels close at hand \u2013 not least from the man singing. BBT Read the full review. 16 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next Pop in 2019 has been all about spontaneity, whether that\u2019s the off-the-cuff language that\u2019s crept into the biggest pop hits or the intensifying feedback loop between pop and TikTok. But nobody perfected the approach like Ariana Grande, whose second album in six months (following 2018\u2019s Sweetener) vibrates with immediacy. After Manchester, the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and a called-off engagement with Pete Davidson, Grande gracefully considers how life could have been and how it turned out, tangling sweet melodies with embattled production. LS Read the full review. 17 Hot Chip \u2013 A Bath Full of Ecstasy The title, the new age font, the tie-dye colours of the album artwork \u2013 they all indicate that Hot Chip are getting in on the very 2019 taste for rave culture. While Hungry Child puts an offbeat spin on the sounds you might have heard pulsing from a motorway underpass 30 years ago, the vibe on A Bath Full of Ecstasy is less about revisiting the hedonism of some lost youth than its tender idealism, creating a bright, tender, often ballady idyll in a wretched age. LS Read the full review. 18 Cate Le Bon \u2013 Reward Cate Le Bon wrote Reward during a year spent living in the Lake District and learning how to make furniture. Without resembling anything so cliched as a \u201cgetting it together in the country\u201d record, her fifth solo album runs on that solitary, spartan existence: sad and lovely piano-led songwriting unfolds in its own unruffled time, but then a post-punk scribble like Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Magazines upsets Le Bon\u2019s calm, like a momentary wigout at her dislocation from society. LS Read the full review. 19 Solange \u2013 When I Get Home \u201cThis shit is for us,\u201d Solange announced on her previous album, handing her music to the black diaspora. On its follow up, she continues to wrap herself in its lore. Seemingly stumbling with Gucci Mane through a haze of chronic on My Skin My Logo, glorying in laidback \u201cCP time\u201d on Binz, the beautiful little nest of references that is \u201cblack molasses, blackberry the masses\u201d, this is an understated and poetic celebration of a culture. Her love for it is infectious. BBT Read the full review. 20 Clairo \u2013 Immunity After Clairo\u2019s lo-fi, bedroom-pop hit Pretty Girl went viral, there was the risk that her ascent to pop proper would obliterate the intimacy that made her appeal in the first place. Happily, that isn\u2019t the case: featuring production from former Vampire Weekend member Rostam (and occasionally drums from Danielle Haim), Immunity is tender and earnest, its scale in keeping with the way 21-year-old Clairo\u2019s generation shrugs off emotional disclosures with a lower-case \u201clol\u201d. LS Read the full review. 21 Charli XCX \u2013 Charli Charli XCX\u2019s long-awaited third album proper firmly puts to bed asinine questions about whether she is a mainstream pop star or a left-field one: here is someone not just punching above their weight but operating in an entirely different cosmos, unconcerned about putting goofy nostalgia (1999) next to deeply queer bass workouts (Click), trance-tinged, cocksure flexes (Next Level Charli) alongside cage-rattling anxiety anthems (Gone). LS Read the full review. 22 Fontaines DC \u2013 Dogrel Their ranting live shows gathered hype like a crowd round a bullhorn, and this debut album delivers \u2013 and then some. The band\u2019s picture of Dublin is as vivid and impetuous as the Joycean visions they clearly admire, all rough beauty and \u201cready-steady violence\u201d; the pint-chucking songs have the blithe, amused swagger of someone who enjoys a fight, but the ballads (Roy\u2019s Tune, Television Screens) are equally good, with a bleating, pub-piano sadness to them. BBT Read the full review. 23 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Miss Universe Miss Universe doesn\u2019t really need the concept-album framework, with its satirical interstitial muzak from the supposedly caring corporation Wway Health. It\u2019s full of contemporary ennui as it is, expressed as much in Yanya\u2019s subtly hangdog vocals as in the lyrics. Whether it\u2019s bossa nova pop, Snail Mail-style slacker grunge or moody synthetic rock in the tradition of the xx, Yanya\u2019s songwriting bar flexes and warps but stays permanently high. BBT Read the full review. 24 Aldous Harding \u2013 Designer Music is filled with no shortage of characters proclaiming how \u201cmad, me\u201d they are, so it\u2019s rare and delightful to come across a genuine oddball. Even before you get to Aldous Harding\u2019s magnetic, bug-eyed live shows, the New Zealander\u2019s third album operates on its own unique logic: inscrutable lyrics and tender folk settings that are deeply eerie yet obviously benign, like the traditional music of some beatific lost civilisation. LS Read the full review. 25 Big Thief \u2013 UFOF Where their second 2019 album Two Hands (see No 37, below) has a torn-paper edge to it, the first, UFOF, is pristine \u2013 but it essays a world that is far from perfect. Whether in grunge ballads (Jenni), front-porch blues (Orange) or the ambient indie-folk that sways reed-like throughout, the mood is as melancholy as it is beautiful. This is a band caught deep in one of the songwriting grooves of the century. Long may it last. BBT Read the full review. 26 Jenny Lewis \u2013 On the Line Lewis fully leans in to her best west coast troubadour mode on her fourth solo album, spinning endlessly captivating yarns of estranged lovers and lost hopes. Her classic band arrangements chime with festivity even as Lewis reveals her darkest experiences: the devastating Little White Dove is set at the deathbed of her estranged mother, who battled heroin addiction throughout Lewis\u2019s life. LS Read the full review. 27 Taylor Swift \u2013 Lover As with Sleater-Kinney\u2019s album, there was so much noise around Lover that it was hard to parse the record itself on release. But peel away the gaudy rollout, two misrepresentative lead singles and the baggage surrounding its creator and you\u2019re left with an endearing, adventurous old-school pop album. Lover paints in complex emotional shades and finds an artist known for her strict adherence to her brand trying lots of new things, from the girl-groupy Paper Rings to Mazzy Star-style reveries on the title track. LS Read the full review. 28 Lizzo \u2013 Cuz I Love You One album can\u2019t really contain the pop-cultural moment that is Lizzo \u2013 she is at her most enjoyable live, feeding back with a crowd that are delighted to see a star who looks like them, or, rather, not like everyone else in pop. But the sheer zest for life in these bombastic, ultra-quotable self-empowerment tracks \u2013 as well as the pure-pop hooks \u2013 gives them intensity even on record. BBT Read the full review. 29 Jenny Hval \u2013 The Practice of Love The Practice of Love is Jenny Hval\u2019s most ambient album, an eerie, euphoric spell sustained by new-age aura and trance beats. It\u2019s certainly the first record by the Norwegian artist that you could put on as background music, give or take some striking spoken-word sections. But it\u2019s a disarming invitation to Hval\u2019s most intimate work yet, one where she and her collaborators contemplate the purpose of existence and art in imagery that\u2019s no less evocative for its surrealism. LS Read the full review. 30 Kim Gordon \u2013 No Home Record Releasing a debut solo album at 66 is impressive enough; that it\u2019s one of the most skilful records of an already iconic career is even more so. No Home Record is as industrial as it is impish, full of sculpted noise, harebrained ragers and sly protest songs \u2013 against corporate branding and treacherous ex-husbands \u2013 that are sexy and seditious. LS Read the full review. 31 James Blake \u2013 Assume Form The quavering, circuitous voice of British jazz-dub songwriter James Blake is still a beautiful instrument, and his arrangements are as atmospheric as ever here. He resembles a heart-eyes emoji at various points, swooning over girlfriend Jameela Jamil on Power On and Can\u2019t Believe the Way We Flow. The strongest tracks, though, are when he slinks softly around guests Travis Scott and Rosal\u00cda. BBT Read the full review. 32 Brittany Howard \u2013 Jaime Alabama Shakes hardly cleaved to one genre, but frontwoman Brittany Howard shows just how astonishingly broad and instinctive her talent is here. Ramshackle hip-hop, spoken word, gospel, neo and not-so-neo soul, raunchy funk, spiritual jazz and whatever glorious noise 13th Century Metal is, it\u2019s all given extra heft by Howard\u2019s poignant reflections on love and identity. BBT Read the full review. 33 Muna \u2013 Saves the World Specificity is the marker of killer pop (the matches in Pet Shop Boys\u2019 So Hard, the shoelaces in Robyn\u2019s Be Mine), a trope that the LA trio Muna wield to intense effect on their second album of gothic synthpop. Saves the World is an unsparing emotional confrontation that drags you right into the bedroom bathed in pink light, the dorm room with the blunt scissors, not to mention singer Katie Gavin\u2019s torrid self-examinations. LS 34 Bill Callahan \u2013 Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest In the five years since his previous album, Bill Callahan got married, became a father and attained a level of beatific perspective that could probably settle international conflicts. While that warmth glows through Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, Callahan\u2019s understanding of his inherent masculine violence, and his way with lucid profundity, means his domestic treatise was never cloying. LS Read the full review. 35 The Murder Capital \u2013 When I Have Fears The other Dublin post-punk success story of 2018 alongside Fontaines DC, The Murder Capital have a bit more monochrome hauteur \u2013 but there\u2019s still a touch of lairiness. Over metronomic garage-rock, frontman James McGovern sings like a man reading a list of demands out of a high window, but also modulates into sweeping gothic romance. BBT Read the full review. 36 Sleater-Kinney \u2013 The Centre Won\u2019t Hold When drummer Janet Weiss quit Sleater-Kinney prior to the release of their ninth studio album, it cast an unfair pallor on a record mired in suspicion, every new dazzling synth or poppy refrain regarded as the possible straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. But its status in the band\u2019s catalogue is beyond reproach. With St Vincent as producer, Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker break new ground as songwriters \u2013 high camp on Bad Dance, trading intimacy and vaulting catharsis on The Dog/The Body \u2013 while mining affectingly desperate and ugly emotional depths. LS Read the full review. 37 Big Thief \u2013 Two Hands The Brooklyn band\u2019s second album of the year is earthier than UFOF, the glowing collection that arrived in spring. Here, the four-piece till the dirt and Adrianne Lenker sings relentlessly about death and disease, elemental concerns that nevertheless reach some kind of higher plane thanks to the tenacious, cracked songwriting that\u2019s swiftly establishing them as Brooklyn\u2019s answer to Crazy Horse. LS Read the full review. 38 Black Midi \u2013 Schlagenheim As buzz bands go, Black Midi is a weird one, a jagged mulch of math rock, Beefheart restlessness and the 90s Chicago school of alt-jazz, full of the declamatory vocals of Geordie Greep (whose voice you couldn\u2019t make up if you tried). But Morgan Simpson\u2019s astonishingly tight drumming keeps them painting within the lines, even when they\u2019re making the most abstract daubs. BBT Read the full review. 39 WH Lung \u2013 Incidental Music From Stereolab to LCD Soundsystem and Hookworms, almost every year produces a band who replicate the soothingly simple, eternal groove of Neu! \u2013 and in our world of lies and gaslighting, we need that north-star constant more than ever. Manchester\u2019s WH Lung are on hand to provide it, garlanded with airy vocals and endearingly retro sonics. BBT Read the full review. 40 Sturgill Simpson \u2013 Sound &amp; Fury Much as Kacey Musgraves broke open country songwriting in 2018 with the love-bombing body high of Golden Hour, Sturgill Simpson casts himself as the genre\u2019s outlier in 2019. This is a strutting, utterly badass glam rock record, shot through with a gimlet-eyed outlaw nihilism \u2013 and comes with its own accompanying Kurosawa-inspired anime. All of a sudden, songs about beer and broads seem a little lacking. BBT Read the full review. 41 These New Puritans \u2013 Inside the Rose With ambition and intent that should shame many of their peers, These New Puritans have crafted another suite of post-punk symphonies. As ever, the sound design is exquisite, bass thrumming in clouds under choirs, pianos and their trademark instant-decay drums, but the big earnest melodies give it heart. Jack Barnett\u2019s vocals, conversational yet epic, add their own particular drama. BBT Read the full review. 42 The Japanese House \u2013 Good at Falling Like Caroline Polachek, Hannah Diamond and so many others this year, Amber Bain uses super-synthetic electropop and soft rock to say much rougher, grittier truths. The production, aided by George Daniel of the 1975, is like dense layers of fluttering gauze, annotated with fine detailing; floating through it all is Bain\u2019s breakup pain. BBT Read the full review. 43 Jamila Woods \u2013 Legacy! Legacy! Like Sons of Kemet\u2019s Your Queen Is a Reptile, each track on poet/activist/songwriter Jamila Woods\u2019s second album is named for a pivotal artist of colour, whose legacies she explores as models of how to live life to the fullest. The Chicago musician flips between them \u2013 from Zora Neale Hurston to James Baldwin \u2013 with warmth and close attention, her sandy voice full of tenderness and the jazz-influenced backing sun-baked and dazzling. It makes Legacy! Legacy! feel less like a history lesson and more like a glimpse into a beloved photo album.

Southern Sky, Bad Man, SugarHouse and plenty more make this a future cult classic. BBT 45 Purple Mountains \u2013 Purple Mountains As with Bowie\u2019s Blackstar and Leonard Cohen\u2019s You Want It Darker, David Berman\u2019s long-awaited return to music will forever be overshadowed by his death, as he died by suicide less than a month after its release. Elegiac and rickety, it\u2019s a lasting testament to his mordant and philosophical poetry, but also to his pain: \u201cThe end of all wanting is all I\u2019ve been wanting,\u201d he sings on That\u2019s Just the Way That I Feel. LS Read the full review. 46 Durand Jones and the Indications \u2013 American Love Call These one-time music students create a perfect simulacrum of 60s and 70s soul, but lit with the lamps of a jazz club rather than the sterile striplighting of a lab. American Love Call is full of modern classics, from the falsetto raptures of How Can I Be Sure to the perfect country soul of Long Way Home. BBT Read the full review. 47 Flying Lotus \u2013 Flamagra Twenty-seven tracks long, and with guests ranging from Solange to David Lynch, Flamagra is the most ambitious vision yet from the LA beatmaker. He gives more space than ever before to his vocalists, but he could never become a producer of straightforward backing tracks \u2013 his tumbling, symphonic funk is as impetuous and psychedelic as ever. BBT Read the full review. 48 King Princess \u2013 Cheap Queen While artists like Billie Eilish and Polachek have pushed pop into the future this year, King Princess joins Lana Del Rey in showing that there\u2019s potential in classicism yet. The 20-year-old \u2013 born Mikaela Straus \u2013 released a debut album filled with louche balladry that, despite her New York pedigree, is plump with west coast studio richness. Also: echoes of All Saints\u2019 sultry best. LS Read the full review. 49 Fat White Family \u2013 Serfs Up! The chief grotbags of the British indie scene return, retaining a genuinely reptilian edge to their lounge lizard music. They dip into the strangest, sexiest bits of the 70s, with prowling disco on Feet, rollicking glam on Tastes Good With the Money, and electronically, chemically enhanced psychedelic skronk throughout. BBT Read the full review. 50 Kano \u2013 Hoodies All Summer With his sixth album, the east Londoner cements his status as one of the UK\u2019s greatest ever MCs. There\u2019s a musicality to his delivery that suggests a man considering one side of the argument, then the other \u2013 but ultimately there is little equivocation as he condemns institutional racism, needless violence, and the difficulty of social mobility: \u201cWe\u2019re Kunta Kintes in some Cuban links / The Balenciagas didn\u2019t blend us in.\u201d BBT Read the full review.",

Its tactic of focusing relentlessly on the NHS is distracting attention from other urgent social policy priorities. While the health service received star billing alongside Brexit in the Queen\u2019s speech, there was little on the growing crises in social care and homelessness. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, had previously let slip that his department had done nothing to prepare a policy on social care, blurting out that \u201cwe\u2019ve already been having discussions about starting that work\u201d. This is years after a green paper was promised by Theresa May\u2019s government. The government\u2019s 80-seat majority gives it enough parliamentary firepower to create a long-term solution for social care funding and up to five years in which to achieve it, but ministers are already setting it up to be lost in the quagmire of cross-party talks by saying they will be looking to build a consensus. Conveniently for the government, there is little chance of Labour agreeing a policy among themselves, let alone with anyone else, in the near future. The only way any government will crack the social care problem is with bold action at the start of its term of office, so legislation can be enacted and bedded down before the next general election.

The \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d didn\u2019t bother to mention homelessness in the Queen\u2019s speech at all. The briefing notes on the government\u2019s plans talked about ending rough sleeping, but little more. As with virtually any Queen\u2019s speech in recent decades, there were half-hearted commitments to strengthen local government. There is talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d the powers of the mayoral combined authorities and more devolution deals, which essentially means more spoon-feeding of local control rather than a decisive shift.

      "bodyText": "Alex Guevara weeps as he describes the five-month odyssey that brought his family from Venezuela to a diner just metres from the United States border \u2013 and the uncertainty and danger that lie ahead. It was June when Guevara and his family fled on foot into Colombia, carrying nothing but a Bible and a worthless Venezuelan coin to remind them of their homeland. \u201cIt was life or death \u2013 either we left or we left,\u201d Guevara\u2019s wife, Andrea, said of the persecution they had suffered because of ties to the opposition movement trying to force Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. From Medell\u00edn, the couple flew to Canc\u00fan with their two young children before traveling overland to one of the most dangerous stretches of the US-Mexico border and crossing the Rio Grande in a rubber dinghy. When border guards detained them on US soil, the Guevaras thought their ordeal was nearly over. But, rather than being allowed to stay in the US while they sought asylum, they were separated and spent a fortnight in detention before being released into one of Mexico\u2019s most notorious border towns in the dead of night. \u201cWow, that was a low blow,\u201d said Andrea. \u201cAfter all the trauma and everything we had been through in our country \u2026 we found ourselves in the mouth of another wolf.\u201d The Guevaras \u2013 who asked for their real names not to be used \u2013 are among more than 57,000 people who have been forced back into Mexico this year by an innocuously named immigration policy that activists consider one of the cruellest and most ruthlessly efficient strands of Donald Trump\u2019s anti-migration crusade. Unveiled in January, the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) project, or Remain in Mexico as it is better known, stipulates that asylum seekers must wait for their court hearings in Mexican border towns \u2013 several of which count among the most violent places on Earth. Even when they do reach court after months of waiting, only a tiny proportion of applicants succeed. Research by academics at Syracuse University found that only 11 out of nearly 10,000 asylum requests were granted in the first nine months of this year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chicken-shit administrative way of not letting people legally seek asylum,\u201d said Kelly Overton, whose NGO, Border Kindness, helps the policy\u2019s victims in Mexicali, one of six border cities involved in the scheme alongside Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros. \u201cThe majority of people are fleeing something \u2013 whether that\u2019s an immediate threat of violence, [or] a guaranteed life of poverty and despair for their children. They are doing this for a reason,\u201d Overton said. \u201cAnd it is shameful how the United States is responding. It is devastating.\u201d Overton, whose group buses asylum seekers to hearings in the US, said the human consequences of the policy were twofold. Many of those sent back, convinced they stood no chance of being legally admitted to the US, were risking their lives by returning to Central American countries suffering some of the world\u2019s highest murder rates. \u201cSome of the people we have helped this year that have gone back will be dead by next year,\u201d Overton said. Those who chose to wait it out, meanwhile, were exposed to con artists and kidnappers who preyed on those whose accents or clothes marked them out as outsiders. Earlier this month the advocacy group Human Rights First accused the Trump administration of exposing asylum seekers to \u201clife-threatening dangers\u201d after documenting 636 cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault and other violent attacks against those returned to Mexico. Victims included a nine-year-old disabled girl and her mother who were kidnapped and raped after being sent back to Tijuana. In Nuevo Laredo, which is located in a Mexican state the US considers as dangerous as Iraq and Syria, 197 kidnappings have already been recorded, including of a seven-year-old Honduran girl. Human Rights First researcher Kennji Kizuka said he suspected such perils were actually part of Trump\u2019s plan. Exposure to hostile environments was designed to \u201cscare people out of remaining and waiting for their immigration proceedings\u201d and thus reduce migration. Terrifying stories of violence and exploitation are easy to encounter in towns such as Mexicali. A Cuban woman told of how armed men had forced her into a car in broad daylight at the start of a terrifying four-day abduction during which she was deprived of food and water. \u201cThey took everything \u2013 our money, our clothes, everything,\u201d said the woman, who had also fled her country for political reasons. \u201cThank God we managed to escape and we\u2019re alive to tell the story \u2013 not everyone is so lucky.\u201d A Honduran woman, who also asked not to be named, said she had not left the shelter where she was living since being approached by a gang of pornographers offering her $50 to pose for naked photographs. \u201cI\u2019m scared \u2013 really, really scared,\u201d she said. The Guevaras, whose home is now a cramped flat on Mexicali\u2019s outskirts, said they also lived in constant fear, speaking quietly in public to hide their distinctive Venezuelan accents and hardly venturing outside. \u201cPeople say to us: \u2018Be careful. Don\u2019t go out on the streets. Don\u2019t leave the kids on their own,\u2019\u201d Andrea said. \u201cYou never know who you are dealing with here.\u201d Her husband insisted they could not return to Venezuela. \u201cBut Mexico is almost as dangerous.\u201d Remain in Mexico is part of a wider set of anti-immigration initiatives created since Trump took office in 2017, including an asylum ban targeting Central American migrants, a dramatic reduction of refugee resettlements and a highly controversial family separation policy scrapped after a global outcry. Margaret Cargioli, a San Diego-based immigration lawyer, called the policy part of \u201can astonishing anti-migrant machine\u201d designed to repel outsiders. \u201cAll of the measures, fundamentally, are racist and xenophobic policies,\u201d Cargioli said. \u201cIt\u2019s very planned out, it\u2019s very deliberate.\u201d Trump defends the moves as intended to protect the US from \u201cbad hombres\u201d, \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d. But in Mexicali the Guardian found mostly desperate young families forced from their homes by situations far beyond their control. In a dingy abandoned cinema converted into a migrant flophouse, Norma Quevedo said crime and deprivation had compelled her to flee Guatemala City with her five-year-old son, Antonio. \u201cThe truth is we want a better future for our children \u2026 so we decided to risk it all,\u201d said the 30-year-old single mother. In another shelter Leonela Cabrera Mart\u00ednez, a Honduran mother-of-three, said she was trying to outrun gangsters who targeted her family for failing to pay \u201crent\u201d. \u201cThey killed one of my brothers. That\u2019s why we came,\u201d said Cabrera, who was with three daughters aged 10, six and three. \u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d Cabrera insisted. \u201cIf I could go back, I would. But I can\u2019t.\u201d On a recent afternoon the shelter welcomed its latest guests: a 42-year-old asylum seeker called Santo Catalino L\u00f3pez Vel\u00e1squez who had been returned from the US just hours earlier after a 36-hour stint in the freezing hielera (icebox) detention centre with his wife, Fidelia Jaqueline Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez, and their baby daughter and toddler son. Like nearly every other migrant interviewed for this story L\u00f3pez shed tears that spoke of overwhelming emotional exhaustion as he told his story. In March, land-grabbers in southern Honduras had threatened to kill him if he failed to surrender his small farm. In April they torched his home. Days later L\u00f3pez fled, stowing away inside lorries all the way to the US border with his wife and children. Penniless and still dazed from the ordeal, L\u00f3pez said he had no idea how he would support his family as he remained in Mexico \u2013 let alone attend their court hearing 130 miles away in San Diego. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a single peso,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNada.\u201d But like many of those now stuck in border limbo, L\u00f3pez was sure of one thing. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can go back \u2013 we\u2019ll be killed,\u201d he said, breaking down as he spoke. \u201cI cannot go back.\u201d Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija",

Englishness has long been vexed, not least because \u2013 in the context of the now-disappeared empire \u2013 it was confused with the identity of Britain. The confusion is summed up by the opening credits of the TV sitcom <em>Dad\u2019s Army</em>, where the musical refrain \u2018Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler, if you think Old England\u2019s done?\u2019 intones over images of the union flag.</p> <p>Niven lives in Northumberland, works at Newcastle University and is very conscious of the financial and political power exerted by London.

Losing yourself in an eerie fog misses the fact that there is nothing theoretical about this particular conspiracy: \u201cEngland is a backward-looking \u2026 place, not because of any actual mystical curse, but because its populace has continually been oppressed, constricted and prevented from self actualisation by the violent and mostly unchecked ascendancy of its ruling class over the last several hundred years.\u201d</p> <p>Only by implementing radical regionalism, Niven argues, \u201cbringing together the best features of leftist anti-nationalism and anti-imperialism on the one hand, and left populism and communitarianism on the other\u201d, can we avoid furthering far-right claims on English identity through pandering to false romanticisms.</p> <p><em>\u2022 New Model Island: How to Build a Radical Culture Beyond the Idea of England by Alex Niven is published by Repeater (\u00a39.99).

In the first chapter he turns his attention to his last communication with Fisher, a Facebook exchange about a family day out to Alton Towers the theorist was planning. \u201cEngland\u2019s Disneyland\u201d, a place Niven has visited many times himself, is used to visualise England\u2019s \u201cgarbled history and exploited masses, while concealing its real identity as a means of generating profit for a large and powerful aggregation of corporate interests\u201d. Psychogeography is a background influence, but Niven argues that the work of Iain Sinclair and others is often \u201csmothered in foreboding and melancholy, and underpinned by a sometimes exaggerated sense of historical curse bordering on conspiracy theory\u201d. Losing yourself in an eerie fog misses the fact that there is nothing theoretical about this particular conspiracy: \u201cEngland is a backward-looking \u2026 place, not because of any actual mystical curse, but because its populace has continually been oppressed, constricted and prevented from self actualisation by the violent and mostly unchecked ascendancy of its ruling class over the last several hundred years.\u201d Only by implementing radical regionalism, Niven argues, \u201cbringing together the best features of leftist anti-nationalism and anti-imperialism on the one hand, and left populism and communitarianism on the other\u201d, can we avoid furthering far-right claims on English identity through pandering to false romanticisms. \u2022 New Model Island: How to Build a Radical Culture Beyond the Idea of England by Alex Niven is published by Repeater (\u00a39.99).

A place for the bassier, murkier, more hip-hop-leaning side of her oeuvre (Coles wanted to be \u201cthe female Timbaland\u201d when she started producing at 14), expect it to crop up at this pre-Christmas blow-out. <br><em><a href=\"https://nighttales.co.uk/all-events\">Night Tales, E8,</a><strong><a href=\"https://nighttales.co.uk/all-events\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://nighttales.co.uk/all-events\">Saturday 21 December</a></em></p> <h2>Fatboy Slim</h2> <p>Norman Cook \u2013 who for a new generation may be best known as Woody from The Circle\u2019s dad \u2013 headlines this night of exploratory dance music, offering up the big-beat bops that made his name. Route 94 will also be on hand with house bangers, there is hardcore-tinged electro from Prospa, and newcomers Eli &amp; Fur deliver on the moody electronics. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.fatboyslim.net/live/\">Mayfield Depot, Manchester, Saturday 21 December</a></em></p> <h2>John</h2> <p>John like to keep things simple. On their Bandcamp page, their bio reads: \u201cFour arms, four legs, two heads, wood, metal and plastic. A band of two Johns from Crystal Palace, London, UK.\u201d Their ferocious, 26-minute-long second album, Out Here on the Fringes, takes their love of rocket-fuelled brevity and chucks in politically charged lyrics about austerity and single-use plastic. <br><em><a href=\"https://broadcastglasgow.com/2019/12/21/john/\">Broadcast, Glasgow, Saturday 21</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sneakypetes.co.uk/2019/12/22/john/\">Sneaky Pete\u2019s, Edinburgh, Sunday 22 December</a></em></p> <h2>Joesef</h2> <p>A year or so ago, the mononymous Joesef was performing at an open-mic night in his native Glasgow, unsure if he really wanted to be a singer. After some strong, supportive words from a friend-turned-manager, the 24-year-old started recording, turning a recent heartbreak into his debut EP, Play Me Something Nice. He has recently been longlisted for the BBC Sound of 2020 poll, which isn\u2019t a bad early confidence boost. <br><em><a href=\"https://swg3.tv/events/2019/december/joesef\">SWG3: Galvanizers, Glasgow, Monday 23 December</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Liane Carroll\u2019s Cold Turkey</h2> <p>Modestly majestic UK singer-pianist Carroll has a soul diva\u2019s earthiness, the turn-on-a-dime timing of a jazz improviser and the dark idiosyncrasies of a Tom Waits \u2013 a mix that has brought her an international reputation. Her Christmas shows at Ronnie\u2019s are remedies for seasonal hangovers both physical and spiritual. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ronniescotts.co.uk/performances/view/5551-liane-carrolls-cold-turkey#\">Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Thursday 26 &amp; Friday 27 December</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Two of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63b7d2f1d0a08e9d4e5e4a9813d2f75c12827316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63b7d2f1d0a08e9d4e5e4a9813d2f75c12827316/769_51_2874_3592/800.jpg\" alt=\"Isabelle Faust\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiering on\u2026 Isabelle Faust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Broede</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Soldier\u2019s Tale</h2> <p>Stravinsky\u2019s pioneering music-theatre piece, which pares drama down to its bare essentials to tell the story of a soldier who sells his soul to the devil, is not perhaps the most obvious pre-Christmas fare. But with a lineup of outstanding instrumentalists led by the one of the greatest violinists around today, Isabelle Faust , and with the French actor Dominique Horwitz as the narrator, it promises to be a special musical treat. Faust precedes The Soldier\u2019s Tale with Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Sonata for Solo Violin, one of his final masterpieces; it\u2019s fearsomely difficult to play, but exactly the kind of technical challenge that the always immaculate Faust will no doubt take in her stride. <br><em><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/isabelle-faust-friends-201912231930\">Wigmore Hall, W1,</a><strong><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/isabelle-faust-friends-201912231930\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/isabelle-faust-friends-201912231930\">Monday 23 December</a></em></p> <h2>St John\u2019s Smith Square Christmas festival</h2> <p>An extended choral festival in the weeks leading up to Christmas has become one of the most popular fixtures in the St John\u2019s Smith Square calendar. And concerts conducted by Stephen Layton and the choirs he directs have become almost as much of an institution as the festival itself. True to tradition, this year\u2019s event ends with Layton conducting the six cantatas that make up Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio and Handel\u2019s Messiah, both with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The Bach will be sung by the choir of Trinity College, Cambridge, where Layton is director of music, and the Handel by Polyphony, the chamber choir that he founded in 1986. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sjss.org.uk/news/st-john%E2%80%99s-smith-square-31st-christmas-festival\">St John\u2019s Smith Square, SW1, Sunday 22 &amp; Monday 23 December</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b61b8101a4a336688d5821dda2d3d56db7f10975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61b8101a4a336688d5821dda2d3d56db7f10975/0_0_4796_3408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olafur Eliasson\u2019s In Real Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mist opportunity\u2026 Olafur Eliasson\u2019s In Real Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hogarth: Place and Progress</h2> <p>Try a Hogarthian Christmas instead of a Dickensian one. Rakes and harlots warm themselves by a brazier after a night\u2019s revelling while a churchgoer looks on in disapproval in a Covent Garden snow scene. Poverty and luxury, corruption and comedy constantly collide in this fairytale of old London. Dickens was a fan \u2013 as you will be. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.soane.org/whats-on/exhibitions/hogarth-place-and-progress\">Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, WC2, to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Olafur Eliasson</h2> <p>In the bleak midwinter it is both eerie and uplifting to explore this Nordic artist\u2019s captivating chemistry of light and colour. Like the aurora borealis, his visions of intense illumination and deep shadow evoke wonder and awe. But Eliasson always returns you to reality and to the climate crisis we have created for the planet and ourselves. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 January</a></em></p> <h2>Jan de Beer</h2> <p>You can\u2019t get more Christmassy than a Renaissance picture of the Nativity or the Adoration of the Magi, and the 16th-century Antwerp artist Jan de Beer painted plenty of them. His atmospheric Nativity in the Barber Institute\u2019s collection sets luminous angels and a glowing crib in a night-shrouded stable. It stars here in a survey of his paintings and drawings that gives a bit of context to those arty Christmas cards. <br><em><a href=\"http://barber.org.uk/truly-bright-and-memorable-jan-de-beers-renaissance-altarpieces/\">The Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, to 19 January</a></em></p> <h2>Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh</h2> <p>I bet you don\u2019t get Christmas presents as good as the stuff Tutankhamun took into the beyond. When the uniquely unspoiled tomb of this young ruler of ancient Egypt was discovered in 1922 it was stacked with luxuries and treats, as if a drunken Santa had offloaded his entire stash there. Ready-to-assemble golden chariots, bows, boomerangs: this exhibition is a party cracker for all ages. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/art/tutankhamun.php\">Saatchi Gallery, SW3, to 3 May</a></em></p> <h2>Inspired By the East</h2> <p>European art\u2019s obsession with the \u201ceast\u201d begins with the three Magi. These gift-giving regulars in the Nativity story have been portrayed by European painters from Botticelli to Rembrandt in what was imagined to be \u201coriental\u201d garb. This exhibition reveals how Rubens and other artists based such depictions on portrayals of dress in the Ottoman empire as it surveys European art\u2019s secret love affair with Islam. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/inspired-east-how-islamic-world-influenced-western-art\">British Museum, WC1, to 26 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb6f07a81e5b9fcf7eb8bb452c9c02935967ce51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb6f07a81e5b9fcf7eb8bb452c9c02935967ce51/0_0_5275_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Clique\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fire starter\u2026 La Clique.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Three Sisters</h2> <p>Yes, it is another version of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters. But this one has been adapted by poet and playwright Inua Ellams, who wrote the acclaimed Barber Shop Chronicles. Ellams has set the play during the Nigerian civil war in 1967, with the three sisters longing to return home to Lagos. It stars Sarah Niles, Natalie Simpson and Racheal Ofori and is directed by the fearless Nadia Fall. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/three-sisters\">National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, to 19 February</a></em></p> <h2>La Clique</h2> <p>The circus and cabaret act returns to London for the first time in 10 years. There is something about this cluster of variety turns, acrobats and musical acts that feels a little bit creaky \u2013 but oh so tempting. There is a juggling act with champagne glasses, aerialists and contortionists, and a fire-breathing routine to top things off. <br><em><a href=\"https://lacliquetheshow.com/\">Leicester Square Spiegeltent, WC2, to 4 January</a></em></p> <h2>Pippi Longstocking</h2> <p>The Royal &amp; Derngate had a hit last year with The Worst Witch, which whizzed into the West End. This year, they\u2019re the first UK theatre to adapt Astrid Lindgren\u2019s much-loved books about Pippi Longstocking \u2013 in all her rowdy, red-haired glory. Mike Akers adapts, with original music from Kneehigh\u2019s Stu Barker, and direction from Jesse Jones and Helena Middleton from the Wardrobe Ensemble. A seriously imaginative creative team, who should produce something special. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/whats-on/pippi-longstocking/\">Royal &amp; Derngate: The Royal, Northampton, to 31 December</a></em></p> <h2>Pinocchio</h2> <p>Citizens Theatre staged a brilliant take on A Christmas Carol last year and have a knack for creating truly distinctive festive shows. High expectations, then, for Lu Kemp and Robert Alan Evans\u2019s adaptation of Carlo Collodi\u2019s Pinocchio, which reunites last year\u2019s winning gang, including director Dominic Hill. There will also be an immersive soundscape from Nikola Kodjabashia, dazzling puppetry and just a dash of darkness. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.citz.co.uk/whatson/info/pinocchio\">Tramway, Glasgow, to 4 January</a></em></p> <h2>Teenage Dick</h2> <p>Michael Longhurst\u2019s opening season at the Donmar continues to surprise and fascinate. Mike Lew\u2019s play is a darkly comic twist on Richard III. It is set in a US high school where Richard, who has hemiplegia, lusts for power and revenge on his tormentors. But is it better to be loved or feared? Daniel Monks stars in the title role, with Ruth Madeley, who appeared in Russell T Davies\u2019s Years and Years, also featuring. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/7415/teenage-dick/?qitq=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;qitp=7ec98049-9e91-43c3-b994-179da19224fb&amp;qitts=1576512177&amp;qitc=donmarwarehouse&amp;qite=ml2seasonpublic&amp;qitrt=Disabled&amp;qith=19fae1fffabd5224c0b8e537a892d612\">Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 1 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4a40b551ae11ec6ff40ac1ea0a8d2bc1c74fdba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a40b551ae11ec6ff40ac1ea0a8d2bc1c74fdba/0_0_4000_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nutcracker and I\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Key stage one\u2026 The Nutcracker and I.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Little Match Girl</h2> <p>Arthur Pita\u2019s bittersweet family show has become a staple of the Christmas schedules, and it is a funny, poignant and surreal piece of dance theatre.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Little Women (U) (Greta Gerwig, 2019, US) 135 mins Louisa May Alcott\u2019s classic kids\u2019 book is much hankered after by film-makers; and Greta Gerwig, in her follow-up to Lady Bird, looks as if she\u2019s very much cracked it. With a top-notch cast \u2013 Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern \u2013 complemented by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Gerwig has recalibrated the March sisters\u2019 story as a gently feminist fable for the 21st century. Out on Boxing Day. Cats (U) (Tom Hooper, 2019, UK/US) TBC mins Can this screen adaptation of the permanent-fixture Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ever recover from its disastrous first trailer launch? Its big idea \u2013 human performers seemingly shrunk to cat size \u2013 has taken a major shellacking, but who\u2019s to say this isn\u2019t going to end up as a cult classic of the future? Stranger things have happened \u2026 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (12A) (JJ Abrams, 2019, US) 142 mins And now, the end is near \u2026 wave goodbye to Luke, Leia and all the rest as Episode IX wraps up the third Star Wars trilogy. Time has taken its toll, with Carrie Fisher revived via CGI, Mark Hamill ghosting about the place and JJ Abrams landing the director\u2019s gig after Lucasfilm\u2019s change of direction. So where does Star Wars go from here? In Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige we \u2013 and Disney \u2013 trust. Spies in Disguise (PG) (Nick Bruno, Troy Quane, 2019, US) 102 mins Here\u2019s a fun prospect for a Christmas treat for the kids: Will Smith, superspy, gets turned into a pigeon in an animated yarn from the outfit behind Ice Age and Rio. Spider-Man\u2019s Tom Holland voices \u2013 to no one\u2019s surprise, let\u2019s face it \u2013 a nerdy young lab guy who\u2019s good with the gadgets (but is also accidentally responsible for the pigeon thing). Ideal for soaking up a few hours in the school holidays. Out on Boxing Day. Jumanji: The Next Level (12A) (Jake Kasdan, 2019, US) 123 mins Fuelled by eyebrow-waggler Dwayne Johnson\u2019s apparently inexhaustible supply of infectious goodwill, the 2017 Jumanji remake went down better than expected. This second bite at the brain-hopping video game brings the crew back together, plus Danny DeVito and Danny Glover as crotchety OAPs along for the ride. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Maya Jane Coles This year saw house producer, remixer and DJ Maya Jane Coles returning to her Nocturnal Sunshine moniker, culminating in last month\u2019s second album, Full Circle. A place for the bassier, murkier, more hip-hop-leaning side of her oeuvre (Coles wanted to be \u201cthe female Timbaland\u201d when she started producing at 14), expect it to crop up at this pre-Christmas blow-out. Night Tales, E8, Saturday 21 December Fatboy Slim Norman Cook \u2013 who for a new generation may be best known as Woody from The Circle\u2019s dad \u2013 headlines this night of exploratory dance music, offering up the big-beat bops that made his name. Route 94 will also be on hand with house bangers, there is hardcore-tinged electro from Prospa, and newcomers Eli &amp; Fur deliver on the moody electronics. Mayfield Depot, Manchester, Saturday 21 December John John like to keep things simple. On their Bandcamp page, their bio reads: \u201cFour arms, four legs, two heads, wood, metal and plastic. A band of two Johns from Crystal Palace, London, UK.\u201d Their ferocious, 26-minute-long second album, Out Here on the Fringes, takes their love of rocket-fuelled brevity and chucks in politically charged lyrics about austerity and single-use plastic. Broadcast, Glasgow, Saturday 21; Sneaky Pete\u2019s, Edinburgh, Sunday 22 December Joesef A year or so ago, the mononymous Joesef was performing at an open-mic night in his native Glasgow, unsure if he really wanted to be a singer. After some strong, supportive words from a friend-turned-manager, the 24-year-old started recording, turning a recent heartbreak into his debut EP, Play Me Something Nice. He has recently been longlisted for the BBC Sound of 2020 poll, which isn\u2019t a bad early confidence boost. SWG3: Galvanizers, Glasgow, Monday 23 December MC Liane Carroll\u2019s Cold Turkey Modestly majestic UK singer-pianist Carroll has a soul diva\u2019s earthiness, the turn-on-a-dime timing of a jazz improviser and the dark idiosyncrasies of a Tom Waits \u2013 a mix that has brought her an international reputation. Her Christmas shows at Ronnie\u2019s are remedies for seasonal hangovers both physical and spiritual. Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Thursday 26 &amp; Friday 27 December JF Two of the best \u2026 classical concerts The Soldier\u2019s Tale Stravinsky\u2019s pioneering music-theatre piece, which pares drama down to its bare essentials to tell the story of a soldier who sells his soul to the devil, is not perhaps the most obvious pre-Christmas fare. But with a lineup of outstanding instrumentalists led by the one of the greatest violinists around today, Isabelle Faust , and with the French actor Dominique Horwitz as the narrator, it promises to be a special musical treat. Faust precedes The Soldier\u2019s Tale with Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Sonata for Solo Violin, one of his final masterpieces; it\u2019s fearsomely difficult to play, but exactly the kind of technical challenge that the always immaculate Faust will no doubt take in her stride. Wigmore Hall, W1, Monday 23 December St John\u2019s Smith Square Christmas festival An extended choral festival in the weeks leading up to Christmas has become one of the most popular fixtures in the St John\u2019s Smith Square calendar. And concerts conducted by Stephen Layton and the choirs he directs have become almost as much of an institution as the festival itself. True to tradition, this year\u2019s event ends with Layton conducting the six cantatas that make up Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio and Handel\u2019s Messiah, both with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The Bach will be sung by the choir of Trinity College, Cambridge, where Layton is director of music, and the Handel by Polyphony, the chamber choir that he founded in 1986. St John\u2019s Smith Square, SW1, Sunday 22 &amp; Monday 23 December AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Hogarth: Place and Progress Try a Hogarthian Christmas instead of a Dickensian one. Rakes and harlots warm themselves by a brazier after a night\u2019s revelling while a churchgoer looks on in disapproval in a Covent Garden snow scene. Poverty and luxury, corruption and comedy constantly collide in this fairytale of old London. Dickens was a fan \u2013 as you will be. Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, WC2, to 5 January Olafur Eliasson In the bleak midwinter it is both eerie and uplifting to explore this Nordic artist\u2019s captivating chemistry of light and colour. Like the aurora borealis, his visions of intense illumination and deep shadow evoke wonder and awe. But Eliasson always returns you to reality and to the climate crisis we have created for the planet and ourselves. Tate Modern, SE1, to 5 January Jan de Beer You can\u2019t get more Christmassy than a Renaissance picture of the Nativity or the Adoration of the Magi, and the 16th-century Antwerp artist Jan de Beer painted plenty of them. His atmospheric Nativity in the Barber Institute\u2019s collection sets luminous angels and a glowing crib in a night-shrouded stable. It stars here in a survey of his paintings and drawings that gives a bit of context to those arty Christmas cards. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, to 19 January Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh I bet you don\u2019t get Christmas presents as good as the stuff Tutankhamun took into the beyond. When the uniquely unspoiled tomb of this young ruler of ancient Egypt was discovered in 1922 it was stacked with luxuries and treats, as if a drunken Santa had offloaded his entire stash there. Ready-to-assemble golden chariots, bows, boomerangs: this exhibition is a party cracker for all ages. Saatchi Gallery, SW3, to 3 May Inspired By the East European art\u2019s obsession with the \u201ceast\u201d begins with the three Magi. These gift-giving regulars in the Nativity story have been portrayed by European painters from Botticelli to Rembrandt in what was imagined to be \u201coriental\u201d garb. This exhibition reveals how Rubens and other artists based such depictions on portrayals of dress in the Ottoman empire as it surveys European art\u2019s secret love affair with Islam. British Museum, WC1, to 26 January JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Three Sisters Yes, it is another version of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters. But this one has been adapted by poet and playwright Inua Ellams, who wrote the acclaimed Barber Shop Chronicles. Ellams has set the play during the Nigerian civil war in 1967, with the three sisters longing to return home to Lagos. It stars Sarah Niles, Natalie Simpson and Racheal Ofori and is directed by the fearless Nadia Fall. National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, to 19 February La Clique The circus and cabaret act returns to London for the first time in 10 years. There is something about this cluster of variety turns, acrobats and musical acts that feels a little bit creaky \u2013 but oh so tempting. There is a juggling act with champagne glasses, aerialists and contortionists, and a fire-breathing routine to top things off. Leicester Square Spiegeltent, WC2, to 4 January Pippi Longstocking The Royal &amp; Derngate had a hit last year with The Worst Witch, which whizzed into the West End. This year, they\u2019re the first UK theatre to adapt Astrid Lindgren\u2019s much-loved books about Pippi Longstocking \u2013 in all her rowdy, red-haired glory. Mike Akers adapts, with original music from Kneehigh\u2019s Stu Barker, and direction from Jesse Jones and Helena Middleton from the Wardrobe Ensemble. A seriously imaginative creative team, who should produce something special. Royal &amp; Derngate: The Royal, Northampton, to 31 December Pinocchio Citizens Theatre staged a brilliant take on A Christmas Carol last year and have a knack for creating truly distinctive festive shows. High expectations, then, for Lu Kemp and Robert Alan Evans\u2019s adaptation of Carlo Collodi\u2019s Pinocchio, which reunites last year\u2019s winning gang, including director Dominic Hill. There will also be an immersive soundscape from Nikola Kodjabashia, dazzling puppetry and just a dash of darkness. Tramway, Glasgow, to 4 January Teenage Dick Michael Longhurst\u2019s opening season at the Donmar continues to surprise and fascinate. Mike Lew\u2019s play is a darkly comic twist on Richard III. It is set in a US high school where Richard, who has hemiplegia, lusts for power and revenge on his tormentors. But is it better to be loved or feared? Daniel Monks stars in the title role, with Ruth Madeley, who appeared in Russell T Davies\u2019s Years and Years, also featuring. Donmar Warehouse, WC2, to 1 February MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows The Little Match Girl Arthur Pita\u2019s bittersweet family show has become a staple of the Christmas schedules, and it is a funny, poignant and surreal piece of dance theatre. Pita\u2019s version of the Hans Christian Andersen tale comes with a touch of commedia dell\u2019arte, operatic arias and an unexpected lunar adventure, plus music by Frank Moon. For ages five and over. Sadler\u2019s Wells: Lilian Baylis Studio, EC1, to 29 December Russian State Ballet of Siberia One of the many Russian companies touring traditional classical ballets around the UK, this one comes with a live orchestra, which makes all the difference. They will be performing a seasonal Nutcracker and the most famous ballet of all, Swan Lake. St David\u2019s Hall, Cardiff, to 31 December; touring to 15 March The Nutcracker and I An imaginative take on the evergreen ballet by pianist Alexandra Dariescu, performing movements from Tchaikovsky\u2019s score while turning the ballet\u2019s story into her own biography, with the help of dancer Imogen Ash interacting with projected animations.

Across the Sea of Moyle, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2019/results/northern_ireland\" title=\"\">more Irish nationalists</a> than Ulster unionists were returned to Westminster for the first time since the creation of Northern Ireland almost a century ago.

      "bodyText": "One of the strangest features of a dismal general election was the almost complete absence of the union from the political debate. Despite Scotland coming pretty close to voting for independence five years ago \u2013 and Northern Ireland\u2019s well-documented civil strife \u2013 the future of the United Kingdom barely registered as a campaign issue (aside from Matt Hancock striking a pose, of course). If Boris Johnson thought the union was safe, the election results should have forced a rethink. With the Scottish National party vote surging, Nicola Sturgeon has already demanded a second vote on independence. Across the Sea of Moyle, more Irish nationalists than Ulster unionists were returned to Westminster for the first time since the creation of Northern Ireland almost a century ago. Inevitably, talk of a border poll on Irish unity has ratcheted up. The union\u2019s difficulties, as is so often the case, have mostly been caused by those who claim themselves to be its strongest defenders. The Tories\u2019 full name is the Conservative and Unionist party \u2013 though it\u2019s not always obvious. \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d might be a winning line in England \u2013 and parts of Wales \u2013 but it has placed the union in a perilous position. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland voted decisively against leaving the European Union \u2013 there is little sign of that opposition mellowing. In Northern Ireland, the DUP has paid a heavy price for supporting a Conservative government. And while some have written off the Scottish nationalist surge as purely an anti-Brexit wave, the scale of the SNP\u2019s success attests to a rising sense of anger among independence supporters. Johnson likes to depict himself as the UK\u2019s staunch defender, but he has purged his party of the moderates who could make a genuine unionist pitch. And unlike his predecessor, Theresa May, Johnson appears to have little or no intrinsic affection for the union. However, that doesn\u2019t mean he is about to give the green light to the referendums that would be needed for any constitutional change in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Quite the opposite. Johnson has already said that he will not permit another independence referendum, but conventional wisdom has it that the prime minister\u2019s intransigence will melt away over time, just like his opposition to a border in the Irish Sea \u2013 and that another SNP victory in the 2021 Scottish parliament elections will force a rethink. Really? Johnson has shown his willingness to goad his opponents and run roughshod over long-held conventions. He could very easily keep saying \u201cno\u201d to Scotland \u2013 and gain support in England by being seen to stand up to the uppity nationalists. The situation in Northern Ireland is, as ever, more fraught. The big election story is the success of the cross-community Alliance party, who doubled their vote and won a famous victory in North Down. The increasing number of Northern Irish voters who refuse to break along sectarian lines will decide its constitutional future. Many come from what would be traditionally unionist backgrounds: these are middle-class Protestants who want to live in a modern, functioning UK but might at some point choose to live in a still-to-be-defined new Ireland rather than a backward Northern Irish statelet ruled by a fundamentalist, kleptocratic political class. A vote on Irish unification could still be some time away. A border poll can only be called by the Northern Irish secretary, based on a reading of opinion polls. Once again, it is not hard to imagine a Johnson appointee refusing to heed the referendum calls that will likely grow after Brexit is done. But belligerence is hardly a long-term strategy for the union. Sooner or later, the public will need to be asked if they want constitutional change. And that\u2019s where things could get very messy. As it currently stands, any referendum on the union in Scotland or Northern Ireland would be open to all manner of electoral manipulation. Dominic Cummings \u2013 whose Vote Leave campaign was found guilty of breaking electoral law in the 2016 referendum \u2013 has just masterminded a general election campaign, alongside Lynton Crosby\u2019s protege Isaac Levido, that elevated lies and misinformation to party policy. Having won a huge victory by playing the system, Johnson has no motivation to change Britain\u2019s outdated and ineffective election laws. (In a grim irony, the Tories would doubtless have triumphed without industrial scale dissembling but having jacked open the Overton window there is little chance of them shutting it now.) Imagine what a border poll on Irish unity would look like in the current era of dark money and disinformation. The scope for malfeasance is so vast that the Constitution Unit at University College London has set up a project to examine how any future referendum on Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional future would best be designed and conducted.

It is enough to put the species at risk. </p> \n  <p>The NSW government today released a new State Environmental Planning Policy (Koala Habitat Protection) 2019. It clarifies the definition of core koala habitat and increase increases the number of tree species that can be used to identify koala habitat from 10 to 123.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are positive but local councils are still under no obligation to develop koala plans of management,\u201d campaigner <strong>Shirley Hall</strong> said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOnly a handful of the 88 councils in NSW identified as needing koala plans of management have developed them to a standard acceptable to the state government since the original koala SEPP was created in 1995.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPart of the problem is that some councils are hostile to koala conservation. Others simply lack the resources to create the plan.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It can cost up to $150,000 to put a koala plan of management in place in an individual local government area, Hall said. That cost would be covered with $12m in state funding, but the funding is not forthcoming. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the NSW Government is serious about koala conservation, it should make the development of koala plans of management compulsory for all identified regions and ensure all councils have the resources they need to implement them,\u201d Hall said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNinety-nine per cent of identified koala habitat on private land in NSW was risk of being cleared before these changes and that remains the case.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T07:18:11.145Z\">at 7.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfc6d1e8f087e8308e618d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T06:54:03.515Z\">6.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>To Queensland now, where AAP reports that 98 people (31 adults and 67 children) have been charged with arson by Queensland police.</p> \n  <p>Queensland has been battling devastating bushfires since August, losing 43 homes and 240,000 hectares of bushland.</p> \n  <p>Police said on Friday that 103 of the fires started since September were deliberately lit, and more than 120 fires are still being investigated to determine their ignition source. </p> \n  <p>Some 65 fires continued to burn across the state on Friday, jumping from 55 reported on Thursday. </p> \n  <p>Conditions are forecast to improve along the Queensland coast into next week but residents across the state should remain on alert about fire and heat warnings, the Bureau of Meteorology says.</p> \n  <p> \u201cIt is vital not to become complacent when hearing these continued warnings,\u201d forecaster Rosa Hoff told media on Friday. \u201cThe danger is as real as it was the first day we experienced it in Queensland.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T07:00:51.184Z\">at 7.00am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfc6b9f8f085eda5c10b20f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T06:40:45.201Z\">6.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There are now five fires burning at emergency warning level in South Australia. </p> \n  <p>The latest fire to be upgraded is a stubble fire at Dudley East on Kangaroo Island.

One person has died in a car crash near Lameroo, in the bushfire zone, but it\u2019s not clear at this stage whether they were fleeing the fire.

Three grassfires near Ballarat in western Victoria were under an emergency warning on Friday night.

New emergency warning for Victoria An emergency warning has been issued for the areas of Bamganie, Shelford, and Teesdale, which are west of Geelong. They are under immediate threat from the uncontrolled grassfire that started at Mount Mercer, near Ballarat. It is too late for residents in those towns to leave. Emergency warnings remain in place for fires burning in the Adelaide Hills, on Kangaroo Island, and on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. One person has died in a car crash near Lameroo, in the bushfire zone, but it\u2019s not clear at this stage whether they were fleeing the fire.

The CFS has established an emergency relief centre for the Maitland fire at the Minalton Bowling Club. The fire at Maitland has now been downgraded to a watch and act level. South Australian senator Penny Wong has expressed her condolences to the family of the person who died in a vehicle crash in the SA fires. The ABC just reported that fire has entered the main street of Charleston, a small town in the Adelaide Hills. The wind is swinging around to the south now, which will push the fire north. That means that what was previously the fire flank will become a very wide fire front. Behold: bats being watered in Melbourne, as the temperature climbed into the low 4os this afternoon. Flying foxes are very susceptible to the heat. More than 400 were killed in a heatwave in western Sydney last year. So I\u2019m sure they enjoyed the shower. Donations open for firefighters families If you want to help the families of Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, the firefighters killed when their truck rolled at the Green Wattle Creek fire on Thursday night, the RFS has set up an official bank account. Donations to that bank account will go to their families, both of which include very young children. The details are here. Keaton, 32, joined the RFS in 2006 and was the deputy captain of the Horsley Park brigade. O\u2019Dwyer, 36, joined in 2003 and was a member of the Horsley Park brigade. Koala habitat still at risk Meanwhile, the Nature Conservation Council says a policy announced today that is supposed to help koalas will \u201cfall well short of what is required to protect the species\u201d. A significant proportion of koala habitat in NSW has been destroyed or is under threat from bushfires, including genetically significant populations in the Blue Mountains. It is enough to put the species at risk. The NSW government today released a new State Environmental Planning Policy (Koala Habitat Protection) 2019. It clarifies the definition of core koala habitat and increase increases the number of tree species that can be used to identify koala habitat from 10 to 123. \u201cThese changes are positive but local councils are still under no obligation to develop koala plans of management,\u201d campaigner Shirley Hall said. \u201cOnly a handful of the 88 councils in NSW identified as needing koala plans of management have developed them to a standard acceptable to the state government since the original koala SEPP was created in 1995. \u201cPart of the problem is that some councils are hostile to koala conservation. Others simply lack the resources to create the plan.\u201d It can cost up to $150,000 to put a koala plan of management in place in an individual local government area, Hall said. That cost would be covered with $12m in state funding, but the funding is not forthcoming. \u201cIf the NSW Government is serious about koala conservation, it should make the development of koala plans of management compulsory for all identified regions and ensure all councils have the resources they need to implement them,\u201d Hall said. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of identified koala habitat on private land in NSW was risk of being cleared before these changes and that remains the case.\u201d To Queensland now, where AAP reports that 98 people (31 adults and 67 children) have been charged with arson by Queensland police. Queensland has been battling devastating bushfires since August, losing 43 homes and 240,000 hectares of bushland. Police said on Friday that 103 of the fires started since September were deliberately lit, and more than 120 fires are still being investigated to determine their ignition source. Some 65 fires continued to burn across the state on Friday, jumping from 55 reported on Thursday. Conditions are forecast to improve along the Queensland coast into next week but residents across the state should remain on alert about fire and heat warnings, the Bureau of Meteorology says. \u201cIt is vital not to become complacent when hearing these continued warnings,\u201d forecaster Rosa Hoff told media on Friday. \u201cThe danger is as real as it was the first day we experienced it in Queensland.\u201d There are now five fires burning at emergency warning level in South Australia. The latest fire to be upgraded is a stubble fire at Dudley East on Kangaroo Island. Another fire is burning at emergency warning level near Menzies on the north side of the island. The warning message from the CFS is very direct. Act now. Leave, if the path is clear to a safer place, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive. If you cannot leave, identify where you will seek shelter from the bushfire. Heat from the fire will kill you. Do not enter this area as conditions are dangerous. The other fires at emergency warning level are at Maitland on the Yorke Peninsula, Cudlee Creek in the Adelaide Hills, and Virginia on Adelaide\u2019s outskirts. The cool change is tracking through SA at the moment, but that is not good news in the short term. It means a wind change, increased wind speeds, and the possibility of more dry lightning, as there\u2019s no rain associated with the change. There\u2019s a thunderstorm warning for South Australia, including some areas that are currently affected by bushfires. So that\u2019s smoke, hail, and damaging winds, all in one place. Still in Victoria, a firefighter has reportedly been taken to hospital after suffering burns while trying to evacuate a childcare centre at Seaford, a suburb in Melbourne\u2019s south-east. The fire began as a house fire on Webb Street and spread to adjacent grasslands. It is uncontrolled and burning toward Frankston North, the CFA has said. The area is under a watch and act alert. The Country Fire Authority has issued an emergency warning for a fast-moving grass fire burning north of Ararat, at the Lexton-Ararat Rd at Amphitheatre. It\u2019s good evening from me, Amy Corderoy, on the LiveBlog tonight. Calla Wahlquist will take over from now. It\u2019s starting to feel apocalyptic... Four South Australian firefighters have been treated for burns and smoke inhalation and three firefighting vehicles have been destroyed, CFS officials have confirmed. The service has been called to more than 120 fires today, but resources from interstate have been hampered by weather conditions. \u201cWe called upon aerial support from New South Wales and Victoria, but, unfortunately, the prevailing weather conditions meant that we couldn\u2019t use them for all of this afternoon and they had to be grounded for safety reasons,\u201d a spokesman said. SA police commissioner Grant Stevens said three police officers had also been injured. \u201cWe have had three police officers who have been affected by smoke, one being admitted to hospital as a result of a fire in Rennella,\u201d he said. One person has died in South Australia and another is unaccounted for in the Cudlee Creek fire, the South Australian Premier has confirmed. Steven Marshall described the incident as \u201cvery sad\u201d and thanked authorities for doing all they could to help the victim. \u201cI want to say thank you very much to all of the volunteers who have done everything they possibly can, our CFS, our MFS, ambulance officers, State Emergency Services for the outstanding work they have done I will Oxley police commissioner to provide more details in a moment regarding the tragedy which has occurred in Lameroo,\u201d he said. SA police commissioner Grant Stevens said the person had died in a vehicle accident. \u201cIt is unclear at this time the exact circumstances of the vehicle collision and because of the fire, but they are currently being investigated,\u201d he said. Australia recorded its second hottest day on record on Thursday, with an average maximum temperature of 41C (105.8F), the Bureau of Meteorology says. It continues the record stretch this week: the last three days are the three hottest recorded. Tuesday 17 December recorded an average of 40.9C across the continent, beating the previous record of 40.3C set on 7 January 2013. That new benchmark was smashed on Wednesday, which brought a new mark of 41.9C. Eight people have been taken to hospital with burns and smoke inhalation in South Australia as fires continue to burn there, the ABC reports. Dangerous fires are still burning in NSW and South Australia this afternoon. In NSW Gospers Mountain and Green Wattle Creek are still listed at emergency level. In South Australia there are out-of-control fires in Maitland, Cudlee Creek and Lamaroo. People have been urged to leave their houses in four Victorian towns, as much of the state has been suffering from poor air quality caused by the NSW fires. \u201cCatastrophic\u201d fire conditions are expected at three sites across NSW tomorrow: Greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven and the Southern Ranges. The NSW RFS says it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if more properties weren\u2019t lost, and that people in fire zones should not assume fire trucks will reach them if disaster strikes. Fire authorities have warned motorists to be vigilant, and avoid contributing to congestion in fire-affected areas. Here is where you can find information on fire-related road closures in your state: Live Traffic NSW Traffic SA Mainroads Western Australia Vicroads alerts ACT City Services Queensland traffic Residents in four Victorian towns have been urged to leave their homes immediately as two bushfires rage out-of-control. A watch-and-act warning was issued on Friday for residents of Dunkeld, Karabeal and Moutajup, about 280km west of Melbourne near the Grampians. \u201cDon\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\u201d the warning reads. The bushfire is travelling in a southerly direction towards the Glenelg Highway, prompting road closures. People are advised not to return home if they are out, to travel to the home of family or friends that are away from the warning area and to take their pets, medication and phones. Another watch-and-act warning was issued at Brookville, about 390 kilometres northeast of Melbourne. A wind change is pushing a fire at Marthavale, which has been burning since November 21, in a northerly direction towards the town. Residents there are also being advised to leave, warning \u201cemergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay\u201d. More than 40 fire trucks are at the scene. The Marthavale fire is directly west of three fires in the East Gippsland region, where about 500 firefighters from the County Fire Authority are working to contain the blazes and strengthen containment lines. Our reporter Helen Davidson is on the ground at the firefront: Aerial support has been going all day, without relief. At least one helicopter, a black hawk, and a skycrane, have been feverishly darting around the ridges and gullies surrounding Balmoral, Buxton, and nearby villages. To the east of Balmoral, members of the local brigade are watching the support dump tonnes of water on a fire that is refusing to die down. A couple, who have lived on this picturesque edge of the bush for 20 years, have seen three fires go through, and are staying to defend their home if the blaze just over the Ridgeline gets blown towards them. \u201cWe always defend,\u201d Justin says. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave t up to the firies, they\u2019ve got enough to do.\u201d This isn\u2019t always advisable, by the way, but Justin and Helena built their house to be certifiably defendable, and had two fire captains come through to check. It\u2019s been tested \u2013 a 2013 fire hit them but the house survived. I ask how he\u2019s felling about tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the wind picks up everyone is going to be in trouble. Heat we can manage but wind is what drives the fire. With that southerly that came through yesterday, you saw what happened to Bargo.\u201d He gestures at three different directions where fires ring the village. No matter what the wind does, it\u2019ll push a fire towards them. \u201cBuxton is even worse because they\u2019re surrounded.\u201d As we stand talking, the fire on the ridge kicks up again and a thick plume of black smoke shoots up as a couple of trees start crowning. It\u2019s a long night ahead. The Gospers Mountain fire will tomorrow move towards the Kurrajong Heights area and up towards the Blue Mountains. NSW RFS Deputy commissioner Rob Rogers says while the winds wont drive the fire towards the Blue Mountains, the steep terrain will. \u201cThere will be some burning in the far west part of the mountains that is going on tonight to try to protect some of those communities around Blackheath,\u201d he told a press conference on Friday afternoon. \u201cAnd that is simply to try to protect as many properties as we can tomorrow for what we know will be a tough day.\u201d Fire authorities are also working to prevent the Green Wattle fire from heading north, Rogers says. \u201cWe know tomorrow... that fire will start causing us problems again and we will be dealing with that and we will be doing our best to stop it getting across the Hume Highway, because if it gets across the Hume Highway that opens up a whole new front for us.\u201d More than 800 buildings have now been lost to the NSW fires, with more to come amidst catastrophic conditions tomorrow. \u201cI think that\u2019s a fairly sure thing that we will lose homes somewhere tomorrow. It would be a miracle if we didn\u2019t,\u201d deputy commissioner Rob Rogers says. The NSW Rural Fire Service has warned people living in catastrophic fire danger areas that they cannot count on the service to arrive in time to save them tomorrow. Deputy commissioner Rob Rogers told a press briefing this afternoon that people should consider relocating. \u201cDo not put yourself near an isolated bush area if your home is directly on the bush. Do not be there in the heat of the day. We cannot guarantee [we will] get firetrucks to you. \u201cWe have so much in the landscape. We will do our best but we cannot guarantee that.\u201d He said a number of major thoroughfares in and out of towns could be affected. \u201cPrinces Highway will be affected by tomorrow. We have the Great Western Highway, the Bells Line of Road is already closed.\u201d Fire activity is increasing again in Gospers Mountain. A well-known vineyard is burning under catastrophic conditions in the Adelaide Hills. Golding Wines, near Charleston, is in the middle of the danger zone for the out-of-control Cudlee Creek fire. According to Nine News, \u201cthousands\u201d of vines were burning at the property and flames were licking toward Cellar Door. The winery hasn\u2019t confirmed the extent of the loss, except to reply to one well-wisher on Twitter. The Country Fire Authority in South Australia said \u201cquite a number of properties\u201d had been impacted by the Cudlee Creek fire, but that it was too early to confirm numbers. The out-of-control fire burning in the Adelaide Hills is unlikely to be contained soon, according to the state\u2019s fire service. Country Fire Service chief Mark Jones said crews were battling thick smoke as the fire continued to head south-east and burn towards the towns of Charleston, Woodside and Inverbrackie. Jones said the terrain and the prevailing conditions were proving particularly challenging for fire crews. \u201cAccess is difficult and dangerous for firefighters, the lack of visibility also makes it very difficult for crews,\u201d he said. Spot fires ahead of the main front were also thought to have damaged some properties around the town of Lobethal. Many locals residents had opted to leave but some were remaining to defend their homes. The most recent emergency-level fire to threaten lives and homes in South Australia was triggered by lightening strikes, the Country Fire Service has confirmed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just one lightning strike, there have been a number of lightning strikes. There is quite a grouping of fires in that area. Some are appearing to move towards together,\u201d Deputy Chief Officer of the South Australian Country Fire Service, Andrew Stark, has just told ABC television. \u201cWe have a number of aircraft working on that fire, as well as the aircraft we have working back in the Adelaide Hills, four on the firing Peninsula at this stage, and seven swing bombers and helicopter is working on the fire back in the Adelaide Hills. \u201cCurrently, the two groups who have come to our assistance from New South Wales and Victoria are on the ground given that they are unsafe to operate in the Adelaide Hills at this time.\u201d The fire at Angle Vale, previously at emergency level, has been brought under control. People have been urged to leave Brookville, in Victoria, with an out-of-control bushfire threatening homes. A \u201cwatch and act\u201d warning was issued on Friday for residents of Brookville, in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland region, about 390km north-east of Melbourne. \u201cDon\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option \u2013 conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\u201d the warning reads. Three NSW regions including Greater Sydney are set to endure catastrophic fire danger on Saturday amid intense heat, strong winds and dry conditions. The NSW Rural Fire Service has forecast catastrophic fire danger for parts of the state - including Greater Sydney - as another \u201cdangerously hot\u201d day looms. The RFS on Friday confirmed that Greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven and the Southern Ranges would on Saturday endure catastrophic fire risks. Greater Hunter and the Central Ranges would experience extreme fire risk. The Bureau of Meteorology warned temperatures could rise into the mid-40s in western Sydney on Saturday, with strong winds and intensely dry conditions creating additional danger. The RFS will address media on Friday afternoon. An emergency fire warning has been issued for Maitland, in the Yorke Peninsula. It is now too late to leave and the Country Fire Service advises taking shelter in a solid building. Trying to find some good news today is pretty difficult. So please accept these adorable rescue puppies for your viewing pleasure. And the record for hottest December day in Victoria falls as well. Geoff Goldrick, a deputy captain with the NSW Rural Fire Service in Northern NSW, has written a powerful piece reflecting on the extraordinary events of this year. 2019 may go down in history as Year Zero of the climate apocalypse. The tsunami of extreme events has been so relentless that each is quickly forgotten in favour of its successor. Three temperature records have fallen so far today in South Australia Scary footage coming out of South Australia now, of the fire at Lobethal. Authorities have issued an emergency warning for a bushfire which is threatening the Israelite Bay campsite on Western Australia\u2019s south coast. The uncontrolled fire is moving quickly towards the campsite, near Esperance on Western Australia\u2019s south coast, and poses a threat to both homes and lives in the area. Firefighters are on their way and people in the area should leave now if there is a clear path. Air Quality has deteriorated rapidly in Victoria, with much of Melbourne now listed as poor or very poor. View of the smoke from the NSW bushfires shrouding Melbourne\u2019s CBD: And here is an aerial view of the smoke: Properties are thought to have been lost or damaged and others remain under threat from two serious bushfires burning near Adelaide. Country Fire Service chief Mark Jones said the fires in the Adelaide Hills and at Angle Vale, both subject to emergency warnings, were unlikely to be contained soon. The CFS says 28 fires have been sparked across the state amid catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, AAP reports. Jones said the terrain and the prevailing conditions in the Adelaide Hills, were making access difficult for fire crews. \u201cThe lack of visibility also makes it very difficult for crews,\u201d he said. Spot fires ahead of the main front were thought to have damaged some properties around the town of Lobethal with the blaze now burning towards Woodside. Properties were also thought to have been damaged or lost in the Angle Vale blaze, but Jones said it was too early to confirm details. The CFS had 59 fire trucks and 11 aircraft tackling the Adelaide Hills fire with 31 trucks and six aircraft deployed to Angle Vale. More than 500 firefighters were in the field across both incidents and extra aerial resources have also been brought in from NSW and Victoria. First the fire, now the rain. Four firefighters have been injured in South Australia at the Cudlee Creek fire, which is at emergency level. It\u2019s currently burning in a south-east direction towards Woodside. Tomorrow\u2019s conditions are looking to be worse but O\u2019Connor is barely even thinking about that yet. He sighs. \u201cWhat you can see we\u2019ve got now \u2013 we\u2019ve got the potential where the village is going to be sandwiched from both sides. We\u2019re coming in from the west, and from the east. Our village has never been affected from the east before.\u201d He says the conditions are erratic, volatile, and the wind is completely unpredictable, pushing fire right into the village before retreating and making another advance. He says residents had plans in place and most people left yesterday, heeding the warnings. O\u2019Connor is fielding a lot of calls from residents but says that\u2019s what they want. Today, as occurred five times yesterday, residents will come to the station to shelter if an emergency klaxon sounds. We\u2019re in Balmoral where the situation is incredibly serious. There are fires on both sides of the village, which was hit five times yesterday by the Green Wattle Creek blaze. Several houses are confirmed lost, and as we sit here residents are walking into the fire station having been forced to abandon their property. Several waterbombing aircraft, including the skycranes, are flying overhead trying to control a blaze to the east before a wind change which is is predicted any time. Brendan O\u2019Connor is the brigade captain of the RFS village unit here, and is visibly shaken. \u201cA massive amount of village was taken yesterday \u2026 and then the lives and the injuries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a tragic thing, unfortunately we\u2019ve seen too much of it this year. It\u2019s just wearing everyone down. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost at least six to eight homes in our village. What it did, it crossed over to our eastern side of our village, so we still have very active fire on our western side plus on our eastern. It\u2019s now moving up on the main body of our village itself.\u201d A skycrane roars overhead as we speak. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting as hard as they can to stop us losing more properties in our village.\u201d Two firefighters died here, and three others are in induced comas after a burnover in Bargo. \u201cMost of us have worked with those gentlemen, so our sincere condolences to the families. It\u2019s absolutely shattering,\u201d says O\u2019Connor. \u201cWe\u2019ve know those guys [from Bargo] for 20-odd years, so we\u2019re as close as family can be. It\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking for every one of us. It\u2019s just so tragic, so tragic.\u201d Victorians are now facing very poor to hazardous air quality in some parts of the state. Have a look at the time lapse as it captures the smoke rolling in. The Latrobe Valley and Melbourne are both predicted to have very poor air quality. The Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills is burning in a south-easterly direction towards Woodside. While NSW areas closer to the water have felt some relief from the smoke, inland is still strongly affected, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. And haunting pictures from our reporter, Helen Davidson, on the ground witnessing the clean-up in Buxton. If you haven\u2019t already, check out our interactive map showing the scale of the fires compared to major cities. Here is the fire area mapped over London. Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains is at watch and act level. An emergency warning has been released for the Northern Expressway Angle Vale fire. This means homes and lives are under threat at two locations around Adelaide. Already 36 firetrucks and eight aircraft have been sent to fight the Cudlee Creek fire, with a further 20 sent to Angle Vale, which is also burning uncontrolled in grassland. The fire is burning towards homes at suburban Munno Para Downs, AAP reports. In both cases, the Country Fire Service says crews are unable to stop the fires from spreading. The federal and state governments have also announced they will provide $6m to attract tourists back to fire-ravaged Queensland communities. The federal and state government funding is a stimulus for tourism-reliant areas hit by fires that includes the Scenic Rim, southern downs, Sunshine Coast and Noosa. Tourism marketing for the affected areas will receive $1.5m, said the federal emergency minister, David Littleproud, and the state development minister, Cameron Dick. A further $1m will go towards restoring walking trails in the Lamington national park, and $500,000 will go towards industry recovery workers. Still in Queensland, where firefighters are continuing to keep watch on a dangerous fire burning on multiple fronts at Lowmead near Gladstone, where several homes are feared lost. The eastern side of the fire is burning in the vicinity of Cross Road, Hills Road, Whytallabah Road and Kirkpatrick Road, according to AAP. Firefighters will continue to work with heavy machinery and water-bombing aircraft to strengthen containment lines. While contained, the fire could burn for several days and crews will remain in the area. Sunshine Coast residents also remain on alert after being forced to evacuate a volatile bushfire on Wednesday. It was the third major fire in the region since September, as police continue to investigate the cause. Conditions are forecast to improve along the Queensland coast into next week, the Bureau of Meteorology says. A forecaster, Kimba Wong, said the sea breeze from the central coast to the border could provide some relief. \u201cFortunately along the coastal fringe we do have the sea breeze coming in bringing a touch of moisture and slightly more moderated temperatures,\u201d she said. Almost 70 fires are now burning across Queensland, jumping from 55 reported on Thursday, as the fire threat deepens. Crews are braced for challenging conditions as a strong upper ridge sweeping across the south-east combines with fresh east-north-easterly winds on Friday, AAP reports. The volatile conditions have prompted the weather bureau to reissue a severe fire warning for the Darling Downs and granite belt, central highlands and coalfields, and the eastern parts of the Warrego and Maranoa districts on Friday. Areas of localised severe fire dangers are also in place for the eastern parts of the central west district. The fires remain at \u201cwatch and act\u2019 levels. In about 20 minutes the cool change will begin to sweep through South Australia, starting with Port Lincoln and heading to Adelaide about 4pm. Leighton Drury, the NSW state secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union and a serving firefighter, has slammed both the New South Wales and federal governments over what he calls a lack of leadership and resourcing. Both the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have consistently said crews in the state have the resources they need to battle the more than 100 fires now burning across the state. But at a press conference today Drury said the union believed the state\u2019s professional firefighting force was 400 staff short, and he\u2019d been told some regional crews were facing further cuts. Drury told media that senior Fire and Rescue NSW figures had told him on Thursday that two regional communities \u2013 Urunga near Coffs Harbour on the state\u2019s mid-coast and Peak Hill, south of Dubbo \u2013would have their minimum staffing reduced from four firefighters to two as a result of budget cuts. Drury said the cuts were emblematic of a wider lack of resourcing within Fire and Rescue NSW, the state\u2019s professional fire service. The union estimates that since 2011 firefighter numbers have remained at best stagnant while the state\u2019s population has grown by approximately 800,000. The union believes the state\u2019s force is 400 professional firefighters short. \u201cI\u2019m calling on the premier, the treasurer and the emergency services minister to get in a room with Fire and Rescue NSW we know we\u2019re 400 firefighters short across the state, 300 in regional NSW,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just on current numbers, that\u2019s not to deal with the crisis we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d The state\u2019s professional firefighters have been working alongside the Rural Fire Service volunteers. \u201cThe RFS are doing all they can but, let\u2019s be honest, you can\u2019t ask people to do things for free for months on end they have their own lives. We\u2019re coming into Christmas, they have their own jobs, they\u2019ve got to earn a quid which is why we need professional firefighters to take care of these fires. \u201cThe RFS, they\u2019ve been at this now for three months this is not just the last two weeks. These fires started in August. We\u2019ve been telling the government since March. They\u2019re not listening and they need to fix it.\u201d And there are 100 fires burning across the state, with half yet to be contained. The air certainly looks a lot clearer in NSW this morning but the rolling tally of hazardous PM 2.5 over the past 24 hours shows just how badly the state has been affected by the fires. The worst-hit area over the past 24 hours was Orange, where the PM 2.5 index reached more than 1,000, or 10 times the limit recommended by the National Environment Protection Measure for Ambient Air standard. Thirty of the 36 recorded sites in NSW exceeded the recommended limits for PM2.5 over the past 24 hours. In greater Sydney the worst-hit area was Oakdale, in Sydney\u2019s south-west, which was five times the limit. David Littleproud has also responded to criticism of Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cwant to be there\u201d comments that were attacked by Anthony Albanese earlier today. The emergency management minister says the statement was \u201cnit-picked\u201d and \u201ctwisted\u201d and was meant to pay tribute to the desire of volunteers to help out. \u201cI get the emotion at the moment but we need to cool it a bit,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to nitpick every statement. [These were] quite innocent comments about the commitment of our firefighters ... I think that is the point he tried to make. To twist it, it is not the time to do it. It is about the professionalism of those men and women.\u201d Australia\u2019s emergency management minister, David Littleproud, is speaking now. He says that \u201cretrospectively\u201d, Scott Morrison might not have gone on holiday had he known how bad the bushfire crisis would be. \u201cYou cannot predict mother nature,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as this has intensified, obviously the prime minister has made the decision he needed to come back. Retrospectively, it would have been great to know, and he might not have taken his leave.\u201d A reporter asks, given that the fires had begun before Morrison left, should \u201che probably have stuck around\u201d? \u201cThat\u2019s a matter of commentary,\u201d Littleproud says. He says \u201cthere were always mechanisms in place\u201d for other members of the executive to keep people safe in emergencies. \u201cHe is a human being and we all know time to recharge. I personally needed time to recharge as well. I am no saint in comparison to these brave men and women on the frontline.\u201d In contrast, here is the view of Parliament House last night. An update on the Cudlee Creek fire: The SA Country Fire Service is appealing to people to shelter from the fire in solid buildings. Eight water-bombing aircraft and 34 firetrucks have been deployed to the out-of-control bushfire burning in the Adelaide Hills amid catastrophic weather conditions, AAP reports. An emergency warning is in place for the blaze at Cudlee Creek which is burning in a southerly direction. The Country Fire Service says it is an immediate threat to lives and homes as it burns uncontrolled in grassland. Conditions in the area are continually changing. A second fire has also broken out north of the city at Angle Vale. The fires come as SA is set to have its worst day for fire conditions so far this summer, with catastrophic risk declared in six districts. Areas affected include Cudlee Creek, Lenswood and Lobethal at Mount Crawford, Forest Fox Creek North of Croft Road, between Cudlee Creek and Lenswood. In NSW, evacuees from the fire are recovering from their experiences yesterday and preparing for what is to come. In the state\u2019s southern highlands, Craig Madsen is in charge of one of the many evacuation centres. The Mittagong RSL has become an evacuation site for those affected by the highly volatile Green Wattle Creek fire \u2013 the only NSW fire still at emergency today. Yesterday the flames flared near Bargo, jumped up into the trees, destroyed dozens of homes and injured five firefighters, two of them seriously. \u201cWhen that fire flared up, it splits the shire in half, to a degree,\u201d Madsen says. Parts of the region came to Mittagong, more went north to Picton bowling club. \u201cWe had some people who escaped to the south to us, and a significant proportion, around Balmoral, Tahmoor, they went to the north.\u201d Today, he says, it has quietened down. But tomorrow the forecast is for extreme danger. At the moment, we\u2019re coping quite well. Yesterday was a little hectic but the Red Cross, Salvation Army and disaster assistance people rolled in, got everything organised quite well. Can\u2019t fault them at all, well-prepared. The people who came in were looked after. We had in excess of a hundred people I would say. A lot of people were there with their dogs and cats, they come with their animals. We had a lot of people from the hilltop area, that had been isolated. Most of the evacuees were either allowed back to their homes or temporary accommodation was found for them by 10pm. NSW is set for \u201cdangerously hot\u201d conditions tomorrow, with maximum temperatures of 47C and treacherous surf. And the Bureau of Meteorology warns that when a cool change comes through on Saturday afternoon the winds will be close to gale-force. Saturday could be even hotter than yesterday, when two firefighters were killed and several others admitted to hospital during an exhausting day battling out-of-control bushfires. The bureau\u2019s acting NSW manager, Jane Golding, said temperatures would again rise into the mid-40s, with Penrith expecting a maximum of 47C and coastal areas hitting the mid-to-high 30s, AAP reports. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerously hot weather,\u201d Golding said. A gusty cool change is also expected on Saturday, which will bring some relief from the heat for central and southern NSW but create challenging fire conditions. \u201cThose southerlies when they come through [will] be close to gale-force,\u201d Golding said. \u201cThe other thing with this system is it is bringing through some swell behind it, so dangerous conditions in the waters on the beach tomorrow as well.\u201d The good news is that once the cooler weather arrives, it should stick around \u201cfor quite a few days\u201d, Golding said. Extinction Rebellion protesters have taken over Sydney\u2019s CBD, staging a dramatic protest on Pitt Street this morning. The extreme heat in Victoria has caused several sporting events to be rescheduled or even cancelled. Melbourne Victory\u2019s W-League match against Brisbane Roar has been moved from Friday night to Saturday morning. The game was scheduled to kick off at 5pm on Friday at Epping Stadium but, due to a forecast temperature of 42.6\u00b0C at kick-off, the FFA elected to move the game. It will now take place at 10.30am on Saturday, allowing the fixture to be held before the Roar fly back to Brisbane that afternoon. New Zealand\u2019s cricketers have abandoned the opening day of their warm-up game ahead of the second Test against Australia because of sweltering conditions forecast for Melbourne. Team management cancelled Friday\u2019s play on player welfare grounds because of a predicted maximum temperature ranging from 43C to 45C. The match against a Victoria XI at Scotch College, scheduled for Friday and Sunday, will become a one-day first-class match. And Racing Victoria has called off Friday night\u2019s horse racing meeting at Moonee Valley because of the extreme heat. \u201cFollowing consultation with our vets and the BOM it was determined that abandoning the meeting was the most appropriate decision for the welfare of our horses and participants,\u201d RV said. The representative body for rural firefighters has issued a statement mourning the loss of the two volunteers killed last night. The NSW Rural Fire Service Association president, Brian McDonough, said: \u201cThe RFS family is in mourning. Our hearts are breaking for the families, friends, and fellow crew members of Deputy Captain Geoffrey Keaton and Firefighter Andrew O\u2019Dwyer from Horsley Park Brigade. \u201cOur members know that what we do can be dangerous, but nothing can take away the pain we all feel when facing such terrible loss.\u201d You can read more about the loss of these two men, both of whom were fathers, here. An emergency warning has been issued for a bushfire burning out of control in the Adelaide Hills. The Country Fire Service issued the warning for the fire, which is burning amid catastrophic weather conditions. The CFS says the blaze near Cudlee Creek is an immediate threat to lives and homes. The fire is burning uncontrolled in grassland and firefighters are unable to stop it spreading, AAP reports. The day has barely started but South Australia is already sweltering. It\u2019s not even 10am local time and Adelaide has surpassed the 40C mark. The highest temperature so far in SA is 43.5\u00b0C, at Roseworthy. I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but it was pretty hot yesterday. But not that hot, according to the Australian today, which has dedicated a large portion of its fire coverage to assuring readers that the Bureau of Meteorology is \u201ccooling the past\u201dto declare current heat record. It\u2019s a shame this blog doesn\u2019t have emojis, because this seems the occasion for a face-palm. The Oz quotes Dr Jennifer Marohasy, who has a PhD in biology and whose previous work on climate change and temperature analysis with the Institute of Public Affairs has been decried as \u201cjunk science\u201d. She believes that the methodology of the bureau\u2019s temperature calculations is \u201ctotally flawed\u201d and that none of the weather we are experiencing is unprecedented. Good morning, this is Amy Corderoy taking over from Naaman Zhou on the blog this morning. We\u2019ve got a good read on our opinion pages from Brigid Delaney this morning, on the how 2019 has come to be defined by fire and ash. [This is] the year some undeniable bomb dropped and dispersed its truth all around us in the form of dark particles in the air that didn\u2019t just sit around us \u2013 but entered our bodies in unholy communion, its fine matter an anti-sustenance that made us sick and afraid. Yesterday was Adelaide\u2019s hottest night in 11 years, and the hottest night on record for the West Terrace observation site, on the edge of the CBD. It only cooled to 33.6C degrees \u2013 at 10:24pm. At 11pm, it was back up to 37.9C. It\u2019s already 38.3C there now, as of 8.30am local time. The RFS has just shared the details of the two volunteers tragically killed last night. They were 32-year-old deputy captain Geoffrey Keaton, and 36-year old Andrew O\u2019Dwyer. Both were from the Horsley Park brigade. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has also just spoken. \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart this morning that we, of course, confirm the deaths of two RFS volunteers overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tragic blow for their family, for the RFS, extended family and of course for the entire community, and out of respect for those two brave outstanding young men, flags will be at half-mast today throughout the state. \u201cWhat the incident overnight demonstrates, which Commissioner Fitzsimmons will give further details on, is how fragile situations can be ... Today milder conditions exist throughout the state but we still have two fire spots \u2013 hot spots \u2013 that are concerning RFS.\u201d She says people should check the Fires Near Me app, and live traffic sites. \u201cThe best thing we can do to support our firefighters today, tomorrow especially as conditions will worsen, and across the next few days, is to make sure we take their advice.\u201d The state\u2019s emergency services minister, David Elliot, adds that it \u201creally is a black armband day for the Rural Fire Service\u201d. \u201cThe loss of these two young men, just dads from western Sydney, is a real tragedy.\u201d Anthony Albanese has defended Scott Morrison\u2019s holiday, saying it was a personal matter. \u201cIt is a matter for the prime minister,\u201d the opposition leader said. \u201cHe made the decision and it is a matter for his judgment when he goes on holiday. \u201cI think one of the issues has been the lack of information and transparency around this.\u201d But he said Morrison should retract comments he made earlier in the month, that volunteer firefighters \u201cwanted to be there\u201d. \u201cHe should really retract those comments that he made because it was raised with me on multiple occasions this morning. Those comments are inappropriate. These people don\u2019t want to be out fighting fires.\u201d Albanese said there should be a more national response, and more support for the state-based volunteer crews. \u201cWe need to do much better at providing that support because this is not business as usual. These are extraordinary fires ... But we need to do much better right now as well.\u201d NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have both expressed their condolences to the families of the two firefighters who died last night. Scott Morrison has just been interviewed on 2GB radio. He says he made the decision to return home \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after the news of the deaths of RFS volunteers overnight. But when asked specifically when he would return, he said he still did not know. Yesterday the acting PM, Michael McCormack, said Morrison was due to return to the PM role on Monday night. Morrison was just asked when he would return. He said: \u201cWe are still trying to arrange that. We are working on that right now.\u201d He was also asked whether he understood how Australians could think it odd that news of his leave came while he was not in Australia but already overseas. He said he had been open about the leave. \u201cMichael [McCormack] stood up as acting PM on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cI texted Anthony Albanese on Monday saying that Michael would be acting prime minister for the next week.\u201d He did confirm that he was in Hawaii. \u201cThe girls and Jen love holidaying in Hawaii and we\u2019ve had a few nice days here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spend a lot of time in Australia as well. We had planned to spend it down the south coast but we had to bring it forward due to those commitments in India and Japan. \u201cThat\u2019s what dads try and do when they work hard all year ... That\u2019s all I was trying to do. It\u2019s just unfortunate it came at such an awful time. \u201cI am pleased to be returning,\u201d he said. As of this morning, one fire in NSW is still at emergency level, the Green Wattle Creek fire, in the Wollondilly shire. The huge Gospers Mountain fire, in the Blue Mountains, is at watch and act, after it flared to emergency yesterday. There is still a total fire ban effective across NSW, which lasts until the end of Saturday \u2013 and a total fire ban today for SA. Welcome to our continuing coverage of this week\u2019s record-breaking heatwave, and the months-long bushfire crisis. In unbearably sad news overnight, two Rural Fire Services volunteer firefighters have been confirmed to have died last night, when their truck overturned near Buxton in south-west Sydney. Three other members of the same crew are injured. This comes after another crew of five was injured on Thursday afternoon. Two firefighters were airlifted to hospital with serious burns. And just this morning, Scott Morrison issued a statement, apologising for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by his personal family leave, taken this week, and saying he will return \u201cas soon as can be arranged\u201d. Yesterday, the acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, said Morrison would return to the job on Monday night. On Wednesday, Australia experienced its hottest day on record, breaking the mark previously set on Tuesday.",

However, Javid defended the choice of Bailey, saying the veteran central banker had \u201cexperience, the record and the character\u201d for the job and that he was \u201cwithout doubt the best candidate\u201d. Praising his rigour and intelligence, the chancellor said Bailey had enhanced his status during the 2008 financial crisis when he led the Bank\u2019s team responding to the implosion of the banking sector. Having previously worked at the Bank for his whole career before leaving in 2016 to run the FCA, Bailey has held several top positions at the central bank, including deputy governor. His appointment was announced on Friday in the same room at the Treasury where Gordon Brown declared the independence of the Bank of England in 1997, and comes at a time of mounting political pressure on Threadneedle Street and other central banks around the world. Carney had faced intense criticism for his warnings over the potential impact of Brexit on the UK economy. There has been speculation that Boris Johnson was interested in appointing Gerard Lyons, a close ally and supporter of Brexit who was his economic advisor as London mayor. There have also been questions over the future structure of the civil service as Johnson looks to reshape Whitehall, making it an overtly political operation. Javid is understood to have decided on Bailey. On Friday, the chancellor was at pains to stress the Bank\u2019s independence, which the City regards as vital for maintaining Threadneedle Street\u2019s credibility. \u201cIt is striking that even at a time where there are very different views on the best way to run our economy, all parties agree that the independence of the Bank of England is essential to a strong economy,\u201d Javid said. Bailey, who will become the 121st governor in the Bank\u2019s 325 year history, is to serve an eight-year term and will be paid \u00a3495,000 a year. His overall pay and pensions package is expected to be less than Carney\u2019s. Bailey\u2019s selection will be regarded by many observers as a missed opportunity to appoint a woman to lead the central bank for first time . The shortlist is understood to have included two women, Minouche Shafik, a former Bank deputy governor who is now director of the London School of Economics, and Shriti Vadera, the Labour peer and investment banker who chairs Santander UK. There have also been questions over whether the UK could attract a leading international figure at a time of heightened political turmoil over Brexit. Kevin Walsh, a former member of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, was also thought to have been in the running.",

There were multiple reports of homes and other buildings on fire in the worst blaze, at Cudlee Creek. More than 100 fires are currently burning across NSW and half of them are not contained, including the \u201cmegafire\u201d in Gospers Mountain, north-west of Sydney, that has been burning for almost two months and has so far destroyed more than 350,000 hectares.

Thick smoke also continued to blanket the east of the country, including Australia\u2019s largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, on Friday, prompting health warnings for residents. Political pressure on the prime minister also mounted on Friday, with Scott Morrison apologising for going on holiday while Australia was in the grip of an extended bushfire crisis. \u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\u201d Morrison said.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></h2> <p>No team or player has been more disappointing than the Browns this season. Their whole season has been a mess. To recap:</p> <p>-- Cleveland entered the season <a href=\"http://pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/preseason_odds.htm\">tied for eighth in the Vegas odds</a> to win it all. They are currently 6-8, and out of the playoffs.</p> <p>-- Baker Mayfield, the should-be face-of-the-franchise has regressed into a middle-of-the-pack quarterback, unable and unwilling to pull the trigger and throw downfield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/20/kameron-kelly-steelers-jukebox-arrest\">Steelers cut rookie after terroristic threats charge over jukebox dispute</a> </p> </aside>  <p>-- An offense featuring Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, David Njoku, Nick Chubb, and Kareem Hunt has lacked rhythm and dynamism. The Browns currently <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamoff/2019\">sit 20<sup>th</sup> in the NFL in efficiency</a>.</p> <p>-- The team\u2019s best player, Myles Garrett, was suspended indefinitely for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/15/browns-steelers-fight-myles-garrett\">hitting an opposing quarterback</a> over the head with his own helmet.</p> <p>-- Beckham told anyone and everyone who will listen that he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brgridiron/status/1207129131508518913\">wants out</a>. Then he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brgridiron/status/1207373193809420288\">backtracked</a>.</p> <p>-- They will end 2019 with the worst record in the NFL over the past decade: 42-115-1 (.269 winning percentage). Even if the Browns win their final two games, they will remain the loseriest (if that\u2019s not a word, it should be) of losers over the past 10 years.</p> <p>This was supposed to be the year Cleveland put it all together. All the hurt and torment of the previous decade would be erased thanks to Baker and his band of merry men. Not so. This season probably hurts more<em> </em>than all the disasters that have come before<em>. </em>What\u2019s a stinky season when it\u2019s sandwiched between another pair of stinkers? But a season <em>really</em> hurts when you come in as a potential Super Bowl contender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/18/lamar-jackson-baltimore-ravens-new-orleans-saints-pro-bowl-selections\">Lamar Jackson leads the way as record 12 Ravens make Pro Bowl roster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cleveland\u2019s unwillingness to admit they were wrong in promoting Freddie Kitchens to head coach has cost them a shot at salvaging the season. Kitchens has looked out of his depth throughout. Is it madness to think Hue Jackson would have done a better job if he was given this roster? Probably. But the fact it\u2019s even a discussion point tells you everything.</p> <p>The Browns should have axed Kitchens and promoted Todd Monken when there was still a chance to make the playoffs. Instead, Cleveland have sputtered to the end of the season in order for a dysfunctional franchise to save face. There\u2019s nothing different about this front office or this team: it\u2019s the same old Browns.</p> <h2><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong></h2> <p>Remember when all of Green Bay\u2019s problems were placed on Mike McCarthy? That was unfair. McCarthy and his offense had their flaws, but so did his quarterback. 2019 was expected to be the rebirth of Rodgers: he would challenge Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson as the most dynamic passer in the game.</p> <p>Matt LeFleur was the new coach, and he was going to bring all the modern trappings \u2013 motions and all the pre-snap fun and games \u2013 that would scheme open receivers, taking some of the pressure off Rodgers to create all by himself.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t quite come together, and there\u2019s only so much a coaching change can do. Rodgers just isn\u2019t vintage Rodgers anymore. Something in his game changed after 2012 when he was sacked 51 times. Rodgers has become so averse to risk that it\u2019s paralyzing some of his brilliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BenFennell_NFL/status/1204157571227115520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Alright folks... Want a quick explanation on my Aaron Rodgers issues/comments from earlier today?<br><br>Here\u2019s an example of what I\u2019m talking about: <br><br>Audio \ud83d\udd0a <a href=\"https://t.co/Z7qR2IDlrr\">pic.twitter.com/Z7qR2IDlrr</a></p>&mdash; Ben Fennell (@BenFennell_NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenFennell_NFL/status/1204157571227115520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Seriously, go back and watch Rodgers throughout the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVb1XRFl6Xo\">Packers 2010 championship run</a>. You will never, ever find a better season of quarterback play. He was quick to pull the trigger. Highlights came from the pocket \u2013 and they came fast. Tap dancing plays, with him clutching the ball and waiting for players to come open down-the-field, were sprinkled in here and there, but they were not the basis for the entire offense.</p> <p>That style has vanished. Rodgers ranks 33rd in \u201caggressiveness\u201d percentage this season, per <a href=\"https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/passing\">NFL Next Gen Stats</a>. His average number of air yards (5.5) puts him right alongside dink-and-dunk maestros Tom Brady (5.5) and Mitch Trubisky (5.4). And it\u2019s not like Rodgers is not given time or receivers are unable to spring open. Rodgers has the <a href=\"https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/passing\">fourth-best</a> time to throw in the NFL, and Davante Adams is a special receiver. Rodgers has made a concerted effort to avoid throws downfield and to consistently throw the ball away if his<em> </em>primary option isn\u2019t there, whether it\u2019s in the flow of the offense or not. It\u2019s worth noting that, at 36, he is closer to the end of his career than the start but his problems seem mental rather than physical, and with quarterbacks it is the body that goes before the mind.</p> <p>The Packers are good, and Rodgers is still capable of great moments because he\u2019s Aaron Rodgers. But the<strong> </strong>Rodgersnaissance never arrived: a year in which he turned back the clock and blitzed all before him. If Rodgers ends the season with another Super Bowl ring \u2013 which is far from impossible \u2013 he won\u2019t care too much that he was below his best. But at the moment, the Packers are winning thanks to their defense, not their future Hall of Fame quarterback.</p> <h2><strong>The New York Jets\u2019 draft class</strong></h2> <p>The Jets\u2019 rookies have been a borderline catastrophe. They were supposed to reshape the franchise in Adam Gase\u2019s image, provide support for Sam Darnold in his second year as quarterback, and add some quality to an already competent defense.</p> <p>Whoops. None of the Jets\u2019 six draft picks from 2019 have played more than 50% of snaps, and only three have played more than 40%. First-round selection Quinnen Williams, the No3 overall pick, was the most dominant defensive player in college football during his final season at Alabama. Now? Nothing. Williams has played just 44% of the Jets\u2019 defensive snaps, racking up 13 total pressures: that ranks second to last among qualified 2019 first-round pass-rushers.

      "bodyText": "Cleveland Browns No team or player has been more disappointing than the Browns this season. Their whole season has been a mess. To recap: -- Cleveland entered the season tied for eighth in the Vegas odds to win it all. They are currently 6-8, and out of the playoffs. -- Baker Mayfield, the should-be face-of-the-franchise has regressed into a middle-of-the-pack quarterback, unable and unwilling to pull the trigger and throw downfield. -- An offense featuring Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, David Njoku, Nick Chubb, and Kareem Hunt has lacked rhythm and dynamism. The Browns currently sit 20th in the NFL in efficiency. -- The team\u2019s best player, Myles Garrett, was suspended indefinitely for hitting an opposing quarterback over the head with his own helmet. -- Beckham told anyone and everyone who will listen that he wants out. Then he backtracked. -- They will end 2019 with the worst record in the NFL over the past decade: 42-115-1 (.269 winning percentage). Even if the Browns win their final two games, they will remain the loseriest (if that\u2019s not a word, it should be) of losers over the past 10 years. This was supposed to be the year Cleveland put it all together. All the hurt and torment of the previous decade would be erased thanks to Baker and his band of merry men. Not so. This season probably hurts more than all the disasters that have come before. What\u2019s a stinky season when it\u2019s sandwiched between another pair of stinkers? But a season really hurts when you come in as a potential Super Bowl contender. Cleveland\u2019s unwillingness to admit they were wrong in promoting Freddie Kitchens to head coach has cost them a shot at salvaging the season. Kitchens has looked out of his depth throughout. Is it madness to think Hue Jackson would have done a better job if he was given this roster? Probably. But the fact it\u2019s even a discussion point tells you everything. The Browns should have axed Kitchens and promoted Todd Monken when there was still a chance to make the playoffs. Instead, Cleveland have sputtered to the end of the season in order for a dysfunctional franchise to save face. There\u2019s nothing different about this front office or this team: it\u2019s the same old Browns. Aaron Rodgers Remember when all of Green Bay\u2019s problems were placed on Mike McCarthy? That was unfair. McCarthy and his offense had their flaws, but so did his quarterback. 2019 was expected to be the rebirth of Rodgers: he would challenge Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson as the most dynamic passer in the game. Matt LeFleur was the new coach, and he was going to bring all the modern trappings \u2013 motions and all the pre-snap fun and games \u2013 that would scheme open receivers, taking some of the pressure off Rodgers to create all by himself. It hasn\u2019t quite come together, and there\u2019s only so much a coaching change can do. Rodgers just isn\u2019t vintage Rodgers anymore. Something in his game changed after 2012 when he was sacked 51 times. Rodgers has become so averse to risk that it\u2019s paralyzing some of his brilliance. Seriously, go back and watch Rodgers throughout the Packers 2010 championship run. You will never, ever find a better season of quarterback play. He was quick to pull the trigger. Highlights came from the pocket \u2013 and they came fast. Tap dancing plays, with him clutching the ball and waiting for players to come open down-the-field, were sprinkled in here and there, but they were not the basis for the entire offense. That style has vanished. Rodgers ranks 33rd in \u201caggressiveness\u201d percentage this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. His average number of air yards (5.5) puts him right alongside dink-and-dunk maestros Tom Brady (5.5) and Mitch Trubisky (5.4). And it\u2019s not like Rodgers is not given time or receivers are unable to spring open. Rodgers has the fourth-best time to throw in the NFL, and Davante Adams is a special receiver. Rodgers has made a concerted effort to avoid throws downfield and to consistently throw the ball away if his primary option isn\u2019t there, whether it\u2019s in the flow of the offense or not. It\u2019s worth noting that, at 36, he is closer to the end of his career than the start but his problems seem mental rather than physical, and with quarterbacks it is the body that goes before the mind. The Packers are good, and Rodgers is still capable of great moments because he\u2019s Aaron Rodgers. But the Rodgersnaissance never arrived: a year in which he turned back the clock and blitzed all before him. If Rodgers ends the season with another Super Bowl ring \u2013 which is far from impossible \u2013 he won\u2019t care too much that he was below his best. But at the moment, the Packers are winning thanks to their defense, not their future Hall of Fame quarterback. The New York Jets\u2019 draft class The Jets\u2019 rookies have been a borderline catastrophe. They were supposed to reshape the franchise in Adam Gase\u2019s image, provide support for Sam Darnold in his second year as quarterback, and add some quality to an already competent defense. Whoops. None of the Jets\u2019 six draft picks from 2019 have played more than 50% of snaps, and only three have played more than 40%. First-round selection Quinnen Williams, the No3 overall pick, was the most dominant defensive player in college football during his final season at Alabama. Now? Nothing. Williams has played just 44% of the Jets\u2019 defensive snaps, racking up 13 total pressures: that ranks second to last among qualified 2019 first-round pass-rushers. As a comparison Nick Bosa, picked one place above Williams, has 47 pressures this season. The rest of the class has been underwhelming. Their second choice (in the third round), pass-rusher Jachai Polite was cut before the start of the season. The Seahawks picked him up then released him within three weeks, and he\u2019s now toiling away on the Rams practice squad. Mike Maccagnan already took the fall for this mess: he was fired as the team\u2019s GM in May, with the Jets luring Joe Douglas away from the Eagles as his replacement. As always with dysfunctional organizations, reports differ on the reasons why Maccagnan was let go so soon after the draft and splashing out over $200m in free agency. Gase reportedly disagreed with the free-agent shopping spree. Jets ownership backed their new coach, promoting Gase to acting general manager once they dismissed Maccagnan. There remains contention over how much input Gase had in the run-up to the draft. The Raiders leaving Oakland Vegas is an exciting new frontier for the NFL, but seeing the Raiders leave Oakland stings. The NHL\u2019s Vegas Golden Knights have shown a team can be a success in the city, but few organizations in sport have a better symbiosis between the style of the team and the attitude of their fans as the Oakland Raiders. The franchise will be better off commercially in Nevada, but that special something that made the Raiders, well, the Raiders will be missing away from Oakland (it\u2019s also worth noting the city lost the NBA\u2019s Warriors to San Francisco this year too).

      "bodyText": "Winter has come to Davenport, Iowa. Temperatures, at 14F (-10C), are well below freezing. But it\u2019s the cold winds of Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars that worry Shaun Buckles. Buckles, 40, worked at the John Deere construction and forestry manufacturing plant in Davenport for three years until he lost his job last month. He was one of 113 workers laid off; John Deere anticipates a 10-15% decline in sales of construction and forestry equipment next year. Earlier this month, John Deere announced another 57 workers at the Davenport plant would be laid off, effective 6 January. According to a company spokesperson, 23 workers in Des Moines were terminated as well, effective 15 December. The job cuts have come as demand for farming equipment shrinks in the midst of a trade war between the United States and China. In response to trade tariffs imposed on China by the Trump administration, China retaliated by halting or reducing purchases of soybean, corn and other agricultural products. A ceasefire has now been called \u2013 but it\u2019s too late for many workers. \u201cWe were affected by these trade policies. It gives a sense of uncertainty in the economy,\u201d said Buckles. \u201cIt\u2019s rough on families, especially around the holidays. John Deere is one of the major employers in this area. The odds of finding something comparable to it are probably non-existent, but I can always try to hope.\u201d Layoffs in manufacturing have become common throughout the midwest even as the overall job market has remained strong. Trump campaigned on promises to bring back jobs, particularly to communities in the midwest that have been devastated from the decline of industry. But manufacturing has continued to suffer. Employment in US manufacturing peaked in 1979 with 19.4m jobs, and have steadily declined since to around 12.8m in 2019, though production output has nearly doubled during that same timeframe as automation and outsourcing have increased efficiency at the expense of US jobs. Most states throughout the US have experienced steady job growth since the economic recession in 2008 and 2009, but growth in the midwest has lagged behind the rest of the country since December 2016, as sectors of manufacturing and agriculture the region relies on have taken hits due to Trump\u2019s trade war. \u201cAs a farmer, it\u2019s killing us. By the time something changes, there will be no small farms,\u201d said Jesse Oberbroeckling, who has worked at the John Deere plant in Dubuque, Iowa for nine years, and runs a small family farm. \u201cI raise different crops and cattle, and prices are terrible. I sure as hell can\u2019t afford to buy any John Deere equipment.\u201d John Deere is one of the largest employers in Davenport, Iowa and Dubuque, Iowa. Trump won Dubuque county in 2016, the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since Eisenhower in 1956. The company has not announced permanent layoffs yet at the Dubuque-based plant, which employs over 2,000 workers, but remaining workers at several John Deere plants have experienced cuts to shifts, downgrades to lower paying roles, temporary layoffs, and the company has rolled out a voluntary separation program. \u201cWe\u2019ve been experiencing minor layoffs.

Just when we have acclimatised ourselves to this remarkable and enigmatic reverie, Bi raises the stakes halfway through by taking Luo into a cinema showing a 3D film, and then gives us an entire hour-long 3D dream-fantasy sequence in one unbroken shot, in which Qiwen is to reappear as a new person \u2013 the sultry and melancholy karaoke singer Kaizhen. (The film is being screened in 3D and 2D versions, and it is impressive either way.)</p> <p>The effect is a kind of slo-mo exhilaration.

But perhaps they are entirely different from that, and different also from dreams. They are closer to subliminal flashes, things with no articulated substance until we create one for them. Memory becomes a creative act, a developmental fleshing-out of a fleeting glimpse or feeling.</p> <p>Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night is a noir movie in its way, with moody cityscapes, pool halls and wrecked buildings \u2013 the kind of buildings that in a European film of 60 years ago would obviously denote wartime destruction. That is not quite what is being suggested here: these are buildings that are being knocked down, perhaps to create something brand new, in keeping with Chinese prosperity. There is an extraordinary moment when Luo asks someone if Kaizhen is going to be on the bill at a certain club \u2013 yes, comes the reply, and in the morning the whole building is to be torn down. And where is Luo right now? Asleep in his 3D movie, dreaming everything we see? Or is it rather that the film simply uses that moment to ascend to a higher order of mystery? It is sometimes exasperating when a film suggests that everything has been a dream anyway, but Bi has let you invest just enough in the material reality of Luo\u2019s unhappy new obsession with lost love, and his realisation that this is the only real thing that has ever happened to him. His love affair has been a waking dream, and the nearest thing to its fulfilment is this eerie new epiphany: that she is gone, and that everything must soon be gone, but that he has been vouchsafed a final new vision of her beauty at the moment of parting.</p>",

They are now elderly people. I have watched as they have grown older, frailer, their voices weaker. Some have died. Their stories are an overlooked part of British history. It\u2019s important to record them before it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>From 1948 until the early 1960s, these former subjects of the British Raj automatically became British citizens. They came here for a better life, and to rebuild the country after the second world war. Many worked the difficult shifts that no one else wanted \u2013 in the mills, factories, foundries and new public services. Many bore children here. Roots were laid ever deeper with each generation.</p> <p>My BBC Radio 4 series <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03xq6h7\" title=\"\">Three Pounds in My Pocket</a> has charted the social history of British south Asians from the 1950s onwards. The current series looks at the 1980s. The decade saw a new kind of Britishness expressed by the second generation, alongside concerns over integration. And dramatic events \u2013 such as the publication of The Satanic Verses and the Indian army\u2019s storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs \u2013 saw the British south Asian community start to fragment, largely along religious lines.</p> <p>In the final programme I unpack the \u201cAsian\u201d part of British south Asian, and explain why it\u2019s often difficult to give a succinct answer to that loaded question: Where are you from? You may have moved from one country to another during the partition of British India. You may identify with a region more than a country \u2013 say Punjab, Sylhet, Mirpur or Gujarat. Or the country you were born in may have become a new country twice over.</p> <p>But what I was not expecting was for some interviewees to find the \u201cBritish\u201d part of British south Asian harder to define in the current political environment.</p> <p>Runi Sayeed came to Britain in 1968 from Dhaka in what would become Bangladesh. She was a teacher. Recently, she\u2019d got off the bus with her husband, and was walking down the street when a passer-by shouted at her: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to your country? Why are you here?\u201d </p> <p>Sayeed\u2019s daughter Farah was furious. \u201cShe\u2019s lived 50 years of her life here and only 24 of them in Bangladesh. So being made to feel acutely foreign again feels unacceptable. But it seems to be what\u2019s happening.\u201d When Farah says \u201cagain\u201d, she means the outward racism she and her mother experienced almost daily in the 1970s and early 1980s. Farah feels the racist attitudes she thought had subsided, or at least were no longer voiced, are resurfacing in the public realm.

I\u2019m very honoured.</p> <p><strong>It hasn\u2019t been out all that long, but do you have any perspective on </strong><strong>why it connected so strongly with audiences </strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I honestly can\u2019t give you an intelligent answer. The making of it was, in a way, fateful. We were blessed with financial and creative support from Netflix and it seemed to just flow once it got started. I don\u2019t know how to accurately express the atmosphere, because people think: \u201cOh, it\u2019s just old friends getting together and hanging out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really that way at all. It was something that we simply had to do. And I never expected it to be received this way. You know, we\u2019re at the end of our lives and we just do the best we can. And if it hits a chord, and if people embrace it \u2013 that\u2019s wonderful.</p> <p>Also, because of the Netflix situation, we were able to experiment more \u2013 narrative style, visual style, length. In a sense, the revolution is such that we don\u2019t know where these films are being seen. Is there one place for a film to be seen now? You know, I grew up when there was only one place to see a film. And then there arrived a little 12in or 16in black-and-white TV, and that\u2019s where I saw things such as the early David Lean films, The Third Man, Citizen Kane with commercials and the March of Time sequence edited out. Seeing them in the theatre was amazing, it was the main venue, so to speak, but you had the ancillary.</p> <p>I guess it\u2019s a long, roundabout way of saying that it just seemed to be natural and I followed my instincts in terms of style and length. And that was before we got to the detail of the CGI, which I call the evolution of makeup. That was extraordinarily experimental, too. We did not know if it was going to work, so we felt our way through it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman review \u2013 Martin Scorsese's finest film for 30 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How key was the cast? </strong><strong>Everyone seemed knocked out by you getting Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel together, and bringing Al Pacino in.</strong></p> <p>Bob and I had tried for many years to come up with a project. This one actually started about 35 years ago with the idea of the remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/22/bad-and-the-beautiful-review\" title=\"\">The Bad and the Beautiful</a> and the sequel <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056625/\" title=\"\">Two Weeks in Another Town</a>. Somehow we exhausted that. And so when Bob came across this story and gave it to me, he said: \u201cYou know, this is an amazing part for Joe, if he wants to do it.\u201d And also for Al Pacino \u2013 and I never worked with Al all these years, you know? We just knew that they were right for it. And then we looked at each other and realised we were meant for this somehow. It\u2019s not necessarily a culmination, but a sense of contemplation of where we are, near the end of our lives.</p> <p><strong>When did you realise how topical the material about the gangsterisation of </strong><strong>US politics was? It is prescient, really, how connected it is to the Trump era.</strong></p> <p>As we were doing it. Absolutely. We looked at each other in the middle of the shoot and realised this is exactly the case as it is now. That\u2019s not to say that it hasn\u2019t been that way in the past. But, maybe naively in this country, we always had an idea of checks and balances. And this isn\u2019t the first time corruption has existed in government in this country. But now, it\u2019s definitely at a crossroads. Now, it looks like it may be over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da2eb4b685e8f3ed3522612d969fd3bf9d53039f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da2eb4b685e8f3ed3522612d969fd3bf9d53039f/125_0_3182_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Bob said it was an amazing part for Joe\u2019 \u2026 De Niro with Pesci in The Irishman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bob said it was an amazing part for Joe\u2019 \u2026 De Niro with Pesci in The Irishman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema\" title=\"\">Your intervention over Marvel and superhero films</a> this year turned into a major news story. How calculated was it?</strong></p> <p>Obviously, we have been discussing this a lot, that theatres have been commandeered by superhero films \u2013 you know, just people flying around and banging and crashing, which is fine if you want to see it. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s no room for another kind of picture. I don\u2019t know how many more I can make \u2013 maybe this is it. The last one. So the idea was to at least get it made and maybe show it for one day at the NFT, maybe one day at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris. I\u2019m not kidding.</p> <p>We are in a situation now where the theatres are only showing the latest superhero films. You have 12 screens \u2013 and 11 are the superhero film. You enjoy superhero films, fine, but you need 11 screens? It\u2019s crazy for a picture like, you know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf\" title=\"\">Lady Bird</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg\" title=\"\">The Souvenir</a>. Those films may not necessarily be hugely commercial, but there are films that are modest and genuine and find a large audience. Just because a film is commercial doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be art. What has consumed the theatres is product. A product is to be consumed and thrown away. Look at a commercial film like Singin\u2019 in the Rain. You can watch it again and again. So the question is: how are we going to protect the art form?</p> <p>Now, you don\u2019t have to like the picture, but you couldn\u2019t get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/10/dvdreviews\" title=\"\">The Aviator</a> made today. You could not get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/11/shutter-island-review\" title=\"\">Shutter Island</a> made today, even with me and Leo [DiCaprio]. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/thriller.mattdamon\" title=\"\">The Departed</a> got made despite itself \u2013 the star power helped. We realised when we were taking this project around that the doors are closing. So what\u2019s going on? I looked over at the theatres right down the block \u2013 10 screens showing the same picture.</p> <p>People comment that we\u2019ve only shown this film in theatres for four weeks. We tried to get more, but the theatre owners and Netflix couldn\u2019t come to terms. But you know, I\u2019ve had pictures play only one week and get thrown out. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/19/best-scorsese-king-of-comedy\" title=\"\">The King of Comedy</a> closed in a week. That film was ignored for 10 years.</p> <p><strong>Talking of King of Comedy, what was your feeling about Joker?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m fascinated by the fact that it\u2019s influenced by King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Especially King of Comedy, because I always point out that the only place that King of Comedy was appreciated was Britain. But I didn\u2019t want to get involved with it. </p> <p><strong>You are all over our top 10 list \u2013 you were involved in Happy as Lazzaro and The Souvenir, as well as Uncut Gems, which featured in our US top 10. Do you feel that you have shown these whippersnappers a thing or two with The Irishman?</strong></p> <p>Ha! No, I didn\u2019t know, how could I? Put it this way: I was firm in my convictions on how to shoot The Irishman. Happy as Lazzaro I am \u201cpresenting\u201d \u2013 I mean: I\u2019m 77 and I\u2019ve got things to do. Time is of the most value, right? I put my name on the line and say: \u201cYes, I think you should see this picture.\u201d</p> <p>The Souvenir is different; I was actually on in the beginning with Joanna [Hogg]. She came to see me and we had discussions about it. The Safdie brothers, they\u2019re crazy. I saw them in Telluride at a dinner and it was like they were mugging me. They look like two bandits. When they said they had Adam Sandler, I thought: OK, that\u2019s interesting. They would come on the set of The Irishman and hang out. There\u2019s still an aspect of me that has an affinity with their ferocious manner, so to speak. But over the years, I have become more and more like Joanna\u2019s films or Happy as Lazzaro \u2013 it\u2019s about focusing on the essentials.</p> <p><strong>Did you anticipate what a lightning rod </strong><strong>The Irishman would become over Netflix and its contest with the rest of the film industry?</strong></p> <p>Once we agreed to do the film with Netflix, I understood what it meant. We knew that it would primarily be seen on streaming but it would also be in theatres. But at that point, we knew we had to make the film and needed to get the financing. And also the main thing: creative freedom. We said: OK, a condition is that it may only be shown in the theatre for one week. And I accepted that condition. My main concern was that it would be OK for the actors, that the Academy would accept it. Not for me, not for the film. I know that I\u2019m at the end of a long, long ride. The main thing is to get the film made and to embrace this new world of how these pictures are going to be seen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Guardian has named The Irishman its No 1 film of 2019, so \u2026 congratulations! Thank you. I\u2019m very honoured. It hasn\u2019t been out all that long, but do you have any perspective on why it connected so strongly with audiences ? I honestly can\u2019t give you an intelligent answer. The making of it was, in a way, fateful. We were blessed with financial and creative support from Netflix and it seemed to just flow once it got started. I don\u2019t know how to accurately express the atmosphere, because people think: \u201cOh, it\u2019s just old friends getting together and hanging out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really that way at all. It was something that we simply had to do. And I never expected it to be received this way. You know, we\u2019re at the end of our lives and we just do the best we can. And if it hits a chord, and if people embrace it \u2013 that\u2019s wonderful. Also, because of the Netflix situation, we were able to experiment more \u2013 narrative style, visual style, length. In a sense, the revolution is such that we don\u2019t know where these films are being seen. Is there one place for a film to be seen now? You know, I grew up when there was only one place to see a film. And then there arrived a little 12in or 16in black-and-white TV, and that\u2019s where I saw things such as the early David Lean films, The Third Man, Citizen Kane with commercials and the March of Time sequence edited out. Seeing them in the theatre was amazing, it was the main venue, so to speak, but you had the ancillary. I guess it\u2019s a long, roundabout way of saying that it just seemed to be natural and I followed my instincts in terms of style and length. And that was before we got to the detail of the CGI, which I call the evolution of makeup. That was extraordinarily experimental, too. We did not know if it was going to work, so we felt our way through it. How key was the cast? Everyone seemed knocked out by you getting Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel together, and bringing Al Pacino in. Bob and I had tried for many years to come up with a project. This one actually started about 35 years ago with the idea of the remake of The Bad and the Beautiful and the sequel Two Weeks in Another Town. Somehow we exhausted that. And so when Bob came across this story and gave it to me, he said: \u201cYou know, this is an amazing part for Joe, if he wants to do it.\u201d And also for Al Pacino \u2013 and I never worked with Al all these years, you know? We just knew that they were right for it. And then we looked at each other and realised we were meant for this somehow. It\u2019s not necessarily a culmination, but a sense of contemplation of where we are, near the end of our lives. When did you realise how topical the material about the gangsterisation of US politics was? It is prescient, really, how connected it is to the Trump era. As we were doing it. Absolutely. We looked at each other in the middle of the shoot and realised this is exactly the case as it is now. That\u2019s not to say that it hasn\u2019t been that way in the past. But, maybe naively in this country, we always had an idea of checks and balances. And this isn\u2019t the first time corruption has existed in government in this country. But now, it\u2019s definitely at a crossroads. Now, it looks like it may be over. Your intervention over Marvel and superhero films this year turned into a major news story. How calculated was it? Obviously, we have been discussing this a lot, that theatres have been commandeered by superhero films \u2013 you know, just people flying around and banging and crashing, which is fine if you want to see it. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s no room for another kind of picture. I don\u2019t know how many more I can make \u2013 maybe this is it. The last one. So the idea was to at least get it made and maybe show it for one day at the NFT, maybe one day at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Paris. I\u2019m not kidding. We are in a situation now where the theatres are only showing the latest superhero films. You have 12 screens \u2013 and 11 are the superhero film. You enjoy superhero films, fine, but you need 11 screens? It\u2019s crazy for a picture like, you know, Lady Bird or The Souvenir. Those films may not necessarily be hugely commercial, but there are films that are modest and genuine and find a large audience. Just because a film is commercial doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be art. What has consumed the theatres is product. A product is to be consumed and thrown away. Look at a commercial film like Singin\u2019 in the Rain. You can watch it again and again. So the question is: how are we going to protect the art form? Now, you don\u2019t have to like the picture, but you couldn\u2019t get The Aviator made today. You could not get Shutter Island made today, even with me and Leo [DiCaprio]. The Departed got made despite itself \u2013 the star power helped. We realised when we were taking this project around that the doors are closing. So what\u2019s going on? I looked over at the theatres right down the block \u2013 10 screens showing the same picture. People comment that we\u2019ve only shown this film in theatres for four weeks. We tried to get more, but the theatre owners and Netflix couldn\u2019t come to terms. But you know, I\u2019ve had pictures play only one week and get thrown out. In the US, The King of Comedy closed in a week. That film was ignored for 10 years. Talking of King of Comedy, what was your feeling about Joker? I\u2019m fascinated by the fact that it\u2019s influenced by King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Especially King of Comedy, because I always point out that the only place that King of Comedy was appreciated was Britain. But I didn\u2019t want to get involved with it. You are all over our top 10 list \u2013 you were involved in Happy as Lazzaro and The Souvenir, as well as Uncut Gems, which featured in our US top 10. Do you feel that you have shown these whippersnappers a thing or two with The Irishman? Ha! No, I didn\u2019t know, how could I? Put it this way: I was firm in my convictions on how to shoot The Irishman. Happy as Lazzaro I am \u201cpresenting\u201d \u2013 I mean: I\u2019m 77 and I\u2019ve got things to do. Time is of the most value, right? I put my name on the line and say: \u201cYes, I think you should see this picture.\u201d The Souvenir is different; I was actually on in the beginning with Joanna [Hogg]. She came to see me and we had discussions about it. The Safdie brothers, they\u2019re crazy. I saw them in Telluride at a dinner and it was like they were mugging me. They look like two bandits. When they said they had Adam Sandler, I thought: OK, that\u2019s interesting. They would come on the set of The Irishman and hang out. There\u2019s still an aspect of me that has an affinity with their ferocious manner, so to speak. But over the years, I have become more and more like Joanna\u2019s films or Happy as Lazzaro \u2013 it\u2019s about focusing on the essentials. Did you anticipate what a lightning rod The Irishman would become over Netflix and its contest with the rest of the film industry? Once we agreed to do the film with Netflix, I understood what it meant. We knew that it would primarily be seen on streaming but it would also be in theatres. But at that point, we knew we had to make the film and needed to get the financing. And also the main thing: creative freedom. We said: OK, a condition is that it may only be shown in the theatre for one week. And I accepted that condition. My main concern was that it would be OK for the actors, that the Academy would accept it. Not for me, not for the film. I know that I\u2019m at the end of a long, long ride. The main thing is to get the film made and to embrace this new world of how these pictures are going to be seen.",

The anchors were excavated from under a metre of sediment in the Gulf of Mexico near Villa Rica, the settlement Cortes founded upon landing 500 years ago in what is now the Mexican state of Veracruz. Archaeologists say the anchors date back to the time of the first conquistadors\u2019 arrival in the Americas.

A magnetic survey of the seabed suggested 15 additional sites might contain anchors \u2013 raising hopes of possibly finding Cort\u00e9s\u2019s ships.

The discovery of the anchors comes as interest surges in Cort\u00e9s\u2019s rogue exploits around the 500th anniversary of his arrival in Mexico \u2013 where he made his way to the seat of Aztec empire \u2013 and sacked it two years later.

But the great virtue of this slick, highly polished thriller by Francis Durbridge is that almost from the start we know who is going to murder whom: the dramatic excitement, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/06/alfred-hitchcock-dial-m-for-murder\">Dial M for Murder</a>, lies in watching the net slowly close in on the smug, smooth protagonist.</p> <h2>Company</h2> <p><strong>Her Majesty\u2019s theatre, London, 19 January 1972</strong><br>How good is Company? When I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sondheim\">Stephen Sondheim</a>\u2019s musical 18 months ago in New York, I thought it a marvellously tart, wry, original show that got away from all the lumbering cliches of the formula-bound Broadway musical.

The mouth belongs to a 70-year-old woman whose past life flashes before her, like that of someone drowning, but who transfers her experiences to someone else: the impression is of a buzzing skull, a mouth on fire helplessly attached to a body incapable of feeling. If I had to sum up the play\u2019s theme in a phrase, it would be the anguish of memory at a time when all physical sentience had departed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/21/billie-whitelaw-samuel-beckett-perfect-actress\">Billie Whitelaw</a>\u2019s performance is an astonishing tour de force combining frenetic verbal speed with total sensitivity to the musical rhythm of the piece.</p> <h2>Ken Dodd</h2> <p><strong>Liverpool Playhouse, 17 April 1973</strong><br>Ostensibly, the intention is to explore the nature of laughter: in reality what we get is a king-sized Dodd-fest. It begins with those wayward teeth spotlit in what looks like a conscious parody of Billie Whitelaw in Beckett; and it goes on to run the gamut of Doddy jokes. Wisely, perhaps, Dodd avoids too much theorising. He quotes Freud\u2019s opinions that a laugh is a conservation of psychic energy; but, as he says, the trouble with Freud is that he never played Glasgow second house on a Friday night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38df5153c26f62a1842a5c7cc663ecc758a6f189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38df5153c26f62a1842a5c7cc663ecc758a6f189/0_0_3238_4911/659.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Dodd opens his one-man show, Ha Ha, at the Playhouse in Liverpool in 1973.\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018King-sized Dodd-fest\u2019 \u2026 Ken Dodd opens his one-man show, Ha Ha, at the Playhouse in Liverpool in 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brassneck</h2> <p><strong>Nottingham Playhouse, 21 September 1973</strong><br>Brassneck by Howard Brenton and David Hare is an important play. Not since John Arden\u2019s The Workhouse Donkey 10 years ago have I seen any work that attempts to put a whole regional community on stage and show in detail how the provincial power nexus works. Judging by the outraged huffing and puffing near me, it was courageous of Nottingham Playhouse to stage it.</p> <h2>Words of Advice</h2> <p><strong>Greenwich theatre, London, 5 March 1974</strong><br>Fay Weldon\u2019s play is tight, tart and alert. In the centre of the ring are Tammy and Julia, a primary schoolteacher and his suffocating wife, who use each other like punchbags. Encircling them are their parents and in-laws who prefer contradictory, self-interesting advice. My gripe about the play is that its horizons are inevitably limited. It scarcely touches on the high cost of loving, on the way social inequity affects private relationships and on the crucial fact that even our emotional crises are carried on against the background of changing public events: only in plays do people have time to suffer in a vacuum. But Miss Weldon can certainly write.</p> <h2>The Tempest</h2> <p><strong>Old Vic, London, 7 March 1974</strong><br>Fourteen years ago precisely, Peter Hall began his brilliant Stratford reign with an over-decorated, eccentrically cast production of Two Gentlemen of Verona. We should not, therefore, despair if he has begun his National Theatre career with a lethargic, vulgarly spectacular, masque-like production of The Tempest that almost manages to submerge the presence of the greatest living Shakespearean actor, Sir John Gielgud, in opulent excess.</p> <h2>Bordello</h2> <p><strong>Queen\u2019s theatre, London, 19 April 1974</strong><br>I have, I suppose, seen worse musicals than Bordello. Indeed I can wincingly remember one about refrigerated corpses and another about premature ejaculation at a certain north London engine shed. But it\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve seen a show of such extravagant pointlessness or one that deployed such elaborate resources to convey a message that could be comfortably inscribed on the back of a 3\u00bdd stamp.</p> <h2>Travesties</h2> <p><strong>Aldwych, London, 11 June 1974</strong><br>I find it difficult to write in calm, measured tones about Tom Stoppard\u2019s Travesties: a dazzling pyrotechnical feat that combines Wildean pastiche, political history, artistic debate, spoof-reminiscence and song-and-dance in marvellously judicious proportions. The text itself is a dense Joycean web of literary allusions; yet it also radiates sheer intellectual joie de vivre, as if Stoppard were delightedly communicating the fruits of his own researches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b541d7958b12282aff402f16ee931f72ab8c3c54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b541d7958b12282aff402f16ee931f72ab8c3c54/0_0_2848_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Powell in costume for his role as Dadaist Tristan Tzara in Tom Stoppard\u2019s Travesties.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dazzling \u2026 Robert Powell in costume for his role as dadaist Tristan Tzara in Tom Stoppard\u2019s Travesties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Tyas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Play Mas</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 17 July 1974</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/01/mustapha-matura-obituary\">Mustapha Matura</a>\u2019s Play Mas is an endearing, intelligent comedy. I only hope the work, playing at heavily reduced prices, gets through to the popular audience it deserves. Not that the play is by any means a mere colourful folksy romp. Even if everything in Trinidad stops for the annual gaudy Dionysiac rite, Matura shows that this cannot conceal either the social and political tensions or the interracial bitterness.</p> <h2>Autosacramentales</h2> <p><strong>Roundhouse, London, 27 December 1974</strong><br>I must be honest: I found Autosacramentales, an hour-long Victor Garcia production of a Calderon religious drama, almost totally inaccessible. Even with the help of programme notes and a pocket torch, I could not sort out Sin from Death, the Soul from the Body, or Cain from Abel.</p> <h2>No Man\u2019s Land</h2> <p><strong>Old Vic, London, 24 April 1975</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pinter\">Harold Pinter</a>\u2019s new play is about precisely what its title suggests: the sense of being caught in some mysterious limbo between life and death, between a world of brute reality and one of fluid uncertainty. But although plenty of plays, from Sweeney Agonistes to Outward Bound, have tried to pin down that strange sense of reaching into a void, I can think of few that have done so as concretely, funnily and concisely as Pinter\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"387a8eb02fb18af344fef35733f00daf875c7752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/387a8eb02fb18af344fef35733f00daf875c7752/0_85_2328_1397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud in No Man\u2019s Land in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In limbo \u2026 Harold Pinter\u2019s No Man\u2019s Land in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Big Red Ladder Show</h2> <p><strong>Camden Town Hall, London, 6 December 1975</strong><br>There was a cup final atmosphere last night at Camden Town Hall as a packed, exultant house roared its approval of the Red Ladder company\u2019s new show, It Makes Yer Sick. The occasion was a benefit night for this spring-heeled leftwing troupe, who next month move to Yorkshire to set up a permanent base. I can only say that the north should count itself lucky, for this show is a model of what popular political theatre ought to be: festive, exuberant and theatrically pungent.</p> <h2>Macbeth</h2> <p><strong>The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 September 1976</strong><br>The simpler, the better; that is my feeling about Trevor Nunn\u2019s ceaseless quest for the ideal Macbeth. Two years ago he staged the play in Stratford\u2019s main house as an over elaborate religious spectacle. He then stripped away the ritual for an Aldwych version spoiled by gabbled speaking. And now, at Stratford\u2019s Other Place in a production played without an interval, he has hit the right balance between verbal clarity and depraved religiosity; I have never seen the play come across with such throat-grabbing power.</p> <h2>Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi</h2> <p><strong>Mayfair theatre, London, 11 February 1977</strong><br>Pam Gems\u2019s play is a bright, naturalistic, observant comedy that, I presume, tells it like it is. It is written with a glancing lightness worlds away from the grisly gaiety of those all-girl TV sitcoms, and Nancy Meckler\u2019s production has an eye for simple, behaviourist detail I haven\u2019t seen since Peter Gill\u2019s New York production of Fishing.</p> <h2>Vautrin</h2> <p><strong>Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 10 October 1977</strong><br>What other company but the Glasgow Citizens would have had the chutzpah to revive Vautrin, a play by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac that has not been seen since its ill-fated Paris premiere in 1840? Having chosen to revive it, what other company would have been able to hit the right note of opulent romantic melodrama?</p> <h2>Coriolanus</h2> <p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 21 October 1977</strong><br>Terry Hands\u2019 production of Coriolanus at Stratford is staggeringly good. Played on a dark, cavernous stage over which two huge ribbed doors swing on hinges, it combines the imagistic power of continental theatre with a very English respect for actors. The paradox of the production is that Alan Howard, one of our most likable actors, plays Coriolanus, Shakespeare\u2019s least likable hero. But not since Olivier has anyone played the part with such complete understanding of his mental process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb7772d7beffb9ce792abc5bbe3cfacf310da9aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb7772d7beffb9ce792abc5bbe3cfacf310da9aa/757_510_419_706/297.jpg\" alt=\"Sweeney Todd\" width=\"297\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A cut above the rest\u2019 \u2026 Billington\u2019s Sweeney Todd review in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Betrayal</h2> <p><strong>Lyttelton, London, 16 November 1978</strong><br>Themes, say some critics, don\u2019t matter: what counts is the skill a dramatist brings to his chosen subject. Well the petit-point school of reviewing should have a field night with Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal at the Lyttelton since it is full of technical resource. What distresses me is the pitifully thin strip of human experience it explores and its obsession with the tiny ripples on the stagnant pond of bourgeois affluent life.</p> <h2>Winter Journey</h2> <p><strong>Ashcroft, Croydon, 12 September 1979</strong><br>Clifford Odets\u2019 Winter Journey is a fascinating backstage melodrama that requires incandescent acting to lift it to a higher plane. Allegedly, it got it when Michael Redgrave, Sam Wanamaker and Googie Withers did a legendary production at the St James in 1952. But the present Cambridge Theatre Company version, now on tour at the Ashcroft, Croydon, is competently acted, thinly directed and wretchedly designed. The curtain is lowered between each of the eight scenes, giving one infinite time to read and reread the programme ads for Turkish restaurants, locksmiths and piano-tuners.</p> <h2>Sweeney Todd</h2> <p><strong>Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, 3 July 1980</strong><br>Sweeney Todd is the reversal of everything we traditionally expect of a musical. It has a powerful and gripping story, hardly a single extractable tune, a fierce sense of social justice. Yet, after seeing it on Broadway 18 months ago and now at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, I would call it sensationally effective. Indeed, burning a boat or two, I would say it is one of the two (My Fair Lady being the other) durable works of popular musical theatre in my lifetime.</p> <h2>Cats</h2> <p><strong>New London theatre, London, 12 May 1981</strong><br>An exhilarating piece of total theatre that demolishes several myths at one go: that the British can\u2019t get a musical together, that our dancers are below American standard, and that musicals with a literary source always dilute their origins. What is heartening is the way the poems are integrated into the occasions. Thus Gus the Theatre Cat (beautifully played by Stephen Tate) is seen as a wistful, white-haired Victorian relic dreaming of palmier days. He is then transmogrified (or transmoggified) into Growltiger, the cutlass-bearing Pirate cat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6aa3c3244bacdd1a4682e47a20639d294c7b17c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6aa3c3244bacdd1a4682e47a20639d294c7b17c/0_0_6201_4111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1981 production of Cats with Bonnie Langford, centre-front, as Rumpleteazer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exhilarating \u2026 Cats with Bonnie Langford, centre-front, as Rumpleteazer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Noises Off</h2> <p><strong>Lyric Hammersmith, London, 25 February 1982</strong><br>Michael Frayn\u2019s play is not simply a machine for creating laughs. It is about the booby-trapped minefield of theatre itself in which one false move, one missed cue, can destroy a carefully created fiction. In one sense, it panders to our sadistic delight in things that go wrong; in another, it is a very intelligent joke about the fragility of all forms of drama.</p> <h2>Aunt Mary</h2> <p><strong>Donmar Warehouse, London, 25 June 1982</strong><br>Not believing that pain-racked evenings are good for the soul, I am delighted to report that the reopened Donmar Warehouse has highly comfortable, well-raked purple seats, a foyer bar and even a portable interval drinks trolley. The new regime\u2019s opening choice is Pam Gems\u2019 Aunt Mary, which confirms the amiable impression it made on me when I first encountered it as an RSC reading. It may not blaze like a comet, but it is a perfectly decent, compassionate if slightly quirky play (like the work of a Brummagem Tennessee Williams).</p> <h2>Top Girls</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 9 February 1983</strong><br>What I admire about Caryl Churchill is that she is not unafraid of downright passion (the rarest commodity in modern British theatre). Having taken us all round her subject, in the final scene Ms Churchill gives us an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between Marlene, the one who got away, and her trapped East Anglian sister. And, without spoiling the denouement, it is fair to say that Ms Churchill proves that both sisters are in different ways deprived and that some things are bigger than blood ties.</p> <h2>Glengarry Glen Ross</h2> <p><strong>Cottesloe, London, 22 September 1983</strong><br>The play is filled with the spiralling obscenity and comic bluster of real-estate salesmen caught off guard; yet underneath that there is fear and desperation. Mamet says that he admires his characters\u2019 pragmatic individualism, but to me the piece comes across as a chillingly funny indictment of a world in which you are what you sell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c08202d17a6dcfa6b11ac515426dce81411ba6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c08202d17a6dcfa6b11ac515426dce81411ba6b/0_0_825_1223/675.jpg\" alt=\"Glengarry Glen Ross at the Cottesloe in 1983.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chillingly funny\u2019 \u2026 Glengarry Glen Ross at the Cottesloe in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Poster design and illustration by Richard Bird, Photograph by Conroy-Hargrave</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Death of a Salesman</h2> <p><strong>Broadhurst </strong><strong>theatre, New York, 6 April 1984</strong><br>What is remarkable about Dustin Hoffman\u2019s performance is that it captures all of Willy\u2019s devouring insecurity. \u201cI still feel kind of temporary about myself,\u201d says Willy at one point, and Hoffman presents us with a man who in his sad 60s still doesn\u2019t quite know who he is.</p> <h2>Mrs Gaugin</h2> <p><strong>Almeida, London, 5 June 1984</strong><br>Style is stronger than substance in Mrs Gauguin: the second production of the new Almeida Theatre Company and an attempt to redeem the reputation of the painter\u2019s wife, Mette Sophie Gad, given a bad press by Maugham in The Moon and Sixpence. Helen Cooper\u2019s script, however, is little more than a series of quick, data-starved, impressionist sketches fleshed out by Mike Bradwell\u2019s visually elegant production.</p> <h2>Saved</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 21 December 1984</strong><br>Edward Bond\u2019s Saved returns to the Royal Court in a very fine production by Danny Boyle that brings out more clearly than previous versions the play\u2019s savage humour and tenuous optimism. Nineteen years ago, critics and audiences were understandably poleaxed by the notorious scene of baby-stoning violence. But, while that remains as stomach-turning as ever, it is by no means exploitative or Bond\u2019s final statement on the human condition.</p> <h2>Henry V</h2> <p><strong>Barbican, London, 18 May 1985</strong><br>Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Henry confirms the good impression he made in Stratford: he combines boyish vulnerability with moral gravitas. I\u2019m not sure he would be capable of the brutalities threatened before Harfleur, but it is an immensely appealing and well-spoken performance. Ian McDiarmid\u2019s Chorus (looking like an RAF bomber pilot) is vocally tricky but rivetingly sardonic, and there is good work from Nicholas Woodeson, who makes the Dauphin a nervous peacock, and from John Carlisle as the Archbishop of Canterbury, who puts the case for war with desperate ingenuity. But then he (and this is one of the production\u2019s major points) doesn\u2019t have to endure the horrendous reality.</p> <h2>Macbeth</h2> <p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 26 August 1985</strong><br>The dominant image of Yukio Ninagawa\u2019s production, often seen through a transparent, latticed screen, is cherry blossoms in full bloom. To us, the cherry blossom symbolises beauty; to the Japanese it also signals danger and fear. Thus Banquo is murdered not in the usual stygian darkness but in full light under a cherry tree while putting up the heroic fight expected of a samurai. And Birnam Wood is not the usual set of tatty Babes in the Wood branches but a whole series of ambulatory trees. Throughout, the falling blossom also betokens time passing and the transitoriness of earthly things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c5ff32e38d78e90e00ead5398934b6346d63b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c5ff32e38d78e90e00ead5398934b6346d63b40/0_0_4574_3081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masachika Ichimura and Yuko Tanaka in Yukio Ninagawa\u2019s Macbeth, revived at the Barbican in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evocative \u2026 Masachika Ichimura and Yuko Tanaka in Yukio Ninagawa\u2019s Macbeth, revived at the Barbican in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shirley</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 1 May 1986</strong><br>There are echoes here of A Taste of Honey and a midweek telly soap opera. But what gives the play a distinctive tone is Ms Dunbar\u2019s refusal to moralise about her characters: Shirley is seen as neither good nor bad but simply the product of a live-for-now culture. The play neither wags its finger nor buttonholes us with argument. But it is not hard to deduce from it a pretty scathing vision of modern urban life in which men and women see each other as instinctive enemies, relationships are defined by appetite, and escape routes are sought in glue-sniffing by the young and Malibu pineapples by the middle-aged.</p> <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2> <p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 April 1986</strong><br>As Benvolio arrives on a motorbike and Tybalt turns up in the Veronese square in a low-slung red sports car, it becomes impossible not to dub this the Alfa Romeo and Juliet. Michael Bogdanov has set the play unequivocally in Verona 1986. The result is hip, cool, clever and witty; a painless revitalisation of a play that, for my money, never lives up to its advance publicity as a great love-tragedy and that depends too much on the faulty postal service between Verona and Mantua.</p> <h2>Pour un Oui</h2> <p><strong>Institut Francais, London, 20 January 1987</strong><br>Nathalie Sarraute excavates, with a good deal of wit, the thoughts that lie between words and the capacity of lifelong relations to be ruined by a momentary inflexion or sudden pause. Read beforehand, the text seemed a bit flat. As played by Jean-Francois Balmer and Sami Frey with enormous emotional variety, it takes off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903765d83bbc2d3c9c6d0ca327d9bbc42b6836b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903765d83bbc2d3c9c6d0ca327d9bbc42b6836b7/0_0_4192_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Brook in rehearsals for Mahabharata at the Bouffes du Nord in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dazzling epic achievement\u2026 Peter Brook in rehearsals for Mahabharata at the Bouffes du Nord in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julio Donoso/Sygma via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mahabharata</h2> <p><strong>Zurich, 18 August 1987</strong><br>\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the night together.\u201d So Peter Brook roguishly told a thousand people gathered on Saturday in a large boathouse on the edge of Zurich\u2019s famous lake. The occasion was the premiere of the English-language version of The Mahabharata. Our communal one-night stand began around eight o\u2019clock on a warm summer\u2019s evening. It ended sensationally 11 hours later with the revelation that the back wall of the boathouse was like a large movable blind, which was slowly lowered to reveal a dazzling morning sun. Even Nature now appears to be directed by Peter Brook.</p> <h2>Uncle Vanya</h2> <p><strong>Vaudeville, London, 26 May 1988</strong><br>Michael Gambon has inherited Ralph Richardson\u2019s ability to exist in two dimensions at once. Half the time he seems to be living in a private dream: there is a magnificent moment when he is accused of being drunk and cries, \u201cPossibly, possibly\u201d in a voice so alien and remote it might be coming from a man under hypnosis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6403668ffb18da0d166e364d5325a1aab6be5b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6403668ffb18da0d166e364d5325a1aab6be5b0/0_0_4320_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Pryce, Michael Gambon and Greta Scacchi in Uncle Vanya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mesmerising \u2026 Jonathan Pryce, Michael Gambon and Greta Scacchi in Uncle Vanya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Love of the Nightingale</h2> <p><strong>The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 11 November 1988</strong><br>This is virtually the last production we shall see at Stratford\u2019s Other Place. It is no longer to be licensed as a theatre and we shall have to wait until the early 1990s for a purpose-built replacement. I once called it the most productive corrugated-iron hut in history, and it is amazing to think of the work that has poured out of it over the last 14 years. I can\u2019t think how Broadway, let alone the RSC, will manage without it. Over the years, it has combined classical and modern work and Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s oddly haunting, 100-minute fable looks like an attempt to combine the two.</p> <h2>Hamlet</h2> <p><strong>Leicester Haymarket, 20 September 1989</strong><br>It\u2019s curtains for Yuri Lyubimov. To be more precise it is one curtain, designed by David Borowsky and apparently woven out of hemp, that is the undoubted star of the Lyubimov Hamlet, which has opened at the Leicester Haymarket before going on a world tour. This curtain can advance, retreat, spin on its axis and send characters hurtling into the grave in a way that evokes the nightmare despotism of Elsinore.</p> <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2> <p><strong>Barbican, London, 29 November 1991</strong><br>Scene: a murky pub near the Barbican. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, two sides of the same critic, have just emerged from the first night of David Edgar\u2019s RSC adaptation of RLS\u2019s chilling novella. They compare notes over a vintage malt.<br>Dr J: My dear Hyde, a capital evening was it not?<br>Mr H: No sir, more like a capital offence \u2026</p> <h2>Moby Dick</h2> <p><strong>Piccadilly theatre, London, 19 March 1992</strong><br>Moby Dick is the latest nail to be driven into the glittering coffin of the West End musical. Lacking logic, style, coherence or sense, it turns Melville\u2019s great Dostoevskyan novel into a campy, vulgar schoolgirl spoof in which lines like, \u201cThree years at sea and still no sign of Dick\u201d signal the level of sophistication. Robert Longden\u2019s concept itself poses a problem that his own production never begins to solve. The idea is that we are watching a black-suspendered, St Trinian\u2019s-style school putting on a homemade version of Moby-Dick, which is a bit like the students of Narkover doing The Brothers Karamazov.</p> <h2>Which Witch</h2> <p><strong>Piccadilly theatre, London, 24 October 1992</strong><br>One of the West End theatre\u2019s special torments is the religious musical. Over the years I recall such vintage horrors as Thomas and the King (with Queen Eleanor\u2019s memorable cry of \u201cSeize that monk!\u201d), a rock Joan of Arc and Bernadette. To that select band we can now add Which Witch, which seems like Norway\u2019s revenge for all those years of humiliation in the Eurovision song contest. Things start ominously with the Inquisition denouncing women for spiriting away men\u2019s private parts and leaving them dangling over trees. We then find a Roman orphan, Maria Vittoria, being unhappily affianced to a German banker somewhat misleadingly named Anton Fugger. But, since Maria is already deeply in love with her Catholic confessor, Daniel, it\u2019s a clear case of Fugger off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e117738721781a8680ad82ff3b5bffb2161b32ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e117738721781a8680ad82ff3b5bffb2161b32ff/73_258_651_1066/611.jpg\" alt=\"The Tempest in 1993.\" width=\"611\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strikingly beautiful ... The Tempest in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Tempest</h2> <p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, London, 13 August 1993</strong><br>Adrian Noble\u2019s biggest problem at the RSC has lain in finding new directors who could handle the main Stratford stage. But Sam Mendes makes the transition from the Swan to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a confident, cohesive and strikingly beautiful production of The Tempest: it is the best debut at this daunting address since Noble\u2019s own.</p> <h2>The Piano Lesson</h2> <p><strong>Tricycle, London, 9 October 1993</strong><br>August Wilson\u2019s decade-by-decade portrait of African-American life reaches Pittsburgh in 1936 \u2013 and the key issue is a family\u2019s battle for possession of a symbolic piano. For all the play\u2019s faults, including prolixity and a final lurch into mystical melodrama, you have the feeling throughout the evening that something momentous is at stake. As in Ibsen or O\u2019Neill, the past constantly informs the present.</p> <h2>Old Times</h2> <p><strong>Birmingham Rep, 2 November 1993</strong><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a long way to the coffee table,\u201d said the lady behind me. She had a point. Watching Harold Pinter\u2019s tense, intimate three-hander, Old Times, in the big Birmingham Rep is a bit like seeing Godot in Madison Square Garden. But Bill Alexander\u2019s new production is so beautifully cast and so alert to every nuance of Pinter\u2019s power battle that we soon forget the wide open spaces of the fawn-carpeted circular stage.</p> <h2>The Statement</h2> <p><strong>Watermans, London, 25 January 1994</strong><br>Although passing tribute is paid to Ruth Rendell and Dorothy L Sayers, the spirit of Marguerite Duras hovers over Helene Pedneault\u2019s The Statement: a six-year-old Quebecois play being presented by The Troupe, in Mark Ravina\u2019s translation, at the Watermans. As so often in Duras, a murder becomes the occasion for an exploration of family relationships, and a certain patience is required before you get your dramatic reward.</p> <h2>Maria Friedman</h2> <p><strong>Donmar Warehouse, London, 31 May 1994</strong><br>The 85-year-old Elisabeth Welch was in the house the night I went to hear Maria Friedman \u2013 By Special Arrangement at the Donmar Warehouse. Fascinating to watch a cabaret legend gazing benevolently at a rising star. For Friedman undeniably has a vocal class, engaging candour and eclectic repertoire that puts her in the great tradition.</p> <h2>The Schoolmistress</h2> <p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre, 8 July 1994</strong><br>Pinero\u2019s drawing-room dramas are highly revivable. His farces, however, strike me as arch and rickety. And they don\u2019t come much archer than The Schoolmistress (1886), being revived at Chichester Festival Theatre with a fixed and deadly grin. Farce is partly about desperation, but here nothing vital seems at stake.</p> <h2>Leave Taking</h2> <p><strong>National Theatre, London, 7 January 1995</strong><br>There\u2019s a shining truthfulness about the writing. In particular, Winsome Pinnock shows an extraordinary intuitive sympathy for two different generations. She understands the dilemma of both Enid and Mai, the Obeah woman, who have been deserted by their menfolk and have had to acquire a steely toughness to survive in a strange land. But, equally, she empathises with Viv and Del, who combine an English upbringing with \u201cCaribbean souls\u201d and who have to break free to discover who they really are. It\u2019s a mature, heartbreaking play that deftly combines the specific problems confronting Jamaican families with the universal issue of mother-daughter relationships.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea0bf8b7d2330a08ef0e20922e16ae472af7ea05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea0bf8b7d2330a08ef0e20922e16ae472af7ea05/0_426_3216_4223/762.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hollander in Mojo.\" width=\"762\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Subtle double game ... Tom Hollander in Mojo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mojo</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 20 July 1995</strong><br>Echoes abound: not only Mamet but Cagney gangster movies and even the recent work of Tarantino. But Jez Butterworth is playing a subtle double game. On the one hand, he himself is influenced by the mythic structures of American movies. On the other, he ironically punctures the way small-time Soho drifters, even in the 1950s, modelled themselves on transatlantic icons: they live in Macmillan\u2019s drab England but they aspire to Mitchum and Mature and are openly derisive when one of their number invokes the wartime team spirit of his Uncle Tommy. Butterworth\u2019s ability to write scintillating dialogue may, at the moment, outstrip anything he has to say. But he understands perfectly how language can be used to camouflage fear or boost ego.</p> <h2>It Could Be Any One Of Us</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, 21 August 1996</strong><br>It is a parody of the kind of thriller that used to be staple fare in the reps. Alan Ayckbourn makes amusing play with the cliches of the genre. But his real purpose, as so often, is to write a compassionate anatomy of failure. Indeed, his chief character is a half-shut private eye and deadbeat claims assessor (it is no accident that two of the characters are intending to see Double Indemnity) who could not solve a crossword puzzle. He, of course, decides to take charge of the investigation and, in Jon Strickland\u2019s well-judged performance, he even dons a trenchcoat to quiz the suspects and spins on his heel to finger each of them in turn in the time-honoured tradition of the stock thriller.</p> <h2>Art</h2> <p><strong>Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, 16 October 1996</strong><br>When they hand out the acting awards, they are going to have to devise a hydra-headed statuette to cover the blistering performances of Ken Stott, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. Add Mark Thompson\u2019s pristine, white-walled set and Gary Yershon\u2019s score, and you have an evening that gives undeniable pleasure. But the real test is whether the play encourages audiences to embrace modern art or reject it. I have an uneasy feeling that Yasmina Reza\u2019s play, for all its manifest cleverness, panders to popular prejudice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d6aff2953de8b7b4a6d9aee467356a7096efe40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6aff2953de8b7b4a6d9aee467356a7096efe40/0_0_3937_2730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney in Art at Wyndham\u2019s theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Blistering performance\u2019 \u2026 Albert Finney in Art at Wyndham\u2019s theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Playing With Fire</h2> <p><strong>Nottingham Playhouse, 3 May 1997</strong><br>Good theatre often confirms one\u2019s prejudices; great theatre radically alters one\u2019s perceptions. And the remarkable thing about Luc Bondy\u2019s brilliant modern-dress production of Playing With Fire, starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, is that it totally reinvents Strindberg. In its lightness, wit, eroticism and aestheticism, it resembles nothing so much as an Eric Rohmer movie.</p> <h2>The Cherry Orchard</h2> <p><strong>Birmingham Rep, 29 May 1997</strong><br>Watching an American adaptation of The Cherry Orchard set in the deep south, No\u00ebl Coward famously described it as A Month in the Wrong Country. No one could be so brutal about Janet Suzman\u2019s equally radical version of Chekhov\u2019s play \u2013 a co-production between Birmingham Rep and the Market Theatre, Johannesburg \u2013 which transposes the action to today\u2019s South Africa. It is an intriguing experiment that throws some areas of the play into high relief, while obscuring others. Suzman never cracks one key problem. Chekhov\u2019s play is a study of a society on the brink of change; in South Africa, the revolution has already happened.</p> <h2>Caravan</h2> <p><strong>Bush theatre, London, 18 November 1997</strong><br>What better way for the Bush to celebrate its 25-year existence than with a first play by a new writer? Caravan, by Helen Blakeman, yet another graduate of Birmingham University\u2019s playwriting course, bulges with promise: not least because the action is shaped by character, public events and the holiday home that gives the play its title. The setting is a caravan park in North Wales: what we see is the steady disintegration of a Liverpool working-class family in the enforced intimacy of their hideaway.</p> <h2>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</h2> <p><strong>Cottesloe, London, 3 October 1998</strong><br>What makes a children\u2019s classic? A mixture of adventure and allegory. Of adolescent excitement and adult myth. And the charm of Salman Rushdie\u2019s Haroun and the Sea of Stories, beautifully staged by Tim Supple in an adaptation by him and David Tushingham, is that it works on so many levels. Behind its picturesque fable lies a passionate plea for imaginative freedom, symbolised on the first night by the author\u2019s liberated presence on stage at the curtain call.</p> <h2>Be My Baby</h2> <p><strong>Pleasance, London, 14 November 1998</strong><br>Amanda Whittington\u2019s Be My Baby poignantly pictures the painful predicament of institutionalised young mums. Set in 1965, it also reminds us of the stranglehold of official morality even in that supposedly libertarian decade. Whittington focuses on 19-year-old Mary, a pregnant middle-class girl deposited by her mum in the St Saviour\u2019s home. Once the child is born, welfare services will place it with adoptive parents. But the real point is to show how, in the 60s, all classes treated extramarital pregnancy as a guilty secret and how even pop culture nourished the dream of holy wedlock with the perfect partner. One of the most touching scenes shows the girls in the home miming to the Dixie Cups\u2019 insidiously catching hit Chapel of Love.</p> <h2>Easy Virtue</h2> <p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre, 29 July 1999</strong><br>Who does the young No\u00ebl Coward remind me of? In a strange way, John Osborne. Both were iconoclasts nostalgic for a world they attacked, both were headline celebrities with a private belief in the work ethic. And, for proof of Coward\u2019s internal contradictions, you have only to see his 1924 play, Easy Virtue, given a rare and largely successful revival by Maria Aitken at Chichester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"303b75bf298dbebf881bd3b02f652b37a9c25174\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/303b75bf298dbebf881bd3b02f652b37a9c25174/0_0_1442_1991/724.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Courtenay as King Lear in 1999.\" width=\"724\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A masterful King Lear \u2026 Tom Courtenay at Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>King Lear</h2> <p><strong>Royal Exchange, Manchester, 17 September 1999</strong><br>Tom Courtenay is undeniably better at conveying the anguish of suffering than the arrogance of power; in that sense, he is more sinned against than Sinden. In the opening scene, played in what looks like a formal Renaissance court, one misses the \u201cgreat rage\u201d that should animate Lear. Courtenay establishes Lear\u2019s shuffling, slow-speaking antiquity, but he reacts to Cordelia\u2019s silence and Kent\u2019s candour with a wry puzzlement rather than a tyrannical wrath. Even the fearful curses rained down on Goneril\u2019s womb seem more rhetorical than heartfelt. The turning point comes with Lear\u2019s great attack on superfluity: \u201cO, reason not the need.\u201d Suddenly, Courtenay\u2019s voice acquires a pitiable desperation that pricks one\u2019s tears and, as Lear declines into madness, so the actor grows steadily in stature.</p> <h2>The Lion King</h2> <p><strong>Lyceum, London, 21 October 1999</strong><br>The show\u2019s undoubted appeal lies in Richard Hudson\u2019s scenic design and the masks and puppetry of Julie Taymor and Michael Curry. Taymor, as director, is the organising visual spirit behind the show, and she produces a child\u2019s garden of delights. But even here one notices how much she borrows from the international theatrical language. When the lions demonstrate grief over the death of their king, Mufasa, by producing ribbons of white silk from their eyes, the effect is pure Peter Brook. Taymor has shopped around shrewdly; but, as with the music, what we have is an artful synthesis of international styles rather than something African.</p> <h2>Arcadia</h2> <p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre, 24 August 2000</strong><br>Tom Stoppard\u2019s play is many things: part satire, part detective story (who was the hermit who died in the grounds of Sidley Park?), part debate about determinism and free will, part celebration of ungovernable human curiosity in the face of the running down of the universe. The play is a fantastically ingenious construct, but it lacks a strong internal dynamic, and Peter Wood\u2019s production, explanatory rather than emotional, makes you aware of the lack of narrative propulsion. The one genuinely moving moment comes when Thomasina\u2019s tutor, responding to her lament over Caesar\u2019s burning of the Alexandrian library, argues that whatever is historically lost is recovered in the long march of humanity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ca5290da2ce1f173886daa886603b1111fd5ddc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ca5290da2ce1f173886daa886603b1111fd5ddc/101_191_1042_875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monumental ...

Faust in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Faust</h2> <p><strong>Hanover Expo, 2 September 2000</strong><br>\u201cTime is short and art is long,\u201d says Goethe\u2019s Mephistopheles. He\u2019s not kidding. Peter Stein\u2019s historic, uncut staging of the two parts of Goethe\u2019s Faust, currently playing in Hall 23 of the Hanover Expo, has just taken up 20 hours of my life. You can see it over six evenings or, as I did, during a marathon weekend: 3pm till 10pm on Saturday and 10am till 11pm on Sunday. The action is divided between two hangar-like arenas filled with portable steel seating: the audience constantly shuttles between the two spaces. The audience is certainly moved by Stein\u2019s Faust: literally, for two days. But the ceaseless motion is not a device to distract us. It is a way of ensuring that, imaginatively, we share Faust\u2019s exploratory, circular journey.</p> <h2>The Circle</h2> <p><strong>Salisbury Playhouse, 12 October 2000</strong><br>The danger is that this kind of play, written in 1919, elicits a stock response. It boasts french windows, a stately drawing room, Georgian furniture: all the things young dramatists have fought against. Study the play closely, however, and you see that Somerset Maugham is offering a waspish portrait of upper-class manners.</p> <h2>The Accused</h2> <p><strong>Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 6 December 2000</strong><br>Jeffrey Archer, in the character of a doctor on trial for wife murder, was last night proclaimed guilty by a majority audience vote of 333 to 254. A more considered verdict might be that, as the play\u2019s author, he is also culpable of taking West End theatre back about 50 years by creating a cardboard courtroom drama.</p> <h2>Blasted</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 5 April 2001</strong><br>Five years ago, I was rudely dismissive of Sarah Kane\u2019s Blasted. Yet watching its revival last night I was overcome by its sombre power. So what has changed? The space, the design, the lighting, the cast and James Macdonald\u2019s production are all radically different. But, above all, one sees the play through the perspective of Kane\u2019s tragically short career and her obsession with love\u2019s survival in a monstrously cruel world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"772bb48f4d1fe0b886e491a97bc96a23653371cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/772bb48f4d1fe0b886e491a97bc96a23653371cd/0_79_2067_1241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Petherbridge and Jeffrey Archer in The Accused at Theatre Royal Haymarket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A cardboard courtroom drama\u2019 \u2026 Edward Petherbridge and Jeffrey Archer in The Accused at Theatre Royal Haymarket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Frozen</h2> <p><strong>Cottesloe, London, 4 July 2002</strong><br>The force of Bryony Lavery\u2019s play lies in its ability to change hearts and minds. It never mitigates the horror of child killing, but it makes us understand Agnetha\u2019s argument that physical damage to the brain, rather than inborn evil, prompts serial murder. In an extraordinary scene, Nancy confronts Ralph in his cell and offers him a forgiveness far more fatal than a distant, cold-blooded revenge. I still think there are contradictions within Lavery\u2019s argument: on one level she is out to prove the predictable banality of the killer, yet Agnetha describes Ralph as \u201cmesmerising like a rattlesnake\u201d. And, while showing Ralph as methodically calculating, Lavery brushes aside the idea of moral responsibility. But, in a world filled with tabloid hysteria, Lavery\u2019s play comes across as a refreshing draught of sanity.</p> <h2>Sanctuary</h2> <p><strong>Loft, Lyttelton, London, 31 July 2002</strong><br>I admire Tanika Gupta for using the stage to rub our noses in global reality. There is a graphic description, for instance, of the killings in Rwanda and of the butchery of 3,000 Tutsis seeking sanctuary in a church. And Kabir feels he is haunted by Satan for having failed to protect his wife from a group of rapacious Indian soldiers. Gupta\u2019s play may not always be fair, but it touches a nerve when it suggests that, in our snug little island, we are either ignorant of or indifferent to the world\u2019s suffering.</p> <h2>Mother\u2019s Day</h2> <p><strong>Lyric Studio, London, 21 September 2002</strong><br>Unironic optimism is a rare quality in modern drama. But Courttia Newland\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, enthusiastically put across by the multicultural Post Office company, posits a Britain in which the nuclear family thrives, racial harmony is easily achieved and local councils act with enlightened beneficence. By the end, I was almost prepared to believe in Santa Claus.</p> <h2>The Mob</h2> <p><strong>Orange Tree, London, 9 September 2003</strong><br>The stock argument against John Galsworthy is that, in plays like Strife and Justice, he suffered from a neutralising impartiality. But here his passions are sufficiently aroused for him to allow his hero an unnerving Coriolanus-like contempt for the mob; and even though Galsworthy shows a measure of sympathy for More\u2019s wife, whose brother is called to the front, he also suggests that she shamelessly uses sexual blackmail to break her husband\u2019s militant pacifism.</p> <h2>The Sugar Syndrome</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 21 October 2003</strong><br>This first play by 22-year-old Lucy Prebble has many of the virtues \u2013 and some of the faults \u2013 you expect in early work. It tackles tricky subjects, such as paedophilia and teenage psychological disorders, with unselfconscious candour: at the same time, having outlawed instant moral judgment, Prebble can\u2019t quite determine what to put in its place. Her purpose may be unclear but she has an instinctive playwright\u2019s gift for grabbing your attention and compelling sympathy for damaged people.</p> <h2>Hamlet</h2> <p><strong>Old Vic, London, 28 April 2004</strong><br>Trevor Nunn\u2019s boldest decision is to cast Ben Whishaw, in his early 20s, as Hamlet. With his hollow cheeks, spindly frame and nail-biting intensity, Whishaw makes a compelling figure. In his feigned madness, he reminded me of a scuttling, manic Danish Mr Bean. There are several moments, as when Hamlet tells Gertrude that at her age \u201cthe heyday in the blood is tame\u201d, when Whishaw profitably reminds you of Hamlet\u2019s callowness. But what this Hamlet lacks is irony, reflectiveness and any sense that he poses a real physical danger to Claudius.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85b1b737cec6755f340baf9818bef17753e724c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b1b737cec6755f340baf9818bef17753e724c3/0_0_2368_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour in The History Boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hymn to language \u2026 Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour in The History Boys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The History Boys</h2> <p><strong>Lyttelton, London, 19 May 2004</strong><br>What is astonishing is how much territory Bennett manages to cover: the teaching and meaning of history, inflexible and imaginative approaches to education, and the idea, as in Forty Years On, that a school has the potential to be a metaphor for English life. It is no accident that the play is set in the 80s, when the arguments between beleaguered humanism and pragmatic functionalism were at the very height. The play is also blissfully funny, but behind the almost ceaseless laughter lies a hymn to the joys of language, intellectual exploration and inspirational educators.</p> <h2>Don Carlos</h2> <p><strong>Crucible, Sheffield, 4 October 2004</strong><br>The triumph of Michael Grandage\u2019s production and Christopher Oram\u2019s design lies in their visualisation of Schiller\u2019s ideas. A swinging thurible, a prison-like court with high, barred windows, even the menacing hiss of the ladies-in-waiting\u2019s fans all tell us that we are in a world of religious and political tyranny \u2013 a point underlined by Mike Poulton\u2019s translation, where Philip announces: \u201cThe instrument God places in my hand is terror.\u201d But Grandage also captures the subversive eruption of feeling in this crepuscular hell: at one point Richard Coyle\u2019s neurotic Don Carlos beats against the court doors like a trapped animal, and his simultaneous passion for Posa and the queen implies a state of Hamletesque sexual confusion.</p> <h2>Hedda Gabler</h2> <p><strong>Almeida, London, 17 March 2005</strong><br>The character of Ibsen\u2019s Hedda Gabler is infinitely various. In the past we\u2019ve had melodramatic Heddas, neurasthenic Heddas, socially superior Heddas. But, in Richard Eyre\u2019s fine new production, Eve Best gives us a dazzlingly ironic Hedda: one aware of life\u2019s absurdity and viewing it with a mixture of dark humour and angry exasperation.</p> <h2>You Never Can Tell</h2> <p><strong>Theatre Royal, Bath, 27 August 2005</strong><br>I am staggered by our current indifference to Shaw: when, for instance, did the National Theatre last revive one of his plays? Peter Hall almost single-handedly keeps the Shavian flame alight; and his revival of this 1897 comedy captures perfectly its Mozartian ability to handle serious issues with an airy lightness and grace.</p> <h2>A Right Royal Farce</h2> <p><strong>King\u2019s Head, London, 2 August 2006</strong><br>Last year Toby Young and Lloyd Evans wrote a mildly amusing farce, Who\u2019s the Daddy?, about the shenanigans at the Spectator. Now they have tried to repeat the format with the royal family, and the result is an evening of desperation. Even to summarise the inane plot requires a heroic act of will \u2026 Young and Evans struck lucky with their Spectator skit, but this play suggests they don\u2019t know their farce from their elbow.</p> <h2>War Horse</h2> <p><strong>Olivier, London, 18 October 2007</strong><br>Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold imagery, including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank, and through the line drawings of Rae Smith projected on to a suspended screen. Admittedly, the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action, but Luke Treadaway, as the tenacious Albert, and Angus Wright, as the sympathetic captain, make their mark. The joy of the evening, however, lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the horse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90861eaa32c9e1bef83fa49e674f46bfc78e9379\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90861eaa32c9e1bef83fa49e674f46bfc78e9379/517_0_1613_2016/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tunji Kasim in The Brothers Size.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spellbinding \u2026 Tunji Kasim in The Brothers Size.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Brothers Size</h2> <p><strong>Young Vic, London, 14 November 2007</strong><br>Tarell Alvin McCraney is a graduate of Yale School of Drama and what he has done in this study of two black Louisiana brothers is draw on \u201celements, icons and stories from the Yoruba cosmology\u201d. In practice, this means that the action combines ritual and realism, and that the language takes the form of a heightened prose-poetry. Without doubting McCraney\u2019s talent, I feel that the result is a conscious literary artefact. What I wouldn\u2019t deny is that it comes thrillingly alive in performance.</p> <h2>Glaspell Shorts</h2> <p><strong>Orange Tree, London, 9 April 2008</strong><br>It was the deceptively named Trifles, written in 1916, that established Susan Glaspell\u2019s reputation. Set on a remote farm where a murder has taken place, it shows female observation triumphing over male obtuseness. While an attorney and sheriff blunder around, their wives discover the real clue to the crime in an empty cage, a strangled songbird and a badly sewn quilt. With the deftest economy, Glaspell conjures up a world of solitude, despair and imprisonment where the women acknowledge their share of guilt.</p> <h2>Fast Labour</h2> <p><strong>West Yorkshire Playhouse, 25 April 2008</strong><br>The play reminds us of our own complicity in the migrant labour industry: as someone points out, the British want their last-minute iceberg lettuce in March without questioning how it got there. Steve Waters\u2019 twin-focus technique allows the migrants to drop their fractured English, signalling a return to their native tongue, and exchange wickedly subversive thoughts about their inherited world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb44120c5efc822bbc7591301e640842982f194c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb44120c5efc822bbc7591301e640842982f194c/0_185_3804_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Engel in Her Naked Skin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passion and politics coalesce ...

Film footage of Emily Davison\u2019s sacrificial gesture at the 1913 Derby is followed by a sketch of male political intransigence over female suffrage. But Lenkiewicz\u2019s real concern is to show how female militancy transcended class and sexual convention. Lady Celia Cain, trapped in a loveless marriage, is erotically drawn to Eve, a young suffragette machinist. Passion and politics coalesce as they pursue an intense affair, but the question Lenkiewicz obliquely raises is whether liberation is more easily achieved from a position of social privilege.</p> <h2>Imagine This</h2> <p><strong>New London theatre, </strong><strong>20 November 2008</strong><br>They said it couldn\u2019t be done: a musical about the Warsaw ghetto. And, now that I\u2019ve seen it, I know that they were right. If this show ultimately fails, it is not for want of trying, but because of the discrepancy between form and content. The romantic sentiment and uplift inherent in the musical sit uneasily with a story of not just heroic resistance but starvation, suffering and the death of more than 100,000 Polish Jews.</p> <h2>Death and the King\u2019s Horseman</h2> <p><strong>Olivier, London, 9 April 2009</strong><br>Rufus Norris\u2019s production, with the aid of Katrina Lindsay\u2019s spectacular design, moves assuredly from the teeming world of a raffia-filled market to the play\u2019s elemental conclusion. There are sterling performances from Nonso Anonzie as the horseman, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as his son, and Claire Benedict as the market leader. One emerges dazzled but also disturbed by Soyinka\u2019s ideas: in particular, the unfashionable notion that death can be seen as a triumphant entrance rather than a tragic exit.</p> <h2>Funny Turns</h2> <p><strong>Hull Truck, 30 April 2009</strong><br>In these recessive times, a new theatre is as rare as snow in June. And, in moving from an old converted backstreet Methodist church into a spanking new space in the town centre, Hull Truck has got itself a dazzler. What strikes me is the value for money of the \u00a315m venue: it boasts a 440-seat main house, a 135-seat studio and wide public spaces that use glazed brick and steel. The wraparound stage has echoes of the former Spring Street building, and Funny Turns, written and directed by John Godber, shows his familiar optimistic championship of society\u2019s underdogs. Even if it doesn\u2019t have the instant mythic appeal of Bouncers and Up\u2019n\u2019Under, it displays a similar warmheartedness.</p> <h2>It Felt Like a Kiss</h2> <p><strong>Hardman Square, Manchester, 3 July 2009</strong><br>The last third of the evening is a total letdown. We find ourselves wandering through debris-filled rooms, entering desolate cells, even being pursued down darkened corridors by a masked man clutching a chainsaw. I guess the aim is to show how the American dream turned into a nightmare. But to do it through these fairground shock tactics is an insult to our intelligence. The cant critical word for this kind of thing is \u201cscary\u201d. But what is the point of simply making people jump out of their skins?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2dcda315611c14290450f999d6932e3d1333a614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcda315611c14290450f999d6932e3d1333a614/23_287_2623_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Bonnici and Tanya Franks in The Black Album.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hectic affair ...

The result is a busy, hectic affair that raises all kinds of issues about religious and political faith, fatwas and censorship and the purpose of art. But, as so often with adaptations, you get the bones without the thickness of texture that was part of the original\u2019s charm.</p> <h2>Category B</h2> <p><strong>Tricycle, London, 13 October 2009</strong><br>The Tricycle certainly thinks big. After its trilogy about Afghanistan earlier in the year, it now comes up with an ambitious three-play season by black writers about the state of Britain. First out of the blocks is Roy Williams with a typically forceful play about prison life that manages to avoid most of the cliches that cling to the genre. Williams\u2019 setting is a category-B jail: the kind that neither the screws nor the prisoners want to end up in. But what he brings out are the uncanny parallels between the institution\u2019s rival power blocs.</p> <h2>Behud (Beyond Belief)</h2> <p><strong>Belgrade, Coventry, 31 March 2010</strong><br>You can see why Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti had to write this play. It is her response to the notorious events that in 2004 led to her play, Behzti, being withdrawn after mass Sikh protests outside, and even inside, Birmingham Rep. By recreating that traumatic episode in fictionalised form, Bhatti is clearly exorcising her demons and liberating her imagination. The new piece, however, is only intermittently successful as drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e8e447a7e9b7ca24d21242faf263c33033baa8ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8e447a7e9b7ca24d21242faf263c33033baa8ad/0_943_4032_5040/800.jpg\" alt=\"Behud.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exorcising demons ...

Four actors alternate in the role of Ben (I caught Samuel Barnett). The sequence of events also depends on receipts handed out to the audience as they enter; they are later reclaimed by Ben as he struggles to fill in a tax return and recall a year of London life. The idea of tax receipts as an index to existence is highly original.</p> <h2>The Persians</h2> <p><strong>Brecon Beacons, 13 August 2010</strong><br>This is site-specific theatre with a vengeance. High up in the Brecon Beacons, in a mock-up village used by the military as a training base, National Theatre Wales is recreating the oldest extant play in western drama: Aeschylus\u2019s The Persians. The combination of the story and the setting, with the sun slowly disappearing over the hills, is overwhelming. We assemble in a square in this deserted military village where the four-strong male chorus is rejoicing in war and announcing: \u201cNo one can withstand this tsunami of the Persians in full rage.\u201d We then march up a hill to sit in front of a four-storey house with the front cut away; and there we see, both in live action and on video, the tragedy enacted. There\u2019s a wonderful moment when Atossa arrives in a white car to a blaze of trumpets.</p> <h2>Onassis</h2> <p><strong>Novello, London, 13 October 2010</strong><br>Martin Sherman has written not so much a play as a part, and it is one that Robert Lindsay fills to overflowing. But, as if to compensate for the emptiness of the dialogue, he is forced to lapse into an Anthony Quinn style of overacting that I\u2019m tempted to dub Exorbitant the Greek. \u201cStillness always works,\u201d Onassis remarks at one point, but you\u2019d scarcely know it from the restless, larger-than-life performance filled with extravagant hand gestures that Lindsay feels obliged to give. He is a fine actor compelled, by the fundamental lack of drama, to put on a bit of a show.</p> <h2>Racing Demon</h2> <p><strong>Crucible, Sheffield, 18 February 2011</strong><br>David Hare\u2019s play gets richer with time. Acclaimed in 1990 for its accurate portrait of a Church of England in crisis, it now seems a perfect metaphor for British institutional life. Presented as part of Sheffield\u2019s three-play Hare season, it could be about the tensions inside any hierarchical organisation, from a political party to a national newspaper. What is impressive is Hare\u2019s imaginative reach: his ability to see the virtues, as well as the flaws, in every character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24667300bc704a06386f1da308308164d3c2009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24667300bc704a06386f1da308308164d3c2009/142_602_3934_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller in Frankenstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epic grandeur ... Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller in Frankenstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Frankenstein</h2> <p><strong>Olivier, London, 24 February 2011</strong><br>Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Creature is unforgettable. \u201cTall as a pine tree,\u201d as the text insists, he has humour as well as pathos: his naked entry into the world is marked by a totter on splayed feet and, when he moves, it is with a forward-thrusting, angular, almost Hulotesque curiosity. But there is also an epic grandeur about Cumberbatch. As he quotes Paradise Lost, his voice savours every syllable of Milton\u2019s words and when, in outrage at his rejection by the exile\u2019s family, he burns their cottage, he utters a Hamletesque cry of \u201cI sweep to my revenge.\u201d It is an astonishing performance. Miller\u2019s strength, in contrast, lies in his menace. Stockier than Cumberbatch, his Creature makes you believe in the character\u2019s satanic impulse and in his capacity for murder.</p> <h2>truth and reconciliation</h2> <p><strong>Royal Court, London, 6 September 2011</strong><br>Staged by debbie tucker green herself in the Theatre Upstairs, with the spectators sitting on hard chairs that replicate those endured by the characters, the piece is cryptic, fragmented, unsettling and well acted \u2013 especially by Wunmi Mosaku as the Rwandan widow, Petra Letang as the zealous Zimbabwean, and Clare Cathcart as a defiant Northern Irish mother. But, although the play raises the issue of whether truth and reconciliation can be compatible, it feels strangely incomplete. I wanted either to hear the piece again or attend a post-play discussion to learn whether the author\u2019s political pessimism was justified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89ede506490d9ace6f3858d316bdae48c30678a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ede506490d9ace6f3858d316bdae48c30678a0/0_257_4216_2531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis Mahoney, Wunmi Mosaku and Ashley Zhangazha in Truth and Reconciliation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of violence \u2026 Louis Mahoney, Wunmi Mosaku and Ashley Zhangazha in truth and reconciliation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stones in His Pockets</h2> <p><strong>Tricycle, London, 20 December 2011</strong><br>Marie Jones\u2019s witty conceit is to view the making of a piece of Hollywood-Irish hokum from the perspective of two County Kerry extras: the quintessentially optimistic Charlie and the more jaundiced Jake, lately returned from New York. What Jones does is to skilfully oppose life and art. In the movie, the high-born heroine romantically weds a local lad; in reality, Jake rejects the advances of the gushing American star who pretends to seduce him in order to appropriate his accent. And, while the film offers a rose-tinted vision of Irish life, the truth is that the land is being split up and Jake\u2019s suicidal cousin is the latest victim of both rural decline and the national propensity to dream.</p> <h2>Hay Fever</h2> <p><strong>No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, 27 February 2012</strong><br>Among the guests there is a peach of a performance from Jeremy Northam as the buttoned-up diplomat quivering with shy lust. His initial, embarrassed encounter with Amy Morgan\u2019s taciturn flapper also proves that Coward, like Pinter, knew the comic value of extended pauses. And Phoebe Waller-Bridge makes something truly memorable of Judith\u2019s daughter whom she plays as a gauche 19-year-old trying strenuously hard to be <em>soign\u00e9</em> and sophisticated. But that simply offers further proof that Coward\u2019s 1924 comedy becomes even funnier when played, as in Davies\u2019s fine revival, for its emotional veracity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdab79b0fbb249371f8715037c937c4076e77ef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdab79b0fbb249371f8715037c937c4076e77ef8/0_161_3410_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Rees, Anjana Vasan and Matthew Aubrey in The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fact and fiction \u2026 Kyle Rees, Anjana Vasan and Matthew Aubrey in The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from theatre company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning</h2> <p><strong>Cardiff High School, Wales, 19 April 2012</strong><br>Tim Price gives us a vivid picture of Manning\u2019s life and of the contradictory responses that he evokes. But what troubles me is the blurring of fact and fiction. I can easily believe that Manning would have been taught about Welsh radicals, from the Chartist John Frost to Aneurin Bevan. But, in one scene, Manning is asked to enact the role of the 23-year-old Dic Penderyn, who in 1831 led a Merthyr uprising and was publicly executed. Entering into the spirit of the part, the 13-year-old Manning denies that Penderyn was a martyr and says: \u201cI just got caught and blamed for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d Dramatic licence is here stretched to the utmost in that Price makes the schoolboy Manning utter sentiments that appear to prophesy his present predicament.</p> <h2>London Road</h2> <p><strong>Olivier, London, 13 August 2012</strong><br>Conventional musicals, even at their best, take us into a world of fantasy. This miraculously innovative show finds a new way of representing reality. Rufus Norris\u2019s production and Katrina Lindsay\u2019s design also deftly evoke the community\u2019s transition from a period of terror to one of entrapment, symbolised by a maze of police incident tape, to restoration, as floral baskets descend from the Olivier ceiling. And an 11-strong ensemble play multiple characters \u2013 with Kate Fleetwood, Nick Holder and Nicola Sloane outstanding as leading lights in Neighbourhood Watch. A previous Blythe show about seaside sex workers, The Girlfriend Experience, smacked of condescension. But this one not only explores the way it takes a crisis to engender community spirit but opens up rich possibilities for musical theatre.</p> <h2>My Life After</h2> <p><strong>Corn Exchange, Brighton, 27 May 2013</strong><br>The Brighton festival\u2019s theatre programme ended with this extraordinary import from Argentina in which five actors recalled, with the aid of photos, letters, home movies and old clothes, the lives of their parents. Conceived and directed by Lola Arias, the show offered a compelling mix of personal memories and \u2013 since the actors were all born around the time of the 1976-83 dictatorship \u2013 a mosaic of modern Argentinian history. I suspect Arias is an admirer of the Brazilian pioneer Augusto Boal, whose \u201ctheatre of the oppressed\u201d dramatised communal issues. Here, the big question is how the actors either live up to the radicalism of a previous generation or, in one case, live down its collusion with dictatorship.</p> <h2>Chimerica</h2> <p><strong>Almeida, London, 30 May 2013</strong><br>\u201cChimerica\u201d was a term coined by economist Niall Ferguson to indicate the global dominance of the dual country that is China and America. But Kirkwood\u2019s play highlights the sharp differences, as well as the similarities, between the twin superpowers. In America, Joe\u2019s bolshie individualism as a photographer who records world events is ultimately celebrated; in China, Zhang Lin, who has already suffered for his involvement in the Tiananmen protests, pays a heavy price for inciting unrest. Kirkwood goes further in examining the nature of capitalism in both countries. China may be open to western investment and apparently enthralled by its products; at the same time, Joe\u2019s girlfriend, Tessa, in a brilliant presentation speech to her clients, explains that the only way into its markets is to understand that China is a country that values the supremacy of its culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d54505f19c1ae7c2338e5e3864d97def8c013b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54505f19c1ae7c2338e5e3864d97def8c013b13/347_549_3855_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Chan, Benedict Wong and David KS Tse in Chimerica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharp differences ...

So we get an older and younger Queen, respectively known as Q and Liz. Equally, we get an older and younger Thatcher, identified as T and Mags. Add in two male actors playing 17 other roles, ranging from Kenneth Kaunda to Rupert Murdoch, and you have what sounds like a recipe for confusion. In fact, Buffini\u2019s device gives the whole evening a buoyant, meta-theatrical playfulness. The older Q spends much of the play trying to hustle the action along in order to get to the interval. And the two Thatchers, while consistent in their detestation of socialism, often lapse into a good cop/bad cop routine that says a lot about the late PM\u2019s contradictory techniques.</p> <h2>Punishment Without Revenge</h2> <p><strong>Theatre Royal, Bath, 22 October 2013</strong><br>This is the real deal: an unqualified masterpiece by Lope de Vega that, in Meredith Oakes\u2019s excellent new translation, forms part of Bath\u2019s Spanish Golden Age season. Since Lope\u2019s 1631 play deals with the guilt-racked love between a young woman and her stepson, one is inevitably reminded of Euripides\u2019s Hippolytus and Racine\u2019s Phedre in its moral intricacy. However, Lope\u2019s play is the equal of its twin rivals \u2013 and indeed, in some ways, far better. This is a multilayered play that touches on numerous themes, from the power of theatre to poisoned inheritances. It gets a first-rate production from Laurence Boswell, which is physically spare yet implies sumptuousness. Much of that is down to Mark Bailey\u2019s sets and costumes, with their silver thrones and sable doublets.</p> <h2>Ciphers</h2> <p><strong>Everyman theatre, Cheltenham, 23 October 2013</strong><br>Even if Dawn King\u2019s play is not as original as Foxfinder, it is clearly the work of a natural dramatist who knows how to generate suspense. Blanche McIntyre\u2019s production and James Perkins\u2019 design, based on sliding white screens, also have a pristine purity that contrasts neatly with the murkiness of a world in which human beings are disposable. Keenan doubles beautifully as both the enigmatic Justine and her upfront sister, and there is strong support from Jhutti as both a community worker and an adulterous artist, and from Bruce Alexander and Shereen Martin as figures who, in both sections of the plot, are pulling the strings. The result is an intelligent puzzle play in which, rather as in Macbeth, nothing is but what is not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afbc6d7ddfdf3b0f49432159f9ce7003e19deffc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afbc6d7ddfdf3b0f49432159f9ce7003e19deffc/80_379_2605_3255/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Terry With Eileen Atkins at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An acting masterclass \u2026 Ellen Terry With Eileen Atkins at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ellen Terry With Eileen Atkins</h2> <p><strong>Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, 21 January 2014</strong><br>Actors are often the sharpest judges of Shakespeare: a point proved by Ellen Terry, who in 1910 started touring a series of informal lecture-demonstrations on Shakespeare\u2019s characters. Eileen Atkins has now adapted them into a 75-minute show that offers the delirious pleasure of seeing one great actor inhabiting the mind and spirit of another. Atkins possesses not just an immaculate technique but an imagination that allows her effortlessly to transcend the limitations of age and gender. If the BBC does not instantly send a film crew to record this masterclass in the art of acting, I shall go and chain myself to the portals of Broadcasting House in protest.</p> <h2>Twelfth Night</h2> <p><strong>Everyman, Liverpool, 13 March 2014</strong><br>Adam Levy\u2019s white-suited, self-dramatising Orsino repeats the play\u2019s opening word, \u201cIf\u201d, three times as a prelude to a visual coup introducing the shipwrecked Viola. As scholar Michael Dobson has pointed out, the whole play seems to take place within a conditional clause, asking \u201cwhat if there were a country such as Illyria?\u201d Gemma Bodinetz seizes on that idea to present us with a series of interlocking fantasies in which people lose their sense of self. There\u2019s a telling moment when Jodie McNee\u2019s disguised Viola, asked by Natalie Dew\u2019s Olivia \u201cWhat are you? What would you?\u201d, looks totally flummoxed as if she herself is unsure.</p> <h2>This May Hurt a Bit</h2> <p><strong>Octagon, Bolton, 27 March 2014</strong><br>Since the NHS is never out of the headlines and directly affects most of us, our theatre has long been crying out for a new play on the subject. And, while Stella Feehily\u2019s piece, co-produced by Out of Joint and the Octagon, is unapologetic agitprop on behalf of a beleaguered service, it makes its points most effectively when it captures the mix of care and chaos you find in wards up and down the country.</p> <h2>Yellow Face</h2> <p><strong>The Shed, London, 12 May 2014</strong><br>David Henry Hwang uses the satirical format to ask what it means to be classified by ethnicity, and also to invoke the xenophobic persecution of Chinese-Americans in the late 1990s. Behind the laughter, this is a probingly political play that tests the validity of Hwang\u2019s optimistic assertion that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what someone looks like on the outside\u201d. Alex Sims\u2019s bracing production pursues its ideas with quickfire vigour. It\u2019s a peach of a play, using theatre as a metaphor for life.</p> <h2>Ballyturk</h2> <p><strong>Black Box, Galway, 21 July 2014</strong><br>As so often in Enda Walsh\u2019s plays, the main characters inhabit a hermetic world \u2013 almost a womb without a view. In this case, they are two men, simply identified as One and Two, who pass the time in speeded-up, silent-comedy rituals and speculating about daily life in an imagined Irish town called Ballyturk. But when the character Three turns up, he not only breaks up the partnership but invites one of the duo into the outer world, en route to inevitable extinction. It is not the last surprise Walsh springs, but it is as if Beckett\u2019s Godot had unexpectedly materialised.</p> <h2>The James Plays</h2> <p><strong>Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 11 August 2014</strong><br>The main thing to say about Rona Munro\u2019s plays is that, while telling us a lot about Scottish history from 1421 to 1488, they are also full of topical resonance. You see this especially in the opening play, The Key Will Keep the Lock. It shows James Stewart, after being kept a prisoner by the English for 18 years, finally assuming the Scottish throne that was rightfully his. As he does so, James McArdle\u2019s wonderfully nervous king gives a speech to his aggressive nobles in which he pours scorn on England\u2019s financial predatoriness and claims that a future Scotland \u201cwill be assaulted but it will never be broken\u201d. It\u2019s a good line that could easily be appropriated \u2013 and probably will be \u2013 by Alex Salmond.</p> <h2>The Apple Family Plays</h2> <p><strong>Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, 5 May 2015</strong><br>British drama tends to be driven by politics and American by relationships. That, at least, is what we assume. Such generalisations are blown apart by Richard Nelson\u2019s extraordinary quartet of plays, which dominated the opening weekend of this year\u2019s Brighton festival. Lasting close to seven hours in total, the plays use the crises within a single family to explore the larger confusions of liberal America. What is striking is how much ground Nelson covers: hope and disillusion, individual and collective memory, and the need to acknowledge the past without being possessed by it.</p> <h2>The Trial</h2> <p><strong>Young Vic, London, 29 June 2015</strong><br>Someone must have had it in for Michael B. He was dozing peacefully at home when a knock came at the door. Two men appeared, telling him he had to attend a new production of Kafka\u2019s The Trial. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Steven Berkoff\u2019s version on stage. I\u2019ve also seen a film directed by Orson Welles and another written by Harold Pinter.\u201d He was forcefully told that was not enough. This time everything would be radically different. Watched by his guards, he arrived at the theatre to find a crowd excitedly milling around. To get to the auditorium people were led down long corridors and admitted through keyhole-shaped doors. Once inside, Michael B was seated on a judicial bench and at first astonished by what he saw.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"880621a275e14d6683a03dbe3671972a2d1b9fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/880621a275e14d6683a03dbe3671972a2d1b9fff/570_0_2458_3072/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Kinnear and Hugh Skinner (Kyle) in The Trial by Franz Kafka.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radically different ...

Aspects of it remain difficult but, watching the magnetic Maxine Peake, it becomes clear that the play offers, among other things, a vision of climate catastrophe we can all understand. In some ways, Churchill\u2019s play is like a darker version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in that it shows a collision between mortal and immortal worlds. The big difference is that Churchill\u2019s skriker, a shape-shifting, ancient fairy, is chillingly visible, unlike Shakespeare\u2019s Puck, to the two teenage girls whom she haunts and pursues.</p> <h2>Medea</h2> <p><strong>Gate, London, 10 November 2015</strong><br>Euripides\u2019 Medea has achieved such mythical status it is subject to endless variations. But, where Rachel Cusk\u2019s new version at the Almeida cheats us of the cathartic climax, this radical update by Kate Mulvany and Anne-Louise Sarks, that originated at the Belvoir Sydney, does not duck the story\u2019s horror. Its big idea is to see the action from the perspective of the heroine\u2019s two children and the effect is as startling as Tom Stoppard\u2019s notion of viewing Hamlet from the vantage point of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p> <h2>Look Back in Anger</h2> <p><strong>Derby theatre, 9 March 2016</strong><br>You may go expecting a museum piece. What is startling is that John Osborne\u2019s play, intimately based on his experiences as a married actor at Derby rep \u2013 and now celebrating its 60th anniversary \u2013 survives due to its unremitting emotional intensity. Director Sarah Brigham has also had the wit to precede it with an hour-long mono-drama by Jane Wainwright that charts the reaction of a gutsy, modern working-class woman to life\u2019s baffling disappointments. Osborne\u2019s play was initially hailed as a vital social document. It says a lot about the class-ridden culture of mid-50s Britain and paints a still-resonant picture of a younger generation educated but with nowhere to go. However, what keeps the play alive is its scorching, Strindbergian portrait of a failing marriage.</p> <h2>Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night</h2> <p><strong>Bristol Old Vic, 30 March 2016</strong><br>Timing matters with Eugene O\u2019Neill as much as it does in a Wagner opera. I suspect Richard Eyre is seeking to contrast the brisk allegro of the play\u2019s opening with the long adagio of its tragic end where the four members of the Tyrone family confront the appalling truth. But too often the tempo is unvaried, so that we miss the almost comic pattern of accusation and retraction that afflicts all the characters. When James Tyrone, a celebrated actor who sold out to commercial success, recites Shakespeare and his tubercular son Edmund recites Baudelaire, we should also feel them dwelling on the consolations of poetry rather than rushing through the speeches as they do here.</p> <h2>Doctor Faustus</h2> <p><strong>Duke of York\u2019s theatre, 26 April 2016</strong><br>The idea of media stardom as a trick of the light is now a truism, and Lloyd\u2019s production is forced to work overtime to give it purchase. We get lashings of sex and violence as well as an awkward collision of the two when Faustus invokes Helen of Troy who appears in the shape of the adoring Wagner and whom he proceeds to stab and rape. The lead actor acquits himself well in the circumstances. Given that he is obliged to bare his buttocks and parade in bloodied boxer shorts, I was tempted to dub him \u201coff-with-your-kit Harington\u201d. But he is much more than a TV icon and, when the production allows him, he gives us a sense of Faustus\u2019s flailing despair.</p> <h2>Bitches</h2> <p><strong>Finborough, London, 18 August 2016</strong><br>Bola Agbaje has written a number of very good plays about different aspects of cultural identity. She has now come up with a new piece for the National Youth Theatre about two female pals \u2013 black Funke and white Cleo \u2013 who dedicate their energies to a music-and-chat vlog, but who, off camera, reveal their deep divisions. In exposing the potential dangers of a faith in new technology and the transcendent power of video, Agbaje makes a shrewd point that absolves her from the charge of vlogging a dead horse.</p> <h2>The Rover</h2> <p><strong>The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, 16 September 2016</strong><br>Even if Loveday Ingram allows no innuendo to go unstressed, she successfully steers us through Aphra Behn\u2019s multiplying subplots and allows the action to grow, with the aid of Grant Olding\u2019s fizzing score, out of a society in a permanent state of fiesta. Joseph Millson, making his entrance swinging on a rope like a Restoration Errol Flynn, plays Willmore excellently as a shameless rakehell whose sexual rapacity is offset by a boyish charm. You may not approve of him but you can\u2019t help liking him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f1f46f8a829784d18aab26a92e0a361599f1500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f1f46f8a829784d18aab26a92e0a361599f1500/0_0_4527_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barber Shop Chronicles at the Dorfman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invigorating \u2026 Barber Shop Chronicles at the Dorfman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Barber Shop Chronicles</h2> <p><strong>Dorfman, London 8 June 2017</strong><br>Bijan Sheibani\u2019s exuberant production begins and ends with a party in which audience members dance with the cast or even go on stage for a quick trim. That seems entirely in keeping with the spirit of Inua Ellams\u2019 invigorating play, which shows how barbers\u2019 shops, run by and catering for African men, combine the roles of pub and political platform, social centre and soapbox. It makes the average white British male\u2019s belief that you simply go in for a haircut look decidedly dreary.</p> <h2>Julius Caesar</h2> <p><strong>Storyhouse, Chester, 26 June 2017</strong><br>As the audience assembles in the foyer, pro-Caesar supporters emerge bearing banners saying: \u201cMake Rome great again.\u201d Although upbraided by the tribunes, the crowd noisily cheers as cameras record the arrival of their beloved leader. Celebrations continue in the auditorium, where the Lupercalian fertility festival is in full swing and Christopher Wright\u2019s Caesar, to the accompaniment of rock music, poses for selfies and morphs from Donald Trump in Washington to Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury.</p> <h2>Gangsta Granny</h2> <p><strong>Garrick, London, 2 August 2017</strong><br>Ben, the 11-year-old hero, is a reverse Billy Elliot who has a covert wish to be a plumber and abhors his parents\u2019 passion for ballroom dancing. Meanwhile, his lonely old gran, on whom he is deposited once a week, seems boring, smelly and flatulent but turns out to have a hidden life. It all makes for a lively show that prompts self-examination. When I asked my grandson on the way out if he found me smelly and boring, he had the wit to reply that at least I didn\u2019t smell.</p> <h2>Loot</h2> <p><strong>Park theatre, London, 24 August 2017</strong><br>Michael Fentiman\u2019s production constantly reminds us that Joe Orton\u2019s shock tactics are a way of alerting us to the hypocrisy of a society in which greed, gain and lust are masked by religious piety and veneration for authority. You see this most clearly in the figure of Inspector Truscott, who, while posing as a man from the Metropolitan Water Board, turns out to be a corruptible sadist. Christopher Fulford plays him to perfection as a moustached suburbanite with a manic gleam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb68ddaa34dbafc4553137aec1204d3e815bb5b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb68ddaa34dbafc4553137aec1204d3e815bb5b7/0_235_4261_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Fulford as Inspector Truscott in Loot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corruptible sadist ...

So it seems fitting that Barrie Rutter\u2019s farewell, at least on home soil, to the company he founded should be a version by Blake Morrison of Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage\u2019s Turcaret. Even if Morrison\u2019s adaptation is unlikely to cause the offence that the original did in France in 1709, it remains a lively satire on capitalist corruption. Morrison shifts the action from Louis XIV\u2019s Paris to a Yorkshire town in the 1920s, but the characters are still propelled by greed. Rose, a young war widow, milks a besotted bank manager, Algy, for all she can while herself being conned by a money-grubbing cousin. But loot is to this play what sex is to La Ronde, in that it forms an endless daisy chain.</p> <h2>The Shadow Factory</h2> <p><strong>NST City, Southampton, 16 February 2018</strong><br>Howard Brenton seeks to highlight the gulf between a bloody-minded British belief in liberty and the dictatorial necessities of wartime. Even the local engineer forced to execute Beaverbrook\u2019s plans says: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m carpet-bombing my own town.\u201d This leads Brenton into some strange ironies, whereby an aristo who readily hands over her stately home to the Spitfire design team emerges as more instinctively patriotic than the obdurate Dimmock. The play\u2019s vitality, however, springs from its ability to show British resistance to any form of authoritarianism while keeping its roots firmly in Southampton life.</p> <h2>The Last Ship</h2> <p><strong>Northern Stage, Newcastle, 22 March 2018</strong><br>Having bombed on Broadway, this musical by Sting about the shipbuilding industry is being revived on its native soil with a new book by its director, Lorne Campbell. The only mystery is why the show ever premiered in the US in the first place. It is a deeply British musical that champions Tyneside life and leaves you in no doubt where it stands on Thatcherite economics. It was received, quite rightly, with full-throated acclaim by its Newcastle audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"780865e914c60721a0703b2483cafa6fa9e3d5b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/780865e914c60721a0703b2483cafa6fa9e3d5b9/0_361_5416_3250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Alvin-Wilson and Ricky Fearon in Nine Night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where past meets present \u2026 Oliver Alvin-Wilson and Ricky Fearon in Nine Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nine Night</h2> <p><strong>Dorfman, London, 1 May 2018</strong><br>There\u2019s a key moment in Natasha Gordon\u2019s highly impressive debut play when Aunt Maggie leaves the nine-night funeral wake that is part of her Jamaican heritage to go home and watch EastEnders. \u201cBig tings are gawn in the Queen Vic tonight,\u201d she announces. For me, that neatly sums up Gordon\u2019s theme \u2013 which is the ability to inhabit two cultures and to acknowledge one\u2019s ancestral past while living fully in the present.</p> <h2>Machinal</h2> <p><strong>Almeida, London, 12 June 2018</strong><br>Sophie Treadwell\u2019s writing is impressive for how much it leaves out. She doesn\u2019t need to show us every detail of Helen\u2019s honeymoon or home life to make us understand her sense of suffocation. While her dialogue is stylised, Treadwell uses the polyphonic possibilities of theatre to press home her point. From the outset, Helen seems surrounded by \u201cthe purgatory of noise\u201d, whether it be the clack of office machinery, the clatter of garbage collectors or the drill that shreds her postnatal nerves. Sound has lately been reduced to an ominous hum in British theatre; in the expert hands of Ben and Max Ringham, it becomes a vital part of the play\u2019s texture.</p> <h2>The Watsons</h2> <p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre, 8 November 2018</strong><br>I would seriously urge anyone planning to attend Laura Wade\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished novel, The Watsons, to stop reading now since one of the play\u2019s many pleasures is its capacity to endlessly take us by surprise. We go in expecting a literary exercise and come out having seen a philosophical comedy.</p> <h2>Sweat</h2> <p><strong>Donmar Warehouse, London, 20 December 2018</strong><br>Lynn Nottage, as she showed in Intimate Apparel, has the capacity to dramatise work. In this breathtaking new play, she tackles the devastating impact of loss of work and of de-industrialisation on modern America. Based on extensive interviews with residents of the rustbelt town of Reading, Pennsylvania, it shows the anger and despair that helped fuel the election of Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Our Lady of Kibeho</h2> <p><strong>Royal and Derngate, Northampton, 17 January 2019</strong><br>Katori Hall\u2019s virtue is that she puts a complete world on stage, one that embraces a cloistered college, a faith-hungry village and tribal hatred. James Dacre\u2019s production rises to the challenge with the aid of a community ensemble, a Jonathan Fensom set that shows the sun-kissed landscape beyond the hermetic school, and an Orlando Gough score that blends a cappella singing with tingling accompaniments to the girls\u2019 visions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bb9d977a297c1a57867363e0687fd9f4fb597da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb9d977a297c1a57867363e0687fd9f4fb597da/0_128_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A complete world on stage ...

Rima Nsubuga, Gabrielle Brooks, Yasmin Mwanza and Michaela Blackburn in Our Lady of Kibeho.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>La Reprise: Histoire(s) du Theatre (I)</h2> <p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 4 August 2019</strong><br>I loved this show for its clarity, compassion and curiosity. Director Milo Rau has something of the ability of Ken Loach to ask disturbing political questions, while extending the possibility of the medium in which he works. This show \u2013 which, among many others things, portrays the economic depression of a de-industrialised city and proves theatre is a form of inquiry \u2013 marks him out as a major talent.</p> <h2>Mary Poppins</h2> <p><strong>Prince Edward theatre, London, 13 November 2019</strong><br>I was rather grudging in my praise when I first saw this musical in 2004. Richard Eyre\u2019s production, based on the PL Travers stories and the Disney movie and supplementing the Richard and Robert Sherman songs with new ones by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, was more remarkable for its clinical efficiency than its pulsating joy. Either the show, which has enjoyed a long UK tour, has changed or I have: it now strikes me as rapturously pleasurable.</p> <h2>Pippi Longstocking</h2> <p><strong>Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, 19 December 2019<br></strong>The virtue of the show is that it conveys the spirit of Astrid Lindgren\u2019s books and suggests that Pippi belongs in the great line of rule-breakers from the medieval Till Eulenspiegel to Richmal Crompton\u2019s William. I came out with a smile on my face, which is fortunate since this show marks the end of a chapter in my life as a critic and allowed me to exit stage left happily chuckling.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Durbridge Play Fortune theatre, London, 2 October 1971 The conventional stage whodunit is about as exciting as a vicarage parlour game. But the great virtue of this slick, highly polished thriller by Francis Durbridge is that almost from the start we know who is going to murder whom: the dramatic excitement, as in Dial M for Murder, lies in watching the net slowly close in on the smug, smooth protagonist. Company Her Majesty\u2019s theatre, London, 19 January 1972 How good is Company? When I saw Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical 18 months ago in New York, I thought it a marvellously tart, wry, original show that got away from all the lumbering cliches of the formula-bound Broadway musical. Second time round I admire it even more; partly because its surface exuberance seems to conceal a great sadness, partly because it has the whiplash precision of the best Broadway shows plus a good deal of intellectual resonance. Not I Royal Court, London, 17 January 1973 If Beckett has a painter\u2019s eye, he also has a poet\u2019s ear. The mouth belongs to a 70-year-old woman whose past life flashes before her, like that of someone drowning, but who transfers her experiences to someone else: the impression is of a buzzing skull, a mouth on fire helplessly attached to a body incapable of feeling. If I had to sum up the play\u2019s theme in a phrase, it would be the anguish of memory at a time when all physical sentience had departed. Billie Whitelaw\u2019s performance is an astonishing tour de force combining frenetic verbal speed with total sensitivity to the musical rhythm of the piece. Ken Dodd Liverpool Playhouse, 17 April 1973 Ostensibly, the intention is to explore the nature of laughter: in reality what we get is a king-sized Dodd-fest. It begins with those wayward teeth spotlit in what looks like a conscious parody of Billie Whitelaw in Beckett; and it goes on to run the gamut of Doddy jokes. Wisely, perhaps, Dodd avoids too much theorising. He quotes Freud\u2019s opinions that a laugh is a conservation of psychic energy; but, as he says, the trouble with Freud is that he never played Glasgow second house on a Friday night. Brassneck Nottingham Playhouse, 21 September 1973 Brassneck by Howard Brenton and David Hare is an important play. Not since John Arden\u2019s The Workhouse Donkey 10 years ago have I seen any work that attempts to put a whole regional community on stage and show in detail how the provincial power nexus works. Judging by the outraged huffing and puffing near me, it was courageous of Nottingham Playhouse to stage it. Words of Advice Greenwich theatre, London, 5 March 1974 Fay Weldon\u2019s play is tight, tart and alert. In the centre of the ring are Tammy and Julia, a primary schoolteacher and his suffocating wife, who use each other like punchbags. Encircling them are their parents and in-laws who prefer contradictory, self-interesting advice. My gripe about the play is that its horizons are inevitably limited. It scarcely touches on the high cost of loving, on the way social inequity affects private relationships and on the crucial fact that even our emotional crises are carried on against the background of changing public events: only in plays do people have time to suffer in a vacuum. But Miss Weldon can certainly write. The Tempest Old Vic, London, 7 March 1974 Fourteen years ago precisely, Peter Hall began his brilliant Stratford reign with an over-decorated, eccentrically cast production of Two Gentlemen of Verona. We should not, therefore, despair if he has begun his National Theatre career with a lethargic, vulgarly spectacular, masque-like production of The Tempest that almost manages to submerge the presence of the greatest living Shakespearean actor, Sir John Gielgud, in opulent excess. Bordello Queen\u2019s theatre, London, 19 April 1974 I have, I suppose, seen worse musicals than Bordello. Indeed I can wincingly remember one about refrigerated corpses and another about premature ejaculation at a certain north London engine shed. But it\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve seen a show of such extravagant pointlessness or one that deployed such elaborate resources to convey a message that could be comfortably inscribed on the back of a 3\u00bdd stamp. Travesties Aldwych, London, 11 June 1974 I find it difficult to write in calm, measured tones about Tom Stoppard\u2019s Travesties: a dazzling pyrotechnical feat that combines Wildean pastiche, political history, artistic debate, spoof-reminiscence and song-and-dance in marvellously judicious proportions. The text itself is a dense Joycean web of literary allusions; yet it also radiates sheer intellectual joie de vivre, as if Stoppard were delightedly communicating the fruits of his own researches. Play Mas Royal Court, London, 17 July 1974 Mustapha Matura\u2019s Play Mas is an endearing, intelligent comedy. I only hope the work, playing at heavily reduced prices, gets through to the popular audience it deserves. Not that the play is by any means a mere colourful folksy romp. Even if everything in Trinidad stops for the annual gaudy Dionysiac rite, Matura shows that this cannot conceal either the social and political tensions or the interracial bitterness. Autosacramentales Roundhouse, London, 27 December 1974 I must be honest: I found Autosacramentales, an hour-long Victor Garcia production of a Calderon religious drama, almost totally inaccessible. Even with the help of programme notes and a pocket torch, I could not sort out Sin from Death, the Soul from the Body, or Cain from Abel. No Man\u2019s Land Old Vic, London, 24 April 1975 Harold Pinter\u2019s new play is about precisely what its title suggests: the sense of being caught in some mysterious limbo between life and death, between a world of brute reality and one of fluid uncertainty. But although plenty of plays, from Sweeney Agonistes to Outward Bound, have tried to pin down that strange sense of reaching into a void, I can think of few that have done so as concretely, funnily and concisely as Pinter\u2019s. The Big Red Ladder Show Camden Town Hall, London, 6 December 1975 There was a cup final atmosphere last night at Camden Town Hall as a packed, exultant house roared its approval of the Red Ladder company\u2019s new show, It Makes Yer Sick. The occasion was a benefit night for this spring-heeled leftwing troupe, who next month move to Yorkshire to set up a permanent base. I can only say that the north should count itself lucky, for this show is a model of what popular political theatre ought to be: festive, exuberant and theatrically pungent. Macbeth The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 September 1976 The simpler, the better; that is my feeling about Trevor Nunn\u2019s ceaseless quest for the ideal Macbeth. Two years ago he staged the play in Stratford\u2019s main house as an over elaborate religious spectacle. He then stripped away the ritual for an Aldwych version spoiled by gabbled speaking. And now, at Stratford\u2019s Other Place in a production played without an interval, he has hit the right balance between verbal clarity and depraved religiosity; I have never seen the play come across with such throat-grabbing power. Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi Mayfair theatre, London, 11 February 1977 Pam Gems\u2019s play is a bright, naturalistic, observant comedy that, I presume, tells it like it is. It is written with a glancing lightness worlds away from the grisly gaiety of those all-girl TV sitcoms, and Nancy Meckler\u2019s production has an eye for simple, behaviourist detail I haven\u2019t seen since Peter Gill\u2019s New York production of Fishing. Vautrin Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 10 October 1977 What other company but the Glasgow Citizens would have had the chutzpah to revive Vautrin, a play by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac that has not been seen since its ill-fated Paris premiere in 1840? Having chosen to revive it, what other company would have been able to hit the right note of opulent romantic melodrama? Coriolanus Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 21 October 1977 Terry Hands\u2019 production of Coriolanus at Stratford is staggeringly good. Played on a dark, cavernous stage over which two huge ribbed doors swing on hinges, it combines the imagistic power of continental theatre with a very English respect for actors. The paradox of the production is that Alan Howard, one of our most likable actors, plays Coriolanus, Shakespeare\u2019s least likable hero. But not since Olivier has anyone played the part with such complete understanding of his mental process. Betrayal Lyttelton, London, 16 November 1978 Themes, say some critics, don\u2019t matter: what counts is the skill a dramatist brings to his chosen subject. Well the petit-point school of reviewing should have a field night with Harold Pinter\u2019s Betrayal at the Lyttelton since it is full of technical resource. What distresses me is the pitifully thin strip of human experience it explores and its obsession with the tiny ripples on the stagnant pond of bourgeois affluent life. Winter Journey Ashcroft, Croydon, 12 September 1979 Clifford Odets\u2019 Winter Journey is a fascinating backstage melodrama that requires incandescent acting to lift it to a higher plane. Allegedly, it got it when Michael Redgrave, Sam Wanamaker and Googie Withers did a legendary production at the St James in 1952. But the present Cambridge Theatre Company version, now on tour at the Ashcroft, Croydon, is competently acted, thinly directed and wretchedly designed. The curtain is lowered between each of the eight scenes, giving one infinite time to read and reread the programme ads for Turkish restaurants, locksmiths and piano-tuners. Sweeney Todd Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, 3 July 1980 Sweeney Todd is the reversal of everything we traditionally expect of a musical. It has a powerful and gripping story, hardly a single extractable tune, a fierce sense of social justice. Yet, after seeing it on Broadway 18 months ago and now at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, I would call it sensationally effective. Indeed, burning a boat or two, I would say it is one of the two (My Fair Lady being the other) durable works of popular musical theatre in my lifetime. Cats New London theatre, London, 12 May 1981 An exhilarating piece of total theatre that demolishes several myths at one go: that the British can\u2019t get a musical together, that our dancers are below American standard, and that musicals with a literary source always dilute their origins. What is heartening is the way the poems are integrated into the occasions. Thus Gus the Theatre Cat (beautifully played by Stephen Tate) is seen as a wistful, white-haired Victorian relic dreaming of palmier days. He is then transmogrified (or transmoggified) into Growltiger, the cutlass-bearing Pirate cat. Noises Off Lyric Hammersmith, London, 25 February 1982 Michael Frayn\u2019s play is not simply a machine for creating laughs. It is about the booby-trapped minefield of theatre itself in which one false move, one missed cue, can destroy a carefully created fiction. In one sense, it panders to our sadistic delight in things that go wrong; in another, it is a very intelligent joke about the fragility of all forms of drama. Aunt Mary Donmar Warehouse, London, 25 June 1982 Not believing that pain-racked evenings are good for the soul, I am delighted to report that the reopened Donmar Warehouse has highly comfortable, well-raked purple seats, a foyer bar and even a portable interval drinks trolley. The new regime\u2019s opening choice is Pam Gems\u2019 Aunt Mary, which confirms the amiable impression it made on me when I first encountered it as an RSC reading. It may not blaze like a comet, but it is a perfectly decent, compassionate if slightly quirky play (like the work of a Brummagem Tennessee Williams). Top Girls Royal Court, London, 9 February 1983 What I admire about Caryl Churchill is that she is not unafraid of downright passion (the rarest commodity in modern British theatre). Having taken us all round her subject, in the final scene Ms Churchill gives us an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between Marlene, the one who got away, and her trapped East Anglian sister. And, without spoiling the denouement, it is fair to say that Ms Churchill proves that both sisters are in different ways deprived and that some things are bigger than blood ties. Glengarry Glen Ross Cottesloe, London, 22 September 1983 The play is filled with the spiralling obscenity and comic bluster of real-estate salesmen caught off guard; yet underneath that there is fear and desperation. Mamet says that he admires his characters\u2019 pragmatic individualism, but to me the piece comes across as a chillingly funny indictment of a world in which you are what you sell. Death of a Salesman Broadhurst theatre, New York, 6 April 1984 What is remarkable about Dustin Hoffman\u2019s performance is that it captures all of Willy\u2019s devouring insecurity. \u201cI still feel kind of temporary about myself,\u201d says Willy at one point, and Hoffman presents us with a man who in his sad 60s still doesn\u2019t quite know who he is. Mrs Gaugin Almeida, London, 5 June 1984 Style is stronger than substance in Mrs Gauguin: the second production of the new Almeida Theatre Company and an attempt to redeem the reputation of the painter\u2019s wife, Mette Sophie Gad, given a bad press by Maugham in The Moon and Sixpence. Helen Cooper\u2019s script, however, is little more than a series of quick, data-starved, impressionist sketches fleshed out by Mike Bradwell\u2019s visually elegant production. Saved Royal Court, London, 21 December 1984 Edward Bond\u2019s Saved returns to the Royal Court in a very fine production by Danny Boyle that brings out more clearly than previous versions the play\u2019s savage humour and tenuous optimism. Nineteen years ago, critics and audiences were understandably poleaxed by the notorious scene of baby-stoning violence. But, while that remains as stomach-turning as ever, it is by no means exploitative or Bond\u2019s final statement on the human condition. Henry V Barbican, London, 18 May 1985 Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Henry confirms the good impression he made in Stratford: he combines boyish vulnerability with moral gravitas. I\u2019m not sure he would be capable of the brutalities threatened before Harfleur, but it is an immensely appealing and well-spoken performance. Ian McDiarmid\u2019s Chorus (looking like an RAF bomber pilot) is vocally tricky but rivetingly sardonic, and there is good work from Nicholas Woodeson, who makes the Dauphin a nervous peacock, and from John Carlisle as the Archbishop of Canterbury, who puts the case for war with desperate ingenuity. But then he (and this is one of the production\u2019s major points) doesn\u2019t have to endure the horrendous reality. Macbeth Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 26 August 1985 The dominant image of Yukio Ninagawa\u2019s production, often seen through a transparent, latticed screen, is cherry blossoms in full bloom. To us, the cherry blossom symbolises beauty; to the Japanese it also signals danger and fear. Thus Banquo is murdered not in the usual stygian darkness but in full light under a cherry tree while putting up the heroic fight expected of a samurai. And Birnam Wood is not the usual set of tatty Babes in the Wood branches but a whole series of ambulatory trees. Throughout, the falling blossom also betokens time passing and the transitoriness of earthly things. Shirley Royal Court, London, 1 May 1986 There are echoes here of A Taste of Honey and a midweek telly soap opera. But what gives the play a distinctive tone is Ms Dunbar\u2019s refusal to moralise about her characters: Shirley is seen as neither good nor bad but simply the product of a live-for-now culture. The play neither wags its finger nor buttonholes us with argument. But it is not hard to deduce from it a pretty scathing vision of modern urban life in which men and women see each other as instinctive enemies, relationships are defined by appetite, and escape routes are sought in glue-sniffing by the young and Malibu pineapples by the middle-aged. Romeo and Juliet Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 April 1986 As Benvolio arrives on a motorbike and Tybalt turns up in the Veronese square in a low-slung red sports car, it becomes impossible not to dub this the Alfa Romeo and Juliet. Michael Bogdanov has set the play unequivocally in Verona 1986. The result is hip, cool, clever and witty; a painless revitalisation of a play that, for my money, never lives up to its advance publicity as a great love-tragedy and that depends too much on the faulty postal service between Verona and Mantua. Pour un Oui Institut Francais, London, 20 January 1987 Nathalie Sarraute excavates, with a good deal of wit, the thoughts that lie between words and the capacity of lifelong relations to be ruined by a momentary inflexion or sudden pause. Read beforehand, the text seemed a bit flat. As played by Jean-Francois Balmer and Sami Frey with enormous emotional variety, it takes off. Mahabharata Zurich, 18 August 1987 \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the night together.\u201d So Peter Brook roguishly told a thousand people gathered on Saturday in a large boathouse on the edge of Zurich\u2019s famous lake. The occasion was the premiere of the English-language version of The Mahabharata. Our communal one-night stand began around eight o\u2019clock on a warm summer\u2019s evening. It ended sensationally 11 hours later with the revelation that the back wall of the boathouse was like a large movable blind, which was slowly lowered to reveal a dazzling morning sun. Even Nature now appears to be directed by Peter Brook. Uncle Vanya Vaudeville, London, 26 May 1988 Michael Gambon has inherited Ralph Richardson\u2019s ability to exist in two dimensions at once. Half the time he seems to be living in a private dream: there is a magnificent moment when he is accused of being drunk and cries, \u201cPossibly, possibly\u201d in a voice so alien and remote it might be coming from a man under hypnosis. The Love of the Nightingale The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 11 November 1988 This is virtually the last production we shall see at Stratford\u2019s Other Place. It is no longer to be licensed as a theatre and we shall have to wait until the early 1990s for a purpose-built replacement. I once called it the most productive corrugated-iron hut in history, and it is amazing to think of the work that has poured out of it over the last 14 years. I can\u2019t think how Broadway, let alone the RSC, will manage without it. Over the years, it has combined classical and modern work and Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s oddly haunting, 100-minute fable looks like an attempt to combine the two. Hamlet Leicester Haymarket, 20 September 1989 It\u2019s curtains for Yuri Lyubimov. To be more precise it is one curtain, designed by David Borowsky and apparently woven out of hemp, that is the undoubted star of the Lyubimov Hamlet, which has opened at the Leicester Haymarket before going on a world tour. This curtain can advance, retreat, spin on its axis and send characters hurtling into the grave in a way that evokes the nightmare despotism of Elsinore. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Barbican, London, 29 November 1991 Scene: a murky pub near the Barbican. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, two sides of the same critic, have just emerged from the first night of David Edgar\u2019s RSC adaptation of RLS\u2019s chilling novella. They compare notes over a vintage malt. Dr J: My dear Hyde, a capital evening was it not? Mr H: No sir, more like a capital offence \u2026 Moby Dick Piccadilly theatre, London, 19 March 1992 Moby Dick is the latest nail to be driven into the glittering coffin of the West End musical. Lacking logic, style, coherence or sense, it turns Melville\u2019s great Dostoevskyan novel into a campy, vulgar schoolgirl spoof in which lines like, \u201cThree years at sea and still no sign of Dick\u201d signal the level of sophistication. Robert Longden\u2019s concept itself poses a problem that his own production never begins to solve. The idea is that we are watching a black-suspendered, St Trinian\u2019s-style school putting on a homemade version of Moby-Dick, which is a bit like the students of Narkover doing The Brothers Karamazov. Which Witch Piccadilly theatre, London, 24 October 1992 One of the West End theatre\u2019s special torments is the religious musical. Over the years I recall such vintage horrors as Thomas and the King (with Queen Eleanor\u2019s memorable cry of \u201cSeize that monk!\u201d), a rock Joan of Arc and Bernadette. To that select band we can now add Which Witch, which seems like Norway\u2019s revenge for all those years of humiliation in the Eurovision song contest. Things start ominously with the Inquisition denouncing women for spiriting away men\u2019s private parts and leaving them dangling over trees. We then find a Roman orphan, Maria Vittoria, being unhappily affianced to a German banker somewhat misleadingly named Anton Fugger. But, since Maria is already deeply in love with her Catholic confessor, Daniel, it\u2019s a clear case of Fugger off. The Tempest Royal Shakespeare theatre, London, 13 August 1993 Adrian Noble\u2019s biggest problem at the RSC has lain in finding new directors who could handle the main Stratford stage. But Sam Mendes makes the transition from the Swan to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a confident, cohesive and strikingly beautiful production of The Tempest: it is the best debut at this daunting address since Noble\u2019s own. The Piano Lesson Tricycle, London, 9 October 1993 August Wilson\u2019s decade-by-decade portrait of African-American life reaches Pittsburgh in 1936 \u2013 and the key issue is a family\u2019s battle for possession of a symbolic piano. For all the play\u2019s faults, including prolixity and a final lurch into mystical melodrama, you have the feeling throughout the evening that something momentous is at stake. As in Ibsen or O\u2019Neill, the past constantly informs the present. Old Times Birmingham Rep, 2 November 1993 \u201cIt\u2019s a long way to the coffee table,\u201d said the lady behind me. She had a point. Watching Harold Pinter\u2019s tense, intimate three-hander, Old Times, in the big Birmingham Rep is a bit like seeing Godot in Madison Square Garden. But Bill Alexander\u2019s new production is so beautifully cast and so alert to every nuance of Pinter\u2019s power battle that we soon forget the wide open spaces of the fawn-carpeted circular stage. The Statement Watermans, London, 25 January 1994 Although passing tribute is paid to Ruth Rendell and Dorothy L Sayers, the spirit of Marguerite Duras hovers over Helene Pedneault\u2019s The Statement: a six-year-old Quebecois play being presented by The Troupe, in Mark Ravina\u2019s translation, at the Watermans. As so often in Duras, a murder becomes the occasion for an exploration of family relationships, and a certain patience is required before you get your dramatic reward. Maria Friedman Donmar Warehouse, London, 31 May 1994 The 85-year-old Elisabeth Welch was in the house the night I went to hear Maria Friedman \u2013 By Special Arrangement at the Donmar Warehouse. Fascinating to watch a cabaret legend gazing benevolently at a rising star. For Friedman undeniably has a vocal class, engaging candour and eclectic repertoire that puts her in the great tradition. The Schoolmistress Chichester Festival theatre, 8 July 1994 Pinero\u2019s drawing-room dramas are highly revivable. His farces, however, strike me as arch and rickety. And they don\u2019t come much archer than The Schoolmistress (1886), being revived at Chichester Festival Theatre with a fixed and deadly grin. Farce is partly about desperation, but here nothing vital seems at stake. Leave Taking National Theatre, London, 7 January 1995 There\u2019s a shining truthfulness about the writing. In particular, Winsome Pinnock shows an extraordinary intuitive sympathy for two different generations. She understands the dilemma of both Enid and Mai, the Obeah woman, who have been deserted by their menfolk and have had to acquire a steely toughness to survive in a strange land. But, equally, she empathises with Viv and Del, who combine an English upbringing with \u201cCaribbean souls\u201d and who have to break free to discover who they really are. It\u2019s a mature, heartbreaking play that deftly combines the specific problems confronting Jamaican families with the universal issue of mother-daughter relationships. Mojo Royal Court, London, 20 July 1995 Echoes abound: not only Mamet but Cagney gangster movies and even the recent work of Tarantino. But Jez Butterworth is playing a subtle double game. On the one hand, he himself is influenced by the mythic structures of American movies. On the other, he ironically punctures the way small-time Soho drifters, even in the 1950s, modelled themselves on transatlantic icons: they live in Macmillan\u2019s drab England but they aspire to Mitchum and Mature and are openly derisive when one of their number invokes the wartime team spirit of his Uncle Tommy. Butterworth\u2019s ability to write scintillating dialogue may, at the moment, outstrip anything he has to say. But he understands perfectly how language can be used to camouflage fear or boost ego. It Could Be Any One Of Us Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, 21 August 1996 It is a parody of the kind of thriller that used to be staple fare in the reps. Alan Ayckbourn makes amusing play with the cliches of the genre. But his real purpose, as so often, is to write a compassionate anatomy of failure. Indeed, his chief character is a half-shut private eye and deadbeat claims assessor (it is no accident that two of the characters are intending to see Double Indemnity) who could not solve a crossword puzzle. He, of course, decides to take charge of the investigation and, in Jon Strickland\u2019s well-judged performance, he even dons a trenchcoat to quiz the suspects and spins on his heel to finger each of them in turn in the time-honoured tradition of the stock thriller. Art Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, 16 October 1996 When they hand out the acting awards, they are going to have to devise a hydra-headed statuette to cover the blistering performances of Ken Stott, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. Add Mark Thompson\u2019s pristine, white-walled set and Gary Yershon\u2019s score, and you have an evening that gives undeniable pleasure. But the real test is whether the play encourages audiences to embrace modern art or reject it. I have an uneasy feeling that Yasmina Reza\u2019s play, for all its manifest cleverness, panders to popular prejudice. Playing With Fire Nottingham Playhouse, 3 May 1997 Good theatre often confirms one\u2019s prejudices; great theatre radically alters one\u2019s perceptions. And the remarkable thing about Luc Bondy\u2019s brilliant modern-dress production of Playing With Fire, starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, is that it totally reinvents Strindberg. In its lightness, wit, eroticism and aestheticism, it resembles nothing so much as an Eric Rohmer movie. The Cherry Orchard Birmingham Rep, 29 May 1997 Watching an American adaptation of The Cherry Orchard set in the deep south, No\u00ebl Coward famously described it as A Month in the Wrong Country. No one could be so brutal about Janet Suzman\u2019s equally radical version of Chekhov\u2019s play \u2013 a co-production between Birmingham Rep and the Market Theatre, Johannesburg \u2013 which transposes the action to today\u2019s South Africa. It is an intriguing experiment that throws some areas of the play into high relief, while obscuring others. Suzman never cracks one key problem. Chekhov\u2019s play is a study of a society on the brink of change; in South Africa, the revolution has already happened. Caravan Bush theatre, London, 18 November 1997 What better way for the Bush to celebrate its 25-year existence than with a first play by a new writer? Caravan, by Helen Blakeman, yet another graduate of Birmingham University\u2019s playwriting course, bulges with promise: not least because the action is shaped by character, public events and the holiday home that gives the play its title. The setting is a caravan park in North Wales: what we see is the steady disintegration of a Liverpool working-class family in the enforced intimacy of their hideaway. Haroun and the Sea of Stories Cottesloe, London, 3 October 1998 What makes a children\u2019s classic? A mixture of adventure and allegory. Of adolescent excitement and adult myth. And the charm of Salman Rushdie\u2019s Haroun and the Sea of Stories, beautifully staged by Tim Supple in an adaptation by him and David Tushingham, is that it works on so many levels. Behind its picturesque fable lies a passionate plea for imaginative freedom, symbolised on the first night by the author\u2019s liberated presence on stage at the curtain call. Be My Baby Pleasance, London, 14 November 1998 Amanda Whittington\u2019s Be My Baby poignantly pictures the painful predicament of institutionalised young mums. Set in 1965, it also reminds us of the stranglehold of official morality even in that supposedly libertarian decade. Whittington focuses on 19-year-old Mary, a pregnant middle-class girl deposited by her mum in the St Saviour\u2019s home. Once the child is born, welfare services will place it with adoptive parents. But the real point is to show how, in the 60s, all classes treated extramarital pregnancy as a guilty secret and how even pop culture nourished the dream of holy wedlock with the perfect partner. One of the most touching scenes shows the girls in the home miming to the Dixie Cups\u2019 insidiously catching hit Chapel of Love. Easy Virtue Chichester Festival theatre, 29 July 1999 Who does the young No\u00ebl Coward remind me of? In a strange way, John Osborne. Both were iconoclasts nostalgic for a world they attacked, both were headline celebrities with a private belief in the work ethic. And, for proof of Coward\u2019s internal contradictions, you have only to see his 1924 play, Easy Virtue, given a rare and largely successful revival by Maria Aitken at Chichester. King Lear Royal Exchange, Manchester, 17 September 1999 Tom Courtenay is undeniably better at conveying the anguish of suffering than the arrogance of power; in that sense, he is more sinned against than Sinden. In the opening scene, played in what looks like a formal Renaissance court, one misses the \u201cgreat rage\u201d that should animate Lear. Courtenay establishes Lear\u2019s shuffling, slow-speaking antiquity, but he reacts to Cordelia\u2019s silence and Kent\u2019s candour with a wry puzzlement rather than a tyrannical wrath. Even the fearful curses rained down on Goneril\u2019s womb seem more rhetorical than heartfelt. The turning point comes with Lear\u2019s great attack on superfluity: \u201cO, reason not the need.\u201d Suddenly, Courtenay\u2019s voice acquires a pitiable desperation that pricks one\u2019s tears and, as Lear declines into madness, so the actor grows steadily in stature. The Lion King Lyceum, London, 21 October 1999 The show\u2019s undoubted appeal lies in Richard Hudson\u2019s scenic design and the masks and puppetry of Julie Taymor and Michael Curry. Taymor, as director, is the organising visual spirit behind the show, and she produces a child\u2019s garden of delights. But even here one notices how much she borrows from the international theatrical language. When the lions demonstrate grief over the death of their king, Mufasa, by producing ribbons of white silk from their eyes, the effect is pure Peter Brook. Taymor has shopped around shrewdly; but, as with the music, what we have is an artful synthesis of international styles rather than something African. Arcadia Chichester Festival theatre, 24 August 2000 Tom Stoppard\u2019s play is many things: part satire, part detective story (who was the hermit who died in the grounds of Sidley Park?), part debate about determinism and free will, part celebration of ungovernable human curiosity in the face of the running down of the universe. The play is a fantastically ingenious construct, but it lacks a strong internal dynamic, and Peter Wood\u2019s production, explanatory rather than emotional, makes you aware of the lack of narrative propulsion. The one genuinely moving moment comes when Thomasina\u2019s tutor, responding to her lament over Caesar\u2019s burning of the Alexandrian library, argues that whatever is historically lost is recovered in the long march of humanity. Faust Hanover Expo, 2 September 2000 \u201cTime is short and art is long,\u201d says Goethe\u2019s Mephistopheles. He\u2019s not kidding. Peter Stein\u2019s historic, uncut staging of the two parts of Goethe\u2019s Faust, currently playing in Hall 23 of the Hanover Expo, has just taken up 20 hours of my life. You can see it over six evenings or, as I did, during a marathon weekend: 3pm till 10pm on Saturday and 10am till 11pm on Sunday. The action is divided between two hangar-like arenas filled with portable steel seating: the audience constantly shuttles between the two spaces. The audience is certainly moved by Stein\u2019s Faust: literally, for two days. But the ceaseless motion is not a device to distract us. It is a way of ensuring that, imaginatively, we share Faust\u2019s exploratory, circular journey. The Circle Salisbury Playhouse, 12 October 2000 The danger is that this kind of play, written in 1919, elicits a stock response. It boasts french windows, a stately drawing room, Georgian furniture: all the things young dramatists have fought against. Study the play closely, however, and you see that Somerset Maugham is offering a waspish portrait of upper-class manners. The Accused Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 6 December 2000 Jeffrey Archer, in the character of a doctor on trial for wife murder, was last night proclaimed guilty by a majority audience vote of 333 to 254. A more considered verdict might be that, as the play\u2019s author, he is also culpable of taking West End theatre back about 50 years by creating a cardboard courtroom drama. Blasted Royal Court, London, 5 April 2001 Five years ago, I was rudely dismissive of Sarah Kane\u2019s Blasted. Yet watching its revival last night I was overcome by its sombre power. So what has changed? The space, the design, the lighting, the cast and James Macdonald\u2019s production are all radically different. But, above all, one sees the play through the perspective of Kane\u2019s tragically short career and her obsession with love\u2019s survival in a monstrously cruel world. Frozen Cottesloe, London, 4 July 2002 The force of Bryony Lavery\u2019s play lies in its ability to change hearts and minds. It never mitigates the horror of child killing, but it makes us understand Agnetha\u2019s argument that physical damage to the brain, rather than inborn evil, prompts serial murder. In an extraordinary scene, Nancy confronts Ralph in his cell and offers him a forgiveness far more fatal than a distant, cold-blooded revenge. I still think there are contradictions within Lavery\u2019s argument: on one level she is out to prove the predictable banality of the killer, yet Agnetha describes Ralph as \u201cmesmerising like a rattlesnake\u201d. And, while showing Ralph as methodically calculating, Lavery brushes aside the idea of moral responsibility. But, in a world filled with tabloid hysteria, Lavery\u2019s play comes across as a refreshing draught of sanity. Sanctuary Loft, Lyttelton, London, 31 July 2002 I admire Tanika Gupta for using the stage to rub our noses in global reality. There is a graphic description, for instance, of the killings in Rwanda and of the butchery of 3,000 Tutsis seeking sanctuary in a church. And Kabir feels he is haunted by Satan for having failed to protect his wife from a group of rapacious Indian soldiers. Gupta\u2019s play may not always be fair, but it touches a nerve when it suggests that, in our snug little island, we are either ignorant of or indifferent to the world\u2019s suffering. Mother\u2019s Day Lyric Studio, London, 21 September 2002 Unironic optimism is a rare quality in modern drama. But Courttia Newland\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, enthusiastically put across by the multicultural Post Office company, posits a Britain in which the nuclear family thrives, racial harmony is easily achieved and local councils act with enlightened beneficence. By the end, I was almost prepared to believe in Santa Claus. The Mob Orange Tree, London, 9 September 2003 The stock argument against John Galsworthy is that, in plays like Strife and Justice, he suffered from a neutralising impartiality. But here his passions are sufficiently aroused for him to allow his hero an unnerving Coriolanus-like contempt for the mob; and even though Galsworthy shows a measure of sympathy for More\u2019s wife, whose brother is called to the front, he also suggests that she shamelessly uses sexual blackmail to break her husband\u2019s militant pacifism. The Sugar Syndrome Royal Court, London, 21 October 2003 This first play by 22-year-old Lucy Prebble has many of the virtues \u2013 and some of the faults \u2013 you expect in early work. It tackles tricky subjects, such as paedophilia and teenage psychological disorders, with unselfconscious candour: at the same time, having outlawed instant moral judgment, Prebble can\u2019t quite determine what to put in its place. Her purpose may be unclear but she has an instinctive playwright\u2019s gift for grabbing your attention and compelling sympathy for damaged people. Hamlet Old Vic, London, 28 April 2004 Trevor Nunn\u2019s boldest decision is to cast Ben Whishaw, in his early 20s, as Hamlet. With his hollow cheeks, spindly frame and nail-biting intensity, Whishaw makes a compelling figure. In his feigned madness, he reminded me of a scuttling, manic Danish Mr Bean. There are several moments, as when Hamlet tells Gertrude that at her age \u201cthe heyday in the blood is tame\u201d, when Whishaw profitably reminds you of Hamlet\u2019s callowness. But what this Hamlet lacks is irony, reflectiveness and any sense that he poses a real physical danger to Claudius. The History Boys Lyttelton, London, 19 May 2004 What is astonishing is how much territory Bennett manages to cover: the teaching and meaning of history, inflexible and imaginative approaches to education, and the idea, as in Forty Years On, that a school has the potential to be a metaphor for English life. It is no accident that the play is set in the 80s, when the arguments between beleaguered humanism and pragmatic functionalism were at the very height. The play is also blissfully funny, but behind the almost ceaseless laughter lies a hymn to the joys of language, intellectual exploration and inspirational educators. Don Carlos Crucible, Sheffield, 4 October 2004 The triumph of Michael Grandage\u2019s production and Christopher Oram\u2019s design lies in their visualisation of Schiller\u2019s ideas. A swinging thurible, a prison-like court with high, barred windows, even the menacing hiss of the ladies-in-waiting\u2019s fans all tell us that we are in a world of religious and political tyranny \u2013 a point underlined by Mike Poulton\u2019s translation, where Philip announces: \u201cThe instrument God places in my hand is terror.\u201d But Grandage also captures the subversive eruption of feeling in this crepuscular hell: at one point Richard Coyle\u2019s neurotic Don Carlos beats against the court doors like a trapped animal, and his simultaneous passion for Posa and the queen implies a state of Hamletesque sexual confusion. Hedda Gabler Almeida, London, 17 March 2005 The character of Ibsen\u2019s Hedda Gabler is infinitely various. In the past we\u2019ve had melodramatic Heddas, neurasthenic Heddas, socially superior Heddas. But, in Richard Eyre\u2019s fine new production, Eve Best gives us a dazzlingly ironic Hedda: one aware of life\u2019s absurdity and viewing it with a mixture of dark humour and angry exasperation. You Never Can Tell Theatre Royal, Bath, 27 August 2005 I am staggered by our current indifference to Shaw: when, for instance, did the National Theatre last revive one of his plays? Peter Hall almost single-handedly keeps the Shavian flame alight; and his revival of this 1897 comedy captures perfectly its Mozartian ability to handle serious issues with an airy lightness and grace. A Right Royal Farce King\u2019s Head, London, 2 August 2006 Last year Toby Young and Lloyd Evans wrote a mildly amusing farce, Who\u2019s the Daddy?, about the shenanigans at the Spectator. Now they have tried to repeat the format with the royal family, and the result is an evening of desperation. Even to summarise the inane plot requires a heroic act of will \u2026 Young and Evans struck lucky with their Spectator skit, but this play suggests they don\u2019t know their farce from their elbow. War Horse Olivier, London, 18 October 2007 Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold imagery, including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank, and through the line drawings of Rae Smith projected on to a suspended screen. Admittedly, the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action, but Luke Treadaway, as the tenacious Albert, and Angus Wright, as the sympathetic captain, make their mark. The joy of the evening, however, lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the horse. The Brothers Size Young Vic, London, 14 November 2007 Tarell Alvin McCraney is a graduate of Yale School of Drama and what he has done in this study of two black Louisiana brothers is draw on \u201celements, icons and stories from the Yoruba cosmology\u201d. In practice, this means that the action combines ritual and realism, and that the language takes the form of a heightened prose-poetry. Without doubting McCraney\u2019s talent, I feel that the result is a conscious literary artefact. What I wouldn\u2019t deny is that it comes thrillingly alive in performance. Glaspell Shorts Orange Tree, London, 9 April 2008 It was the deceptively named Trifles, written in 1916, that established Susan Glaspell\u2019s reputation. Set on a remote farm where a murder has taken place, it shows female observation triumphing over male obtuseness. While an attorney and sheriff blunder around, their wives discover the real clue to the crime in an empty cage, a strangled songbird and a badly sewn quilt. With the deftest economy, Glaspell conjures up a world of solitude, despair and imprisonment where the women acknowledge their share of guilt. Fast Labour West Yorkshire Playhouse, 25 April 2008 The play reminds us of our own complicity in the migrant labour industry: as someone points out, the British want their last-minute iceberg lettuce in March without questioning how it got there. Steve Waters\u2019 twin-focus technique allows the migrants to drop their fractured English, signalling a return to their native tongue, and exchange wickedly subversive thoughts about their inherited world. Her Naked Skin Olivier, London, 2 August 2008 Rebecca Lenkiweicz\u2019s method is to start with a wide-angled shot and then gradually focus on intimate relationships. Film footage of Emily Davison\u2019s sacrificial gesture at the 1913 Derby is followed by a sketch of male political intransigence over female suffrage. But Lenkiewicz\u2019s real concern is to show how female militancy transcended class and sexual convention. Lady Celia Cain, trapped in a loveless marriage, is erotically drawn to Eve, a young suffragette machinist. Passion and politics coalesce as they pursue an intense affair, but the question Lenkiewicz obliquely raises is whether liberation is more easily achieved from a position of social privilege. Imagine This New London theatre, 20 November 2008 They said it couldn\u2019t be done: a musical about the Warsaw ghetto. And, now that I\u2019ve seen it, I know that they were right. If this show ultimately fails, it is not for want of trying, but because of the discrepancy between form and content. The romantic sentiment and uplift inherent in the musical sit uneasily with a story of not just heroic resistance but starvation, suffering and the death of more than 100,000 Polish Jews. Death and the King\u2019s Horseman Olivier, London, 9 April 2009 Rufus Norris\u2019s production, with the aid of Katrina Lindsay\u2019s spectacular design, moves assuredly from the teeming world of a raffia-filled market to the play\u2019s elemental conclusion. There are sterling performances from Nonso Anonzie as the horseman, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as his son, and Claire Benedict as the market leader. One emerges dazzled but also disturbed by Soyinka\u2019s ideas: in particular, the unfashionable notion that death can be seen as a triumphant entrance rather than a tragic exit. Funny Turns Hull Truck, 30 April 2009 In these recessive times, a new theatre is as rare as snow in June. And, in moving from an old converted backstreet Methodist church into a spanking new space in the town centre, Hull Truck has got itself a dazzler. What strikes me is the value for money of the \u00a315m venue: it boasts a 440-seat main house, a 135-seat studio and wide public spaces that use glazed brick and steel. The wraparound stage has echoes of the former Spring Street building, and Funny Turns, written and directed by John Godber, shows his familiar optimistic championship of society\u2019s underdogs. Even if it doesn\u2019t have the instant mythic appeal of Bouncers and Up\u2019n\u2019Under, it displays a similar warmheartedness. It Felt Like a Kiss Hardman Square, Manchester, 3 July 2009 The last third of the evening is a total letdown. We find ourselves wandering through debris-filled rooms, entering desolate cells, even being pursued down darkened corridors by a masked man clutching a chainsaw. I guess the aim is to show how the American dream turned into a nightmare. But to do it through these fairground shock tactics is an insult to our intelligence. The cant critical word for this kind of thing is \u201cscary\u201d. But what is the point of simply making people jump out of their skins? The Black Album Cottesloe, London, 22 July 2009 Hanif Kureishi has turned his own vibrant 1995 novel into a play. The result is a busy, hectic affair that raises all kinds of issues about religious and political faith, fatwas and censorship and the purpose of art. But, as so often with adaptations, you get the bones without the thickness of texture that was part of the original\u2019s charm. Category B Tricycle, London, 13 October 2009 The Tricycle certainly thinks big. After its trilogy about Afghanistan earlier in the year, it now comes up with an ambitious three-play season by black writers about the state of Britain. First out of the blocks is Roy Williams with a typically forceful play about prison life that manages to avoid most of the cliches that cling to the genre. Williams\u2019 setting is a category-B jail: the kind that neither the screws nor the prisoners want to end up in. But what he brings out are the uncanny parallels between the institution\u2019s rival power blocs. Behud (Beyond Belief) Belgrade, Coventry, 31 March 2010 You can see why Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti had to write this play. It is her response to the notorious events that in 2004 led to her play, Behzti, being withdrawn after mass Sikh protests outside, and even inside, Birmingham Rep. By recreating that traumatic episode in fictionalised form, Bhatti is clearly exorcising her demons and liberating her imagination. The new piece, however, is only intermittently successful as drama. The Man Finborough, London 1 Jun 2010 Theatre is different every night, but this new piece by James Graham, which forms the centrepiece of a Finborough festival offering 30 plays in 30 days, takes the idea of flux to Ayckbourn-style lengths. Four actors alternate in the role of Ben (I caught Samuel Barnett). The sequence of events also depends on receipts handed out to the audience as they enter; they are later reclaimed by Ben as he struggles to fill in a tax return and recall a year of London life. The idea of tax receipts as an index to existence is highly original. The Persians Brecon Beacons, 13 August 2010 This is site-specific theatre with a vengeance. High up in the Brecon Beacons, in a mock-up village used by the military as a training base, National Theatre Wales is recreating the oldest extant play in western drama: Aeschylus\u2019s The Persians. The combination of the story and the setting, with the sun slowly disappearing over the hills, is overwhelming. We assemble in a square in this deserted military village where the four-strong male chorus is rejoicing in war and announcing: \u201cNo one can withstand this tsunami of the Persians in full rage.\u201d We then march up a hill to sit in front of a four-storey house with the front cut away; and there we see, both in live action and on video, the tragedy enacted. There\u2019s a wonderful moment when Atossa arrives in a white car to a blaze of trumpets. Onassis Novello, London, 13 October 2010 Martin Sherman has written not so much a play as a part, and it is one that Robert Lindsay fills to overflowing. But, as if to compensate for the emptiness of the dialogue, he is forced to lapse into an Anthony Quinn style of overacting that I\u2019m tempted to dub Exorbitant the Greek. \u201cStillness always works,\u201d Onassis remarks at one point, but you\u2019d scarcely know it from the restless, larger-than-life performance filled with extravagant hand gestures that Lindsay feels obliged to give. He is a fine actor compelled, by the fundamental lack of drama, to put on a bit of a show. Racing Demon Crucible, Sheffield, 18 February 2011 David Hare\u2019s play gets richer with time. Acclaimed in 1990 for its accurate portrait of a Church of England in crisis, it now seems a perfect metaphor for British institutional life. Presented as part of Sheffield\u2019s three-play Hare season, it could be about the tensions inside any hierarchical organisation, from a political party to a national newspaper. What is impressive is Hare\u2019s imaginative reach: his ability to see the virtues, as well as the flaws, in every character. Frankenstein Olivier, London, 24 February 2011 Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Creature is unforgettable. \u201cTall as a pine tree,\u201d as the text insists, he has humour as well as pathos: his naked entry into the world is marked by a totter on splayed feet and, when he moves, it is with a forward-thrusting, angular, almost Hulotesque curiosity. But there is also an epic grandeur about Cumberbatch. As he quotes Paradise Lost, his voice savours every syllable of Milton\u2019s words and when, in outrage at his rejection by the exile\u2019s family, he burns their cottage, he utters a Hamletesque cry of \u201cI sweep to my revenge.\u201d It is an astonishing performance. Miller\u2019s strength, in contrast, lies in his menace. Stockier than Cumberbatch, his Creature makes you believe in the character\u2019s satanic impulse and in his capacity for murder. truth and reconciliation Royal Court, London, 6 September 2011 Staged by debbie tucker green herself in the Theatre Upstairs, with the spectators sitting on hard chairs that replicate those endured by the characters, the piece is cryptic, fragmented, unsettling and well acted \u2013 especially by Wunmi Mosaku as the Rwandan widow, Petra Letang as the zealous Zimbabwean, and Clare Cathcart as a defiant Northern Irish mother. But, although the play raises the issue of whether truth and reconciliation can be compatible, it feels strangely incomplete. I wanted either to hear the piece again or attend a post-play discussion to learn whether the author\u2019s political pessimism was justified. Stones in His Pockets Tricycle, London, 20 December 2011 Marie Jones\u2019s witty conceit is to view the making of a piece of Hollywood-Irish hokum from the perspective of two County Kerry extras: the quintessentially optimistic Charlie and the more jaundiced Jake, lately returned from New York. What Jones does is to skilfully oppose life and art. In the movie, the high-born heroine romantically weds a local lad; in reality, Jake rejects the advances of the gushing American star who pretends to seduce him in order to appropriate his accent. And, while the film offers a rose-tinted vision of Irish life, the truth is that the land is being split up and Jake\u2019s suicidal cousin is the latest victim of both rural decline and the national propensity to dream. Hay Fever No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, 27 February 2012 Among the guests there is a peach of a performance from Jeremy Northam as the buttoned-up diplomat quivering with shy lust. His initial, embarrassed encounter with Amy Morgan\u2019s taciturn flapper also proves that Coward, like Pinter, knew the comic value of extended pauses. And Phoebe Waller-Bridge makes something truly memorable of Judith\u2019s daughter whom she plays as a gauche 19-year-old trying strenuously hard to be soign\u00e9 and sophisticated. But that simply offers further proof that Coward\u2019s 1924 comedy becomes even funnier when played, as in Davies\u2019s fine revival, for its emotional veracity. The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning Cardiff High School, Wales, 19 April 2012 Tim Price gives us a vivid picture of Manning\u2019s life and of the contradictory responses that he evokes. But what troubles me is the blurring of fact and fiction. I can easily believe that Manning would have been taught about Welsh radicals, from the Chartist John Frost to Aneurin Bevan. But, in one scene, Manning is asked to enact the role of the 23-year-old Dic Penderyn, who in 1831 led a Merthyr uprising and was publicly executed. Entering into the spirit of the part, the 13-year-old Manning denies that Penderyn was a martyr and says: \u201cI just got caught and blamed for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d Dramatic licence is here stretched to the utmost in that Price makes the schoolboy Manning utter sentiments that appear to prophesy his present predicament. London Road Olivier, London, 13 August 2012 Conventional musicals, even at their best, take us into a world of fantasy. This miraculously innovative show finds a new way of representing reality. Rufus Norris\u2019s production and Katrina Lindsay\u2019s design also deftly evoke the community\u2019s transition from a period of terror to one of entrapment, symbolised by a maze of police incident tape, to restoration, as floral baskets descend from the Olivier ceiling. And an 11-strong ensemble play multiple characters \u2013 with Kate Fleetwood, Nick Holder and Nicola Sloane outstanding as leading lights in Neighbourhood Watch. A previous Blythe show about seaside sex workers, The Girlfriend Experience, smacked of condescension. But this one not only explores the way it takes a crisis to engender community spirit but opens up rich possibilities for musical theatre. My Life After Corn Exchange, Brighton, 27 May 2013 The Brighton festival\u2019s theatre programme ended with this extraordinary import from Argentina in which five actors recalled, with the aid of photos, letters, home movies and old clothes, the lives of their parents. Conceived and directed by Lola Arias, the show offered a compelling mix of personal memories and \u2013 since the actors were all born around the time of the 1976-83 dictatorship \u2013 a mosaic of modern Argentinian history. I suspect Arias is an admirer of the Brazilian pioneer Augusto Boal, whose \u201ctheatre of the oppressed\u201d dramatised communal issues. Here, the big question is how the actors either live up to the radicalism of a previous generation or, in one case, live down its collusion with dictatorship. Chimerica Almeida, London, 30 May 2013 \u201cChimerica\u201d was a term coined by economist Niall Ferguson to indicate the global dominance of the dual country that is China and America. But Kirkwood\u2019s play highlights the sharp differences, as well as the similarities, between the twin superpowers. In America, Joe\u2019s bolshie individualism as a photographer who records world events is ultimately celebrated; in China, Zhang Lin, who has already suffered for his involvement in the Tiananmen protests, pays a heavy price for inciting unrest. Kirkwood goes further in examining the nature of capitalism in both countries. China may be open to western investment and apparently enthralled by its products; at the same time, Joe\u2019s girlfriend, Tessa, in a brilliant presentation speech to her clients, explains that the only way into its markets is to understand that China is a country that values the supremacy of its culture. Handbagged Tricycle, London, 2 October 2013 Buffini\u2019s brightest idea is to double the central roles. So we get an older and younger Queen, respectively known as Q and Liz. Equally, we get an older and younger Thatcher, identified as T and Mags. Add in two male actors playing 17 other roles, ranging from Kenneth Kaunda to Rupert Murdoch, and you have what sounds like a recipe for confusion. In fact, Buffini\u2019s device gives the whole evening a buoyant, meta-theatrical playfulness. The older Q spends much of the play trying to hustle the action along in order to get to the interval. And the two Thatchers, while consistent in their detestation of socialism, often lapse into a good cop/bad cop routine that says a lot about the late PM\u2019s contradictory techniques. Punishment Without Revenge Theatre Royal, Bath, 22 October 2013 This is the real deal: an unqualified masterpiece by Lope de Vega that, in Meredith Oakes\u2019s excellent new translation, forms part of Bath\u2019s Spanish Golden Age season. Since Lope\u2019s 1631 play deals with the guilt-racked love between a young woman and her stepson, one is inevitably reminded of Euripides\u2019s Hippolytus and Racine\u2019s Phedre in its moral intricacy. However, Lope\u2019s play is the equal of its twin rivals \u2013 and indeed, in some ways, far better. This is a multilayered play that touches on numerous themes, from the power of theatre to poisoned inheritances. It gets a first-rate production from Laurence Boswell, which is physically spare yet implies sumptuousness. Much of that is down to Mark Bailey\u2019s sets and costumes, with their silver thrones and sable doublets. Ciphers Everyman theatre, Cheltenham, 23 October 2013 Even if Dawn King\u2019s play is not as original as Foxfinder, it is clearly the work of a natural dramatist who knows how to generate suspense. Blanche McIntyre\u2019s production and James Perkins\u2019 design, based on sliding white screens, also have a pristine purity that contrasts neatly with the murkiness of a world in which human beings are disposable. Keenan doubles beautifully as both the enigmatic Justine and her upfront sister, and there is strong support from Jhutti as both a community worker and an adulterous artist, and from Bruce Alexander and Shereen Martin as figures who, in both sections of the plot, are pulling the strings. The result is an intelligent puzzle play in which, rather as in Macbeth, nothing is but what is not. Ellen Terry With Eileen Atkins Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, 21 January 2014 Actors are often the sharpest judges of Shakespeare: a point proved by Ellen Terry, who in 1910 started touring a series of informal lecture-demonstrations on Shakespeare\u2019s characters. Eileen Atkins has now adapted them into a 75-minute show that offers the delirious pleasure of seeing one great actor inhabiting the mind and spirit of another. Atkins possesses not just an immaculate technique but an imagination that allows her effortlessly to transcend the limitations of age and gender. If the BBC does not instantly send a film crew to record this masterclass in the art of acting, I shall go and chain myself to the portals of Broadcasting House in protest. Twelfth Night Everyman, Liverpool, 13 March 2014 Adam Levy\u2019s white-suited, self-dramatising Orsino repeats the play\u2019s opening word, \u201cIf\u201d, three times as a prelude to a visual coup introducing the shipwrecked Viola. As scholar Michael Dobson has pointed out, the whole play seems to take place within a conditional clause, asking \u201cwhat if there were a country such as Illyria?\u201d Gemma Bodinetz seizes on that idea to present us with a series of interlocking fantasies in which people lose their sense of self. There\u2019s a telling moment when Jodie McNee\u2019s disguised Viola, asked by Natalie Dew\u2019s Olivia \u201cWhat are you? What would you?\u201d, looks totally flummoxed as if she herself is unsure. This May Hurt a Bit Octagon, Bolton, 27 March 2014 Since the NHS is never out of the headlines and directly affects most of us, our theatre has long been crying out for a new play on the subject. And, while Stella Feehily\u2019s piece, co-produced by Out of Joint and the Octagon, is unapologetic agitprop on behalf of a beleaguered service, it makes its points most effectively when it captures the mix of care and chaos you find in wards up and down the country. Yellow Face The Shed, London, 12 May 2014 David Henry Hwang uses the satirical format to ask what it means to be classified by ethnicity, and also to invoke the xenophobic persecution of Chinese-Americans in the late 1990s. Behind the laughter, this is a probingly political play that tests the validity of Hwang\u2019s optimistic assertion that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what someone looks like on the outside\u201d. Alex Sims\u2019s bracing production pursues its ideas with quickfire vigour. It\u2019s a peach of a play, using theatre as a metaphor for life. Ballyturk Black Box, Galway, 21 July 2014 As so often in Enda Walsh\u2019s plays, the main characters inhabit a hermetic world \u2013 almost a womb without a view. In this case, they are two men, simply identified as One and Two, who pass the time in speeded-up, silent-comedy rituals and speculating about daily life in an imagined Irish town called Ballyturk. But when the character Three turns up, he not only breaks up the partnership but invites one of the duo into the outer world, en route to inevitable extinction. It is not the last surprise Walsh springs, but it is as if Beckett\u2019s Godot had unexpectedly materialised. The James Plays Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 11 August 2014 The main thing to say about Rona Munro\u2019s plays is that, while telling us a lot about Scottish history from 1421 to 1488, they are also full of topical resonance. You see this especially in the opening play, The Key Will Keep the Lock. It shows James Stewart, after being kept a prisoner by the English for 18 years, finally assuming the Scottish throne that was rightfully his. As he does so, James McArdle\u2019s wonderfully nervous king gives a speech to his aggressive nobles in which he pours scorn on England\u2019s financial predatoriness and claims that a future Scotland \u201cwill be assaulted but it will never be broken\u201d. It\u2019s a good line that could easily be appropriated \u2013 and probably will be \u2013 by Alex Salmond. The Apple Family Plays Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, 5 May 2015 British drama tends to be driven by politics and American by relationships. That, at least, is what we assume. Such generalisations are blown apart by Richard Nelson\u2019s extraordinary quartet of plays, which dominated the opening weekend of this year\u2019s Brighton festival. Lasting close to seven hours in total, the plays use the crises within a single family to explore the larger confusions of liberal America. What is striking is how much ground Nelson covers: hope and disillusion, individual and collective memory, and the need to acknowledge the past without being possessed by it. The Trial Young Vic, London, 29 June 2015 Someone must have had it in for Michael B. He was dozing peacefully at home when a knock came at the door. Two men appeared, telling him he had to attend a new production of Kafka\u2019s The Trial. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Steven Berkoff\u2019s version on stage. I\u2019ve also seen a film directed by Orson Welles and another written by Harold Pinter.\u201d He was forcefully told that was not enough. This time everything would be radically different. Watched by his guards, he arrived at the theatre to find a crowd excitedly milling around. To get to the auditorium people were led down long corridors and admitted through keyhole-shaped doors. Once inside, Michael B was seated on a judicial bench and at first astonished by what he saw. The Skriker Royal Exchange, Manchester, 6 July 2015 When Caryl Churchill\u2019s collaborative fantasy was first seen in 1994, it was regarded as bafflingly obscure. Aspects of it remain difficult but, watching the magnetic Maxine Peake, it becomes clear that the play offers, among other things, a vision of climate catastrophe we can all understand. In some ways, Churchill\u2019s play is like a darker version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in that it shows a collision between mortal and immortal worlds. The big difference is that Churchill\u2019s skriker, a shape-shifting, ancient fairy, is chillingly visible, unlike Shakespeare\u2019s Puck, to the two teenage girls whom she haunts and pursues. Medea Gate, London, 10 November 2015 Euripides\u2019 Medea has achieved such mythical status it is subject to endless variations. But, where Rachel Cusk\u2019s new version at the Almeida cheats us of the cathartic climax, this radical update by Kate Mulvany and Anne-Louise Sarks, that originated at the Belvoir Sydney, does not duck the story\u2019s horror. Its big idea is to see the action from the perspective of the heroine\u2019s two children and the effect is as startling as Tom Stoppard\u2019s notion of viewing Hamlet from the vantage point of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Look Back in Anger Derby theatre, 9 March 2016 You may go expecting a museum piece. What is startling is that John Osborne\u2019s play, intimately based on his experiences as a married actor at Derby rep \u2013 and now celebrating its 60th anniversary \u2013 survives due to its unremitting emotional intensity. Director Sarah Brigham has also had the wit to precede it with an hour-long mono-drama by Jane Wainwright that charts the reaction of a gutsy, modern working-class woman to life\u2019s baffling disappointments. Osborne\u2019s play was initially hailed as a vital social document. It says a lot about the class-ridden culture of mid-50s Britain and paints a still-resonant picture of a younger generation educated but with nowhere to go. However, what keeps the play alive is its scorching, Strindbergian portrait of a failing marriage. Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night Bristol Old Vic, 30 March 2016 Timing matters with Eugene O\u2019Neill as much as it does in a Wagner opera. I suspect Richard Eyre is seeking to contrast the brisk allegro of the play\u2019s opening with the long adagio of its tragic end where the four members of the Tyrone family confront the appalling truth. But too often the tempo is unvaried, so that we miss the almost comic pattern of accusation and retraction that afflicts all the characters. When James Tyrone, a celebrated actor who sold out to commercial success, recites Shakespeare and his tubercular son Edmund recites Baudelaire, we should also feel them dwelling on the consolations of poetry rather than rushing through the speeches as they do here. Doctor Faustus Duke of York\u2019s theatre, 26 April 2016 The idea of media stardom as a trick of the light is now a truism, and Lloyd\u2019s production is forced to work overtime to give it purchase. We get lashings of sex and violence as well as an awkward collision of the two when Faustus invokes Helen of Troy who appears in the shape of the adoring Wagner and whom he proceeds to stab and rape. The lead actor acquits himself well in the circumstances. Given that he is obliged to bare his buttocks and parade in bloodied boxer shorts, I was tempted to dub him \u201coff-with-your-kit Harington\u201d. But he is much more than a TV icon and, when the production allows him, he gives us a sense of Faustus\u2019s flailing despair. Bitches Finborough, London, 18 August 2016 Bola Agbaje has written a number of very good plays about different aspects of cultural identity. She has now come up with a new piece for the National Youth Theatre about two female pals \u2013 black Funke and white Cleo \u2013 who dedicate their energies to a music-and-chat vlog, but who, off camera, reveal their deep divisions. In exposing the potential dangers of a faith in new technology and the transcendent power of video, Agbaje makes a shrewd point that absolves her from the charge of vlogging a dead horse. The Rover The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, 16 September 2016 Even if Loveday Ingram allows no innuendo to go unstressed, she successfully steers us through Aphra Behn\u2019s multiplying subplots and allows the action to grow, with the aid of Grant Olding\u2019s fizzing score, out of a society in a permanent state of fiesta. Joseph Millson, making his entrance swinging on a rope like a Restoration Errol Flynn, plays Willmore excellently as a shameless rakehell whose sexual rapacity is offset by a boyish charm. You may not approve of him but you can\u2019t help liking him. Barber Shop Chronicles Dorfman, London 8 June 2017 Bijan Sheibani\u2019s exuberant production begins and ends with a party in which audience members dance with the cast or even go on stage for a quick trim. That seems entirely in keeping with the spirit of Inua Ellams\u2019 invigorating play, which shows how barbers\u2019 shops, run by and catering for African men, combine the roles of pub and political platform, social centre and soapbox. It makes the average white British male\u2019s belief that you simply go in for a haircut look decidedly dreary. Julius Caesar Storyhouse, Chester, 26 June 2017 As the audience assembles in the foyer, pro-Caesar supporters emerge bearing banners saying: \u201cMake Rome great again.\u201d Although upbraided by the tribunes, the crowd noisily cheers as cameras record the arrival of their beloved leader. Celebrations continue in the auditorium, where the Lupercalian fertility festival is in full swing and Christopher Wright\u2019s Caesar, to the accompaniment of rock music, poses for selfies and morphs from Donald Trump in Washington to Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury. Gangsta Granny Garrick, London, 2 August 2017 Ben, the 11-year-old hero, is a reverse Billy Elliot who has a covert wish to be a plumber and abhors his parents\u2019 passion for ballroom dancing. Meanwhile, his lonely old gran, on whom he is deposited once a week, seems boring, smelly and flatulent but turns out to have a hidden life. It all makes for a lively show that prompts self-examination. When I asked my grandson on the way out if he found me smelly and boring, he had the wit to reply that at least I didn\u2019t smell. Loot Park theatre, London, 24 August 2017 Michael Fentiman\u2019s production constantly reminds us that Joe Orton\u2019s shock tactics are a way of alerting us to the hypocrisy of a society in which greed, gain and lust are masked by religious piety and veneration for authority. You see this most clearly in the figure of Inspector Truscott, who, while posing as a man from the Metropolitan Water Board, turns out to be a corruptible sadist. Christopher Fulford plays him to perfection as a moustached suburbanite with a manic gleam. For Love or Money Viaduct, Halifax, 24 September 2017 Northern Broadsides have made a habit of giving European classics a Yorkshire setting. So it seems fitting that Barrie Rutter\u2019s farewell, at least on home soil, to the company he founded should be a version by Blake Morrison of Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage\u2019s Turcaret. Even if Morrison\u2019s adaptation is unlikely to cause the offence that the original did in France in 1709, it remains a lively satire on capitalist corruption. Morrison shifts the action from Louis XIV\u2019s Paris to a Yorkshire town in the 1920s, but the characters are still propelled by greed. Rose, a young war widow, milks a besotted bank manager, Algy, for all she can while herself being conned by a money-grubbing cousin. But loot is to this play what sex is to La Ronde, in that it forms an endless daisy chain. The Shadow Factory NST City, Southampton, 16 February 2018 Howard Brenton seeks to highlight the gulf between a bloody-minded British belief in liberty and the dictatorial necessities of wartime. Even the local engineer forced to execute Beaverbrook\u2019s plans says: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m carpet-bombing my own town.\u201d This leads Brenton into some strange ironies, whereby an aristo who readily hands over her stately home to the Spitfire design team emerges as more instinctively patriotic than the obdurate Dimmock. The play\u2019s vitality, however, springs from its ability to show British resistance to any form of authoritarianism while keeping its roots firmly in Southampton life. The Last Ship Northern Stage, Newcastle, 22 March 2018 Having bombed on Broadway, this musical by Sting about the shipbuilding industry is being revived on its native soil with a new book by its director, Lorne Campbell. The only mystery is why the show ever premiered in the US in the first place. It is a deeply British musical that champions Tyneside life and leaves you in no doubt where it stands on Thatcherite economics. It was received, quite rightly, with full-throated acclaim by its Newcastle audience. Nine Night Dorfman, London, 1 May 2018 There\u2019s a key moment in Natasha Gordon\u2019s highly impressive debut play when Aunt Maggie leaves the nine-night funeral wake that is part of her Jamaican heritage to go home and watch EastEnders. \u201cBig tings are gawn in the Queen Vic tonight,\u201d she announces. For me, that neatly sums up Gordon\u2019s theme \u2013 which is the ability to inhabit two cultures and to acknowledge one\u2019s ancestral past while living fully in the present. Machinal Almeida, London, 12 June 2018 Sophie Treadwell\u2019s writing is impressive for how much it leaves out. She doesn\u2019t need to show us every detail of Helen\u2019s honeymoon or home life to make us understand her sense of suffocation. While her dialogue is stylised, Treadwell uses the polyphonic possibilities of theatre to press home her point. From the outset, Helen seems surrounded by \u201cthe purgatory of noise\u201d, whether it be the clack of office machinery, the clatter of garbage collectors or the drill that shreds her postnatal nerves. Sound has lately been reduced to an ominous hum in British theatre; in the expert hands of Ben and Max Ringham, it becomes a vital part of the play\u2019s texture. The Watsons Chichester Festival theatre, 8 November 2018 I would seriously urge anyone planning to attend Laura Wade\u2019s adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s unfinished novel, The Watsons, to stop reading now since one of the play\u2019s many pleasures is its capacity to endlessly take us by surprise. We go in expecting a literary exercise and come out having seen a philosophical comedy. Sweat Donmar Warehouse, London, 20 December 2018 Lynn Nottage, as she showed in Intimate Apparel, has the capacity to dramatise work. In this breathtaking new play, she tackles the devastating impact of loss of work and of de-industrialisation on modern America. Based on extensive interviews with residents of the rustbelt town of Reading, Pennsylvania, it shows the anger and despair that helped fuel the election of Donald Trump. Our Lady of Kibeho Royal and Derngate, Northampton, 17 January 2019 Katori Hall\u2019s virtue is that she puts a complete world on stage, one that embraces a cloistered college, a faith-hungry village and tribal hatred. James Dacre\u2019s production rises to the challenge with the aid of a community ensemble, a Jonathan Fensom set that shows the sun-kissed landscape beyond the hermetic school, and an Orlando Gough score that blends a cappella singing with tingling accompaniments to the girls\u2019 visions. La Reprise: Histoire(s) du Theatre (I) Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 4 August 2019 I loved this show for its clarity, compassion and curiosity. Director Milo Rau has something of the ability of Ken Loach to ask disturbing political questions, while extending the possibility of the medium in which he works. This show \u2013 which, among many others things, portrays the economic depression of a de-industrialised city and proves theatre is a form of inquiry \u2013 marks him out as a major talent. Mary Poppins Prince Edward theatre, London, 13 November 2019 I was rather grudging in my praise when I first saw this musical in 2004. Richard Eyre\u2019s production, based on the PL Travers stories and the Disney movie and supplementing the Richard and Robert Sherman songs with new ones by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, was more remarkable for its clinical efficiency than its pulsating joy. Either the show, which has enjoyed a long UK tour, has changed or I have: it now strikes me as rapturously pleasurable. Pippi Longstocking Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, 19 December 2019 The virtue of the show is that it conveys the spirit of Astrid Lindgren\u2019s books and suggests that Pippi belongs in the great line of rule-breakers from the medieval Till Eulenspiegel to Richmal Crompton\u2019s William. I came out with a smile on my face, which is fortunate since this show marks the end of a chapter in my life as a critic and allowed me to exit stage left happily chuckling.",

But O\u2019Connor seems the sort of person who lives an eternally optimistic life. The former military man is smiling and greeting people, asking after their loved ones, their pets, their homes. But he\u2019s exhausted, like everyone here in Balmoral, in Sydney, in New South Wales, in Australia. \u201cA massive amount of village was taken yesterday \u2026 and then the lives and the injuries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a tragic thing. Unfortunately we\u2019ve seen too much of it this year. It\u2019s just wearing everyone down.\u201d Colin Todd and Sandy Lockwood pull up in their car. Their faces are ashen, literally and figuratively. Todd thinks the house is gone. He doesn\u2019t know. He had no time to turn the pump on when a wall of flames roared up the the pottery shed they live in, nestled in what was once a leafy corner at the end of a dirt road. O\u2019Connor and another colleague walk over, hear their story, and they hug. The couple are brought in to the shed for a drink and a rest. Guardian Australia is given directions to where we might see the waterbombing, told to come back to the shed at any time for a drink or rest. Urged to watch out for falling trees, and \u201cstay safe\u201d. Balmoral is battling a fire to its east and another to its west. It was hit five times on Thursday, O\u2019Connor says. The conditions have been erratic and volatile, with completely unpredictable winds pushing fire right into the village before retreating and making another advance. Residents of this tiny village, built in 1867, had plans in place and most people had left on Thursday, heeding the warnings. O\u2019Connor is fielding a lot of calls from residents but says that\u2019s what he wants them to do. On Friday, as occurred five times on Thursday, residents have been told to the station to shelter if an emergency klaxon sounds. A Skycrane roars overhead, one of at least three waterbombing aircraft in action. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting as hard as they can to stop us losing more properties in our village,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. Two firefighters died on the road on Thursday in a car accident, and three others were hospitalised after a burnover in Bargo. \u201cMost of us have worked with those gentlemen, so our sincere condolences to the families. It\u2019s absolutely shattering,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. \u201cWe\u2019ve know those guys [from Bargo] for 20-odd years, so we\u2019re as close as family can be. It\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking for every one of us. It\u2019s just so tragic, so tragic.\u201d Another couple, who have lived on this picturesque edge of the bush for 20 years, have seen three fires go through and are staying to defend their home if the blaze just over the ridgeline gets blown towards them. Justin and Helena built their house to be certifiably defendable, and had two fire captains come through to check. It\u2019s been tested \u2013 a 2013 fire hit them but the house survived. He\u2019s worried about Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the wind picks up, everyone is going to be in trouble. Heat we can manage, but wind is what drives the fire. With that southerly that came through yesterday, you saw what happened to Bargo.\u201d Some of the firefighters have been in the field for months. They were already exhausted but power through, grumbling now and then about back burns, resources, employers and governments. Thursday\u2019s deaths were sobering. One young firefighter describes leaving his family at home that morning, his kids asking if he was going to fight fires and if he was coming back. Further south, Guardian Australia finds the helicopters dropping their bags into dams that are already too empty and have been for months. Fire and Rescue NSW has gone door to door before fire fronts come through, checking who has water sources the firefighters can exploit, who is staying to defend. Some are more stubborn than others. A still burning fencepost is the only damage to one house we find. Across the road a forest of charred trees glow above a ground of ash. Thick brown smoke winds through the trunks, uncomfortably close. The cracks and booms of falling branches shudder out to the street. At the end of the road, some firefighters marvel at the survival of a tin house, surrounded by trees. A half melted sign out the front reveals it to be Todd and Lockwood\u2019s place. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything move so fast,\u201d Todd says later. \u201cI could hear it roaring but I thought I still had some time. I had no time. By the time I ran the 100m from the pump, I was working on to the car \u2013 it was like five or 10 metres away.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the direction it\u2019s suppose to come, and that\u2019s because of the extremely dry conditions. The shape of the land is enough for it to make a run like a huge wall of fire.\u201d He says it was the aerial waterbombing that saved his house. Todd is angry. He\u2019s the father of a scientist, an activist, and a resident of the bush. \u201cWe should have done something about climate change 30 years ago.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For the past three years, Vikash Mishra, a merchant seaman from Mumbai, has been stranded on a rusting cargo ship at sea in the United Arab Emirates, thousands of miles from his young family, after being abandoned by the vessel\u2019s owner.</p> <p>His 39-month ordeal, which he describes as \u201cmental torture\u201d, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/11/seafarers-trapped-on-ship-for-33-months-say-jail-threats-forced-them-to-reboard\">covered by the Guardian in July</a>, when conditions in the busy shipping lane became so dangerous after the vessel developed engine failure that he and three crew members feared for their lives.</p> <p>His wages went unpaid and he and the others were forced to sleep outside in searing heat at the mercy of cockroaches and mosquitoes.</p> <p>Mishra\u2019s case echoes that of Captain Ayyappan Swaminathan, an Indian captain whose abandonment by the same company, Elite Way Marine Services, a UAE firm, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/12/abandoned-at-sea-the-crews-cast-adrift-without-food-fuel-or-pay\">highlighted by the Guardian</a> in April.</p> <p>The pair are just two of more than 5,000 seafarers recorded as abandoned by their vessel owners by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation since 2004.</p> <p>But today, after three long years with few supplies, scant means of communication and a trail of broken promises from the ship\u2019s owners, Mishra, 34, the second engineer on the Tamim Aldar, has finally had the news he has been waiting for. He has been paid 80% of his wages and hopes to be home for Christmas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf3ceb9c95a29917d7101c5bdf8f9d187933f1da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf3ceb9c95a29917d7101c5bdf8f9d187933f1da/0_0_715_953/375.jpg\" alt=\"Vikash Mishra\u2019s wife Vinita, son Tanmay and daughter Tanya.

He should be with them by Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Vikash Mishra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mishra, who is now in Dubai maritime city port, said via a WhatsApp audio message: \u201cWe are very lucky. So many people are abandoned here, without salary, without anything. After 39 months, I can go home and see my family.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came here, my daughter Tanya was eight months old. She will be four this month. I have been away three Christmases.\u201d</p> <p>Mishra said his son, Tanmay, said to him: \u201cI will tell Santa Claus: Please, I don\u2019t want a gift. Just send my father home.\u201d</p> <p>Mishra thanked the Guardian for helping to highlight his plight and that of other abandoned seafarers.</p> <p>He and his three fellow crew members from the Tamim Aldar, Arsu Lobo, a chief engineer from India, Tesfa Michael and Welday Mehari Ayra, both Eritrean, are the last of the 36 seamen who were abandoned in several vessels in the Gulf by Elite Way Marine Services. They were effectively forced to continue work on board without pay, in order to keep the ships safe. The rest were successfully repatriated, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/17/long-ordeal-ends-for-crew-stranded-at-sea-azraqmoiah\">Ayyappan reunited with his family in June</a>.</p> <p>At one point, Mishra and the other seamen were so afraid for their lives they abandoned the Tamim Aldar, and attempted to travel the 25 nautical miles to port in a lifeboat before being forced back to their vessel and warned they faced jail.</p> <p>In August, Mishra and the others were persuaded by another company, Mubarak Marine, to return to Dubai, where they are now living on a barge. Mishra was paid 8,000 UAE Dirhams, about $2,000 (\u00a31,500), which he has sent to his family, who are heavily in debt. In the last few days, Mishra was given 80% of the US$78,000 he was owed.</p> <p>The IMO and human rights groups have compared rising abandonment cases to forced labour or modern slavery.</p> <p>The past three years have seen a dramatic rise in abandonment cases \u2013 with the UAE one of the worst countries involved. This year, more than 50% of 474 men abandoned \u2013 254 seamen \u2013 have not received their wages, their cases unresolved, according to the IMO.</p> <p>At least 40 vessels have been recorded as abandoned this year; 44 in 2018, and 55 in 2017, compared to 12 to 17 cases a year in the previous five years. The IMO says the rise is partly to do with better reporting and <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/maritime-labour-convention/news/WCMS_502387/lang--en/index.htm\">greater protections</a> afforded to seafarers under an amendment in the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) in 2017. Under the convention, seafarers abandoned and unpaid for two months can claim their wages via mandatory insurance.</p> <p>The UAE, where 90% of the labour force are migrant workers, is not a signatory of the MLC, which also insists on union rights. Last year, the country banned Elite Way Marine Services from operating in its waters and is planning new legislation to protect seafarers. The new law, not yet on the statute book, would allow the authorities to arrest abandoned vessels, sell them and prioritise seafarers instead of debtors.</p> <p>Of the cases reported as abandoned in 2019, four involved flag states which had not ratified the MLC: Comoros, Dominica, Syria and the United Arab Emirates, IMO said. The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation have slightly different figures, and recorded five vessels in the UAE, four in Qatar and three in Iran.</p> <p>Jan Engel de Boer, senior legal officer at the IMO said he believed the issue is underreported, because seafarers are under pressure from ship owners not to alert the authorities. De Boer said: \u201cLess cases are being resolved. That\u2019s my impression. The figures we are getting is not what is happening, just what is being reported. So you never know just how bad it is.\u201d</p> <p>When seafarers are abandoned, they are often at the mercy of charities, who act as a go-between, visiting their families to provide support.</p> <p>The Rev Andy Bowerman, of the Mission to Seafarers, who recently returned from visiting Mishra\u2019s family in Mumbai, said: \u201cThe sad thing is, all the time the children were saying \u2018Where\u2019s daddy, when is he coming home?\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have had so many promises and false dawns,\u201d said Bowerman. \u201cBut with any luck, they will be home for Christmas. He knows of 60 individuals in 10 ships, off the coast of UAE, who have been abandoned for periods between three and 10 months.</p> <p>Bowerman said: \u201cThere are changes but they are happening very slowly. The new law has not gone onto the statute books. If it does, it will represent a significant shift to recognise seafarers.\u201d</p> <p>The Federal Transport Authority in UAE were contacted by the Guardian for this piece, but did not respond.</p> <p>UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the Guardian in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way\u2019s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. \u201cWe have a financial problem,\u201d said Gafar at the time. \u201cFor one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.\u201d</p> <p>The company could not be contacted for this article. Mubarak Marine, a company which has been looking after the seafarers since August, did not respond.</p> <p>David Hammond, of Human Rights At Sea, said: \u201cWhen abandoned, in order to keep leverage and be taken seriously, a seafarer has to put his life in danger by remaining on the ship and that should not be happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAccountability for ship-owners has to come from national legislation. The lack of legislation to hold ship owners to account is a failure and goes hand in hand with a lack of will to prosecute.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",

The pair are just two of more than 5,000 seafarers recorded as abandoned by their vessel owners by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Labour Organisation since 2004. But today, after three long years with few supplies, scant means of communication and a trail of broken promises from the ship\u2019s owners, Mishra, 34, the second engineer on the Tamim Aldar, has finally had the news he has been waiting for. He has been paid 80% of his wages and hopes to be home for Christmas. Mishra, who is now in Dubai maritime city port, said via a WhatsApp audio message: \u201cWe are very lucky. So many people are abandoned here, without salary, without anything. After 39 months, I can go home and see my family. \u201cWhen I came here, my daughter Tanya was eight months old. She will be four this month. I have been away three Christmases.\u201d Mishra said his son, Tanmay, said to him: \u201cI will tell Santa Claus: Please, I don\u2019t want a gift. Just send my father home.\u201d Mishra thanked the Guardian for helping to highlight his plight and that of other abandoned seafarers. He and his three fellow crew members from the Tamim Aldar, Arsu Lobo, a chief engineer from India, Tesfa Michael and Welday Mehari Ayra, both Eritrean, are the last of the 36 seamen who were abandoned in several vessels in the Gulf by Elite Way Marine Services. They were effectively forced to continue work on board without pay, in order to keep the ships safe. The rest were successfully repatriated, with Ayyappan reunited with his family in June. At one point, Mishra and the other seamen were so afraid for their lives they abandoned the Tamim Aldar, and attempted to travel the 25 nautical miles to port in a lifeboat before being forced back to their vessel and warned they faced jail. In August, Mishra and the others were persuaded by another company, Mubarak Marine, to return to Dubai, where they are now living on a barge. Mishra was paid 8,000 UAE Dirhams, about $2,000 (\u00a31,500), which he has sent to his family, who are heavily in debt. In the last few days, Mishra was given 80% of the US$78,000 he was owed. The IMO and human rights groups have compared rising abandonment cases to forced labour or modern slavery. The past three years have seen a dramatic rise in abandonment cases \u2013 with the UAE one of the worst countries involved. This year, more than 50% of 474 men abandoned \u2013 254 seamen \u2013 have not received their wages, their cases unresolved, according to the IMO. At least 40 vessels have been recorded as abandoned this year; 44 in 2018, and 55 in 2017, compared to 12 to 17 cases a year in the previous five years. The IMO says the rise is partly to do with better reporting and greater protections afforded to seafarers under an amendment in the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) in 2017. Under the convention, seafarers abandoned and unpaid for two months can claim their wages via mandatory insurance. The UAE, where 90% of the labour force are migrant workers, is not a signatory of the MLC, which also insists on union rights. Last year, the country banned Elite Way Marine Services from operating in its waters and is planning new legislation to protect seafarers. The new law, not yet on the statute book, would allow the authorities to arrest abandoned vessels, sell them and prioritise seafarers instead of debtors. Of the cases reported as abandoned in 2019, four involved flag states which had not ratified the MLC: Comoros, Dominica, Syria and the United Arab Emirates, IMO said. The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation have slightly different figures, and recorded five vessels in the UAE, four in Qatar and three in Iran. Jan Engel de Boer, senior legal officer at the IMO said he believed the issue is underreported, because seafarers are under pressure from ship owners not to alert the authorities. De Boer said: \u201cLess cases are being resolved. That\u2019s my impression. The figures we are getting is not what is happening, just what is being reported. So you never know just how bad it is.\u201d When seafarers are abandoned, they are often at the mercy of charities, who act as a go-between, visiting their families to provide support. The Rev Andy Bowerman, of the Mission to Seafarers, who recently returned from visiting Mishra\u2019s family in Mumbai, said: \u201cThe sad thing is, all the time the children were saying \u2018Where\u2019s daddy, when is he coming home?\u2019.\u201d \u201cThey have had so many promises and false dawns,\u201d said Bowerman. \u201cBut with any luck, they will be home for Christmas. He knows of 60 individuals in 10 ships, off the coast of UAE, who have been abandoned for periods between three and 10 months. Bowerman said: \u201cThere are changes but they are happening very slowly. The new law has not gone onto the statute books. If it does, it will represent a significant shift to recognise seafarers.\u201d The Federal Transport Authority in UAE were contacted by the Guardian for this piece, but did not respond. UAE-owned Elite Way Marine Services told the Guardian in April that they failed to pay the seafarers from Azraqmoiah and other ships after encountering financial problems, but promised they would be paid soon. Captain Ibrahim Gafar, Elite Way\u2019s operations manager, said the company had previously been unwilling to sell any of its vessels to release money for wage payments because unfavourable market conditions meant he would not get a good price, but they later found a buyer for one while another was being sold for scrap. \u201cWe have a financial problem,\u201d said Gafar at the time. \u201cFor one and a half years the market has been down. Any person would not give a good price for the vessel.\u201d The company could not be contacted for this article. Mubarak Marine, a company which has been looking after the seafarers since August, did not respond. David Hammond, of Human Rights At Sea, said: \u201cWhen abandoned, in order to keep leverage and be taken seriously, a seafarer has to put his life in danger by remaining on the ship and that should not be happening.\u201d \u201cAccountability for ship-owners has to come from national legislation. The lack of legislation to hold ship owners to account is a failure and goes hand in hand with a lack of will to prosecute.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Washington reckoned on Thursday with the realisation that it had impeached the third US president in American history, the capital remained racked with uncertainty about what will come next in an impeachment process defined by almost total partisanship and rancor. The two most powerful figures in the US Capitol, the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican majority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, almost immediately engaged in a huge showdown over who will have control over the impending congressional impeachment trial of Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. In a historic vote, the House of Representatives approved late on Wednesday two articles of impeachment against the president \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. As she tried to give the proceedings a grave, nonpartisan tone, Pelosi abruptly silenced Democrats in the House with a sharp look and gesture as they began breaking into applause after the articles passed. Then minutes later, in a night-time press conference, Pelosi indicated that she may delay designating House \u201cmanagers\u201d who officially deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which then triggers the trial of the president, as a way of leveraging influence with Republican leaders and cajoling them into staging a substantive trial. Of late, senior Republicans, including McConnell, have signaled a summary trial and acquittal of Trump in the Senate. He has said he is coordinating every step with the White House \u2013 the head of the jury in cahoots with the defendant \u2013 and has rebuffed Democratic demands that key witnesses including the former national security adviser John Bolton be called to testify. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen anything that looks fair to us. Hopefully it will be fair, and when we see what that is, we\u2019ll send our managers,\u201d Pelosi said. On Thursday morning, McConnell took to the floor of the Senate to say the House had done something no other Congress has ever done \u2014 impeached a president who hasn\u2019t \u201ccommitted an actual crime\u201d. He slammed Pelosi\u2019s threat of delaying tactics. \u201cHouse Democrats may be too afraid to even transmit their shoddy work product to the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country, and second-guessing whether they want to do the trial.\u201d He added that articles of impeachment are the \u201cthinnest and the weakest\u201d in American history. \u201cNothing else comes close.\u201d At a meeting with the US representative Jeff Van Drew, who switched from the Democratic party to the Republican after voting against articles of impeachment, Trump himself asserted: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being impeached, because it\u2019s a hoax, it\u2019s a set-up.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019ll see some very interesting things happen over the coming few days and weeks,\u201d he added. He had scoffed the night before, at a rally in Michigan as the vote went through in Washington, at the grave fate that befalls few presidents and has now, indelibly, befallen him. Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, but not removed from office. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal before the House voted on his likely impeachment. At his annual press conference on Thursday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, poured scorn on the articles of impeachment \u2013 the equivalent of congressional charges or indictments \u2013 saying they were based on \u201cmade-up reasons\u201d and offering the opinion that Trump would almost certainly be acquitted at trial in the Senate. In Ukraine, at the center of the impeachment battle after details emerged that Trump tried to pressure its president into investigating his political rival Joe Biden, a spokesman for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said impeachment was an \u201cinternal issue\u201d and \u201cUkraine does not interfere in the internal affairs of any state\u201d. Back in the US, such is the vast chasm now dividing the two main parties in Congress that even some Trump opponents have begun to call for the articles of impeachment to be withheld from the Senate indefinitely. That would leave Trump in a state of limbo, with the dark cloud of impeachment hanging over his head while investigations continued. Until Pelosi\u2019s latest move, a Senate trial had been expected in early to mid January, just as the 2020 presidential election campaign gets into full swing with the first Democratic primaries to choose the party\u2019s nominee due to begin in early February. Pelosi said on Thursday morning that the reaction of Republicans \u201creminded me that our founders, when they wrote the constitution, they suspected there could be a rogue president. I don\u2019t think they suspected we could have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the Senate at the same time.\u201d Trump\u2019s line of attack was to highlight and reinforce the overwhelming partisan divide, implying that Democratic leaders had strong-armed party members to vote for impeachment. \u201cThey happened to have a small majority, and they took that small majority and they forced people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey put the arm on everybody.\u201d He seized on the fact that no Republican had broken ranks in the dual impeachment vote, the final tally of which was 230 to 197 on abuse of power and 229 to 198 on obstruction. The Democrats saw two of its ranking members cross party lines on both impeachment votes \u2013 Van Drew and Collin Peterson of Minnesota \u2013 and a third, Jared Golden of Maine, voted against charging Trump with obstruction. \u201c100% Republican Vote,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s what people are talking about. The Republicans are united like never before!\u201d Still, not all conservatives rallied behind the president. In a searing editorial, a prominent evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for Trump to be removed from office. \u201cNone of the president\u2019s positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character,\u201d wrote Mark Galli, the editor-in-chief.",

I read translations of his famous novels \u2013 Effi Briest and The Stechlin \u2013 and was then transfixed by his enthralling non-fiction five-volume work, <em>Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg</em> (Rambles through Brandenburg state), which has never been translated.

Calling Neuruppin pretty would be an understatement: rebuilt in neoclassical style following an enormous fire in 1787 (leaving it \u201clike a loaf of bread of which only the heels remained\u201d, wrote Fontane) the town is tidy, with wide streets and stately pastel townhouses. Miniature Christmas decorations hang from lamp posts, and a small farmers\u2019 market occupies the central square. Still, the traces of the region\u2019s more recent history linger: I head for the water, past the Apotheke above which Fontane was born, following Karl-Marx-Strasse and passing Friedrich-Engels Strasse \u2013 the town served as a garrison for Soviet troops from 1945 until the Wall fell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f39537da3436506a6dcffdcb846ebb8a7989972\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f39537da3436506a6dcffdcb846ebb8a7989972/0_302_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neuruppin\u2019s main square with Christmas tree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neuruppin\u2019s main square: the town was rebuilt after a fire in 1787.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Lee/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fontane\u2019s stories centred on the everyday: the details of the landscape and the lives of villagers, the intrigues of local counts and crown princes, the beauty of their castles.

I\u2019ve traced his boat journeys south of Berlin in much the same way and found lakeside villages still quiet despite the capital city on their doorsteps.

Lake Ruppin is still as Fontane described \u2013 sandy-bottomed and clear, under gentle slopes that seem at odds with the flat fields beyond. Swimming out into the cold, I can see the length of it \u2013 almost 10km end to end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5747db3ba2b442865d8091efeecb7121a65f27f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5747db3ba2b442865d8091efeecb7121a65f27f8/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruppiner See in winter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruppiner See makes for a bracing swim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dressed and warm again, I walk a few more kilometres until the lake narrows to a canal. I reach a freshly paved road, signposted as a Fontane cycle route, and then arrive at another lake altogether: Molchowsee, lined with crumbling dachas and newly built mansions. Fontane said that despite its lack of mountains this land of lakes \u2013 the Ruppiner Schweiz (Ruppiner Switzerland) \u2013 is beautiful because of its wealth of clear waterways and vast forests. To the friendly and attentive eye, he wrote, this watery landscape could offer more than enough.</p> <p>The sun dips low on the horizon so I turn back toward the railway station. As I ride home to the city past the unchanged fields, surrounded by refreshed spa visitors and Berliners clutching their novels, I see a sparrow hawk hunting along a hedgerow and count baubles of mistletoe high among the trees. </p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jessica J.

Lake Ruppin is still as Fontane described \u2013 sandy-bottomed and clear, under gentle slopes that seem at odds with the flat fields beyond. Swimming out into the cold, I can see the length of it \u2013 almost 10km end to end. Dressed and warm again, I walk a few more kilometres until the lake narrows to a canal. I reach a freshly paved road, signposted as a Fontane cycle route, and then arrive at another lake altogether: Molchowsee, lined with crumbling dachas and newly built mansions. Fontane said that despite its lack of mountains this land of lakes \u2013 the Ruppiner Schweiz (Ruppiner Switzerland) \u2013 is beautiful because of its wealth of clear waterways and vast forests. To the friendly and attentive eye, he wrote, this watery landscape could offer more than enough. The sun dips low on the horizon so I turn back toward the railway station. As I ride home to the city past the unchanged fields, surrounded by refreshed spa visitors and Berliners clutching their novels, I see a sparrow hawk hunting along a hedgerow and count baubles of mistletoe high among the trees. \u2022 Jessica J.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Workers\u2019 rights clause stripped from exit bill</h2> \n<p>Good morning. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and welcome to the last morning briefing of the year. We will return in January but in the meantime we wish you all the best for the festive season. These are the top stories from the Guardian today.</p> \n<p>MPs will vote on the revised Brexit bill for the first time in the new parliament today after Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/queens-speech-nhs-funding-and-terrorist-sentencing-at-centre-of-plans\">promised that Britain would leave the European Union by 31 January</a>. After a Queen\u2019s speech that outlined more than 30 new pieces of legislation, the EU withdrawal bill will be put to the Commons where it is expected to pass easily. Labour MPs expressed dismay that key concessions on issues such as workers\u2019 rights and refugee children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/johnson-revises-eu-bill-to-limit-parliaments-role-in-brexit-talks\">had been stripped out of the new bill</a>, dashing hopes that Johnson\u2019s majority would usher in a softer Brexit. Their mood will not have improved when Johnson proclaimed the next decade could be a \u201cnew golden age\u201d for Britain. Suggesting he believes he can win again in 2024, the prime minister said: \u201cThis is not a programme for one year, or one parliament \u2013 it is a blueprint for the future of Britain.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s leadership race gained a new entrant when Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/clive-lewis-joins-race-to-be-labour-leader-pledging-to-unleash-party\">said he would be running</a> on a platform of giving more say to members. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/19/im-standing-labour-leader-clive-lewis\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Lewis says Labour had failed to convince voters that they had cast off the legacy of New Labour.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trial of strength \u2013</strong> House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell are gearing up for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/19/trump-impeachment-pelosi-mcconnell-house-senate\">a showdown about how Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial should be managed</a>. Pelosi is trying to gain more Republican support for a substantive impeachment trial but McConnell, who is effectively the head of the trial jury, has vowed to ensure a short, summary acquittal of the president. Trump repeated his claim that the process was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and won support from Vladimir Putin, who said the allegations were \u201cmade up\u201d. But Trump was dealt a blow when the magazine Christianity Today said the impeachment hearings had revealed the president\u2019s \u201cimmoral\u201d behaviour and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/19/trump-evangelical-christian-magazine-impeachment\">called for his removal from office</a>.</p> \n<p>In Los Angeles, the Democratic party presidential hopefuls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/19/democratic-debate-2020-los-angeles-warren-sanders-biden\">faced off in their final debate </a>before next year\u2019s primaries with Elizabeth Warren unleashing on the alleged elitism of Pete Buttigieg for hosting a fundraiser in a wine cave in California.

Heathrow is expecting its busiest day of the year tomorrow while Network Rail said the vast majority of the railway would be open over the break. However, thousands of rail passengers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/20/railcard-website-crash-leaves-passengers-without-discount-cards\">could be left out of pocket</a> over the holidays because railcard applications and renewals were delayed when the national website crashed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Depression hope \u2013 </strong>A drug similar to ketamine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/19/ketamine-like-drug-depression-uk-licence-esketamine\">has been licensed for use in the UK for severe depression </a>in a decision that offers hope to the millions of patients for whom conventional treatments have failed. Esketamine, taken as a nasal spray, is one of the first rapid-acting drugs for depression and the first in decades that is thought to work in a fundamentally different way in the brain. Some psychiatrists say esketamine is a breakthrough while others fear it has the potential for addiction and abuse.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Catastrophic\u2019 \u2013</strong> Firefighters in Australia<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/dec/20/nsw-fires-near-sydney-melbourne-wa-western-south-australia-weather-forecast-victoria-qld-bushfires-catastrophic-extreme-heatwave-latest-news-live-updates\"> are bracing themselves for \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions tomorrow </a>as bushfires threaten major roads in the eastern states at the start of the Christmas travel getaway. Temperatures are set soar into the high 40s on Saturday and police fear drivers could get trapped in their cars if fires encroach onto highways. It follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/20/nsw-bushfires-rfs-two-firefighters-killed-south-west-sydney\">the death of two firefighters in western Sydney</a> on Thursday when their truck overturned after hitting a downed tree. Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s prime minister, is heading back to the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/20/scott-morrison-apologises-for-taking-holiday-during-australias-bushfire-crisis\">after being criticised for trying to keep a family holiday in Hawaii </a>under wraps.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bet fairer \u2013 </strong>Video games with betting-style features are \u201cpolluting\u201d youngsters\u2019 lives and should be reclassified as gambling for over-18s. A new report by the Royal Society for Public Health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/20/charity-warns-that-betting-features-in-video-games-harm-young-people\">raises concerns about video game loot boxes </a>\u2013 where players buy or earn in-game rewards \u2013 and the rise of betting with \u201cskins\u201d, the term for items such as weapons and outfits that can be bought for money. It also warns about marketing tieups in sport and calls for a complete overhaul of gambling regulation in the UK.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Astrology boom is written in the stars</h2> \n<p>Astrology is back!

You can also talk food and drink with Felicity Cloake, beauty with Sali Hughes or movies with Peter Bradshaw.</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>Mikel Arteta may make a success of Arsenal. Carlo Ancelotti could triumph at Everton. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/19/arteta-ancelotti-arsenal-everton-guesswork\">Even a laughably reactive recruitment strategy gets it right once a decade</a>, writes Barney Ronay. Arsenal didn\u2019t fight hard enough to recruit Mikel Arteta as a coach and then last year overlooked him as a manager. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/19/arsenal-mikel-arteta-gamble-manager-appointment-mr-mentality\">His appointment now would offer hope for a reboot</a>. UK Sport is \u201cquietly confident\u201d that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/19/uk-sport-gb-olympic-medal-record-tokyo-2020\">Tokyo Olympics will be the best ever for British athletes</a>, surpassing the record-breaking medal haul of 2016. In darts, if Gerwyn Price ends up as world champion, he may find his mind wandering back to the time his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/20/gerwyn-price-willie-oconnor-pdc-darts\">opponent threw at a double 1 instead of a double 2</a>.

Finally to cricket, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/19/england-final-warm-up-game-south-africa-cricket-tour-downgraded-flu-bug\">England have been forced to revise their final preparations for the Boxing Day Test</a> due to the illness bug sweeping the camp, with Friday\u2019s warm-up against South Africa A downgraded from first-class status.</p> \n<h2>Business</h2> \n<p>Andrew Bailey, head of the City regulator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/city-regulator-andrew-bailey-favourite-to-take-bank-of-england-job\">is favourite to takeover from Mark Carney </a>as governor of the Bank of England. The FCA boss could be confirmed in his new post today, according to the FT. Markets in Asia were becalmed overnight and the FTSE100 looks like opening down very slightly. The pound is on \u00a31.305 and \u20ac1.172.</p> \n<h2>The papers</h2> \n<p>A picture of a grinning Boris Johnson and a stony-faced Jeremy Corbyn features on several front pages as the papers digest the Queen\u2019s speech.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Workers\u2019 rights clause stripped from exit bill Good morning. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and welcome to the last morning briefing of the year. We will return in January but in the meantime we wish you all the best for the festive season. These are the top stories from the Guardian today. MPs will vote on the revised Brexit bill for the first time in the new parliament today after Boris Johnson promised that Britain would leave the European Union by 31 January. After a Queen\u2019s speech that outlined more than 30 new pieces of legislation, the EU withdrawal bill will be put to the Commons where it is expected to pass easily. Labour MPs expressed dismay that key concessions on issues such as workers\u2019 rights and refugee children had been stripped out of the new bill, dashing hopes that Johnson\u2019s majority would usher in a softer Brexit. Their mood will not have improved when Johnson proclaimed the next decade could be a \u201cnew golden age\u201d for Britain. Suggesting he believes he can win again in 2024, the prime minister said: \u201cThis is not a programme for one year, or one parliament \u2013 it is a blueprint for the future of Britain.\u201d Labour\u2019s leadership race gained a new entrant when Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said he would be running on a platform of giving more say to members. Writing in the Guardian, Lewis says Labour had failed to convince voters that they had cast off the legacy of New Labour. * * * Trial of strength \u2013 House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell are gearing up for a showdown about how Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial should be managed. Pelosi is trying to gain more Republican support for a substantive impeachment trial but McConnell, who is effectively the head of the trial jury, has vowed to ensure a short, summary acquittal of the president. Trump repeated his claim that the process was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and won support from Vladimir Putin, who said the allegations were \u201cmade up\u201d. But Trump was dealt a blow when the magazine Christianity Today said the impeachment hearings had revealed the president\u2019s \u201cimmoral\u201d behaviour and called for his removal from office. In Los Angeles, the Democratic party presidential hopefuls faced off in their final debate before next year\u2019s primaries with Elizabeth Warren unleashing on the alleged elitism of Pete Buttigieg for hosting a fundraiser in a wine cave in California. Read our analysis of who won the debate. * * * Christmas getaway \u2013 The festive travel rush is expected to peak this afternoon although congestion on the roads could be better than previous years, according to motoring groups, because the 25th falls in midweek. Heathrow is expecting its busiest day of the year tomorrow while Network Rail said the vast majority of the railway would be open over the break. However, thousands of rail passengers could be left out of pocket over the holidays because railcard applications and renewals were delayed when the national website crashed. * * * Depression hope \u2013 A drug similar to ketamine has been licensed for use in the UK for severe depression in a decision that offers hope to the millions of patients for whom conventional treatments have failed. Esketamine, taken as a nasal spray, is one of the first rapid-acting drugs for depression and the first in decades that is thought to work in a fundamentally different way in the brain. Some psychiatrists say esketamine is a breakthrough while others fear it has the potential for addiction and abuse. * * * \u2018Catastrophic\u2019 \u2013 Firefighters in Australia are bracing themselves for \u201ccatastrophic\u201d conditions tomorrow as bushfires threaten major roads in the eastern states at the start of the Christmas travel getaway. Temperatures are set soar into the high 40s on Saturday and police fear drivers could get trapped in their cars if fires encroach onto highways. It follows the death of two firefighters in western Sydney on Thursday when their truck overturned after hitting a downed tree. Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s prime minister, is heading back to the country after being criticised for trying to keep a family holiday in Hawaii under wraps. * * * Bet fairer \u2013 Video games with betting-style features are \u201cpolluting\u201d youngsters\u2019 lives and should be reclassified as gambling for over-18s. A new report by the Royal Society for Public Health raises concerns about video game loot boxes \u2013 where players buy or earn in-game rewards \u2013 and the rise of betting with \u201cskins\u201d, the term for items such as weapons and outfits that can be bought for money. It also warns about marketing tieups in sport and calls for a complete overhaul of gambling regulation in the UK. Today in Focus podcast: Astrology boom is written in the stars Astrology is back! The Guardian\u2019s Aamna Modhin looks at why millennial women are taking life advice from the stars. And: spoken word artist Sophia Thakur on why we should be a bit kinder at Christmas. Guardian and Observer charity telethon A team of Guardian and Observer journalists will be taking calls and donations at our annual telethon tomorrow. The cause is the climate crisis and we\u2019re raising money for four charities that plant and protect trees, forests and woodlands. So if you want to discuss the climate crisis with George Monbiot or mull over the election with Polly Toynbee, Owen Jones or Marina Hyde, this is your chance. You can also talk food and drink with Felicity Cloake, beauty with Sali Hughes or movies with Peter Bradshaw. Sport Mikel Arteta may make a success of Arsenal. Carlo Ancelotti could triumph at Everton. Even a laughably reactive recruitment strategy gets it right once a decade, writes Barney Ronay. Arsenal didn\u2019t fight hard enough to recruit Mikel Arteta as a coach and then last year overlooked him as a manager. His appointment now would offer hope for a reboot. UK Sport is \u201cquietly confident\u201d that the Tokyo Olympics will be the best ever for British athletes, surpassing the record-breaking medal haul of 2016. In darts, if Gerwyn Price ends up as world champion, he may find his mind wandering back to the time his opponent threw at a double 1 instead of a double 2. In tennis, Britain\u2019s No1 Johanna Konta says she\u2019s had a knee injury since the start of the year, but is still hopeful of playing in the Australian Open next month. Finally to cricket, and England have been forced to revise their final preparations for the Boxing Day Test due to the illness bug sweeping the camp, with Friday\u2019s warm-up against South Africa A downgraded from first-class status. Business Andrew Bailey, head of the City regulator, is favourite to takeover from Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England. The FCA boss could be confirmed in his new post today, according to the FT. Markets in Asia were becalmed overnight and the FTSE100 looks like opening down very slightly. The pound is on \u00a31.305 and \u20ac1.172. The papers A picture of a grinning Boris Johnson and a stony-faced Jeremy Corbyn features on several front pages as the papers digest the Queen\u2019s speech. The Guardian says \u201cFears of \u2018extreme Brexit\u2019 in PM\u2019s blueprint for Britain\u201d, while the Express and Telegraph take a different view with, respectively, \u201cBoris promises new golden age\u201d and \u201cJohnson promises a \u2018golden age\u2019 for Britain\u201d. The i has \u201cMissing: a plan to tackle social care crisis\u201d and the Mail leads with \u201cMinister demands all NHS staff get flu jabs\u201d. The Times continues with its story about the leaks at the Bank of England with \u201cTraders boasted of Bank breach\u201d, and the FT splashes on future changes at Threadneedle Street: \u201cFCA\u2019s Bailey emerges as favourite to replace Carney at Bank of England\u201d. The Mirror goes with \u201cGran\u2019s final wish \u2026 a Christmas shopping trip to M&amp;S\u201d and the Sun is concerned with renovations at Wayne Rooney\u2019s house: \u201cEscape Roon\u201d.

Several candidates, including the US congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and the author Marianne Williamson, failed to meet that bar. Also missing from the event was Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who made a surprise entrance into the race last month and has poured an estimated $13.5m into TV ads in California. Steyer, whose campaign still lags behind his competitors despite spending heavily on TV ads, may not have achieved the night\u2019s breakout performance but appeared unfazed when asked about it in the spin room afterwards. \u201cLook, my attitude about all these debates is simply: my job in this campaign is simply to tell Americans what I stand for, why I\u2019m running and who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I talk, that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d Steyer said he was not concerned that Andrew Yang, also a lesser-known candidate, had received more positive reactions from the debate crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s funny. I enjoyed him,\u201d Steyer said.\ufeff",

A day after blazes some Rural Fire Service members described as \u201cunfightable\u201d claimed the lives of two volunteers south of Sydney, attention has again turned to the resourcing of the firefighting effort amid concerns about the scale of the emergency. With catastrophic fire danger warnings again in place across swathes of NSW on Saturday, the federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called for volunteer firefighters to be compensated through tax breaks, one-off payments or special leave entitlements saying the fires in NSW were \u201cnot businesses as usual\u201d. \u201cThese are extraordinary fires ... but we need to do much better right now as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do more to make sure that people aren\u2019t out of pocket, that they\u2019re not in a position of choosing whether to go out on another run, or whether to have to go to work and provide for their family.\u201d Those comments come amid ongoing scrutiny about the resourcing of volunteer firefighting units and reports of scenes of \u201cchaos\u201d from some volunteers posted at firegrounds across the state on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s a really bad feeling among some of us at the moment, it doesn\u2019t really feel like we can trust the instructions we\u2019ve been given at times,\u201d he said.

As the number of people suffering from mental illnesses continues to rise, the \u201ctreatment gap\u201d of medical professionals to tend them remains one of the largest in the world.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://indianmhs.nimhans.ac.in/Docs/Report2.pdf\">National Mental Health Survey</a>, commissioned by the Indian government and carried out by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), found that 150 million Indians (10.6% of adults) were suffering from a mental health disorder in 2016.

Between 2012-2030, WHO estimates that India\u2019s mental health emergency will cost the economy more than $1tn in lost productivity (as measured in 2010 US dollars).</p> <p>\u201cRight now, the people of this country are suffering,\u201d says psychiatrist Dr Soumitra Pathare. \u201cWe need to get Indians healthy, so they can reach their full potential and the country can thrive.

In 2014, aged 28 and more than a decade after he had first experienced symptoms, Khan was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder.

That\u2019s because the treatment gap is worse in rural areas, where the majority of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people live.</p> <p>Dr Shyam Ravilla is a psychiatrist with the Banyan, a mental health organisation that hosts pop-up clinics in rural areas. He typically sees up to 50 patients during a clinic.

It\u2019s not something the average Indian can afford.\u201d</p> <p>While there is a public healthcare system in India, Dr Ravilla says many rural patients give up on care entirely or turn to private providers. </p> <p>Despite the challenges, there has been progress.

As sublime as her debut single Video Games was, her debut album, Born to Die, was flimsy, laced with hiccupy hip-hop affectations and surface obsessions (Hollywood, bad boys, putting a red dress on and then taking it off again) that didn\u2019t suggest much potential for maturation. How nice it has been to be proved wrong. </p> <p>In 2017, the New York Times music reporter Joe Coscarelli <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joecoscarelli/status/834076276415664128\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSerious Q, why does everyone seem to unequivocally love Lana Del Rey now? What changed?\u201d What changed is that an artist perceived as a dilettante, thanks to sexist assumptions about her aesthetic and background, turned out to be one of pop\u2019s grafters. She leaned into the image that had aroused suspicions, creating an identity so indelible that when she swapped her pout for a grin on the cover of 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/21/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-album-review\" title=\"\">Lust for Life</a>, it was as startling as finding a green can of Coke.</p> <p>More significantly, Del Rey deepened her craft, producing six albums in nine years, each better than the last. In pop\u2019s big league, only Drake matched her productivity, although he might wish he had her increasing creative returns. Her themes became more provocative, while her sweeping, lunar balladry pushed beyond cliched noir. Here was someone who knew exactly what she was doing \u2013 and when other people tried it (see: Taylor Swift\u2019s Wildest Dreams), something was clearly missing.

Unlike Lust for Life, with its unconvincing forays into trap, Del Rey\u2019s stately sixth album is completely out of step with contemporary trends: as if a Brill Building stablehand went west on a Laurel Canyon recon mission. Those sounds are more than just another layer of Americana cosplay (though they are that, too). On NFR, Del Rey asserts a newfound sturdiness after a wayward past of teenage alcoholism and yielding to men who take her sadness \u201cout of context\u201d. \u201cMaybe the way that I\u2019m living is killing me,\u201d she gasps on Fuck It I Love You. \u201cBut one day I woke up like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll do it differently.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And so she offers herself up as a compass (\u201cI\u2019m always going to be right here,\u201d she declares on How to Disappear) and a catalyst: \u201cthe kind of girl who\u2019s gonna make you wonder who you are and where you\u2019ve been,\u201d she gasps on Mariner\u2019s Apartment Complex, each rich, piano-led verse a three-part rising chord progression that rings with stability, as if laying foundations, bricks then roof.

      "body": "<p>The richness, artistry and grandeur of Martin Scorsese\u2019s film-making was revealed again in his epic mob corruption tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-irishman\">The Irishman</a>, which returns him spectacularly to the wellspring of his greatest inspiration: the lives of working-class Italian Americans, and those from other US immigrant communities in the 20th century. They are mixed up with organised crime, deeply influenced by the protective codes and practices of the family, the church and respectable commerce, but their conformity exists alongside a half-acknowledged life of sin and crime. The family man cheats on his wife, the churchgoer murders and robs, the hardworking small businessman evades tax, uses his business as a laundering front for the wiseguys and pays (or demands) protection \u2013 and the loyal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/22/mafia-godfathers-sicily-palermo-italy\">Cosa Nostra</a> soldier secretly wears a wire preparing to turn state\u2019s evidence.</p> <p>The Irishman is based on the true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses, about Philadelphia mob enforcer Frank Sheeran \u00ad\u2013 whose nickname \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was an important way of announcing his semi-detachment from the Italian gangsters \u2013 and Sheeran\u2019s claim to have been the man who murdered Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa at the behest of mafiosi nervous about what Hoffa might reveal about his mob links. Scorsese assembles a superstar repertory of players: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/01/robert-de-niro-and-al-pacino-were-not-doing-this-ever-again\">Robert De Niro is the stolid, discreet Sheeran</a>, Joe Pesci displays his charismatic menace in the role of soft-spoken mafia boss Russell Bufalino and Al Pacino brings his A-game to the part of Hoffa.</p> <p>These are all actors in their 70s, and though the digital de-ageing techniques used to represent them in middle age are remarkably successful, they have the bodies of old men and move like old men. Or is it that the top players in those days did indeed have a natural predator\u2019s discreet, unhurried stealth and stillness? Either way, there is a wintry poignancy to their performances and to the movie, which has led to a critical consensus that this is late Scorsese and that he is saying farewell to the mob genre.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS3aHkkfuEI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RS3aHkkfuEI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Maybe.

      "bodyText": "The richness, artistry and grandeur of Martin Scorsese\u2019s film-making was revealed again in his epic mob corruption tale The Irishman, which returns him spectacularly to the wellspring of his greatest inspiration: the lives of working-class Italian Americans, and those from other US immigrant communities in the 20th century. They are mixed up with organised crime, deeply influenced by the protective codes and practices of the family, the church and respectable commerce, but their conformity exists alongside a half-acknowledged life of sin and crime. The family man cheats on his wife, the churchgoer murders and robs, the hardworking small businessman evades tax, uses his business as a laundering front for the wiseguys and pays (or demands) protection \u2013 and the loyal Cosa Nostra soldier secretly wears a wire preparing to turn state\u2019s evidence. The Irishman is based on the true-crime bestseller I Heard You Paint Houses, about Philadelphia mob enforcer Frank Sheeran \u2013 whose nickname \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was an important way of announcing his semi-detachment from the Italian gangsters \u2013 and Sheeran\u2019s claim to have been the man who murdered Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa at the behest of mafiosi nervous about what Hoffa might reveal about his mob links. Scorsese assembles a superstar repertory of players: Robert De Niro is the stolid, discreet Sheeran, Joe Pesci displays his charismatic menace in the role of soft-spoken mafia boss Russell Bufalino and Al Pacino brings his A-game to the part of Hoffa. These are all actors in their 70s, and though the digital de-ageing techniques used to represent them in middle age are remarkably successful, they have the bodies of old men and move like old men. Or is it that the top players in those days did indeed have a natural predator\u2019s discreet, unhurried stealth and stillness? Either way, there is a wintry poignancy to their performances and to the movie, which has led to a critical consensus that this is late Scorsese and that he is saying farewell to the mob genre. Maybe. What strikes me now about this story is not that it is sadly closing the book, but actually opening the book \u2013 and a lot of wounds \u2013 about crime and its connections with corrupt politics. The film makes clear the connection between the Cuban revolution, the collapse of the mob\u2019s casino business there and the subsequent creation of Las Vegas as the new gambling playground, built with money illegally loaned by Jimmy Hoffa out of the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund in return for a taste of the interest repayment and the use of mob \u201cmuscle\u201d \u2013 like Sheeran. It also touches on the mob\u2019s complex rage at John F Kennedy for failing to show gratitude for their alleged help in getting him elected and Hoffa\u2019s anger at attorney general Robert Kennedy for his anti-corruption crackdown. Not since Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK has a movie returned to the conspiracist issue of political assassination. With calm, non-cranky deliberation, The Irishman proposes Hoffa\u2019s death as a quasi-Kennedy murder, but with no grassy knoll, no book depository, no Zapruder footage. There is such intense fascination in Scorsese\u2019s mastery of the big picture, the tiny detail, the flair and showmanship in the popular music on the soundtrack, and the unmistakable use of narrative voiceover, which gives his picture the intimacy of an anecdote and potency of myth. He talks of Bufalino\u2019s\u2019s wife, Carrie (played by Kathrine Narducci, who was Charmaine on The Sopranos) as a member of the blue-blooded Sciandra family from Sicily: \u201cThey came over on the Italian Mayflower!\u201d It is a very male film, and the absence of powerful women figures has been noted. I can only say that, yes, there is not much for Anna Paquin to do as Frank\u2019s adult daughter, but the maleness and male toxicity is part of the point. The geriatric melancholy of The Irishman is shown in the scenes in an old people\u2019s home and in those prison facilities adapted for use by the very old (another point in common with David Chase\u2019s The Sopranos). When the ageing Bufalino tells Sheeran he is going to mass in the prison chapel, he warns him not to laugh \u2013 and you don\u2019t laugh, not even ironically at Bufalino\u2019s expense.

They again emerged as the dominant parties, respectively with 30% and 22% of the vote, but with with major dents, even in their heartlands.</p> <p>Instead of sweeping the vacant seat of North Down, the DUP disappeared under a landslide for Stephen Farry, deputy leader of the non-aligned Alliance party, which rallied Remainers, including unionists, against the DUP\u2019s would-be Brexiters.</p> <p>A tsunami for Colum Eastwood, leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, swamped Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s incumbent MP in Foyle, which encompasses Derry.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very clear message to the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in that the status quo was completely unacceptable,\u201d said John Kyle, a councillor with the Progressive Unionist party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa7147dc4d6afd09e13f9ed8e34940b4ce34a9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa7147dc4d6afd09e13f9ed8e34940b4ce34a9b/0_27_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colum Eastwood, leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colum Eastwood, leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, swamped Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s MP in Foyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The election\u2019s big winner was the Alliance, a socially liberal party that rejects nationalist and unionist labels. It won 16.8% of the vote, an surge of 8.9% percentage points from the last election, making it the third biggest party. Previously it was fifth biggest, behind the Ulster Unionist party and the SDLP.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a new confidence about the middle ground,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cIt offers an alternative that is more policy focused.\u201d Brexit will put Northern Ireland in limbo, requiring focused and practical leadership, she said. \u201cRegulations, trade policy, nitty-gritty policy \u2013 these are the challenges. The constitutional question \u2026 diverts attention away from what\u2019s needed here and now if Northern Ireland is not to become a basket case.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/northern-ireland-nurses-strike-over-pay-and-patient-safety\">nurses\u2019 strike</a> this week underscored the gravity of the healthcare crisis, piling pressure on all sides to restore Stormont. Another factor that may clinch a deal is the presence of a secretary of state, Smith, who is respected by all parties and civil servants, unlike certain predecessors. \u201cGod I hope we get to keep him,\u201d said one official, eyeing a coming cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>There is widespread agreement that Stormont must not just be restored but reformed. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/13/burned-cash-for-ash-scandal-sam-mcbride\">cash-for-ash scandal</a> \u2013 a bungled green energy incentive scheme that helped topple power-sharing \u2013 exposed dysfunction and corruption. The rise of the centre also increases pressure to change rules designed for the binary politics of nationalism versus unionism.</p> <p>Brexit raises the stakes for both sides of that quarrel. Already unnerved by Scottish fissures in the union, some loyalists, including paramilitaries, have warned of a backlash over Johnson\u2019s \u201cbetrayal bill\u201d, raising the spectre of disruption at Larne and other ports.</p> <p>Kyle, the PUP councillor, played down such a prospect. \u201cPast experience tells us civil disobedience peters out and is not effective at bringing about change. The best options are to be involved in serious negotiations with Westminster and Dublin to see how potential problems can be ameliorated.\u201d</p> <p>For nationalists who yearn for a united Ireland the omens are mixed. Nationalist MPs \u2013 two SDLP, seven Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 for the first time outnumber unionist MPs. Opinion polls suggest a conceivable majority for unification, a sentiment likely to harden if Brexit inflicts serious damage.</p> <p>\u201cThis election has left Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s calls for a border poll bolstered, particularly amidst renewed calls in Scotland for another referendum,\u201d said Marisa McGlinchey, an assistant politics professor at Coventry University who studies Irish nationalism.</p> <p>Others dispute that, saying a 22% vote share and downward trend weakens Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s hand. \u201cThe narrative of unstoppable forward progress has been badly weakened,\u201d said Whyte. \u201cTheir border poll idea is now dead,\u201d wrote Mick Fealty, political editor of the political blog <a href=\"https://sluggerotoole.com/\">Slugger O\u2019Toole</a>.</p> <p>The big debate about Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status lies in the future. For the next few weeks, at least, focus will be on the politicians driving up the mile-long drive of red-twigged lime trees to the grand, abandoned parliament building to see if they can banish the cobwebs.</p>",

The parliament building at Stormont, an estate outside Belfast, is an imposing structure in the Greek classical style filled with ornate ceilings, chandeliers and marbled halls. Life drained from the building three years ago when a row between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) led to the collapse of power sharing, mothballing the assembly chamber and zombifying Northern Ireland\u2019s politics. The debacle haunted both parties on election night. The DUP lost two of its 10 MPs and saw its overall vote fall by 5.4 percentage points. Sinn F\u00e9in won a headline-grabbing victory in Belfast North where John Finucane toppled the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds, but faltered everywhere else, losing a seat in Derry and seeing its overall vote drop by 6.7 percentage points. It was punishment for Stormont\u2019s paralysis amid crumbling public services, especially a crisis in healthcare, and it was Brexit blowback: retribution for DUP bungling and Sinn F\u00e9in irrelevance. \u201cPeople were voting against abstentionism and the dominance of the two big parties.

But last night the British and Irish governments blamed the DUP for holding up a compromise deal. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d and that talks would probably be paused over Christmas to give all parties time to \u201creflect\u201d before trying again in January. \u201cI know there are people in the DUP who want to move forward and I would urge them to move forward so we can get this done,\u201d he said.

Bigger challenges loom, raising profound questions about Northern Ireland\u2019s future. The prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal rattles loyalists who say a border down the Irish Sea will diminish their British identity. And it will create headaches for business owners faced with murky rules and regulations for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Equally unclear is how Downing Street\u2019s coming trade talks with the European Union will impact Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and constitutional status within the UK and EU. All this while a renewed push for Scottish independence and a demographic tilt towards a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland fans republican hopes \u2013 and unionist dread \u2013 of Irish unification. There is everything to play for, in other words, so little wonder that voters vented anger at the absence of players on the pitch. The DUP had deflected frustration over Stormont\u2019s impasse by touting its confidence-and-supply agreement with Theresa May\u2019s government, casting itself as Downing Street\u2019s puppeteer, only for her successor, Johnson, to negotiate a Brexit deal that cut the strings, leaving the DUP betrayed and sidelined. Sinn F\u00e9in, meanwhile, struggled to show its impact given the empty chamber in Belfast and a policy of abstention from Westminster that emasculated its seven MPs during Brexit\u2019s great parliamentary dramas. Both parties sought to rally their bases with existential appeals: vote DUP to save the union from peril, vote Sinn F\u00e9in to get a border poll on a united Ireland. They again emerged as the dominant parties, respectively with 30% and 22% of the vote, but with with major dents, even in their heartlands. Instead of sweeping the vacant seat of North Down, the DUP disappeared under a landslide for Stephen Farry, deputy leader of the non-aligned Alliance party, which rallied Remainers, including unionists, against the DUP\u2019s would-be Brexiters. A tsunami for Colum Eastwood, leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP, swamped Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s incumbent MP in Foyle, which encompasses Derry. \u201cIt was a very clear message to the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in that the status quo was completely unacceptable,\u201d said John Kyle, a councillor with the Progressive Unionist party. The election\u2019s big winner was the Alliance, a socially liberal party that rejects nationalist and unionist labels. It won 16.8% of the vote, an surge of 8.9% percentage points from the last election, making it the third biggest party. Previously it was fifth biggest, behind the Ulster Unionist party and the SDLP. \u201cThere is a new confidence about the middle ground,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cIt offers an alternative that is more policy focused.\u201d Brexit will put Northern Ireland in limbo, requiring focused and practical leadership, she said. \u201cRegulations, trade policy, nitty-gritty policy \u2013 these are the challenges. The constitutional question \u2026 diverts attention away from what\u2019s needed here and now if Northern Ireland is not to become a basket case.\u201d A nurses\u2019 strike this week underscored the gravity of the healthcare crisis, piling pressure on all sides to restore Stormont. Another factor that may clinch a deal is the presence of a secretary of state, Smith, who is respected by all parties and civil servants, unlike certain predecessors. \u201cGod I hope we get to keep him,\u201d said one official, eyeing a coming cabinet reshuffle. There is widespread agreement that Stormont must not just be restored but reformed. The cash-for-ash scandal \u2013 a bungled green energy incentive scheme that helped topple power-sharing \u2013 exposed dysfunction and corruption. The rise of the centre also increases pressure to change rules designed for the binary politics of nationalism versus unionism. Brexit raises the stakes for both sides of that quarrel. Already unnerved by Scottish fissures in the union, some loyalists, including paramilitaries, have warned of a backlash over Johnson\u2019s \u201cbetrayal bill\u201d, raising the spectre of disruption at Larne and other ports. Kyle, the PUP councillor, played down such a prospect. \u201cPast experience tells us civil disobedience peters out and is not effective at bringing about change. The best options are to be involved in serious negotiations with Westminster and Dublin to see how potential problems can be ameliorated.\u201d For nationalists who yearn for a united Ireland the omens are mixed. Nationalist MPs \u2013 two SDLP, seven Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 for the first time outnumber unionist MPs. Opinion polls suggest a conceivable majority for unification, a sentiment likely to harden if Brexit inflicts serious damage. \u201cThis election has left Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s calls for a border poll bolstered, particularly amidst renewed calls in Scotland for another referendum,\u201d said Marisa McGlinchey, an assistant politics professor at Coventry University who studies Irish nationalism. Others dispute that, saying a 22% vote share and downward trend weakens Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s hand. \u201cThe narrative of unstoppable forward progress has been badly weakened,\u201d said Whyte. \u201cTheir border poll idea is now dead,\u201d wrote Mick Fealty, political editor of the political blog Slugger O\u2019Toole. The big debate about Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status lies in the future. For the next few weeks, at least, focus will be on the politicians driving up the mile-long drive of red-twigged lime trees to the grand, abandoned parliament building to see if they can banish the cobwebs.",

All the male candidates chose to offer a gift, while the two women on stage \u2013 <strong>Elizabeth Warren </strong>and <strong>Amy Klobuchar </strong>\u2013 sought forgiveness for getting \u201cworked up\u201d talking about important issues.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Sarah Sanders</strong>, <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s former press secretary, sent a tweet mocking <strong>Joe Biden </strong>for his history of stuttering. The former vice president said during the debate that children have approached him while on the campaign trail asking for help with speaking, imitating his own past stutter. Sanders later apologized and deleted the tweet.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for following the Guardian\u2019s live coverage, and tune in next month when the blog covers the seventh debate in Des Moines, Iowa.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T05:18:49.365Z\">at 5.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfc54f38f087e8308e61860\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T05:01:04.160Z\">5.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, the governor of California, interestingly defended <strong>Pete Buttigieg </strong>for hosting a fundraiser at a wine cellar in Napa Valley.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kronayne/status/1207881469613314049\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GavinNewsom</a> on the now infamous wine cave: \"There are literally hundreds of Democrats that have been in that same cave.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight. Here are some of the biggest moments from the sixth Democratic presidential debate: Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg clashed over fundraising practices, as Warren accused Buttigieg of being in the pocket of big-dollar donors. \u201cBillionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States,\u201d Warren said, referring to Buttigieg\u2019s recent fundraiser at a wine cellar in Napa valley. Amy Klobuchar also criticized Buttigieg for his relative lack of experience, so the Indiana mayor who has surged to the top of the polls in Iowa took incoming fire from multiple sides. The debate on the whole was more contentious than the other recent match-ups, with candidates likely feeling pressure to capture viewers\u2019 attention less than two months before voters start heading to the polls. The candidates defended the House\u2019s decision yesterday to impeach Trump, arguing the president\u2019s \u201ccorrupt\u201d actions had made the vote necessary. A gender divide emerged on the final debate question, when candidates were asked whether they wanted to seek forgiveness for something or offer a gift. All the male candidates chose to offer a gift, while the two women on stage \u2013 Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 sought forgiveness for getting \u201cworked up\u201d talking about important issues. Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, sent a tweet mocking Joe Biden for his history of stuttering. The former vice president said during the debate that children have approached him while on the campaign trail asking for help with speaking, imitating his own past stutter. Sanders later apologized and deleted the tweet. Thanks for following the Guardian\u2019s live coverage, and tune in next month when the blog covers the seventh debate in Des Moines, Iowa. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, interestingly defended Pete Buttigieg for hosting a fundraiser at a wine cellar in Napa Valley. Newsom, who endorsed Kamala Harris\u2019 White House bid before she dropped out of the race, grew a multimillion business from a wine shop he started in San Francisco. The homepages of three major US newspapers are currently highlighting the contentious nature of tonight\u2019s debate, specifically noting candidates\u2019 attacks on Pete Buttigieg. Here are the current homepage headlines: New York Times: \u201cDemocratic Candidates Go on the Attack, and Buttigieg Is the Target.\u201d Wall Street Journal: \u201cPete Buttigieg, Strong in Iowa, Comes Under Attack From Democratic Rivals.\u201d Washington Post: \u201cCandidates spar on donors, health care, political experience.\u201d Joe Biden is receiving some praise for his debate performance. From a conservative blogger: But commentators were quick to note Biden had the advantage of lowered expectations, considering his less-than-stellar performances at past debates. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t flawless, but he kept things on the rails, had flashes of good humor, and was deft with tough moments he could see approaching, including about his age,\u201d Aaron Blakes writes for the Washington Post. Amy Klobuchar continued her attacks on Pete Buttigieg\u2019s experience level after leaving the debate stage, arguing a woman with his resume would not be in the same favorable polling position that he is. The final count is in, and Bernie Sanders spoke more than any other candidate on the debate stage, followed closely by Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. But despite the smaller debate stage, there were still large differences in candidates\u2019 speaking times. For example, Sanders spoke nearly twice as much as Andrew Yang. Pete Buttigieg was asked about the gender divide on the final debate question, when candidates were asked whether they wanted to ask for forgiveness for something or offer a gift. All of the male candidates chose to offer a gift, while the two women on stage \u2013 Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 asked for forgiveness for getting \u201cworked up\u201d talking about important issues. \u201cNo woman should ever have to apologize for being fired up,\u201d Buttigieg said. The Indiana mayor noted male candidates would likely be questioned if they did not get \u201cworked up\u201d talking about the issues, calling the double standard \u201cone of the many effects of sexism in our politics\u201d. Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, has deleted her tweet mocking Joe Biden for stuttering, claiming she did not know of his history with the condition. After Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, mocked Joe Biden for his history of stuttering, this video from August started recirculating on Twitter. Biden\u2019s history of stuttering came up during the debate because he was talking about the children who approach him while on the campaign trail and ask for his help because they also have the condition. In the Los Angeles spin room, surrogates for Bernie Sanders are wearing shirts that read PetesWineCave.com. The website, which refers to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s recent fundraiser at a wine cellar in Napa Valley, redirects to a donations page for Sanders\u2019 campaign. Buttigieg sparred with Elizabeth Warren tonight over his fundraising practices. \u201cBillionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States,\u201d Warren said. Many debate viewers noted the gender divide that emerged as candidates answered the final debate question. PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff asked the candidates whether they wanted to ask their opponents for forgiveness for anything or offer them a gift. Both of the women on stage \u2013 Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 asked for forgiveness for getting too \u201cworked up\u201d about important issues, while the men offered gifts ranging from the books they\u2019ve written to their entire candidacies. This gender split did not go unnoticed by Twitter commentators, many of whom argued it reflected the double standards that women are held to in the race. Joe Biden has reacted to Sarah Sanders mocking his history of stuttering, suggesting Trump\u2019s former press secretary should look up the definition of empathy. Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, dubiously argued her tweet about Joe Biden, which begins \u201cI I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave,\u201d was not meant to make fun of his stuttering. In light of Sarah Sanders\u2019 cruel tweet about Joe Biden\u2019s history with stuttering, it\u2019s worth revisiting this recent Atlantic story on the topic. The magazine\u2019s John Hendrickson, who also struggled with stuttering, writes: Maybe you\u2019ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden\u2019s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters\u2014if slightly\u2014on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I\u2019ve just heard. \u2018I want to ask you, as, you know, a \u2026 stutterer to, uh, to a \u2026 stutterer. When you were \u2026 talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to \u2026 my ear, my eye \u2026 did you have \u2026 trouble on s? Or on \u2026 m?\u2019 Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. \u2018But, you know, I haven\u2019t stuttered in so long that it\u2019s hhhhard for me to remember the specific\u2014\u2019 He pauses. \u2018What I do remember is the feeling.\u2019 The sixth Democratic debate has concluded, but the Guardian team will have more analysis coming up. Candidates are still delivering their closing statements, but much of the conversation on Twitter has turned to this shocking tweet from Trump\u2019s former press secretary, Sarah Sanders. The tweet is a reference to Joe Biden\u2019s answer moments ago about meeting children who struggle with stuttering, which he also suffered from when he was young. Biden demonstrated what a stutter sounds like to emphasize his point, prompting this cruel joke from Trump\u2019s former adviser. Biden\u2019s rapid response director quickly reacted to Sanders\u2019 tweet: The debate has moved on to closing statements, and each candidate will get 60 seconds to deliver final remarks. Tom Steyer pledged to \u201cbreak the corporate stranglehold\u201d and tackle climate change as president. Andrew Yang opened his closing statement with a joke about his outsider status. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, America: How am I still on this stage with them?\u201d The debate has hit its last commercial break, and candidates will soon make their one-minute closing statements. The other candidates seem to be taking the \u201cforgiveness or gift\u201d question to make a larger pitch for their candidacies. Pete Buttigieg talked about the need to defeat Trump, and Elizabeth Warren asked forgiveness for getting \u201cworked up\u201d about the important issues she hears about from voters. Joe Biden echoed Warren\u2019s point about how many people he has met during his campaign who need help. Interestingly, the former vice president talked about children he\u2019s met who have told them about their issues with stuttering, which he also struggled with as a child. Biden actually made a point to demonstrate a stutter on stage, which is noteworthy considering he makes a point to emphasize he has recovered from the condition. The debate has reached its final question, and it\u2019s ... a pretty weird one, to be honest. PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff asked the candidates if there was anything they would like to ask forgiveness for from one of their opponents or if they would like to offer them a gift. The answers started with Andrew Yang, who was clearly baffled. He ended up joking that he was grateful Elizabeth Warren had started reading his book, and he offered to send it to the other candidates. Amy Klobuchar said Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care fight was actually with the many Americans who don\u2019t support Medicare for All. The moderators then tried to move on, but Sanders interjected to try to take back the floor with a joke: \u201cShe took my name in vain.\u201d The debate has turned to the issue of health care, much later than it has come up in previous debates. Bernie Sanders refused to say whether he would pursue more modest proposals than Medicare for All if Congress could not approve a single-payer system. Sanders and Joe Biden, who has proposed a public option rather than Medicare for All, then clashed over what was realistic to expect in terms of passing health care bills. PBS Newshour\u2019s Amna Nawaz asked Joe Biden about what he knew of the US military\u2019s difficulties in Afghanistan, referring to the recent revelation from the Washington Post that government officials were aware the troop surge there was not working. Biden said he argued against the surge in Afghanistan, putting him at odds with Barack Obama and senior Pentagon officials. The comment surprised some debate viewers, but a former senior adviser to Obama confirmed Biden\u2019s stance. PBS NewsHour\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor asked the candidates how they would address violence against transgender women of color. Bernie Sanders said the country needed \u201cmoral leadership in the White House to protect the transgender community,\u201d specifically touching on the need to guarantee access to health care. \u201cThe transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible,\u201d said Elizabeth Warren. She pledged that, as president, she would go to the Rose Garden every year and read the names of transgender women and people of color who have been killed. PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff just asked Amy Klobuchar a question that any eventual nominee will have to face: how will you enact your agenda with so many Trump-appointed judges on the bench? Klobuchar pledged to appoint judges in the vein of liberal Supreme Court justices, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Amy Klobuchar has repeatedly criticized Pete Buttigieg tonight, a fight that seems to have been inevitable to many. In response to criticism from Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg defended his electability by pointing to his mayoral victories in South Bend, Indiana. \u201cTry building a coalition to win re-election with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence\u2019s Indiana,\u201d Buttigieg said, referring to the vice president\u2019s previous role as the governor of Indiana. Senator Amy Klobuchar got in a dig at Pete Buttigieg, touting her accomplishments in the Senate to highlight his relative lack of experience. Buttigieg responded by highlighting his experience as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. \u201cI certainly respect your military experience,\u201d Klobuchar said. But she added, \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d The Minnesota senator went on to say she had a proven track record of winning over Midwestern voters, which would help Democrats win back the White House. While the debate turned to discussions of human rights violations in China the detention of Uigher people in Xinjiang, CNN international correspondent Will Ripley reported that the CNN live feed of the debate went dark in Beijing. Chinese officials have previously said that reports that the country is holding more than a million people from the country\u2019s Muslim minority population in detention camps are \u201cfake news\u201d, insisting that the camps are \u201ceducation and training centres\u201d. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s dig at Pete Buttigieg, who recently hosted a luxurious fundraiser at a Napa winery, had to be the best mom joke of the night. \u201cI\u2019ve never even been to a wine cave,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have been to a wind cave,\u201d an apparent reference the South Dakota national park. Twitter was swift to react. By the way, here is a picture of that Napa wine cave where Pete Buttigieg recently held a campaign fundraiser, for which he was just criticized by Elizabeth Warren. There\u2019s still plenty of time left in the Democratic debate, but it\u2019s already clear the night has become more contentious than any of the other recent debates. Bernie Sanders was not willing to let a fundraising argument go by without getting in a dig at Joe Biden, darkly joking the former vice president and Pete Buttigieg are in a contest to be funded by the most billionaires. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigeig engaged in a protracted back and forth about their fundraising tactics, which they have clashed over in recent weeks. Warren criticized Buttigieg for his recent fundraiser at a private Napa winery. \u201cBillionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States,\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg replied by noting he was the least wealthy candidate on stage and was willing to receive contributions from anyone who wanted to defeat Trump. The moderators then interjected to bring in additional candidates, turning to Amy Klobuchar, who said she wasn\u2019t here to listen to Buttigieg and Warren argue. \u201cI have never even been to a wine cave,\u201d Klobuchar joked. Asked about the fact that she would be the oldest president ever inaugurated, Elizabeth Warren delivered one of the biggest lines of the night yet. \u201cI\u2019d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said to much applause. Asked about Barack Obama\u2019s comment on \u201cold men\u201d not \u201cgetting out of the way\u201d, Joe Biden joked that his former boss was not referring to him. Biden was then asked whether he would only serve one term if elected, as some reports have indicated. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not willing to commit one way or another,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m running for one term, and let\u2019s see where we are. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Candidates were asked about Barack Obama\u2019s recent comment that many of the world\u2019s problems stem from \u201cold people, usually old men, not getting out of the way\u201d. Asked for a response, Bernie Sanders said, \u201cThe issue is where power resides in America.\u201d The Vermont senator warned the United States was turning into an \u201coligarchy\u201d with only billionaires benefiting. But on the issue of \u201cold men ... getting out of the way\u201d, Sanders didn\u2019t seem to directly answer the question. The sixth Democratic debate just wrapped up its first hour, and here\u2019s where things stand so far: The candidates defended the House\u2019s decision to impeach Trump, arguing the president\u2019s \u201ccorrupt\u201d actions necessitated the historic vote. Meanwhile, the president continues to tweet attacks at House Democratic leadership, complaining about their threat to withhold the articles of impeachment from the Senate in order to gain influence over the trial procedures. Asked about being the only candidate of color on stage, Andrew Yang offered a detailed answer about the structural challenges that Latinos and African Americans face in America, arguing his proposed universal basic income would help to address those issues. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. A number of debate viewers noted Tom Steyer\u2019s odd use of the word \u201cfrenemy\u201d to desribe America\u2019s relationship with China. But it actually wasn\u2019t the first time that the billionaire activist has used the term in a debate. During the October debate, Steyer said of climate change, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.\u201d Moments ago, PBS Newshour\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor asked Amy Klobuchar about what she would say to the white Americans who are nervous about becoming a racial minority. But the Minnesota senator offered a muddled reponse to Alcindor\u2019s question. As the Democratic presidential debate continues, Trump is keeping up his attacks on the House Democrats who just impeached him. The president claimed House Democratic leadership does not want to advance the articles of impeachment to a Senate trial because they\u2019re afraid to have Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee chairman, or the whistleblower testify. However, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell would be in charge of deciding which witnesses were called to testify, and it\u2019s unclear whether he would comply with Trump\u2019s requests. Joe Biden was asked why the Obama administration was unable to close Guantanamo Bay, which was a campaign promise of Barack Obama\u2019s. The former vice president blamed Congress for being unable to close the military prison, which he called \u201can advertisement for creating terror.\u201d Andrew Yang, who is putting on a strong show tonight, is also enjoying a flourishing bromance with Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino), after the Democrat scored Glover\u2019s endorsement earlier this week. Ahead of the debate, the Yang campaign announced the multi-talented Glover would be joining in a creative consultancy role. Glover has immense sway with young voters \u2013 and the pair are certainly employing a millennial-friendly approach to the endorsement. The two hosted a pop-up event in LA on Thursday afternoon, where Glover-designed merchandise was sold (which featured an ornate \u201c46\u201d design, a reference to the 2020 election being for the 46th presidency). Videos showcasing the long line of fans and supporters were posted on social media. Yang and Glover were spotted hanging out at the highly attended event. We\u2019re preemptively coining this new relationship \u201cDondrew\u201d. When Bernie Sanders was asked about the whiteness of tonight\u2019s debate stage, he tried to pivot to an earlier question about climate change. Moderator Amna Nawaz then interjected, \u201cSenator, with all due respect, this question is about race. Can you get back to the question at hand?\u201d This prompted some applause from the audience. Andrew Yang was asked about being the only candidate of color on stage tonight, following the withdrawal of Kamala Harris and other candidates\u2019 failure to qualify. \u201cIt\u2019s both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI miss Kamala, I miss Cory,\u201d he said, referring to Senator Cory Booker. Yang added, \u201cAlthough I think Cory will be back.\u201d Yang went on to cite some of the statistics reflecting the structural challenges that Latinos and African Americans face in the United States, arguing his proposed universal basic income would help address those issues. After Elizabeth Warren spoke about the need to build an economy that works for everyone, Amy Klobuchar responded by emphasizing the need to beat Trump next year. \u201cThe way we tackle corruption is by winning big in this election,\u201d said Klobuchar, who has pitched herself as the candidate best suited to winning over voters in states that backed Trump in 2016. On the subject of climate change, Klobuchar emphasized that it wasn\u2019t only coastal regions seeing its effects. She said her home state of Minnesota has also suffered flooding because of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s not flyover country to me,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI live there.\u201d Which candidate spoke the least before the first commercial break? That would be the leader in national polls, Joe Biden. The conversation has turned to climate change, and the candidates have criticized Trump for not addressing the crisis and for pulling the United States out of the Paris agreement. But Tom Steyer interestingly used his answer to criticize Pete Buttigieg, calling on the Indiana mayor to prioritize climate change in his campaign platform. \u201cThis is not theoretical to me,\u201d Buttigieg responded, going on to say his South Bend neighborhood had recently flooded. \u201cI insist that we act.\u201d Just before the commercial break, Pete Buttigieg used an answer on the economy to draw a contrast between himself and more progressive candidates like Elizabeth Warren, with whom he has clashed in recent weeks. The debate is taking a two-minute commercial break. So far, the discussion has focused on impeachment and the economy. But it\u2019s already notable how the smaller stage has allowed each candidate to talk more. Tom Steyer has already spoken at least twice, compared to zero times in the first half-hour of the November debate. Asked by PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff about critics who say her tax increases would stifle the economy, Elizabeth Warren said, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just wrong,\u201d prompting applause from the audience. Warren went on to make an argument for her wealth tax, saying it would result in a fairer economy. Elizabeth Warren argued the success of the US economy was not being shared with everyday Americans. The Massachusetts senator said the economy was working for the \u201cwealthy and well connected but no one else\u201d. Bernie Sanders echoed that message, pledging to create an economy that \u201cworks for working families, not just the 1%\u201d. Judy Woodruff posed a question to Bernie Sanders about the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which the House passed earlier today. Sanders, who has been generally skeptical of trade agreements in the past, ackowledged that the deal was a \u201cmodest improvement over what we have right now\u201d, referring to NAFTA. But the Vermont senator said the agreement did not address key issues such as outsourcing and so he would not be voting in favor of it. Senator Amy Klobuchar agreed that there were some issues with the deal, but she said it would improve the lives of America\u2019s farmers, so she will be voting in favor of the deal. Pete Buttigieg used a question about impeachment to offer a broader justification for his candidacy, pledging to \u201cchange the course of this nation for the better\u201d. There was then an odd moment where Judy Woodruff turned to \u201cMr Yang\u201d but actually directed a question to Tom Steyer. Andrew Yang responded by clapping his hands to indicate he was on the other end of the debate stage, but Woodruff quickly corrected herself and directed the impeachment question to Steyer, who noted he started the \u201cNeed to Impeach\u201d group shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Answering a question about Trump\u2019s impeachment, Elizabeth Warren called him \u201cthe most corrupt president in living history.\u201d The Massachusetts senator noted Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington and said the president \u201cbroke that promise\u201d by overseeing a corrupt administration. Amy Klobuchar, who like Warren would be a juror in an eventual Senate impeachment trial, said Trump had initiated \u201ca global Watergate\u201d in his actions toward Ukraine and argued he was afraid to let his advisers testify, indicating his guilt. The first debate question is (unsurprisingly) about yesterday\u2019s impeachment of Donald Trump and is being broadly posed to all seven candidates. PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff asked the candidates how they would move the country forward considering the impeachment vote fell almost exactly along party lines. Joe Biden called the impeachment vote a \u201cconstitutional necessity\u201d and promised to \u201crestore the integrity of the presidency.\u201d Bernie Sanders then called Trump a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d repeating a line he has used before at past debates. The Vermont senator, who would be a juror in the president\u2019s impeachment trial, pledged to \u201cmake the case\u201d against giving Trump a second term. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett is in Los Angeles and has been speaking with voters ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. Here\u2019s what they had to say about the respective candidates ... The sixth Democratic debate is officially underway, and seven candidates will now face off the day after the impeachment of Donald Trump. The moderators of tonight\u2019s debate are Judy Woodruff, Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour and Politico\u2019s Tim Alberta. Candidates will have 1 minute and 15 seconds to respond to questions from moderators and 45 seconds for rebuttals and follow-ups. The candidates will be allowed one minute to deliver closing statements, but there will be no opening statements, so it\u2019s likely the candidates will use the first question (no matter what it is) to make their broad arguments for why they should be president. Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren have been clashing for weeks over the appropriateness of big campaign donors and transparency. Warren has honed in on Buttigieg\u2019s work at the consulting group McKinsey, asking him to release his client list (he eventually did). Buttigieg hit back by asking her to release her tax returns from the years she worked as a legal consultant for corporate clients (she disclosed how much those clients paid her). He also called \u201cevasive\u201d on her plans to pay for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d, while Warren pushed back on settling for small shifts over systematic change, asserting she was fighting for Medicare for all because Warren it\u2019s \u201cthe gold standard\u201d of health care. It will be interesting to see how the Harvard grad and the former Harvard professor will interact with each other on stage. The sixth Democratic presidential debate is less than ten minutes away, so here is how you can watch tonight\u2019s event. The debate is hosted by PBS Newshour and Politico and will be broadcast live on PBS stations, as well as CNN. It can also be streamed on all three of the outlets\u2019 websites. And (of course) keep an eye on the Guardian live blog to get updates and analysis from our team. Among those missing from today\u2019s date stage is Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this month. It will be interesting to see how debate dynamics shift in her absence. Harris was, after all, an outsize presence on stage. She was known for her prosecutorial debate style and even fashioned herself as the best candidate to \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against Donald Trump. Though Harris\u2019 campaign faced many setbacks, including lagging support among progressives, many regretted losing her perspective in the presidential race, which has gotten markedly whiter in her absence. Critics have said that primarily candidates of color have been overlooked. This dynamic played out at the last Democratic debate, when Joe Biden said he had the support of the only black woman elected to the senate, referring to Carol Moseley Braun. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d Harris shot back. Former US representative Joe Sestak and former Montana governor Steve Bullock also suspended their campaigns since the last debate. There\u2019s a lot of news coming out of Washington as the Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate in Los Angeles. Politico is reporting that Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff who infamously admitted to a quid pro quo in the Ukraine controversy before subsequently denying it, intends to step down after the Senate impeachment trial. Politico reports: Trump allies and White House aides, who have been nudging the president in recent weeks to find a new leader for the team as it delves into a crucial reelection campaign, have been circulating lists of potential replacements for weeks. Mulvaney no longer wields much control over White House staff. Lately, he has been left out of major personnel and policy decisions, and he is not driving the strategy on impeachment even though he occupies what is historically the most powerful job in the West Wing. \u2018He is there. I\u2019ll leave it at that,\u2019 said a Republican close to the White House when asked about Mulvaney\u2019s status. \u2018He\u2019s like a kid. His role at the dinner table is to be seen and not heard.\u2019 In the lead up to today\u2019s debate, the billionaire candidates spent significant money on TV ads in California. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who made a late entrance into the race last month, spent roughly $13.5m on ads airing in the state in recent weeks, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that monitors political ads. Bloomberg has flooded the LA area with his ads in particular, though he did not qualify for tonight\u2019s debate. Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist who also remained low in the polls, spent roughly $1.6m on California TV ads, starting earlier this month. Advertising Analytics said no other Democratic candidate has bought TV ads in the state so far. Other candidates have, however, spent money on digital ads in California, according to Anna Massoglia, a researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics. In the past 90 days, Steyer\u2019s campaign spent the most on Facebook ads targeted in California at $1.2m, she said. During that period, Bloomberg spent more than $650,000 on Facebook in California, and the campaign of Pete Buttigieg spent $250,000 on the social media site in the state. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign spent roughly $210,000 on Facebook ads in California. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary and a 2020 candidate who did not qualify for the debate, was in LA yesterday to talk with homeless advocates. When the Guardian asked him about his billionaire rivals spending millions on ads, he said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in this election cycle is that, too often times in politics, money still talks. People can basically buy their way onto the debate stage ... We need to get to a time in this country where money doesn\u2019t talk the same way that it does today.\u201d Trump is proving what a hard time the Democratic presidential candidates will have tonight as they try to make their voices heard over the noise of the president\u2019s impeachment. Trump just tweeted his frustration that Nancy Pelosi has threatened to hold back the articles of impeachment from the Senate in the hope of gaining leverage over majority leader Mitch McConnell, who will be in charge of determining the procedures of the trial to decide whether to remove the president from office. The Republican-controlled Senate is virtually guaranteed to acquit Trump, but a delay in the trial could complicate the president\u2019s efforts to convey the House\u2019s decision to impeach as a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Although it\u2019s not clear what timeline Pelosi will pursue to advance the articles of impeachment, it\u2019s clear that the House speaker\u2019s ruminations are getting under Trump\u2019s skin. Only seven candidates will participate in today\u2019s debate \u2013 the smallest number so far. To qualify for a spot on the stage, candidates had to prove that they had received contributions from at least 200,000 unique donors and meet one of two polling requirements. They either had to poll at higher than 6% in two polls in the four early nominating states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina) or they had to poll at 4% or higher in four polls of early nominating states or four national surveys. Neither Cory Booker nor Juli\u00e1n Castro qualified \u2013 leaving Andrew Yang as the only non-white candidate participating tonight. The Democratic National Committee has intentionally made it progressively more difficult for candidates to participate in the debates. When Booker, Castro and all seven qualifying candidates sent the DNC a letter asking them to alter the requirements for upcoming debates in January in February, the committee pushed back. \u201cThe DNC will not change the threshold for any one candidate and will not revert back to two consecutive nights with more than a dozen candidates,\u201d the organization said in a statement to Politico. The sixth Democratic presidential debate is about a half an hour away, so it\u2019s time to reintroduce the candidates who will be on stage tonight. Here they are in in terms of their proximity to center stage, which was determined by recent polling: Joe Biden, the former vice president who has maintained his lead in the race despite a number of gaffes and efforts by Trump\u2019s allies to have Ukraine investigate baseless corruption claims against him. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has centered her campaign around \u201cbig, structural change\u201d but has faced pushback over the specifics of her Medicare for All proposal. Bernie Sanders, the self-declared democratic socialist who has maintained a strong position in polls despite competing with Warren, a fellow progressive senator from the Northeast. Pete Buttigieg, the moderate and millennial mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has won over voters in the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire but has struggled to recreate the same level of success elsewhere. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has pitched herself as the best candidate to win over Midwestern voters but has so far failed to break into the top-polling tier of contenders. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur who has attracted supporters with his campaign promise of universal basic income and will surprisingly be the only non-white candidate on stage tonight. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist whose campaign has been buoyed by the many ads he has bought in recent months, a strategy that has prompted criticism from some of his opponents. Those seven candidates will take the stage in about 30 minutes, so stay tuned. Celebrity endorsements can bring a big boost to a candidate\u2019s campaign, especially when it comes to younger voters. Surprisingly, Joe Biden has failed to rack up hefty endorsements from the Hollywood elite, despite his popularity in the polls \u2013 although he\u2019s scored the backing of Game of Thrones author George RR Martin. FEC filings show Pete Buttigeg has received a surprisingly high number of celebrity donations. In November, reports revealed the actor Jennifer Aniston, the TV show creator Ryan Murphy, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, actor Mandy Moore, and luxury designer Tom Ford all donated money to the Indiana politician. Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has struck a chord with younger entertainers. Rapper Cardi B has been an ardent campaigner for the Vermont senator, even sitting down for a one-on-one discussion about issues relevant to her and her fans \u2013 many of whom belong to marginalized, lower-income communities. Pop star Ariana Grande recently met Sanders backstage after one of her concerts, thanking him \u201cfor all that you stand for\u201d in a tweet to her 68 million followers. Corey Booker has a major endorsement from actor Rosario Dawson \u2013 who is also his girlfriend. Andrew Yang has received co-signs from Tesla founder Elon Musk, musician/actor Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino), Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and teen heartthrob Noah Centino. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren has received support from Queer Eye star Johnathan Van Ness, who shared how Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare For All\u201d plan won him over after he lost his HIV medication and had to pay $3,500 for a replacement. Bad Feminist writer Roxane Gay and actor Chlo\u00eb Sevigny have also voiced their support for the senator. At this historic moment ... A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: The president of the United States has been impeached. Let\u2019s remind ourselves just what is at stake. To quote from the articles of impeachment: \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office.\u201d There has never been a more urgent demonstration of the need for an independent press in the US. With your support, we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. At a time when both media and politics are scarred by polarization, the Guardian remains an independent voice. Freed from the influence of an owner or shareholders, our independence is our unique driving force and guiding principle. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Joe Biden will be at center stage tonight, as the former vice president maintains his lead in the polls despite a number of gaffes and attacks from Trump and his allies. A new CNN poll released today showed Biden leading the primary with the support of 26% of Democratic voters, while Bernie Sanders came in second at 20%. Despite the many developments in the race in recent weeks, including candidates entering and exiting the field, it\u2019s worth noting Biden and Sanders have remained in the top-polling tier of candidates since the beginning of this year. One of the names missing from the list of debate participants: Tulsi Gabbard. The Hawaii congresswoman didn\u2019t meet the qualifications for today\u2019s debate, but she said she wouldn\u2019t have participated even if she had qualified. Gabbard and her campaign have repeatedly expressed the disdain for the debates, which she has referred to as \u201cso-called debates\u201d and nothing more than \u201ccommercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than to inform or enlighten\u201d. If she were on stage today, she would surely face questions about her decision to vote \u201cpresent\u201d in yesterday\u2019s impeachment hearing, and her desire to formally censure Donald Trump rather than remove him from office. Gabbard is instead attending \u201cAn evening with Tulsi and Friends\u201d at The Rex Theater in Manchester, New Hampshire tonight. Today\u2019s debate comes after a spate of mass shootings in California this fall. At the end of October two Hallween parties \u2013 one in Long Beach and the other in Orinda, a small town in the Bay Area \u2013 ended in tragedy within a day of each other. A total of eight people were killed, and 14 others were injured. Almost two weeks later, the state was rocked by three more shootings within a space of four days, leaving 10 people dead at a Santa Clarita high school and at homes in Fresno and San Diego. California is known for its strict gun laws including an assault weapons ban passed in 1989 and a Gun Violence Restraining order, also known as a \u2018red flag\u2019 law passed in 2014. This policy allows people to petition judges to get firearms temporarily taken from people who pose a threat to themselves or others. Still, some lawmakers are calling on other states and the federal government to follow California\u2019s lead and pass laws that could reduce the number of guns and gun violence across the US. This week, the US Congress allocated $25m to the Center for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health for gun violence research. This is the first allotment of this kind in more than 20 years. Gun control has been a recurrent theme in the Democratic debates so far and could feature prominently on tonight\u2019s stage. Each of the candidates in tonight\u2019s debate support \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun laws including universal background checks and a stronger licensing system. Still there are some divergences within the Democratic field. Bernie Sanders believes that individual states should determine their own gun control laws, with the exception of a federal background check and assault weapons ban. Elizabeth Warren wants to raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms and mandate reporting on multiple gun purchases. Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang, the only candidates who\u2019ve never held public office advocate for similar \u201ccommon sense\u201d laws and Steyer is also calling on the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide more violence intervention programs. Yang wants to increase funding for suicide prevention, particularly among veterans. In addition to the aforementioned common sense laws, Pete Buttigieg wants to require people to report missing or stolen firearms. Finally, Joe Biden hopes to establish a task force that looks at and addresses combination of online harassment, extremism, and violence. Tonight\u2019s debate almost didn\u2019t happen because of a labor dispute that prompted the presidential candidates to threaten a boycott of the event. The debate was originally scheduled to take place at the Univesity of California, Los Angeles, but the candidates raised objections over going to the campus while the school is locked in conflict with a union representing more than 25,000 workers. So the event was moved to the nearby Loyola Marymount University, but then contract negotiations between the school\u2019s unionized food-service workers and the company Sodexo stalled last week. Every Democratic candidate who had qualified for the debate said they would not cross the picket line while negotiations were stalled, but the dispute was settled earlier this week, clearing the way for tonight\u2019s event. Even though the unionized workers and Sodexo reached an agreement, it seems virtually certain that the issue of labor rights will be raised during tonight\u2019s debate. The debate is taking place in Los Angeles, a city where the escalating homeless crisis has become a public health emergency. LA experienced a 16% increase in homelessness this year, with a total of 36,000 people now homeless across the city, including 27,000 without shelter. The homelessness crisis has also made the state a frequent target of Donald Trump. At one point earlier this year, the president openly complained about homeless people taking up space on the \u201cbest highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings \u2026 where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige\u201d. In recent months, the Trump administration has repeatedly hinted he wants to pursue a police crackdown on homeless people living on the streets of LA and San Francisco, sparking fear and anger from advocates. Although Democrats in the state have positioned themselves as leaders of the resistance to Trump, on the subject of homelessness, California liberals have often pursued similar law enforcement solutions even if they avoid using the dehumanizing language of the president. If Trump escalates his political attacks on California over homelessness next year, Democrats may be pressured to push back with policy solutions that don\u2019t focus on criminalization and incarceration. Roughly 25% of homeless people in the US live in California, where a severe affordable housing shortage has led to increased evictions and displacement throughout the state. Counts this year have found massive jumps in the number of homeless people in LA, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and cities across the state. Here\u2019s our latest reporting on Trump\u2019s threats to California and responses from advocacy groups: Those tuning in to watch tonight\u2019s Democratic debate might have a question when the participants take the stage: where did all the candidates of color go? Since the last debate in Atlanta, Senator Kamala Harris has dropped out of the race, and three other candidates of color \u2013 Senator Cory Booker, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 failed to qualify for the LA debate. The only non-white candidate on stage will be tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who qualified on the last possible day to do so with a fourth poll showing him hitting 4%. The difficulties that candidates of color have faced in the race have sparked criticism, even from those candidates themselves. Booker has suggested polling is a poor metric to determine debate participants, and Castro has argued candidates of color are disadvantaged by the mostly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire voting first. Although they won\u2019t be on stage tonight, it seems almost certain that their opponents will be asked about their absence \u2013 and what it means for the Democratic party moving forward. In a state increasingly plagued by rising sea levels, drought, flood, wildfires, the power shutoffs meant to prevent those wildfires, and recent efforts by the Trump administration to upend California\u2019s environmental policies, the climate crisis is at the forefront of many voters minds. Nearly half of Democratic voters ranked climate as their top priority in a poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley \u2013 slightly more than voters nationwide. Every candidate on tonight\u2019s stage has released a climate change action plan, though they vary widely in scale, scope and detail. But if past debates are any indication, they won\u2019t be talking much about those plans. Climate has thus far received little time or attention in the Democratic debates, comprising just one tenth of the question topics. In the most recent debate, Bernie Sanders called the climate crisis \u201cthe existential threat of our time\u201d \u2013 but there was only one question devoted to it. The apparent unwillingness to talk about the climate crisis has become a kind of existential threat to Democratic unity. At a party convention in San Francisco in August, officials resoundingly rejected multiple proposals to hold a climate-focused primary debate, above the passionate protest of party members and climate activists from the youth-led Sunrise Movement. Hello, live blog readers! The sixth Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. E.T., and it will feature a record low number of candidates for this election cycle. Only seven candidates will take the stage: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Those seven candidates will face off at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. Although the Golden State is not one of the four early voting states, its high number of delegates will have a massive impact on the election when Californians head to the polls on March 3, or \u201cSuper Tuesday.\u201d Despite California\u2019s importance in the primary fight, the candidates will be fighting for attention with the spectacle of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. The House voted last night to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making him only the third president in US history to be impeached. Candidates will be looking to make an impression on Democratic primary voters, but will their message break through over the noise of impeachment? We\u2019ll find out in about an hour and a half, so stay tuned.",

      "body": "<p>When Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in October, the Facebook founder and chief executive faced pointed questions about his decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/04/facebook-exempts-political-ads-ban-making-false-claims\">exempt politicians from a policy</a> barring advertisers from promoting false claims \u2013 or to put it another way, his decision to allow politicians to spend money to promote lies.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about helping the politicians,\u201d he told congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. \u201cThis is about making sure that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d</p> <p>Since the 2016 election, during which Facebook allowed candidates to purchase so-called \u201cdark ads\u201d that could only be seen by whatever narrow slice of the electorate they were targeted at, Facebook has promised to provide more transparency by building a political ad archive. If you want to know how your local city council candidates are selling themselves to the electorate on Facebook, you can navigate to a relatively user-friendly site and see exactly what they\u2019re saying.</p> <p>So far, so reasonable, right?</p> <p>Not exactly. Over the past week alone, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has run more than 16,000 different advertisements on Facebook. And that\u2019s just one week, just one candidate, and just Facebook! At any given moment, the Trump campaign will have between 1,000 and 5,000 different ads running simultaneously. If you want to take a peek, head to this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=153080620724\">link</a> and start scrolling. Chances are you\u2019ll give up \u2013 or the page will freeze \u2013 before you get to the bottom.</p> <p>Many of these ads are minor variations on a single theme, targeted at narrow slices of the electorate in ways that are opaque. This lack of transparency reveals the dishonesty in Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that Facebook supports the democratic process by allowing people to \u201csee for themselves what politicians are saying\u201d. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it\u2019s utter bunkum.</p> <p>Calling out Silicon Valley\u2019s deceptions and distortions is something of a Guardian US tradition. Since we opened our west coast bureau in 2016, we\u2019ve worked overtime to expose the gaps between the tech industry\u2019s altruistic rhetoric \u2013 and the reality of how tech companies are reshaping society.

      "bodyText": "When Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in October, the Facebook founder and chief executive faced pointed questions about his decision to exempt politicians from a policy barring advertisers from promoting false claims \u2013 or to put it another way, his decision to allow politicians to spend money to promote lies. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about helping the politicians,\u201d he told congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. \u201cThis is about making sure that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d Since the 2016 election, during which Facebook allowed candidates to purchase so-called \u201cdark ads\u201d that could only be seen by whatever narrow slice of the electorate they were targeted at, Facebook has promised to provide more transparency by building a political ad archive. If you want to know how your local city council candidates are selling themselves to the electorate on Facebook, you can navigate to a relatively user-friendly site and see exactly what they\u2019re saying. So far, so reasonable, right? Not exactly. Over the past week alone, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has run more than 16,000 different advertisements on Facebook. And that\u2019s just one week, just one candidate, and just Facebook! At any given moment, the Trump campaign will have between 1,000 and 5,000 different ads running simultaneously. If you want to take a peek, head to this link and start scrolling. Chances are you\u2019ll give up \u2013 or the page will freeze \u2013 before you get to the bottom. Many of these ads are minor variations on a single theme, targeted at narrow slices of the electorate in ways that are opaque. This lack of transparency reveals the dishonesty in Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that Facebook supports the democratic process by allowing people to \u201csee for themselves what politicians are saying\u201d. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it\u2019s utter bunkum. Calling out Silicon Valley\u2019s deceptions and distortions is something of a Guardian US tradition. Since we opened our west coast bureau in 2016, we\u2019ve worked overtime to expose the gaps between the tech industry\u2019s altruistic rhetoric \u2013 and the reality of how tech companies are reshaping society. We pride ourselves on making sure that Guardian values shape the questions we ask: whose labor went into that billion-dollar valuation? Who is being left out of a company\u2019s rosy picture of the future? What does this mean for privacy? How do decisions made in Menlo Park affect people in Myanmar, Brazil, Hong Kong or the west coast\u2019s numerous homeless encampments? This year, we exposed allegations of wage theft by one of the richest companies in the world, revealed how Amazon was working with police departments to create a vast surveillance system and held social media platforms accountable for amplifying anti-vaccine misinformation \u2013 reporting that inspired action from the congressman Adam Schiff. We tracked extremism and hate from the dark corners of the web to the supposedly sanitized realm of Facebook, reported on the harsh reality of Uber drivers living in their cars as the founders made off with billions, and showed how the boom in \u201ckidfluencers\u201d was enabling exploitation of child labor. Looking ahead to 2020, we\u2019re getting ready to track misinformation and digital campaigning in a momentous election for US politics.

It is clear that Klobuchar has an intense dislike for Buttigieg: she professed herself insulted by his previous comments about the limited value of \u201cWashington experience\u201d, pointing out that Buttigieg had never managed to win a statewide election. Buttigieg, for his part, gave a righteously indignant defense of the significance of small-town America that could have been scripted by Aaron Sorkin.

He defended himself by pointing to his low net worth and saying he was not going to \u201cturn away anyone\u201d from donating. He was ready to take on Warren on the issue, though: Buttigieg pointed out that Warren\u2019s aversion to big money donations was a recent shift, and asked her if she believed she had been corrupted by accepting these donations for her Senate campaign. What should have been a strong moment for Warren was rendered far less effective. Bernie Sanders also brought up campaign finance, pointing out that both Buttigieg and Joe Biden had dozens of billionaire donors. Sanders encouraged them to compete to see who could get the most billionaires. Neither responded.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/19/democratic-debate-2020-los-angeles-warren-sanders-biden\">Democratic debate: Buttigieg becomes target as candidates clash in Los Angeles</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Warren had the best single line of the night. When a moderator informed her she would be the oldest president ever inaugurated, Warren replied: \u201cI\u2019d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated.\u201d Warren is quick-witted at these debates: when the moderators ended on an insipid \u201cnovelty\u201d question (Would you like to ask forgiveness of another candidate or give one a gift?) she suggested the candidates \u201ccould do a labor action and go on strike against this question\u201d. Warren\u2019s performance was strong on the whole, including a moving answer about special-needs education that drew on her own experience as a special ed teacher.</p> \n<p>Andrew Yang, too, was funny and sharp. Yang has often been relegated to the margins in these debates, but the smaller number of candidates at this debate allowed him to distinguish himself with some amusing lines (\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, America: How am I still on the stage with them?\u201d) and his signature universal basic income proposal. Yang had the single best answer on impeachment, encouraging Democrats to \u201cstop being obsessed\u201d over it and correctly encouraging them to \u201cdig in and solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place\u201d. Though Yang is unlikely to get far in the primary, and his knowledge of foreign policy was exposed as thin, having another candidate on stage preoccupied with ordinary people\u2019s economic struggles helps the debates. (Strangely, in response to the final question about \u201cgiving a gift\u201d, he promised to give copies of his book to the other candidates, rather than seizing the obvious opportunity to plug his $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend.)</p> \n<p>Joe Biden was more lucid than usual, and also angrier. He bordered on enraged when talking about how unrealistic Sanders\u2019 Medicare For All plan is, misleadingly citing only the increases in government spending without mentioning the elimination of private insurance payments. Biden had little to say when called out by Sanders about his support for the Iraq war, and when asked about his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/biden-republicans-trump-1321377\">strange belief</a> that he can get Republicans to work with him, Biden simply reiterated his existing position. It is unfortunate that Biden brings more energy to arguing against single-payer healthcare than to any other issue, but he certainly seemed more agile and effective in this debate than in previous ones. (Which is not necessarily saying much.)</p> \n<p>Bernie Sanders was in strong form and made several important points, bringing up both the oppression of Palestinians and the racial justice aspects of climate change. He dealt reasonably well with a confrontational question about his age, arguing that the most important quality in a presidential candidate was whether they would fight for working people of every age, gender, and race. He also gave a forceful defense of universal programs, after Buttigieg repeated his line about not wanting to pay to send rich people\u2019s children to college. When asked about impeachment, Sanders noted that the issue was not just Trump\u2019s ethical violations, but the fact that he \u201ctold working people one thing and ended up doing something else\u201d and the right had \u201csold out the working families of this country\u201d by trying to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Sanders also did something rarely seen in politics: admitting error. When asked about his early support of the war in Afghanistan, Sanders said that Representative Barbara Lee was the only one who voted against it. Lee was right, he said, and Sanders was wrong.</p> \n<p>Tom Steyer\u2019s presence in the debate was not worthy of note. It is a shame that Juli\u00e1n Castro, Cory Booker, and Tulsi Gabbard were not on the stage, since each tends to bring up important issues (immigration, racial justice, and militarism, respectively). The selection procedure for the debate was unfortunate, since Steyer doesn\u2019t poll any better than these other three. Let us hope they return in future exchanges.</p> \n<p>The moderators chose some strange and highly critical questions based on dubious premises. One was based on the idea that Medicare for All would inevitably fail politically, another on the idea that Trump\u2019s economy was working well for people, and another on the suggestion that the worst effects of climate change were unavoidable. Klobuchar was (yet again) given far more time than her dismal polling numbers warrant. The questions\u2019 subjects were not trivial, but it was strange to see no questions about labor issues given that labor politics had <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/17/democratic-debate-labor-fight-086423\">nearly prevented the debate from happening</a>.</p> \n<p>No candidate did poorly, and there was no clear \u201cwinner\u201d. Klobuchar will probably be praised for her performance, and Biden\u2019s supporters will breathe a sigh of relief to see him putting moderately intelligible sentences together. Buttigieg is increasingly revealing himself to be ruthless in combat with the other candidates. Sanders, Warren, and possibly Yang were the only candidates who offered anything resembling a clear and powerful positive agenda for the country, rather than empty rhetoric about \u201cvalues\u201d. Insofar as the three of them seem to care about ordinary people\u2019s struggles, they should be considered the winners of every debate.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs and a Guardian US columnist<br></p></li> \n</ul>",

When a moderator informed her she would be the oldest president ever inaugurated, Warren replied: \u201cI\u2019d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated.\u201d Warren is quick-witted at these debates: when the moderators ended on an insipid \u201cnovelty\u201d question (Would you like to ask forgiveness of another candidate or give one a gift?) she suggested the candidates \u201ccould do a labor action and go on strike against this question\u201d. Warren\u2019s performance was strong on the whole, including a moving answer about special-needs education that drew on her own experience as a special ed teacher. Andrew Yang, too, was funny and sharp. Yang has often been relegated to the margins in these debates, but the smaller number of candidates at this debate allowed him to distinguish himself with some amusing lines (\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, America: How am I still on the stage with them?\u201d) and his signature universal basic income proposal. Yang had the single best answer on impeachment, encouraging Democrats to \u201cstop being obsessed\u201d over it and correctly encouraging them to \u201cdig in and solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place\u201d. Though Yang is unlikely to get far in the primary, and his knowledge of foreign policy was exposed as thin, having another candidate on stage preoccupied with ordinary people\u2019s economic struggles helps the debates. (Strangely, in response to the final question about \u201cgiving a gift\u201d, he promised to give copies of his book to the other candidates, rather than seizing the obvious opportunity to plug his $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend.) Joe Biden was more lucid than usual, and also angrier. He bordered on enraged when talking about how unrealistic Sanders\u2019 Medicare For All plan is, misleadingly citing only the increases in government spending without mentioning the elimination of private insurance payments. Biden had little to say when called out by Sanders about his support for the Iraq war, and when asked about his strange belief that he can get Republicans to work with him, Biden simply reiterated his existing position. It is unfortunate that Biden brings more energy to arguing against single-payer healthcare than to any other issue, but he certainly seemed more agile and effective in this debate than in previous ones. (Which is not necessarily saying much.) Bernie Sanders was in strong form and made several important points, bringing up both the oppression of Palestinians and the racial justice aspects of climate change. He dealt reasonably well with a confrontational question about his age, arguing that the most important quality in a presidential candidate was whether they would fight for working people of every age, gender, and race. He also gave a forceful defense of universal programs, after Buttigieg repeated his line about not wanting to pay to send rich people\u2019s children to college. When asked about impeachment, Sanders noted that the issue was not just Trump\u2019s ethical violations, but the fact that he \u201ctold working people one thing and ended up doing something else\u201d and the right had \u201csold out the working families of this country\u201d by trying to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Sanders also did something rarely seen in politics: admitting error. When asked about his early support of the war in Afghanistan, Sanders said that Representative Barbara Lee was the only one who voted against it. Lee was right, he said, and Sanders was wrong. Tom Steyer\u2019s presence in the debate was not worthy of note. It is a shame that Juli\u00e1n Castro, Cory Booker, and Tulsi Gabbard were not on the stage, since each tends to bring up important issues (immigration, racial justice, and militarism, respectively). The selection procedure for the debate was unfortunate, since Steyer doesn\u2019t poll any better than these other three. Let us hope they return in future exchanges. The moderators chose some strange and highly critical questions based on dubious premises. One was based on the idea that Medicare for All would inevitably fail politically, another on the idea that Trump\u2019s economy was working well for people, and another on the suggestion that the worst effects of climate change were unavoidable. Klobuchar was (yet again) given far more time than her dismal polling numbers warrant. The questions\u2019 subjects were not trivial, but it was strange to see no questions about labor issues given that labor politics had nearly prevented the debate from happening. No candidate did poorly, and there was no clear \u201cwinner\u201d. Klobuchar will probably be praised for her performance, and Biden\u2019s supporters will breathe a sigh of relief to see him putting moderately intelligible sentences together. Buttigieg is increasingly revealing himself to be ruthless in combat with the other candidates. Sanders, Warren, and possibly Yang were the only candidates who offered anything resembling a clear and powerful positive agenda for the country, rather than empty rhetoric about \u201cvalues\u201d. Insofar as the three of them seem to care about ordinary people\u2019s struggles, they should be considered the winners of every debate.

Buttigieg said, \u201cany tool should be on the table\u201d in dealing with China. Billionaire Tom Steyer stressed the need for a relationship with China, which he referred to as a \u201cfrenemy\u201d, to combat the global challenge of climate change. Asked specifically about Chinese military buildup, the former vice-president Joe Biden said China would take 17 years to match the might of the US military, and added that the US should not abide by any human rights abuses on the part of China.

      "bodyText": "A group of protesters known as the Nauru 19 have been sentenced to jail after a highly controversial retrial for charges stemming from a 2015 protest. The long-running prosecution of the group relates to a 2015 demonstration against Nauru government crackdowns on judicial officers and opposition MPs, during which authorities arrested and charged 19 demonstrators. On Thursday, 15 members of the group \u2013 which included former MPs and presidents of Nauru and someone who was a minor at the time of the offence but tried as an adult \u2013 were sentenced by judge Daniel Fatiaki for jail terms of between three and 11 months. The sentences are suspended for 12 months after half the time has been served. Mathew Batsiua, a lead defendant and one of the MPs whose suspension sparked the protest, was sentenced to 18 months for riot, with seven months discounted because of the delay in getting to trial, his personal circumstances and \u201cextrajudicial punishment\u201d in the form of a government-operated blacklist against the group. The remaining members were also given discounted sentences for the same factors, or \u2013 in the case of two defendants \u2013 their young age. Twelve of the 15 remained in Nauru to face the second trial, arriving at court on Thursday for sentencing wearing protest T-shirts and accompanied by family and supporters. They had been held in remand since last week, when they were found guilty of various charges including riot and assault and accessing security-restricted areas, but were acquitted of charges of disturbing the legislature. Australian judge Geoffrey Muecke was contracted to hear the first trial of the members who pleaded not guilty, but after reviewing the case he ordered a permanent stay on the trial, finding the government had gone to such extraordinary and \u201cshameful\u201d lengths to see the demonstrators punished that there was no chance of a fair trial. The Nauru government denies the findings and says it has respected the court process. The Australian government told Guardian Australia it had \u201cmade representations to the government of Nauru on the importance of respect for the rule of law and an independent judiciary\u201d, specifically including the Nauru 19. The most serious charge \u2013 and one of the most contested by critics \u2013 carried a potential penalty of imprisonment with hard labour for life, \u201cwith or without solitary confinement\u201d. Of the other seven members of the group, three had earlier pleaded guilty and four sought asylum overseas. The former Nauruan president Sprent Dabwido sought asylum in Australia for cancer treatment and died earlier this year. The Nauruan director of public prosecutions had submitted to the judge that a custodial sentence was \u201cinevitable\u201d and called for consecutive sentences for the charges of assault and act with intent. This was rejected by Fatiaki. The DPP\u2019s submissions included excerpts from the judgment against the three protesters who pleaded guilty which said the protest was \u201can attack on Nauru\u2019s government structure\u201d. \u201cSuch an attack on parliament could easily have escalated to a total breakdown of the rule of law, which could have escalated into nationwide chaos and social and political instability.\u201d The DPP put forward that several counts were aggravated, claiming the acts of riot were \u201cdeliberate and planned\u201d, acted against police, used weapons such as rocks and fire extinguishers and was \u201caimed to destabilise the democracy and stability of the Republic of Nauru as a nation\u201d. He singled out Batsiua, saying the former MP \u201cshould have controlled his own emotions and controlled the crowd\u201d but \u201cchose not to\u201d. The defendants called for a non-custodial sentence, saying the riot offences were not in the higher range of seriousness and that the court did not need to place substantial weight on protecting the community from the offenders because they had not reoffended since the protest and were \u201crehabilitated and transformed\u201d.",

Fires have been burning in the south-east for months, and all four southern mainland states have already experienced catastrophic fire weather. Smoke has choked our largest city for weeks. Like the Tasmanian fires that started the year, the lack of soil moisture means these fires are tearing through ecosystems that normally don\u2019t burn. Small fires are conflating into megafires, resources are stretched, firefighters are exhausted, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/19/australia-bushfires-20-structures-destroyed-as-nsw-firefighters-hospitalised-with-severe-burns\">750 homes have been lost and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/19/australia-bushfires-20-structures-destroyed-as-nsw-firefighters-hospitalised-with-severe-burns\">six people</a> have already died.

So before the year ends we should pause, remember just how extraordinary it was, and reflect on what this might mean for our future. The year started with a record-breaking heatwave in southern Australia with temperatures in the mid-40s, in some areas for 40 days in a row. Then followed the immolation of vast areas of moist Tasmanian forests, forests that date back to the last ice age. Approximately 3% of the state burned as a long-term trend of less rainfall and more evaporation was capped off by the driest January on record. On the mainland, who could forget those horrifying images of the Menindee fish kills? To our north, Pabuk, the earliest forming tropical storm in the north-west Pacific Ocean on record, smashed into the coastal resorts of Thailand, killing 10 people and causing almost US$160m in damage. While Australia was sweltering, North America was freezing thanks to a disruption of the polar vortex that might, perversely, be linked to the warming of Arctic waters. February brought little climatic relief with Townsville hit by devastating floods and Sydney lashed by storms. March saw fires continue to rage in Victoria, with over 30 homes lost. Meanwhile, Cyclone Idai, one of a record number of Indian Ocean cyclones, swept through south-eastern Africa, killing thousands in what some called the worst weather-related disaster ever to strike the southern hemisphere. Australia was not immune from cyclones, with Trevor and Veronica wreaking billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage. Flooding in Iran claimed at least 70 lives in early April, while cyclones returned to south-eastern Africa, causing another 50 deaths. In late April-early May Cyclone Fani lashed Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, causing 89 deaths, capping off a season of very atypical cyclones likely triggered by uncommonly warm seas. In Hawaii, the Mauna Loa observatory recorded its highest-ever reading of carbon dioxide at 414.8 parts per million, confirming the relentless upward trend. The Guardian adopted a new editorial policy to prefer the term \u201cclimate crisis\u201d. Inspired by a determined teenager from Sweden, hundreds of thousands of students from thousands of towns in hundreds of countries protested for the future of their planet. June saw weeks of rain drown the midwest United States, on top of a near-record tornado season and the wettest 12 months on record. Then hell came to Europe with a widespread heatwave that saw France record its highest ever temperature of 45.9C while climate scientists confirmed the link to climate change. In the US, a month of above-average temperatures baked Alaska and fuelled hundreds of fires. As the tropical storm season started in the Gulf of Mexico in July, Louisiana and Mississippi braced for more floods. Across the Atlantic, Britain boiled while temperature records were also broken in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands during the planet\u2019s hottest month on record. August saw record-low sea ice levels in the Arctic and, as August turned to September, Hurricane Dorian missed Mar-a-Lago but terrorised the Bahamas. There was scarcely time to take a breath before torrential rain submerged entire towns in south-east Spain and Imelda drowned Texas. In response, millions of students once again took to the streets, as Scott Morrison chastised them for needless anxiety and Greta Thunberg \u201cdared\u201d world leaders to ignore them. Rain towards the end of September brought some relief for the devastating fires in the Amazon, and Noaa confirmed the month as the hottest September on record. October saw the fires move north to California, as Europe continued to swelter, parts of Australia choked on dust, and Japan was pounded by the costliest Pacific typhoon in recorded history. In November, a Venetian council rejected action on climate change only to have its council chambers flooded by record high tides, Cyclone Bulbul displaced millions in Bangladesh and India, and heavy rain triggered deadly flooding across central and eastern Africa. In a terrifyingly symbolic bookend to another year of record temperatures, Australia is once again on fire and the country and sweltering through a record-breaking heatwave. Fires have been burning in the south-east for months, and all four southern mainland states have already experienced catastrophic fire weather. Smoke has choked our largest city for weeks. Like the Tasmanian fires that started the year, the lack of soil moisture means these fires are tearing through ecosystems that normally don\u2019t burn. Small fires are conflating into megafires, resources are stretched, firefighters are exhausted, more than 750 homes have been lost and six people have already died. And still our \u201cleaders\u201d refuse to discuss climate change. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia\u2019s record for its hottest day has tumbled for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9C on Wednesday. The catalogue of climatic disasters that have unfolded this year is truly numbing. And a recently published letter by 11,000 scientists warns the climate emergency will only intensify. And yet despite all the scientific evidence, all the destruction, all the suffering, all the apocalyptic predictions, and all the strikes and marches, nothing happens. Global CO2 emissions continue to rise and the world leaders procrastinate. \u2022 Dr Geoff Goldrick is a deputy captain with the NSW Rural Fire Service in Northern NSW",

In a wide-ranging report, the charity added its voice to growing calls for a complete overhaul of gambling regulation in the UK, urging Boris Johnson to follow through on the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto commitment to review it. The RSPH singled out video games and sport as areas of concern, warning that products with gambling-style mechanisms, as well as increasingly subtle marketing tie-ups, allow betting firms to \u201csweep over the safeguards\u201d intended to protect children. Its report raised concerns over video game loot boxes \u2013 where players buy or earn randomised in-game rewards \u2013 and the rise of betting with \u201cskins\u201d, the term for items such as weapons and outfits that can be bought for money. The Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto branded existing gambling legislation, introduced under Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government in 2005, as \u201canalogue law in a digital age\u201d and promised to examine whether to crack down on loot boxes. The RSPH called on the government to introduce legislation to classify such features as gambling, meaning video games developers would have to ditch loot boxes \u2013 a market worth \u00a3700m in the UK alone - or accept age restrictions on certain titles. RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: \u201cYoung people have told us that gambling and gambling-like activity are slowly but surely polluting hobbies and pastimes that have traditionally been beneficial to their wellbeing. Today, the vast majority of young people take part regularly in video-gaming and no doubt many will receive video games as Christmas presents.\u201d She added: \u201cHowever, we, and the young people we\u2019ve spoken to, are concerned at how firmly embedded gambling-type features are in many of these games. The rise of loot boxes and skin betting have seen young people introduced to the same mechanisms that underpin gambling, through an industry that operates unchecked and unregulated on the back alleys of the internet, which young people can access from their bedrooms.\u201d The RSPH cited research, funded by fellow charity GambleAware, that found that two in five young gamers bought loot boxes and that more than half believed video games could induce them to gamble. The youngest survey respondents were most likely to accept gambling-style products as a normal part of gaming. A government spokesperson said: \u201cProblem gambling can devastate lives, which is why we are absolutely committed to protecting young people from gambling-related harm. We have committed to a review of the Gambling Act and take concerns around loot boxes in video games very seriously.\u201d Dr Jo Twist, chief executive of video games body trade body Ukie, said the industry \u201ctakes its responsibility to its players seriously\u201d and that while loot boxes were not classified as gambling, it would engage with the government on a review of regulations. Ukie pointed out that sites that allow players to use skins as a currency to gamble were illegal in the UK without a gambling licence. The intervention from the RSPH echoes a similar call issued this year by MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee. The RSPH report, entitled Skins in the Game, also called for legislation to loosen the bonds between gambling and sport. It said that sports professionals should be barred from endorsing gambling-related activity. Such a change in the law could affect deals such as the tie-up with online casino 32Red that saw England\u2019s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney wear the number 32 shirt at Derby County. It might also preclude a publicity stunt launched by Paddy Power his year, in which it produced hoax Huddersfield Town shirts with a huge version of the company\u2019s logo emblazoned on the front. The report said such deals weakened efforts to protect young people from being influenced by gambling marketing. \u201cThe visibility that they afford means that high-profile sponsorship arrangements between sports clubs and gambling operators can sweep over the safeguards designed to protect children and young people from gambling harms,\u201d the report found. \u201cAt a time where 55,000 children in Great Britain are classed as problem gamblers and we have seen the National Problem Gambling Clinic commission specialist services for 13-25 year olds, the close relationship between the industries is not one that should remain unaddressed.\u201d The RSPH also wants to see legislation banning sports teams from having a betting company as their \u201ctitle sponsor\u201d, which includes firms that have stadium naming rights.

      "body": "<h2>1) Ljungberg was not given the tools to succeed</h2> \n<p>Unless Mikel Arteta decides there really is no time like the present and, without even taking a training session, oversees Arsenal\u2019s visit to Goodison Park from the dugout this will be Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s final match in temporary charge. It is easy to feel some sympathy with Ljungberg given that, throughout his five games so far, he has had to operate with no coaching staff to speak of and little certainty about the length of his tenure. Arsenal had made clear upon Unai Emery\u2019s departure that they would be open to giving Ljungberg a run until the end of the season but failed to equip him with the tools required to show what he could do. Was this meant to be a kind of audition or not? In fairness to the Swede, he has cut a dignified figure throughout the process and stressed he is aware that, in the end, this is all strictly business. Ljungberg will presumably join Arteta\u2019s backroom staff and keep an eye out for future managerial opportunities elsewhere; what a nice touch it would be, though, if one of Arsenal\u2019s most beloved former players could sign off his brief return to the spotlight with a crucial win to set up the new head coach\u2019s reign. <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Everton v Arsenal (Saturday, 12.30pm, all times GMT)</em></p> \n<h2>2) Leicester have chance to go seven clear of Man City</h2> \n<p>The Etihad was where, in February 2016, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t \u2026 could they?\u201d became \u201cThey really, really can\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/06/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester\u2019s 3-1 win</a>, inspired by Riyad Mahrez and the less likely form of Robert Huth, showed their title credentials were deadly serious and Saturday\u2019s fixture offers an excellent chance to hammer home the present vintage\u2019s virtues. Chasing Liverpool down looks too big a task for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side, even though they host the leaders on Boxing Day, but three points this time around would put them seven clear of City in third spot as the season nears halfway. They have a fair chance: City were not at their best against Arsenal last week despite the emphatic nature of their win and Jamie Vardy\u2019s form is such that Pep Guardiola may find fresh reason to curse his lack of specialist centre-backs. If Leicester, not short of a few rough edges themselves in their last two assignments against Norwich and Everton, can click once again then Champions League football will, even at this early stage, appear a certainty. <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Manchester City v Leicester City (Saturday, 5.30pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) A testing examination for Lampard on Mourinho reunion</h2> \n<p>Fans of one of London\u2019s most famous derbies have been starved of their fix of late. It\u2019s been almost 300 days since Tottenham and Chelsea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/27/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">last locked horns, at Stamford Bridge</a> at the end of February in the fourth match between the two clubs in the space of 95 days. Luckily, the latest edition of a fixture that was first played in 1909 should be worth waiting for, with Jose Mourinho welcoming his former golden boy Frank Lampard to north London for a much-anticipated showdown. Chelsea lost only twice against Spurs with Mourinho in charge \u2013 albeit one of them a 5-3 thumping in 2015 \u2013 with his nine victories including the Carabao Cup final two months later. Having stealthily moved to within striking distance of their rivals over the last few weeks, Tottenham know that victory will take them into the top four. No pressure then, Frank. <strong>EA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea (Sunday, 4.30pm)</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/dec/19/liverpool-busy-24-hours-manager-moves-and-more-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Liverpool\u2019s busy 24 hours, manager moves and more \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>4) Ancelotti will benefit from Ferguson\u2019s cameo</h2> \n<p>Nobody around Everton will forget Duncan Ferguson\u2019s short-lived tenure, which has realised a dream for their former centre-forward while injecting fresh belief and vigour into players and fans. Perhaps there is something to be said for quitting \u2013 or moving aside \u2013 while you are ahead and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/19/mikel-arteta-to-be-confirmed-as-arsenal-manager-not-take-team-on-saturday-everton\">the watching Carlo Ancelotti</a> will be encouraged by the effect a little extra motivation has had on his future charges. But the hard work will start after that: hiring Ancelotti is well and good but there is no escaping that Everton have ripped up a long-term plan and plumped for a glitzy, probably short-term appointment at the first sign of real trouble. It is hard to know what the endgame really is but Ancelotti, from on high, will be hoping to see signs he can coax even more improvement out of a broadly talented squad. <strong>NA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Everton v Arsenal (Saturday, 12.30pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7421bf9dca2f50c3b82a0f3a508e42b36e939f80\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7421bf9dca2f50c3b82a0f3a508e42b36e939f80/0_258_5113_3068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duncan Ferguson\u2019s enthusiasm has rubbed off on Everton\u2019s players.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duncan Ferguson\u2019s enthusiasm has rubbed off on Everton\u2019s players.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) More empty seats at St James\u2019 despite upturn in form</h2> \n<p>Steve Bruce\u2019s side may have surprised many pessimistic Newcastle supporters with their position in mid-table as the halfway point of the season approaches but their relative success has not prompted an upturn in attendances at St James\u2019 Park as fans continue to protest against the owner, Mike Ashley, with their feet. Having always averaged well over 50,000 even when they were in the Championship, Newcastle have exceeded that mark only once this season \u2013 against Manchester United in October \u2013 while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/newcastle-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">win over Southampton</a> in their last home game was watched by only 42,303 fans. Some have predicted that figure could be even lower on Saturday against Crystal Palace, with Ashley and Bruce reported to have come up with the scheme that will give away 10,000 season tickets for the final 10 games of the season to avoid any further embarrassing pictures of empty seats. <strong>EA</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Newcastle United v Crystal Palace (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2><strong>6) Saints need a win before tricky run of fixtures</strong></h2> \n<p>After Saturday Southampton will have enjoyed a run of seven games of which only one has been against opposition currently in the top half of the table \u2013 and that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">10th-placed Arsenal</a> \u2013 and five have been against opponents in the bottom six (the one they haven\u2019t played being themselves). After Villa, however, they don\u2019t meet a bottom-half team until February. During this sequence, as forgiving a run as any team will enjoy this season (and one they will pretty much repeat in February and March), they have beaten only the two teams beneath them and despite it they remain in the bottom three.

      "bodyText": "1) Ljungberg was not given the tools to succeed Unless Mikel Arteta decides there really is no time like the present and, without even taking a training session, oversees Arsenal\u2019s visit to Goodison Park from the dugout this will be Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s final match in temporary charge. It is easy to feel some sympathy with Ljungberg given that, throughout his five games so far, he has had to operate with no coaching staff to speak of and little certainty about the length of his tenure. Arsenal had made clear upon Unai Emery\u2019s departure that they would be open to giving Ljungberg a run until the end of the season but failed to equip him with the tools required to show what he could do. Was this meant to be a kind of audition or not? In fairness to the Swede, he has cut a dignified figure throughout the process and stressed he is aware that, in the end, this is all strictly business. Ljungberg will presumably join Arteta\u2019s backroom staff and keep an eye out for future managerial opportunities elsewhere; what a nice touch it would be, though, if one of Arsenal\u2019s most beloved former players could sign off his brief return to the spotlight with a crucial win to set up the new head coach\u2019s reign. NA \u2022 Everton v Arsenal (Saturday, 12.30pm, all times GMT) 2) Leicester have chance to go seven clear of Man City The Etihad was where, in February 2016, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t \u2026 could they?\u201d became \u201cThey really, really can\u201d. Leicester\u2019s 3-1 win, inspired by Riyad Mahrez and the less likely form of Robert Huth, showed their title credentials were deadly serious and Saturday\u2019s fixture offers an excellent chance to hammer home the present vintage\u2019s virtues. Chasing Liverpool down looks too big a task for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side, even though they host the leaders on Boxing Day, but three points this time around would put them seven clear of City in third spot as the season nears halfway. They have a fair chance: City were not at their best against Arsenal last week despite the emphatic nature of their win and Jamie Vardy\u2019s form is such that Pep Guardiola may find fresh reason to curse his lack of specialist centre-backs. If Leicester, not short of a few rough edges themselves in their last two assignments against Norwich and Everton, can click once again then Champions League football will, even at this early stage, appear a certainty. NA \u2022 Manchester City v Leicester City (Saturday, 5.30pm) 3) A testing examination for Lampard on Mourinho reunion Fans of one of London\u2019s most famous derbies have been starved of their fix of late. It\u2019s been almost 300 days since Tottenham and Chelsea last locked horns, at Stamford Bridge at the end of February in the fourth match between the two clubs in the space of 95 days. Luckily, the latest edition of a fixture that was first played in 1909 should be worth waiting for, with Jose Mourinho welcoming his former golden boy Frank Lampard to north London for a much-anticipated showdown. Chelsea lost only twice against Spurs with Mourinho in charge \u2013 albeit one of them a 5-3 thumping in 2015 \u2013 with his nine victories including the Carabao Cup final two months later. Having stealthily moved to within striking distance of their rivals over the last few weeks, Tottenham know that victory will take them into the top four. No pressure then, Frank. EA \u2022 Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea (Sunday, 4.30pm) 4) Ancelotti will benefit from Ferguson\u2019s cameo Nobody around Everton will forget Duncan Ferguson\u2019s short-lived tenure, which has realised a dream for their former centre-forward while injecting fresh belief and vigour into players and fans. Perhaps there is something to be said for quitting \u2013 or moving aside \u2013 while you are ahead and the watching Carlo Ancelotti will be encouraged by the effect a little extra motivation has had on his future charges. But the hard work will start after that: hiring Ancelotti is well and good but there is no escaping that Everton have ripped up a long-term plan and plumped for a glitzy, probably short-term appointment at the first sign of real trouble. It is hard to know what the endgame really is but Ancelotti, from on high, will be hoping to see signs he can coax even more improvement out of a broadly talented squad. NA \u2022 Everton v Arsenal (Saturday, 12.30pm) 5) More empty seats at St James\u2019 despite upturn in form Steve Bruce\u2019s side may have surprised many pessimistic Newcastle supporters with their position in mid-table as the halfway point of the season approaches but their relative success has not prompted an upturn in attendances at St James\u2019 Park as fans continue to protest against the owner, Mike Ashley, with their feet. Having always averaged well over 50,000 even when they were in the Championship, Newcastle have exceeded that mark only once this season \u2013 against Manchester United in October \u2013 while the win over Southampton in their last home game was watched by only 42,303 fans. Some have predicted that figure could be even lower on Saturday against Crystal Palace, with Ashley and Bruce reported to have come up with the scheme that will give away 10,000 season tickets for the final 10 games of the season to avoid any further embarrassing pictures of empty seats. EA \u2022 Newcastle United v Crystal Palace (Saturday, 3pm) 6) Saints need a win before tricky run of fixtures After Saturday Southampton will have enjoyed a run of seven games of which only one has been against opposition currently in the top half of the table \u2013 and that\u2019s 10th-placed Arsenal \u2013 and five have been against opponents in the bottom six (the one they haven\u2019t played being themselves). After Villa, however, they don\u2019t meet a bottom-half team until February. During this sequence, as forgiving a run as any team will enjoy this season (and one they will pretty much repeat in February and March), they have beaten only the two teams beneath them and despite it they remain in the bottom three. Given their recent and future fixtures, their league position might be a little inflated. The opposite is true of Villa, who so far have played only one game against the bottom three and between now and the new year play them all, in reverse order of hopelessness. SB \u2022 Aston Villa v Southampton (Saturday, 3pm) 7) Norwood fired up for Brighton return Oliver Norwood will be the focus of attention as he returns to the club that jettisoned him after their promotion in 2017 without giving him a chance of top-flight football \u2013 he then went on a season-long loan to Fulham, with whom he won promotion again, before joining Sheffield United, initially on loan, in the summer of 2018. Brighton fans might not be unduly worried about the prospect of him exacting the traditional footballer\u2019s revenge, because they are the only club he has played for more than five times without scoring \u2013 his one season with the Seagulls is the only one he has played without a league goal \u2013 even if he did score against them for Huddersfield in 2014. Norwood has more than proved his Premier League credentials this season, is the Blades\u2019 captain and heartbeat from his deep-lying midfield role \u2013 he has played over 200 more passes than any other United player \u2013 and will certainly not lack motivation this weekend. SB \u2022 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Sheffield United (Saturday, 3pm) 8) Depleted Norwich may still wound Wolves After an excellent defensive display led by Ben Godfrey that stopped Leicester in their tracks last week, Norwich will be without the highly-rated England Under-21 defender for Wolves\u2019 visit to Carrow Road due to a knee problem. Daniel Farke must decide between Alex Tettey and Ibrahim Amadou to partner Christoph Zimmermann \u2013 the only recognised central defender available to him as the Canaries\u2019 injury record continues to handicap their attempts to stay up. A Wolves team still licking their wounds after Tottenham\u2019s smash-and-grab victory ended their unbeaten run last week will fancy their chances against the makeshift backline but with Todd Cantwell in exceptional form and Teemu Pukki back in the goals, don\u2019t rule out a home victory. EA \u2022 Norwich City v Wolverhampton Wanderers (Saturday, 3pm) 9) Watford\u2019s new arrival could learn from Greenwood The 18-year-old striker Jo\u00e3o Pedro arrived in Hertfordshire this week following his move from Fluminense to Watford, and is free to make his debut in the new year. Last week\u2019s defeat by Liverpool, in which the Hornets set a new benchmark for comic chance-missing, demonstrated how badly they need a natural finisher, and perhaps he will meet that need. In the meantime Watford can glimpse the kind of impact a young forward can make when Mason Greenwood \u2013 2cm shorter and five days younger than the Brazilian \u2013 visits on Sunday. Greenwood has scored five goals in his last 10 outings (that\u2019s two more than Watford\u2019s entire squad have managed in their previous 10 games), despite most of them coming as a substitute, but has now started three of Manchester United\u2019s last four games and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r admits it is \u201chard for me to leave him out\u201d.
