But the group had publicly anticipated that the event would attract \u201cenough citizens armed with handguns to take over a modern mid-sized country\u201d.</p> <p>Philip Van Cleave, the VCDL president, told the Guardian that the group was consulting its lawyers and exploring a legal challenge to the governor\u2019s ban on weapons in Richmond\u2019s Capitol Square.

The rhetoric of some of these local activists has been intense, with calls of treason and tyranny, and open references to civil war.

He is a quick healer and he\u2019ll play through some pain \u2013 he\u2019s capable if it\u2019s not a bad injury.\u201d Rashford has spoken of using a device called Melmak and was pictured with it before Saturday\u2019s 4-0 win over Norwich. \u201cWhen I was younger I used to have a lot of problems in my back, so I got used to using this machine,\u201d he said. \u201cI still use it, a bone-healing [ultrasound] machine. Put a bit of gel on, then strap it round.\u201d After the tie Rashford, who has 19 goals, said: \u201cI never want to feel like I\u2019ve let my teammates, the club and most importantly the fans down, so did my very best to carry on and was gutted to come off. Top work from the lads to get into the next round.\u201d Juan Mata, who scored the winner, said: \u201cHopefully he is not too bad and available because he is on fire, scoring every game. It\u2019s a shame he couldn\u2019t stay more minutes, hopefully it was nothing.\u201d",

The annual \u201cbenchmarking\u201d report produced by European football\u2019s governing body recorded generally booming attendances, TV income and commercial revenues across all leagues, but Uefa also sounded a warning about the widening financial and competitive gap between the richest elite clubs and the rest. The report assessed the 2017-18 financial reports from all 712 clubs in the top divisions of Uefa\u2019s 54 European member countries and found the Premier League has dramatically cemented its dominance over all other leagues during the past decade. Uefa\u2019s analysts found the combined revenues of the 20 Premier League clubs, \u20ac5.4bn, was more money than the 617 clubs in all 50 European leagues below the top four. The gap between the Premier League and the next wealthiest and most powerful leagues is also vast, its clubs making \u20ac2bn more than the Bundesliga, whose members made \u20ac3.2bn, and La Liga (\u20ac3.1bn), with Serie A clubs having earned \u20ac2.3bn and France\u2019s Ligue 1 \u20ac1.7bn, a third of the Premier League\u2019s total earnings.

Pressure from the major European clubs is in the opposite direction, for more lucrative Champions League matches from a reshaping of the competition after 2024, and there is very little talk of redistributing money more equally.

Yuin people said there were several sites that may have been wiped out between Gulaga (Mount Dromedary) and Mumbulla mountain, north of Bega. Mumbulla and Gulaga are part of a chain of important Aboriginal cultural sites stretching from the Shoalhaven to the Victorian border. A Yuin man, Warren Foster from Wallaga Lake, said people need to be supported to go out on country to assess the damage. \u201cThese are the worst bushfires in our history,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIt\u2019s never gone up like this.

Once the two year time frame is up, and China thinks about diversifying its imports, what might happen to US farmers who have since ramped up domestic production on expectations of Chinese demand? At face value, it\u2019s not encouraging as a completely sustainable trade framework going forward.<br><br></li> <li>The deal has some encouraging language, but it\u2019s provisions still leave open questions around the severe structural issues in the US-China trade relationship.

      "bodyText": "Wall Street traders have donned their \u201cDow 29,000\u201d hats, to mark today\u2019s rally. Donald Trump will hope that trade war optimism, and the hint of tax cuts later this year, might see them wearing \u201cDow 30,000\u201d before November. But that is for another day. Until tomorrow, goodnight! GW Boom! Wall Street has ended at a new all time closing high. Relief that the Phase One trade deal with China is finally signed lifted stocks, despite the agreement\u2019s flaw. The Dow closed up 91 points, or 0.3%, at 29,031, having earlier hit an intraday peak at 29,127 points. With the Phase One trade deal in the bag, Donald Trump is now hosting a lunch for the Chinese delegation and his own officials. The president sound upbeat, saying that relations between the two sides are better than ever. Here\u2019s my colleague Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s trade deal: Donald Trump has signed the first phase of a new trade agreement with China after two years of tension between the two superpowers that have rattled economies around the world. Trump said: \u201cToday, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade. Together we are righting the wrong of the past.\u201d \u201cAt long last Americans have a government that puts them first at the negotiating table,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest deal anybody has ever seen.\u201d Trump and China\u2019s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, signed the deal at a packed press conference, attended by Ivanka Trump, much of Trump\u2019s cabinet, Henry Kissinger, and media and business leaders including Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of Blackstone, and Ajay Banga, the president of Mastercard. The signing came hours after Democrats named the team that will prosecute Trump in an impeachment trial that starts early next week. The first phase of the deal will further open the Chinese market to US companies, and includes roughly $200bn in Chinese purchases of American goods and services. But it will also leave in place much of the $360bn worth of tariffs that the US has already imposed on Chinese goods, and the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal. Trump campaigned on tackling what he saw as China\u2019s unfair trade practices, accusing the country of \u201craping\u201d the US and perpetuating \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world\u201d. The often rancorous trade dispute has hurt agriculture, manufacturing and other sectors of the US economy, and the uncertainty it has engendered has worried business leaders. But its impact on the broader economy does not appear to have been as dire as some predicted. The trade deal, if it holds, could be a major political boost for Trump in an election year when he can argue his tough stance with China has paid off. US stock markets hit new record highs ahead of the signing. Anahita Thoms, Head of the Trade Practice at law firm Baker McKenzie in Germany, has also kicked the tires of the trade deal....and come away unimpressed. She says that both sides will have concerns -- so we could see Phase Two, Three and Four trade deals in the years ahead. Phase One, though, is not a major breakthrough: \u201cUltimately, trade wars produce losers. The US has lost because of inevitably higher prices for consumers, whilst China has lost because overall the volume of its trade will fall. However, other countries such as Vietnam have benefitted in the short term by taking advantage of the changing trade opportunities, but in the long term, we will all lose because global growth is negatively impacted when the two biggest economies engage in a trade war for years.\u201d \u201cFor now, Phase One doesn\u2019t strike a deal in a comprehensive way. In the beginning, the goal was about securing IP rights, easing the issues around forced technology transfer, market access and subsidies. In regards to Phase One, we are not there yet. Many, before President Trump, have tried to reach such a comprehensive deal, but it remains elusive for now.\u201d Nick Marro, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, also has concerns about the deal. He\u2019s not convinced that China can meet its pledge of buying $200bn of extra goods from America each year. And even if it can, what happens in 2022 when the deal expires? Marro fears that the trade war could flare up again, despite today\u2019s upbeat (and sometimes rambling) signing ceremony. He says: The trade war has demonstrated the problems of overexposure to a single market. But rather than encouraging export diversification, the trade deal risks exacerbating this over reliance through its purchase targets. This is especially because much of these purchases will come via artificially generated demand, rather than market dynamics. Once the two year time frame is up, and China thinks about diversifying its imports, what might happen to US farmers who have since ramped up domestic production on expectations of Chinese demand? At face value, it\u2019s not encouraging as a completely sustainable trade framework going forward. The deal has some encouraging language, but it\u2019s provisions still leave open questions around the severe structural issues in the US-China trade relationship. This, combined with likely difficulties in implementing many of these commitments, suggests that there is a high risk that the deal might fall apart later this year. Companies may need to seriously consider the scenarios around a resumption in tariff hostilities. Dr Kerstin Braun, President of Stenn Group, is also giving the phase one deal a muted reception. She says America hasn\u2019t made progress on key issues, including subsidies for Chinese companies that tilt the playing field unfairly. \u201cThe US China phase one deal is long-awaited good news for global trade, which took a hit from the tariff war in 2019 to the tune of $420 billion in lost revenue for exporters. \u201cBut while it\u2019s a start, the deal fails to cover the significant issues that prompted the war in the first place. This includes China\u2019s preferential support of state-owned enterprises and technology transfer from American companies doing business there. \u201cBoth sides need to accept the larger picture. For the US, it\u2019s that China as an economic power is not going away. For China, it\u2019s that to be in the world marketplace means complying with international business standards. \u201cWith a weakened World Trade Organisation and the general trend away from multilateral trade agreements, we\u2019re only going to see more trade squabbles. \u201cChina is already showing it can be less dependent on the US economy. China\u2019s exports grew slightly last year overall, but exports to the US dropped 12.5%.\u201d Is today\u2019s deal as momentous as Donald Trump claimed today? No, according to Tim Drayson, Head of Economics at Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM). He says the deal doesn\u2019t address key issues, will be hard for China to stick to, and still leaves trade barriers in place: \u201cThe signing of the \u2018Phase One\u2019 trade deal marks the widely anticipated ceasefire in Trump\u2019s trade war with China. While this could hold through to November, it probably marks the peak in improving news on the US and China relationship. First, the majority of the existing tariffs remain in place, with no timetable for their removal. Second, it will be difficult for China to meet its target for purchases of US goods. Third, the deal lacks a credible enforcement mechanism. Finally, progress on the key structural issues remain extremely limited.\u201d Details of the trade deal are now being released by the White House. It includes a pledge by China to buy another $200bn of US goods over the next two years, and will come into effect in 30 days. However, China only appears to be promising to buy an extra $33bn of agricultural products (unless I\u2019m missing something). Manufacturing goods: at least $32.9bn more in 2020, rising to $44.8bn more in 2021 Agricultural products: at least $12.5bn more in 2020, rising to $19.5bn in 2021. Energy products: at least $18.5bn more in 2020, rising to $33.9bn in 2021 Services: at least $12.8bn more in 2020, rising to $25.1 in 2021 China has also promised to restrict its requests for access to confidential data when reviewing whether to allow US companies to access its markets, and pledge to speed up the process for authorising US biotech products. That will address some concerns about \u2018forced technology transfers\u2019, and the opening up of China\u2019s markets. Donald Trump signals to some of the audience to gather round to see the signing. They don\u2019t need asking twice, and soon the stage is packed. The president is clearly keen to make this Phase One agreement seem like a very Big Deal. But be clear, this is not a comprehensive deal to fully end the trade war. That\u2019s why Trump hasn\u2019t lowered tariffs on China\u2019s goods today. Finally, after more than 18 months of trade conflict, America and China are signing the preliminary trade deal. Donald Trump sets the scene in the White House, saying \u201cThe world is watching today, it\u2019s a great honour to be here\u201d. Then he shakes hands with vice-premier Liu He, and the pair head over to the desks where a few copies of the agreement are waiting. A few strokes of the pens later, and the deal is done! Liu He is now issuing a serious warning to the US politicians and business leaders in the White House. He says China and America must work closer together to tackle the world\u2019s problems. Co-operation is the only right choice, he insists. We must work together, with mutual respect. Reminder: earlier today the World Economic Forum warned that environmental dangers are now the top risks facing the global economy. A trade war between Washington and Beijing undermines the global co-operation needed. Simon Evenett,professor of economics at the University of St Gallen, smells a doll-sized rat.... Liu He now turns to his own remarks. He insists that today\u2019s deal is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d, and complies with trade rules. We will honour it strictly, he promises. Liu is hopeful that the Phase Two talks will go well, citing an old proverb that \u201ca good beginning is the hardest part\u201d. He then says that China will import $40bn of US agricultural goods. If there\u2019s strong demand, they can import more, he adds. [Trump earlier cited a $50bn figure....] Trump is now inviting vice-premier Liu He to address the room (after joking that Liu deserves a break after all his hard work and should catch a movie). Liu produces a letter from his boss, president Xi Jinping! It\u2019s addressed to Donald Trump. The letter begins with Xi telling Trump that conclusion of the phase one trade agreement between China and the US is good for both countries, and the whole world. We need equality and mutual respect, to tackle issues together, says Xi. Both sides must implement the deal in \u201creal earnestness\u201d, and make progress in trade and economic co-operation. Healthy and steady growth in relations will need efforts from both sides. Xi also says that he hopes that US treats Chinese companies fairly, and promises to work closely with Trump. I believe that under our guidance, China-US relations will deliver more results and provide more benefits for our people Xi concludes by wishing the Trump family best wishes, and happiness and success in the Chinese new year. Looking ahead, Donald Trump says the US and China will start talking about a Phase Two deal as this deal kicks in. But in the meantime, the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports will remain in place. We\u2019re leaving tariffs on, but I will agree to take them off if we agree phase two, the president says. We need the tariffs, or we won\u2019t have any cards to pay with, he adds. And Trump concludes his remarks by claiming that \u201cthis is the biggest deal that anyone\u2019s ever seen\u201d. It will bring \u201charmony, prosperity, commerce and much more between the US and China\u201d, and \u201clead to even stronger world peace.\u201d Honestly.... Trump has finally returned to the details of the US-China trade talks. He says Beijing has agreed to \u201cgreatly expand\u201d the products it buys from America, and will buy \u201cmuch more than $200bn\u201d over the next two years. That includes more than $50bn on agriculture products, $75bn on manufacturing products, and $50bn of energy. He says it also contains very strong IP protections, very strong restrictions on currency devaluations, and has \u201ctotal and full enforceability\u201d. [But given the WTO is so weak, how will this deal really be enforced, I wonder...] Trump reckons that China is now more open to US beef, pork, dairy, animal feed, and biotechnology. I\u2019m not saying the president is rambling (well, he is...) but Bloomberg TV has now switched away from the trade deal signing ceremony. Viewers probably got the point, after thirty minutes of Trump patting his officials, and himself, on the back. Trump now wants to know why investors will pay for other countries\u2019 debt, but not Americas. The president says this is unfair -- who is crazy enough to accept a guaranteed loss? The reason... is that German debt (for example) is seen as a safe place to place your capital, so it\u2019s worth paying over the face value of the bonds. Also, the European Central Bank might buy those bonds off you for an even higher price, as part of its stimulus plan. Some of America\u2019s top business leaders are in the room, and President Trump is naming them in turn. Most of them are doing incredibly well, Trump says, and it\u2019s all thanks to him (I think this is a joke, but with this president you never know...) He spots Boeing\u2019s CEO David Calhoun, saying he has a big job turning the aircraft maker around after the 737 Max crisis. Not your fault, David, says Trump generously. You\u2019ll straighten it out quickly, I hope? We will, pledges Calhoun, as Trump moves on... ...to the chief of eBay. Trump isn\u2019t happy that items he signs are turning up on the online auction site the next day, such as signed sneakers at $5,000. Sometimes it\u2019s Senators and Congresspeople doing it, he puns. OK, Trump\u2019s veered waaaay away from the trade deal. He\u2019s now banging on about changing regulations so that a firework display can be held at Mount Rushmore. At least he\u2019s not talking about having his name chiseled into the rockface (yet...). But it\u2019s a really rambling performance: Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump\u2019s opening comments on the trade deal, before he diverted into picking out allies in the audience and thanking them for their work. Donald Trump is now name-checking various members of his administration, including Mike Pompeo, and thanking them for their work. He takes a swipe at Congress, saying some of his audience may need to leave to vote in the \u201cimpeachment hoax\u201d. The president then picks out some friends in the audience, including Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, who Trump modestly says \u201calways liked me, because he\u2019s so smart\u201d. I\u2019m really not sure what the Chinese delegation make of it all, but they\u2019re standing politely and applauding occasionally while Trump hands out his verbal bouquets. Trump turns to Robert Lighthizer, joking that his trade representative has been kept pretty busy in the last couple of years. Was this deal easier or harder than you thought, Robert?, asks Trump innocently. Harder, says Lighthizer ruefully. Trump also gives his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, credit for helping on the trade deal (even though Lighthizer\u2019s team appeared to do the heavy lifting). And in a jovial mood, Trump jokes about how his advisor Larry Kudlow managed to talk the stock market up again after it suffered a rare $1trn selloff last year. Vice-president Mike Pence takes the podium. \u201cThis is a good day for America, China and the world,\u201d says Pence, saying the deal helps to \u201cput America first\u201d. Differences will remain between our two countries, but today\u2019s deal signing marks a new, more productive relationship, Pence continues. Actually, that\u2019s a good point -- today\u2019s signing ceremony is significant, if it means Washington and Beijing are on the path towards a full ceasefire in the trade war. The White House band is playing, as Donald Trump and Liu He arrive. Everyone\u2019s on their feet. The president speaks first. Today, we are taking a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade, says Trump. Together we are righting the wrong of the past. He claims that the Phase One trade deal will provide economic security for US families, businesses and farmers. And in a piece of classic Trump, the president says that many people thought such a deal was impossible (who exactly?!), but it should have happened a long time ago. Trump speaks warmly of Liu He being a friend, and says he will visit China in the \u2018not too distant future\u2019. The room is now packed. And at the front, there are two desks, each bearing several documents - presumably ready to be signed by Trump and Liu. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have just arrived in the East Room, ready for the deal signing. We\u2019re expecting Donald Trump to sign it for the US, with vice-premier Liu He representing China. Seats are filling up fast in the East Room of the White House, ready for the signing ceremony for the phase one trade deal. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has also hit a new all-time high, over 9,298 points. The signing of the US-China trade deal is due to take place in around 10 minutes. But despite the White House\u2019s best efforts, it\u2019s not the biggest story in Washington today. This is: Wall Street\u2019s \u2018fear index\u2019 has dropped to its lowest level of the year: Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new all-time high. These optimistic noises from Larry Kudlow and Stephen Mnuchin may be cheering New York traders, encouraging them to drive stocks higher. This has lifted the Dow by 0.5%, or 150 points, to 29,089 -- a new peak. A former White House cabinet secretary, Chris Lu, has warned that American consumers are paying the price for Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. Lu, who served under Barack Obama, points out that the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods arriving at US ports are a burden on consumers (as the importer pays them). China is hoping that the White House might roll back some tariffs in the coming months, if the Phase One trade deal holds up. That\u2019s according to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper which is a good guide to Beijing\u2019s thinking. It says: China and the US are set to sign the long-awaited phase one trade deal on Wednesday (US time); the deal, which involves a nine-chapter text, has fully taken into account the concerns and interests of both countries, and it is expected to bring the world\u2019s two largest economies back on track to stable and sound development, experts close to the deal told the Global Times on Wednesday. The hard-won text involves nine chapters, touching sectors such as intellectual property rights (IPR), technology transfer, food and agricultural products, financial services, exchange rates and transparency, trade expansion as well as bilateral assessments and dispute settlement mechanisms. \u201cThe phase one deal, which is signed based on an equal footing, is in the interests of both countries and will be a constraining force on both China and the US,\u201d Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing who is close to the trade talks, told the Global Times on Wednesday. As the two reached consensus on the phase-one deal, US agreed to lower tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese products to 7.5 percent from 15 percent, but a 25 percent tariff remains on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese products. The US also rolled back plans to impose tariffs on all additional imports. \u201cThe tariffs will be further scrapped when negotiations in the upcoming months run smoothly,\u201d Gao said. Larry Kudlow is now talking up the US-China trade deal, saying it will be good for the American economy, and the wider global economy. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I don\u2019t care what side of the aisle you\u2019re on, this is a fantastic deal. But he also confirms that issues such as the subsidies paid to Chinese firms, and technology licensing are not covered in today\u2019s deal. Q: But are there any plans to lower tariffs on Chinese tariffs? If the agreements in this deal are adhered to, it will make Phase Two much easier, Kudlow replies. In other words, if America decides China isn\u2019t abiding by its pledges, tariffs won\u2019t be cut. So much for worrying about the deficit! National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to President Trump, has revealed that the White House plans to unveil a plan for additional tax cuts later in 2020. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow revealed the move would come in the summer -- when the presidential election campaign would be intensifying \u201cI am still running a process of Tax Cuts 2.0. We\u2019re many months away \u2013 it\u2019ll come out something later during the campaign. Tax Cuts 2.0 to help middle-class economic growth: That\u2019s still our goal.\u201d Kudlow added: \u201cI had a tremendous meeting with my friend Kevin Brady, who will undoubtedly be the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But we will unveil this perhaps sometimes later in the summer.\u201d Thee excitement around the US-China phase-one trade deal has already faded in markets, even before the ink is wet on the paper. So says Silvia Dall\u2019Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. The deal is now expected to bear only limited fruit: US officials suggested overnight that in the absence of a phase-two agreement, the US is unlikely to roll back further tariffs against China before the Presidential elections later this year. That is hardly surprising. The deal seemed already fragile when it was announced in mid-December: details were scant (a full document will be provided only after the signing), some of the commitments (such as the $200bn step-up in Chinese purchases of US goods and services in the next two years) seemed unrealistic, and there was extreme vagueness concerning some crucial aspects such as intellectual property protections and technological transfers. All in all, trade tensions between the US and China might well re-surface over the course of the year, also depending on how US domestic electoral dynamics pan out in coming months.\u201d Wall Street has opened calmly, as investors await today\u2019s Phase One trade deal signing. The Dow has gained 60 points, or 0.2%, up to 28,999 points --- tantalising close to the 29k level hit for the first time last week. Mnuchin also told reporters that the White House is \u201cindifferent\u201d to whether the tariffs on US-China trade are reduced before, or after, November\u2019s election. I\u2019m not sure that America farmers share this relaxed approach, given the drop in soybean sales. US firms who have to either absorb tariffs on Chinese imports or pass then onto consumers are also keen to see progress. Treasury secretary Mnuchin has also been challenged over the US deficit, which has jumped by over 11% according to new figures. Is it safe to be borrowing so much, and does this show that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts aren\u2019t working? Mnuchin (ever loyal), insists that the Trump tax cuts will pay for themselves over the next decade. He blames spending commitments, rather than taxes, for the yawning deficit. There\u2019s no question that over time, we need to look at government spending issues. That\u2019s the cause of the deficit, not tax cuts. That\u2019s likely to alarm those who fear cuts to social security and Medicare. Military spending has also gone up sharply, and could rise further if geopolitical tensions increase. It\u2019s fair to say that global investors don\u2019t quite share Stephen Mnuchin\u2019s excitement about today\u2019s trade deal ceremony. There\u2019s plenty of disappointment that the White House isn\u2019t cutting some of the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports since the trade war began in 2018 (one CIO dubbed these tariffs a \u2018roach motel\u2019 overnight) Investors have also noted that the big issues, such as intellectual property protection and subsidies, have been deferred until a future Phase Two deal Hugh Grieves, fund manager at Premier Miton, says the Phase One agreement doesn\u2019t end the war: \u201cThe phase 1 trade deal due to be signed later today will allow both Presidents Trump and Xi to claim a political victory after a bruising two-year trade war. When the details of the agreement are released however, we will be shown just how much, or (more likely) how little, structural reform China has committed to in return for just $200bn of increased imports (equal to only approximately half of China\u2019s 2018 bilateral trade deficit) and some tariff reduction. \u201cBut whatever the details in this limited agreement, it does not resolve the underlying tensions, both political and economic, between the two countries and therefore investors should expect further tensions to be a feature of the future investing landscape.\u201d Newsflash: The Phase-One trade deal that America and China will sign today is an \u201cenormous win\u201d. That\u2019s according to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin, who is speaking outside the White House now. Mnuchin insists that this preliminary deal is a great success, even though it doesn\u2019t appear to cover important issues such as cyber crime. This is the first time that we\u2019ve had an agreement with China that addresses agricultural purchases, structural reforms, financial services and currency issues, says Mnuchin. He adds that China has also agreed to buy \u201c$200bn of additional things\u201d over the next few years. Sweeping aside fears that the deal is a damp squib, he says the White House expects \u201csignificant growth\u201d this year. This is an enormous win. The average consumer will see a stronger economy in 2020 thanks to this deal.... The deal itself should be signed in a few hours time (11.30am in Washington, or 4.30pm UK time). Just in: British Airways\u2019 owner IAG has filed an official complaint to the European Commission over the rescue of Flybe. The move comes amid a growing backlash to the government\u2019s rescue of the ailing regional carrier from rival airlines, opposition politicians, and environmentalists. My colleague Gwyn Topham explains: IAG has written to the competition directorate of the EU saying that the rescue deal announced on Tuesday night by ministers, which could include a \u00a3100m loan and deferral of an outstanding tax bill, contravenes state aid rules. IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, had earlier described the deal as \u201ca blatant misuse of public funds\u201d. The European Commission said it was ready to discuss with Britain its rescue of regional airline Flybe, noting that any state aid should be designed to avoid the distortion of competition and a level playing field. Here\u2019s the full story: Tackling the climate emergency will need some tough decisions. The UK government faces one in the North of England, where a new \u00a3165m coalmine in Cumbria is being planned. But a new report, from Lancaster University professors Rebecca Willis and Mike Berners-Lee, shows that the mine would undercut the UK\u2019s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. They\u2019ve calculated that the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than 1 million households. Here\u2019s the full story: Our economics editor Larry Elliott is back from WEF\u2019s press conference on its Global Risks report, and says: A year of extreme weather events and mounting evidence of global heating have catapulted the climate emergency to the top of the list of issues worrying the world\u2019s elite. The World Economic Forum\u2019s annual risks report found that, for the first time in its 15-year history, the environment filled the top five places in the list of concerns likely to have a major impact over the next decade. B\u00f8rge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, said: \u201cThe political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning. This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.\u201d After a month that has seen bush fires raging out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action. \u201cWe have only a very small window and if we don\u2019t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.\u201d... More here: WEF have tweeted about their Risks Report (which is online here). Top decision makers under the age of 40 have particularly strong concerns about climate, today\u2019s WEF Risks Report has found. It says: The report highlights how risks are seen by those born after 1980. They ranked environmental risks higher than other respondents, in the short- and long- terms. Almost 90% of these respondents believe \u201cextreme heat waves\u201d, \u201cdestruction of ecosystems\u201d and \u201chealth impacted by pollution\u201d will be aggravated in 2020; compared to 77%, 76% and 67% respectively for other generations. They also believe that the impact from environmental risks by 2030 will be more catastrophic and more likely. So is there any hope? Emily Farnworth, head of climate change at WEF, argues that there is. The Paris Agreement of 2015 sent businesses a clear signal that governments want slow their emissions. She\u2019s also optimistic that social and technology entrepreneurs, springing up around the world, can deliver the \u201cexponential change\u201d needed if the 2020s are to be a \u201cdecade of delivery\u201d. We know what the challenge is, we need to get on and address it. WEF\u2019s Risks Report has also predicted that 2020 will see rising political and social tensions, both within countries and between them. So with the added risk of economic slowdown, it could be a turbulent year. 78% of survey respondents said they expect \u201ceconomic confrontations\u201d and \u201cdomestic political polarization\u201d to rise in 2020. Increased political polarisation, extreme heat waves and the destruction of the natural environment are also worryingly likely, with policymakers struggling to make the progress needed on the climate emergency. Here are the six key points from the report (online here). Geopolitical Instability: National politics in many countries has evidenced intense divisiveness and \u2018pushbacks\u2019, coupled with increasingly fractious international relations. These volatilities will likely persist, challenging cooperation on key priorities. Economic Concerns: As economic confrontations between major powers grow, the global economy shows greater signs of a concerted slowdown. Climate Response Shortcomings: Weak international agreements belie rising investor and popular pressure for action, against a backdrop of a multitude of natural catastrophes and indicators of longer-term disruptions. 2020 is a critical year for nations to accelerate progress towards major emissions reductions and boosting adaption investments. Biodiversity Loss Impacts: Many ecosystems are in decline or at risk of distinction. Biodiversity loss poses irreversible consequences to societies, economies, and the health of the planet. Technological Governance Deficits: Emerging technology risks can erode social discourse, threaten economic stability, exacerbate geostrategic competition, and pressure national and international security. Getting a better handle on systemic risks will require a significant technology governance refresh at all levels. Creaking Health Systems: Changing societal, environmental, demographic, and technological trends are straining health systems globally. While transformative technology, medicines, and insurance can improve healthcare, they also introduce new risks and trade-offs. Britain\u2019s weak inflation is likely to spur the Bank of England to cut interest rates this month, says Garry Young of economic thinktank NIESR. But he\u2019s not convinced they should.... The surprise fall in UK inflation to 1.3% has knocked the pound back below $1.30. Traders are (understandably) concluding that an interest rate cut is more likely. Significantly, core inflation has dropped to just 1.4%, from 1.7% in November -- showing price pressures are weakening. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says: The Bank of England has been studiously steering interest rate expectations lower, but this morning\u2019s collapse in core inflation further increased the likelihood that rates will be cut to 0.5% when the MPC meets on 30th January. Core inflation is now back at the levels last seen in 2016.\u201d Shops slashed women\u2019s clothing prices particularly sharply last month, the Office for National Statistics says: The largest individual downward contributions came from women\u2019s casual jackets and cardigans, where prices fell between November and December 2019 but rose between the same two months in 2018. There were also small individual downward contributions from formal trousers and formal skirts. There is evidence of increased discounting, with the proportion of women\u2019s clothing items recorded on sale being higher in December 2019 than in December 2018. Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to a three-year low, making an early interest rate cut increasingly likely. The Consumer Prices Index fell to just 1.3% in December, down from 1.5% in November, to its lowest since November 2016. That\u2019s some way below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. Clothing and restaurants had the biggest downward push on prices. That suggests that retailers have been forced to slash prices to encourage customers through their doors. Q: Is China engaging enough on these issues? Brende replies that it is crucial that China is a part of the global fight against climate. He points out that they have lead a major role in solar and wind power, helping to drive prices down. China has been a \u201cresponsible player in sticking to multilateral agreements\u201d....\u201dWe cannot succeed... without China on board\u201d, Brende says. Q: Is WEF concerned about the new, pneumonia-like virus spreading in China? The world is not ready for another pandemic, Brende replies sternly. B\u00f8rge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, warns that policymakers only have 10 years to address the climate emergency - otherwise they\u2019ll just be \u201cmoving deckchairs on the Titanic\u201d. But he\u2019s also optimistic, pointing out that the cost of solar energy is 10 times as cheap as a decade ago. A lot can happen in 10 years, if people react. Here are some key charts from WEF\u2019s risks report, showing how environmental issues (coloured green) are now seen as the biggest threat to the global economy. WEF are now taking questions.... firstly from my colleague Larry Elliott. Q: Next week, lots of the CEOs who say they want to fight the climate emergency will be flying to Davos in their private jets - isn\u2019t there a major reality gap here? Most people who go to Davos go by rail, WEF\u2019s Adrian Monck replies [Larry and I will be chugging up the mountain next week] There\u2019s biofuel at Zurich Airport if you want to top up your private jet, and the Annual Meeting is going to be carbon neutral, Monck adds. But he agrees that Davos needs to do more than just pay lip service to environmental issues. There\u2019s nothing worse than an organisation recognising a risk and doing nothing about it, which is why we take it so seriously. Biodiversity loss and a warming planet are linked, Giger adds -- one can lead to the other. Businesses, consumers and regulators....need to prioritise investments that protect the planet. Peter Giger, Zurich\u2019s group chief risk officer, says the loss of biodiversity is a very serious risk to the global economy. We rely on biodiversity, from pollinating crops to curing diseases. John Drzik, chairman of financial service firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Insights, is now speaking at the Global Risks report press conference. He says there is mounting pressure on the public sector to act on environmental risks, in the face of rising threats. The situation is \u201cbad and getting worse\u201d, Drzik says. Climate impact was very visible in 2019, he says, citing wildfires in Australia, Europe and California, and flooding in other regions. The business community need to focus with more intensity on the risks from climate emergency, but also the opportunities, Drzik continues. Drzik says investors and regulators are taking the issue more seriously, so bosses need to do the same. He cited BlackRock\u2019s decision yesterday to focus on sustainable investment, following heavy criticism for its investment in fossil fuels. The World Economic Forum is outlining its Risks Report at a press conference in London now. The first chapter is called \u201cAn Unsettled World\u201d - focusing on the current fractured global situation. This is making it harder to tackle issues such as the climate emergency. WEF\u2019s Mirek Dusek explains: It is the super-risk. All the other risks that we need to contend with, there is this drag that we have to contend with - that we live in a more polarised, more competitive world. The Risks Report also focuses on environmental issues -- such as the threat of accelerated biodiversity loss. A conservative estimate says we are losing 200 to 2,000 species per year -- this is an issue of critical importance. NEWSFLASH: the World Economic Forum\u2019s new global risks report is out! And for first time in its 15 year history, the top five global risks to the global economy over the next decade are all related to the environment. This confirms that the climate emergency has rocketed to the top of the global agenda, with business leaders and economists now awake to the dangers from rising temperatures. The top five are: Extreme weather events Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation Human made environmental damage and disaster Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse Major natural disasters such as earthquakes. This comes from a survey of 759 global experts and decision makers across the globe, many of whom will be travelling to Davos next week for WEF\u2019s Annual Meeting. WEF are announcing more details from the report now.... Michael Saunders has also produced this chart, showing why he believes UK interest rates should be cut: Newsflash: Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders has warned that the UK economy appears to be stagnating. Speaking in Northern Ireland right now, Saunders says that is recent business surveys suggest there is \u2018little or no growth\u2019 in the British economy right now. So with growth sluggish, Saunders favours an \u201cexpansionary monetary policy stance\u201d -- ie lower interest rates. In a speech titled Risk management in a sluggish economy, he says: \u201cIt probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target. With limited monetary policy space, risk management considerations favour a relatively prompt and aggressive response to downside risks at present.\u201d Saunders is one of two policymakers who voted to cut interest rates at the Bank\u2019s last meeting in December. Other members of the Monetary Policy Committee have sounded dovish since, meaning rates could be lowered at the next meeting in a fortnight. Howard Archer of EY Item Club reckons Saunders is certain to vote for a cut again. Unusually, the full text of the Phase One trade deal hasn\u2019t been released yet. But Reuters has heard some details: China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source, though some U.S. trade experts call it an unrealistic target. Under the Phase 1 trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same period, the source, who was briefed on the deal, told Reuters late on Monday. The agreement also calls for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to increase by some $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year, said the source. Donald Trump famously claimed that trade wars were good and easy to win. But Washington\u2019s refusal to dial back the tariffs on $360bn Chinese goods shows clearly that trade wars are hard to get out of. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, says US businesses need to hunker down, as they can\u2019t escape these tariffs easily. We\u2019re still stuck with these tariffs which are a drag on growth in trade and manufacturing These tariffs have now become a roach motel.\u201d (for those unversed in Americanisms, this means a place you can easily get into, but struggle to escape) Asia-Pacific stocks have been hit by America\u2019s refusal to lift tariffs on Chinese goods. Almost all the major indices are in the red, as traders face up to the prospect of more trade tensions this year. China\u2019s CSI300 index is down 0.5%, with India\u2019s Sensex losing 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US and China will finally sign their Phase One trade deal today, but there\u2019s no much celebration in the markets. President Donald Trump and vice-premier Liu He will both put their signatures to the agreement, at a ceremony in Washington later today. The deal should calm the turbulent trade conflict between the two nations which blew up in 2018, slowing global trade and hurting the world economy. We can expect Trump to talk up the deal as a major breakthrough, with Beijing agreeing to buy up to $50bn of US agricultural products per year. But the fizz is going flat, even before the corks fly out of the bottles. That\u2019s because the White House has already declared that the existing tariffs imposed over the last 18 months or so will remain in place until a full trade deal deal is agreed. That means tariffs on $360bn of Chinese imports will remain in place, probably until after November\u2019s presidential election. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin broke the news to reporters overnight, saying: \u201cThese tariffs will stay in place until there is a Phase 2. If the president gets a Phase 2 in place quickly, he\u2019ll consider releasing tariffs as part of Phase 2.\u201d We don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in the 80-page Phase One deal, but it appears to duck some of the really serious sticking points, such as intellectual property protections and China\u2019s subsidies of its companies. Investors fear that a comprehensive trade deal could take a long time to agree, given the long grind just to agree Phase One. There\u2019s also concern that China might not stick to the deal, meaning it could swiftly unravel: As Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, puts it: The US \u2013 China trade deal is like watching a live show in the theatre of the absurd. The Trump administration revealed a detail that nobody expected just before the signature of the phase-one trade deal today: the tariff cuts will not take effect before the US election in November. This means that the US tariffs will continue weighing on Chinese exports for almost an additional year, while the emerging market giant will certainly be asked to deliver on its promise to buy massive amounts of US farm goods and manufactured products immediately. The risk here is that the double-standard agreement could provide a weak basis for the future negotiations, impair the benefits, or even spoil the deal. So don\u2019t bank on major action in the markets today, although the Dow Jones industrial average did briefly jump over 29,000 points yesterday, before tariff fears struck.... Also coming up today The World Economic Forum are releasing their annual Global Risks report, identifying the key threats to the global economy ahead of next week\u2019s gathering in Davos. Trade wars, the climate emergency and geopolitical tensions will probably feature highly. We also get the latest UK inflation data - a weak reading could give the Bank of England more leeway to consider an interest rate cut. The agenda 9am GMT: World Economic Forum publishes its Global Risks report 9.30am GMT: UK inflation data for December. Expected to remain at 1.5%, a three-year low 4.30pm GMT: US and China sign their Phase One trade deal",

I didn\u2019t understand! I\u2019m sorry! <em>[Disarming smile.]</em> Yes it was an even game. We had good chances, Man United also. We didn\u2019t defend the goal well. But we reacted good and were in it at the end. It was a proper game. I am disappointed to go out, because we\u2019re frustrated, we performed well, but I am happy with the boys and our support. We played good so we have to be confident.\u201d As for the disallowed goal? \u201cThat\u2019s VAR! You cannot do anything. We celebrate, then the other celebration was louder.

That\u2019s because 1980 was the last time they won at Old Trafford. John Richards set up Mel Eves to score the only goal that day, knocking a big dent in United\u2019s title hopes for that season. \u201cWe were a bit below par,\u201d shrugged United boss Dave Sexton.</p> <p><strong>United were a bit below par at Molineux 11 days ago, too. </strong>Wolves weren\u2019t much better. Both sides will need to up their game if they\u2019re to win this. Wolves, already 38 matches into a Homeric season, are on a run of four without a win; United, by contrast, are coming off the back of an impressive rhythm-relocating four-goal thumping of Norwich City. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s young team are therefore favourites to advance to a fourth-round tie at Tranmere Rovers or Watford, team selection permitting. But Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s fine side will find their form again at some point, and why not tonight? So it promises to be an entertaining evening, not least because it surely can\u2019t be worse than the first one.

      "bodyText": "Anyway, that\u2019s your lot. Jamie Jackson was at Old Trafford this evening, and here\u2019s his verdict. Click, enjoy, and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! And now a word with Nuno. Some comical confusion as Nuno misunderstands Des Kelly\u2019s opening question: there wasn\u2019t a lot between the two sides, was there? \u201cYes there was! You never see a good game! It has to be the best game for you to enjoy it! It was a good game.\u201d No, I said there wasn\u2019t a big gap ... \u201cAh! No, no, no. I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t understand! I\u2019m sorry! [Disarming smile.] Yes it was an even game. We had good chances, Man United also. We didn\u2019t defend the goal well. But we reacted good and were in it at the end. It was a proper game. I am disappointed to go out, because we\u2019re frustrated, we performed well, but I am happy with the boys and our support. We played good so we have to be confident.\u201d As for the disallowed goal? \u201cThat\u2019s VAR! You cannot do anything. We celebrate, then the other celebration was louder. So now we are celebrating non-goals. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Ole talks. \u201cYou can see there were two teams that were tired. End to end, an open game, we wanted to control the game. But you don\u2019t get an easier draw in the next round if you win 4-0, so 1-0 is enough. We finally beat Wolverhampton. Mata is different class, he has the skill and composure ... and even the pace to get through there!\u201d A cheeky grin there. And the note? \u201cI thought we went out of shape so I adjusted it for five to ten minutes before half time.\u201d As for Marcus Rashford? \u201cYeah, that backfired, but you have to go for them once in a while. Seems like he\u2019s got a knock there and couldn\u2019t run. Let\u2019s test him in the next couple of days, and hopefully he\u2019ll be OK for Sunday. He has struggled with a knock on his back, and got another one there.\u201d And finally, is there any transfer news? \u201cNo updates.\u201d Another cheeky smile. The match-winner Juan Mata speaks. \u201cThey are a difficult team, they play in a certain way, they do it very well, and it\u2019s difficult to break them down. But today has been a good result for us, we\u2019ve had a good couple of days, and now we\u2019ve got a big one coming [Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday] so hopefully we can keep it up. Luckily I put the ball in the net. It wasn\u2019t offside, I was waiting for the VAR, you have to wait nowadays, but I was happy. We wanted to beat them, finally, and we did that today.\u201d What was on the note his manager passed to him in the fist half? \u201cIt was a list of grocery shopping, bread, milk and all those things!\u201d Zinger of the evening as well as a fine goal. A sour note for Vinagre, who appears to have pulled a hamstring in the final stages. He\u2019s down getting treatment. Wolves have now played 38 games this season, and this is maybe the cost. With their Europa League campaign in mind, perhaps an early exit from the FA Cup will be seen as a blessing in disguise ... once the pain of defeat subsides, of course. So close to the final last year; they\u2019ll have to wait at least another season to scratch that 60-year itch. Meanwhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer almost levitates down the tunnel, gliding along serenely, still dreaming of United\u2019s 13th FA Cup and his first bit of silverware as manager of the club. United have done enough! Just. Not a classic, not their best performance, but getting through is all that matters. They\u2019ll meet either Tranmere Rovers or Watford thanks to a lovely goal by Juan Mata. 90 min +4: Wolves send it upfield. Martial takes up possession and brings it back towards their box. He sets up Pereira, who curls weakly into Ruddy\u2019s arms. But that should be enough. 90 min +3: Maguire hooks it into the corner. The clock ticks on. Eventually Martial is caught offside. Wolves have one chance to hit this long and take United to extra time. 90 min +2: Jimenez clatters into Maguire. A garden-variety free kick in the midfield. Maguire takes the opportunity to run down the clock as he prepares to take. 90 min +1: The resulting corner is an overly intricate non-event. Buur is eventually flagged offside. This all happens in the first of four additional minutes. 90 min: Buur busies himself down the right and slips a pass into the box for Dendoncker, who crosses and hits Lindelof on the forearm. Wolves want a penalty, but Lindelof had made no move towards the ball, his arm wasn\u2019t in an unnatural position, and the pair were too close anyway, the defender with no time to react. 88 min: Oskar Buur, a 21-year-old Danish defender, comes on for Traore. He\u2019s making his FA Cup debut. 86 min: Jimenez dances down the right and reaches the byline. His chipped cross is an inch too high for Gibbs-White, free in the middle, six yards out. Old Trafford collectively catches its breath. 85 min: Martial wins a corner down the left off Neves. Pereira\u2019s hard-hit corner is flicked on by Matic at the near post, but there\u2019s nobody there to bundle the ball home. 84 min: Vinagre dribbles down the middle. United are backpedalling, and he\u2019s got options either side. So he takes his eye off the ball ... and steps on it, mid-flight. United clear their lines, and Dendoncker is booked for a frustrated check on Fred. 82 min: Doherty works his way down the left and wins a corner off Lindelof. Moutinho takes. With the six-yard box crammed with players, he pulls one back for Neves, alone on the edge of the box. Neves aims for the top left, but while it\u2019s not the worst effort, it\u2019s always going high and wide. 80 min: The tension at Old Trafford is palpable. A big ten minutes, plus stoppages, coming up for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 79 min: Nope, Rashford is down again, struggling, holding his back. He\u2019s able to get up and walk off down the tunnel, to be replaced by Jesse Lingard. 78 min: Traore\u2019s cross from the right is brought down by Jimenez, ten yards out and level with the left-hand post. But he can\u2019t sort his feet out. For a second, it looked as though Wolves had opened United up. 77 min: But Rashford is made of strong stuff, and he\u2019s back up, determined to continue. United will hope that\u2019s just a sore knock picked up when coming together with Doherty, rather than anything more serious. 76 min: Rashford is down, shaking his head and holding his lower back. This doesn\u2019t look good for United\u2019s star striker, especially with the north-west derby at Anfield looming on Sunday. 75 min: Before the free kick can be taken, Vinagre replaces Jonny. Moutinho\u2019s delivery is cleared by Maguire, dealing with the problem he caused himself. 74 min: Wolves get the free kick here, though, as Maguire scythes Jimenez with a sliding tackle from behind. That\u2019s as agricultural as it gets, an obvious booking and free kick. 73 min: Lindelof and Traore crash into each other as the pair chase a long ball down the Wolves right. Traore wants a free kick in a dangerous position, but it\u2019s deemed a 50-50 shoulder challenge and we play on. 71 min: That was Neto\u2019s last contribution. He\u2019s replaced by the promising Morgan Gibbs-White, sent on by Nuno to make his name in the cup. 70 min: Wolves try to hit back immediately, Neto jigging his way down the right and drawing a couple of players. He should slip Traore free down the middle, but overhits his diagonal dink and it\u2019s a goal kick. 68 min: There\u2019s a ludicrous wait as VAR sticks its unwanted neb in. A check for offside. But Mata was clearly on. In the dugout, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wears the wide grin of a cream-enhanced cat. Doherty strips Pereira with ease and powers down the right. He enters the box, dances along the touchline, but is robbed by Maguire. United counter. Martial drifts in from the left and dinks a ball down the middle, with Wolves light at the back. Mata draws Ruddy, and chips the keeper elegantly to break the deadlock! 66 min: United push Wolves back, though they\u2019re not sure how to open them up in the final third. Eventually Wan-Bissaka bursts down the right, and hooks a cross into the mixer. Unfortunately for United, nobody in red has taken a chance and there\u2019s nobody in the middle. All a bit static up front for the hosts. 64 min: Greenwood and James are replaced by Pereira and Rashford. United take a short free kick and tippy-tap it about in the midfield. 63 min: Moutinho skittles Fred, 35 yards out. But before the free kick can be taken, United prepare a double change ... 61 min: Neto nearly bursts clear down the right. He enters the box, but can\u2019t shake off his nemesis Williams, the young defender staying strong and earning a huge cheer from the home faithful as he eventually wins possession and clears the danger. He\u2019s a real prospect, this lad. 59 min: Neto is booked for a late slide on Williams. He can have no complaints, but makes one anyway, in the theatrical manner. 58 min: Traore turns on the jets and speeds past Wan-Bissaka down the left. He nearly gets past Maguire, too, but the defender toe-pokes the ball out of his road. Just in time, because Traore would have been in on goal. 56 min: Fred clips Traore\u2019s heel as the Wolves winger whips through the centre circle. Just a free kick, but the United midfielder, already in the book, wants to watch himself here. Another one of those could test the ref\u2019s patience. 55 min: Neto sails past a static Maguire, down the right. He stands one up for Jimenez in the middle. Lindelof does well to read the danger and head clear. United continue to give up chances. 54 min: Neves launches a shot towards the train tracks. Miles over the bar. 52 min: Much better from United! Martial works down the left and checks back. He rolls back up the wing for Williams, who plays a cute reverse pass down the channel to release James into the area. James sends a low fizzer across Ruddy and inches wide of the right-hand post. A lovely move. 50 min: Traore makes good down the left. His cross is no good. United play out from the back. Fred plays yet another poor pass, a short backwards fluff that nearly lets Traore in down the left. Lindelof steps in and mops up. 49 min: Wolves are sitting deep, and United don\u2019t seem too sure what to do. Martial, Greenwood and James aren\u2019t moving, the midfield have few options. Eventually Mata has a rasp from 25 yards, hoping to find the top right. Easy for Ruddy. A few grumbles from the home support as United toil. 48 min: Ruddy launches long. Jimenez nearly gets in down the right, but Romero comes out of his box to deal with the danger. Not for the first time either. 47 min: A quiet start to the second half as United stroke the ball around the back, and an atmosphere at an under-capacity Old Trafford to match. United get the second half underway. They\u2019re now kicking towards the Stretford End. No changes. Half-time reading. Three halves of football, and still no goals between these two. Neto, who had one disallowed, theatrically cocks his head back and wails at the stars for the benefit of the half-time cameras. Still no real idea which way this tie will turn. We\u2019ll find out soon enough, even if we need extra time and penalties. No flipping! 45 min: Fred dinks a cute pass down the inside right for Mata, who would have been one on one but for Dendoncker\u2019s extended leg, hooking into the air. Greenwood can\u2019t bring the ball down in the Wolves area, and the flag goes up for offside anyway. 44 min: Back up the other end, Williams winning a corner off Doherty on the left. Mata takes, but doesn\u2019t beat the first man. Wolves clear. Jonny and Williams collide on the halfway line, and grab a chunk of each other\u2019s shirt. For a second it looks like properly kicking off, but the ref\u2019s in quickly to defuse the situation and the pair clasp hands amiably enough. There\u2019s nice. 42 min: James breaks down the inside-left channel, racing after Greenwood\u2019s pass from deep, and warms Ruddy\u2019s hands with a powerful shot. Wolves break up the other end, Jonny reaching a deep position on the left, but failing to find a man in the middle. Moutinho tries again, but crosses too deep in looking for Doherty at the far post. Goal kick. 40 min: This is better, though, Fred dribbling with purpose down the right and winning a corner off Saiss. Mata plays it short. A couple of slow passes by Fred and Williams, then James wins United a second go. This one is hung up for Ruddy to claim easily. A little better. 39 min: Not much of a cup atmosphere right now. The travelling Wolves fans making the most noise at the minute. United haven\u2019t done too much to get the home faithful going. 37 min: Mata has finished reading Ole\u2019s note. He furrows his brow, looking a bit confused/concerned. Another lesson at half-time might be required. In other admin news, Fred is booked for repeated fouling. 36 min: While Mata does the homework he\u2019s been set, Neves goes about playmaking for Wolves, scooping a fine pass down the right. Doherty is onside and in acres, but once again Romero reads the play well, sensing the danger, racing out of his area to high-kick clear. 35 min: Both managers are prowling on the touchline. Nuno applauds his team; Ole, less content, passes a note to Mata. 33 min: Matic gives up possession cheaply to Doherty, who feeds Jonny and bursts down the right. Jonny runs into trouble, and suddenly Doherty is miles out of position. Martial takes advantage, zipping down the United left and sailing inside. A fine run, but the shot at the end of it flies straight at Ruddy. 32 min: Traore glides down the left and crosses for Jimenez, who loops a weak header into the arms of Romero. United are making problems for themselves; that all began when Lindelof played a lazy ball out of defence that was easily intercepted. 30 min: Wolves hit the post! Matic is robbed by Traore on the halfway line. Jimenez is sent scampering down the left, and wins a corner. The set piece is worked short again. Neves chips in from the left. Doherty, coming in from the right, heads across the rooted Romero and onto the base of the left-hand post. Jimenez can\u2019t knock the rebound in, but the flag goes up for offside anyway. It\u2019s not clear whether Doherty had strayed off; Jimenez almost certainly was for the rebound. Either way, United survive again. 28 min: A long ball down the Wolves right. Williams dawdles, nearly letting Neto in. Romero comes off his line to claim well. United go straight up the other end, Mata slapping a low shot straight at Ruddy, who parries well. 26 min: Wan-Bissaka launches himself down the right, and nearly breaks into the box, before running the ball out of play. Wolves go up the other end, Traore ripping the ball away from a dithering Matic and nearly releasing Neto down the right. Williams, tracking back eagerly, reads the play brilliantly to intercept and stub out the danger. 24 min: The second corner comes to nothing. United have enjoyed two-thirds of the possession so far, but Wolves are looking dangerous nonetheless. 23 min: Jonny nearly makes it past Wan-Bissaka down the left and into the area, but the United full back loves a tackle, and he slides in to concede a corner. Wolves play it short. Moutinho crosses. Lindelof nearly eyebrows the ball into the top-right corner of his own net, but Matic is again on hand to rescue United. He flicks a header off the line and out for another corner. 21 min: Fred drops a shoulder to make space for himself, just to the left of the Wolves D. His shot isn\u2019t particularly good, but pings off Dendoncker\u2019s back. A corner, which allows Fred another go from distance. He hooks this one harmlessly over the bar from 20 yards. A flashy attempt at chipping the keeper from the edge of the box. Ambitious, to say the least. He\u2019d have been better putting his laces through that one. 19 min: A pause as Jimenez gets treatment after being (legally) clattered by Lindelof. The Wolves striker is up and about again soon enough. 18 min: United ping it around the middle of the park awhile. They go nowhere. Suddenly James bursts down the left but he can\u2019t get past Dendoncker. Patient play by the hosts. 16 min: Another loose pass by United, Williams and Fred confusing each other in the middle of the park. Jimenez races off with it and flicks a pass down the right for Neto. Fortunately for United, Matic is on point to get back and usher the Wolves player out for a goal kick. That\u2019s excellent defending. 14 min: Greenwood hoicks long. James brings the pass down and tees up Martial, who pulls a lame shot well wide right from distance. Plenty of chances being made at both ends. 12 min: That\u2019s extremely unfortunate for Wolves, who have been undone by VAR. But the officials had no choice, given the laws of the game at the moment. Maguire and Fred can breathe again. 10 min: Wolves score ... or do they? A poor Fred backpass down the Wolves left, and Jimenez latches onto the ball. Maguire challenges weakly, and the ball breaks to Neto, who takes a touch before calmly slotting the ball into the bottom right. Awful defending by United, but they get away with it, because Maguire had deflected the ball up onto Jimenez\u2019s hand - accidentally, no intent - and rules are rules. 9 min: Matic is extremely lucky to escape censure for a cynical tug on Traore. A bit later in the match, and that was surely a yellow. 8 min: Wolves should be ahead. Traore turns on the jets and burns towards the byline on the left. He whips a low cross in for Jimenez, who takes a touch and shifts the ball between his feet on the penalty spot, sending Maguire and Williams the wrong way. He\u2019s free, but having done the hard work, sends a pea-roller into the arms of Romero. 7 min: Quite a few empty seats at Old Trafford this evening. It\u2019s far from a sell-out. 5 min: This is absurdly open in the early stages. First up, Wan-Bissaka drops a shoulder to make good down the right, but overruns the ball as he enters the box. The chance to shoot is gone as Ruddy smothers. Then down the other end, Neto has a lash from the right-hand corner of the United box. The ball flies inches past the left-hand post. Romero, who had let the effort sail by in the passive style, wears the look of a man who knew the shot was always going wide, but he\u2019s surely kidding. That was too close for comfort. 3 min: Mata, quarterbacking from deep, lifts a clever ball over the top down the inside-right channel. James springs a high offside trap, and tries to round Ruddy. Had he managed to do so, he\u2019d have been rolling the ball into an empty net. But Ruddy refuses to be beaten, and sticks out a strong arm to deny him. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 1 min: Wolves make an early statement of intent, Traore skedaddling down the inside-left channel and forcing United on the back foot immediately. He\u2019s forced to check back. He tries again. Fred takes him down. The resulting free kick is quickly taken, but doesn\u2019t catch United sleeping, and Jonny runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. And we\u2019re off! Wolves get this third-round replay underway. They\u2019ll be kicking towards the Stretford End in this first half. Before the action hots up, here\u2019s Paul from Spain, reminiscing about the aforementioned 1979 Richards-McIlroy match. \u201cI remember being at that Wolves game, walking to Molineux singing \u2018we\u2019ll be top by five o\u2019clock\u2019. But we lost and we weren\u2019t.\u201d The teams are out! A fine cup-tie atmosphere at Old Trafford. This is the one. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. But in the meantime, oh dear, what can we do, Wolves are in black and John Hubbard\u2019s feeling blue. \u201cLeaving aside VAR, the absurd handball rule and everything else that spoils modern football, the one big change that I\u2019m sure fans want to see is a rule that says away strips must not be worn unless in the referee\u2019s view there is an *actual* colour clash. Wolves\u2019 old gold should be worn tonight instead of dull black.\u201d Preach on, brother. Then a word with Nuno Espirito Santo. \u201cWe take all the games seriously, our approach is always the same. The entire squad is ready. We played good at Molineux, though I recall in the first half we struggled. We are going to face a very tough opponent, a fantastic team, a very good stadium in Old Trafford. So this is a good time to challenge ourselves and make a good performance.\u201d Both managers look relaxed yet determined as they talk to BT Sport. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is first up: \u201cWe have scored quite a few goals in the last few games at Old Trafford, so hopefully we can find some of that here. We want to go through. Sergio is in for David and Dan is in for Marcus, who has had loads of football. If it was a cup final he would probably play tonight but we have Sunday [against Liverpool] in mind. And Andreas is out and Mason is in for him. So we go here to create chances and try to win the game. All the games we have had against Wolverhampton were tight affairs. We have had the majority of the possession but they are always dangerous on counter attacks and set plays so we know it\u2019s going to be a hard game.\u201d Manchester United will of course be sporting devilish red tonight. Wolves could wear their famous old gold if they so desired, but instead will be trotting out in second-choice black with gold trim. Look! In lieu of old gold, here\u2019s John Richards wearing some in late 1979. Has there ever been a better Wolves shirt? The United top Sammy McIlroy has on isn\u2019t half bad either. The Wembley cup logo suggests it\u2019s the same one he wore while netting an ultimately futile equaliser in the final a few months previously. Full-time result: a high-scoring draw between Umbro and Admiral. Manchester United make three changes to the team sent out to beat Norwich City on Saturday. Mason Greenwood replaces Marcus Rashford up front; Sergio Romero takes David de Gea\u2019s gloves; and Daniel James comes in for Andreas Pereira. Wolves make just one change to the side that drew 1-1 with Newcastle United at the weekend. John Ruddy takes Rui Patricio\u2019s spot in between the sticks. Manchester United: Romero, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Matic, Greenwood, Mata, James, Martial. Subs: Jones, Rashford, Grant, Lingard, Andreas Pereira, Dalot, Chong. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Ruddy, Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Joao Moutinho, Neves, Jonny, Traore, Jimenez, Pedro Neto. Subs: Bennett, Rui Patricio, Gibbs-White, Ruben Vinagre, Kilman, Ashley-Seal, Rasmussen. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). Wolves last won the FA Cup in 1960. Here\u2019s their legendary captain Bill Slater hoisting the famous old pot at the famous old Wembley, moments after Stan Cullis\u2019s side saw off Blackburn Rovers 3-0. Sixty years ago! Though if Conor Coady wants to follow in Slater\u2019s footsteps come May, Wolves will only need to start by turning the clock back 40 years tonight. That\u2019s because 1980 was the last time they won at Old Trafford. John Richards set up Mel Eves to score the only goal that day, knocking a big dent in United\u2019s title hopes for that season. \u201cWe were a bit below par,\u201d shrugged United boss Dave Sexton. United were a bit below par at Molineux 11 days ago, too. Wolves weren\u2019t much better. Both sides will need to up their game if they\u2019re to win this. Wolves, already 38 matches into a Homeric season, are on a run of four without a win; United, by contrast, are coming off the back of an impressive rhythm-relocating four-goal thumping of Norwich City. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s young team are therefore favourites to advance to a fourth-round tie at Tranmere Rovers or Watford, team selection permitting. But Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s fine side will find their form again at some point, and why not tonight? So it promises to be an entertaining evening, not least because it surely can\u2019t be worse than the first one. It\u2019s on! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT.",

Juan Mata had shone against Norwich and he was to prove the matchwinner in an impressive performance. His pass put James away and only a deft hand from the excellent John Ruddy thwarted the winger.</p> <p>Wolves\u2019 Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez fashioned a clear sight of Sergio Romero\u2019s goal via a swivel that sent Brandon Williams, Harry Maguire and Nemanja Matic into a different postcode. Adama Traor\u00e9 had delivered a pinpoint pass to the striker only for him to hit the ball straight at the United goalkeeper.</p> <p>It was all part of a breathless start that was about to have the latest instalment in the VAR soap opera. Fred and Matic had a farcical mix-up in which the former smacked the ball off the latter into Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s path. Yet when Maguire went to challenge the ball ricocheted off the striker\u2019s right hand and, though Neto finished, VAR ruled the effort out. Jim\u00e9nez was looking the other way and thus had no part in the action but this was the correct decision.</p> <p>Cue frustration for Wolves and gleeful schadenfreude for the United faithful. The emotions were reversed when a sharp Aaron Wan-Bissaka pass released Anthony Martial only for him to slide to the turf.</p> <p>Next up in an open and entertaining contest was a corner won by Jonny. Jo\u00e3o Moutinho took it short, received the ball back and United were relieved to clear his cross. Later, they had a lucky escape: a Jonny cross was headed by Matt Doherty past Romero but rebounded off a post. Jim\u00e9nez looked to pounce but was ruled offside.</p> <p>A helter-skelter first half had Matic giving the ball away, chasing and winning it back, before beginning an attack that had Martial scampering forward but he could shoot only tamely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35bf4119c03d7ce90a4080a2038aee211ac5454c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35bf4119c03d7ce90a4080a2038aee211ac5454c/0_104_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolves\u2019 Neto rifles past Sergio Romero in the first half only for the effort to be disallowed by VAR for handball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolves\u2019 Neto rifles past Sergio Romero in the first half only for the effort to be disallowed by VAR for handball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A note was passed by Solskj\u00e6r to Mata and the latter later joked about what it contained. \u201cIt was a list of grocery shopping, bread milk and other things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r was more revealing. \u201cA couple of times we went out of shape \u2013 we adjusted it for five-10 minutes before half-time,\u201d the United manager said.</p> <p>Each manager\u2019s instructions for the second half will have been similar: tighten up at the back and be more ruthless when opportunity knocked.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r had Rashford warming up and the 22-year-old had a front\u2011seat view from the touchline of James firing past Ruddy and coming close to breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>Any control for United came via Matic and Fred in midfield though they were still vulnerable when Wolves wrested back possession, moved forward and worked the ball to the eager Jim\u00e9nez. But he, again, missed with an attempt from an angle.</p> <p>Quality had taken a downturn. Even Kevin Friend seemed affected, the referee showing Neto a yellow card when Williams appeared to jump over his leg rather than be felled by it. Yet the left-back did impress with a show of pacy, muscular defending that took him back alongside Neto as he sprinted into the area. The 19-year-old dispossessing the winger and cleared the danger while drawing applause from his goalkeeper.</p> <p>On 65 minutes Solskj\u00e6r removed James for Rashford and Greenwood for Andreas Pereira. And now, at last, Mata struck: the playmaker ran on to a Martial through ball and expertly chipped Ruddy.\u201cI had a lot of time and it\u2019s not good, better not to have time when you are facing a goalkeeper,\u201d Mata said.</p> <p>Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was disappointed. \u201cIt is frustrating when you perform well and go out,\u201d the Wolves manager said.</p>",

Juan Mata had shone against Norwich and he was to prove the matchwinner in an impressive performance. His pass put James away and only a deft hand from the excellent John Ruddy thwarted the winger. Wolves\u2019 Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez fashioned a clear sight of Sergio Romero\u2019s goal via a swivel that sent Brandon Williams, Harry Maguire and Nemanja Matic into a different postcode. Adama Traor\u00e9 had delivered a pinpoint pass to the striker only for him to hit the ball straight at the United goalkeeper. It was all part of a breathless start that was about to have the latest instalment in the VAR soap opera. Fred and Matic had a farcical mix-up in which the former smacked the ball off the latter into Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s path. Yet when Maguire went to challenge the ball ricocheted off the striker\u2019s right hand and, though Neto finished, VAR ruled the effort out. Jim\u00e9nez was looking the other way and thus had no part in the action but this was the correct decision. Cue frustration for Wolves and gleeful schadenfreude for the United faithful. The emotions were reversed when a sharp Aaron Wan-Bissaka pass released Anthony Martial only for him to slide to the turf. Next up in an open and entertaining contest was a corner won by Jonny. Jo\u00e3o Moutinho took it short, received the ball back and United were relieved to clear his cross. Later, they had a lucky escape: a Jonny cross was headed by Matt Doherty past Romero but rebounded off a post. Jim\u00e9nez looked to pounce but was ruled offside. A helter-skelter first half had Matic giving the ball away, chasing and winning it back, before beginning an attack that had Martial scampering forward but he could shoot only tamely. A note was passed by Solskj\u00e6r to Mata and the latter later joked about what it contained. \u201cIt was a list of grocery shopping, bread milk and other things,\u201d he said. Solskj\u00e6r was more revealing. \u201cA couple of times we went out of shape \u2013 we adjusted it for five-10 minutes before half-time,\u201d the United manager said. Each manager\u2019s instructions for the second half will have been similar: tighten up at the back and be more ruthless when opportunity knocked. Solskj\u00e6r had Rashford warming up and the 22-year-old had a front\u2011seat view from the touchline of James firing past Ruddy and coming close to breaking the deadlock. Any control for United came via Matic and Fred in midfield though they were still vulnerable when Wolves wrested back possession, moved forward and worked the ball to the eager Jim\u00e9nez. But he, again, missed with an attempt from an angle. Quality had taken a downturn. Even Kevin Friend seemed affected, the referee showing Neto a yellow card when Williams appeared to jump over his leg rather than be felled by it. Yet the left-back did impress with a show of pacy, muscular defending that took him back alongside Neto as he sprinted into the area. The 19-year-old dispossessing the winger and cleared the danger while drawing applause from his goalkeeper. On 65 minutes Solskj\u00e6r removed James for Rashford and Greenwood for Andreas Pereira. And now, at last, Mata struck: the playmaker ran on to a Martial through ball and expertly chipped Ruddy.\u201cI had a lot of time and it\u2019s not good, better not to have time when you are facing a goalkeeper,\u201d Mata said. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was disappointed. \u201cIt is frustrating when you perform well and go out,\u201d the Wolves manager said.",

Not everyone agrees that they represent the origins of complex life. But the theory\u2019s proponents suggest that one of these cells could have engulfed a bacterium, with the bacteria then going on to become structures known as mitochondria, which act as an internal power supply in all complex cells today. Bacteria and archaea lack this internal architecture.<br><br>The Japanese team suggest that Asgard\u2019s newly revealed spaghetti-like tendrils could have engulfed a passing bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with it. After several evolutionary leaps, the two organisms could have become one, more complex, cell type \u2013 a primitive eukaryote.</p> <p>The scenario is still speculative and is likely to remain under active debate for the next decade. Either way, the advance is likely to trigger a resurgence of interest in these under-explored microbes.</p> <p>\u201cThe importance of this work \u2013 it\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d said Lane. \u201cYou see these genome sequences and try and reconstruct what the cell might look like, but you can\u2019t do that with any real power.

They sequenced microbial DNA extracted from mud from a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Greenland. One intriguing genome stood out: it was clearly a member of the archaea, but dotted through its DNA were genes similar to those seen in eukaryotic cells. Scientists called it the Asgard archaea and suggested that the ancestors of this evolutionary branch could have bridged the gap between basic and complex life billions of years earlier. When the Japanese team sequenced their samples, genetic analysis revealed they had managed to cultivate the same Asgard archaea. Until this point, scientists had found out the genetic code, but had no idea what the organism actually looked like. The latest work reveals that the Asgard archaea are small simple cells, but feature long tentacle-like structures reaching out of the cells. Not everyone agrees that they represent the origins of complex life. But the theory\u2019s proponents suggest that one of these cells could have engulfed a bacterium, with the bacteria then going on to become structures known as mitochondria, which act as an internal power supply in all complex cells today. Bacteria and archaea lack this internal architecture. The Japanese team suggest that Asgard\u2019s newly revealed spaghetti-like tendrils could have engulfed a passing bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with it. After several evolutionary leaps, the two organisms could have become one, more complex, cell type \u2013 a primitive eukaryote. The scenario is still speculative and is likely to remain under active debate for the next decade. Either way, the advance is likely to trigger a resurgence of interest in these under-explored microbes. \u201cThe importance of this work \u2013 it\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d said Lane. \u201cYou see these genome sequences and try and reconstruct what the cell might look like, but you can\u2019t do that with any real power. Finally you see what the cell looks like and it\u2019s not what anyone expected.\u201d",

The case revolves around allegations of breach of copyright, invasion of privacy and misuse of personal data after the newspaper published excerpts from a letter she sent to her father complaining about his treatment of her. But documents filed at the high court revealed the paper will argue that Meghan is a \u201cmajor public figure, whose fitness to perform royal duties on behalf of the Crown and to be the recipient of public money is a proper matter for public scrutiny\u201d. In the defence, lawyers for Associated Newspapers state she \u201cdid not have a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d for the letter\u2019s contents because there was \u201cno mutual understanding\u201d between the duchess and her father that the correspondence should remain secret. The defence states that the newspaper will seek disclosure from Meghan of her exchanges with her friend Jessica Mulroney about allegedly providing information to the media to influence what was published. The newspaper\u2019s submission also refers to a text message sent to Thomas Markle signed, \u2018Love M and H\u2019, which \u201cread as if it was from Prince Harry \u2026 admonishing Mr Markle for talking to the press and telling him to stop and accusing Mr Markle of causing hurt to his daughter\u201d. The fact that the letter was handwritten in such a clear manner is further evidence that it was sent by Meghan \u201cwith a view to it being read by third parties and/or disclosed to the public\u201d, the Mail on Sunday\u2019s lawyers maintain. \u201cThe letter appears to have been being immaculately copied out by [Meghan] in her own elaborate handwriting from a previous draft.

The failure to manage them properly over the last decade is a national scandal, which could properly be added to the long list of problems that the recently announced Royal Commission on Criminal Justice has to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>The latest update on big Home Office projects, published in July 2019, admitted that the Leds super-database had been given a \u201cred\u201d rating in a review \u2013 meaning it could be undeliverable. It was first announced by May in 2016 as part of her modern crime prevention strategy.</p> <p>Weekly meetings of programme directors were set up and a \u201cseries of recommendations to address affordability and deliverability challenges\u201d were agreed.</p> <p>The report revealed that costs for Leds in 2018-19 alone had risen by 22% to reach \u00a382m, putting the overall price tag of the scheme at \u00a3469m.</p> <p>A Home Office budget estimate submitted to parliament in May 2019 insisted the super-database would \u201ccreate a cheaper, more flexible IT infrastructure that will provide better information and link more data between law enforcement and public protection agencies\u201d.</p> <p>But it admitted the programme had been \u201crecently reset\u201d and the new target was for the old PNC (which holds details of millions of convictions) and PND (covering intelligence reports) to be switched off in 2022 and 2023 respectively.</p> <p>As the Guardian revealed, a software error with the PNC dating back five years has meant that an estimated one in three conviction alerts on foreign nationals has not been sent to police in their home countries.</p> <p>And minutes of a board meeting by the international criminal records office show that the backlog of missed notifications may never be passed on to EU countries \u2013 because the Home Office fears the \u201creputational impact\u201d.</p> <p>MPs are calling for an inquiry into the scandal.

The central authority for the exchange of criminal records is working at pace to implement the technical fixes which will ensure that all the correct data is shared with EU members.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said: \u201cThe Police National Computer and Police National Database will be replaced by the new Law Enforcement Data Service.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the complexity, it will now be delivered through a phased approach starting this year and is on track for completion in 2023.

She is accused of \u201cstarving\u201d the crucial police national computer (PNC) of money against advice from forces when she was home secretary, and instead pushing ahead with an ambitious and costly super-database to replace it that is now years behind schedule and millions of pounds over budget. Her decision is said to have led to serious problems developing with the \u201ccreaking\u201d PNC \u2013 including its failure to send details of 75,000 foreign nationals convicted in the UK to their home countries, in a scandal revealed by the Guardian this week. The Home Office is now desperately trying to fix the software glitch that has gone unnoticed for five years, while May\u2019s planned replacement system \u2013 known as the Law Enforcement Data Service (Leds) \u2013 is now due to cost \u00a3469m and will not be working fully until 2023.

The failure to manage them properly over the last decade is a national scandal, which could properly be added to the long list of problems that the recently announced Royal Commission on Criminal Justice has to deal with.\u201d The latest update on big Home Office projects, published in July 2019, admitted that the Leds super-database had been given a \u201cred\u201d rating in a review \u2013 meaning it could be undeliverable. It was first announced by May in 2016 as part of her modern crime prevention strategy. Weekly meetings of programme directors were set up and a \u201cseries of recommendations to address affordability and deliverability challenges\u201d were agreed. The report revealed that costs for Leds in 2018-19 alone had risen by 22% to reach \u00a382m, putting the overall price tag of the scheme at \u00a3469m. A Home Office budget estimate submitted to parliament in May 2019 insisted the super-database would \u201ccreate a cheaper, more flexible IT infrastructure that will provide better information and link more data between law enforcement and public protection agencies\u201d. But it admitted the programme had been \u201crecently reset\u201d and the new target was for the old PNC (which holds details of millions of convictions) and PND (covering intelligence reports) to be switched off in 2022 and 2023 respectively. As the Guardian revealed, a software error with the PNC dating back five years has meant that an estimated one in three conviction alerts on foreign nationals has not been sent to police in their home countries. And minutes of a board meeting by the international criminal records office show that the backlog of missed notifications may never be passed on to EU countries \u2013 because the Home Office fears the \u201creputational impact\u201d. MPs are calling for an inquiry into the scandal. Stephen Doughty, a Labour member of the home affairs select committee in the last parliament, said: \u201cIt is vital the new home affairs committee takes this up urgently once constituted, and I and other members will be asking questions urgently of ministers.\u201d He went on: \u201cIt is clearly in our mutual interest to exchange as much information as possible on, for example, serious criminals, paedophiles and terrorists with trusted partners \u2013 and the revelation of yet another screw-up from the Home Office could put this crucial relationship at risk.\u201d The software error has still not been repaired and so more and more alerts are being missed every day, sources confirmed last night. However, no cases have yet come to light where dangerous offenders have slipped back to Europe undetected to commit further offences as a result of the missing data. The revelations were raised in parliament on Wednesday, with the Labour peer Lord Kennedy of Southwark telling the House of Lords that the Guardian\u2019s \u201crevelation is both shocking and worrying\u201d. He asked: \u201cDoes the minister accept that this is a huge failure on the part of the government and that it is possible that dangerous offenders have returned to their home country without the UK making proper notification to the authorities? \u201cWhen the error was discovered, it was not corrected \u2013 shamefully \u2013 because of the risk of reputational damage to the UK.\u201d Responding for the government, Lord Bethell admitted: \u201cThe noble lord is entirely correct: this is a very serious matter and the government take it very seriously.\u201d He blamed the out-of-date police computer systems and insisted: \u201cWe are currently working hard to upgrade our legacy systems. The central authority for the exchange of criminal records is working at pace to implement the technical fixes which will ensure that all the correct data is shared with EU members.\u201d The Home Office said: \u201cThe Police National Computer and Police National Database will be replaced by the new Law Enforcement Data Service. \u201cGiven the complexity, it will now be delivered through a phased approach starting this year and is on track for completion in 2023. The new system will save \u00a3216m when rolled out nationally. We will continue to monitor progress to ensure the successful delivery of this programme.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 16 January.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Donald Trump has signed the first phase of a new trade agreement with China</strong> after two years of tension between the two superpowers that have rattled economies around the world.<strong> </strong>Some<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-donald-trump\">$250bn worth of US tariffs will stay in place</a> on Chinese industrial goods but tariffs will halve elsewhere on electronics and footwear, while China will buy about $200bn of US goods and services. But analysts have warned this first phase \u201chardly addresses in any substantive way the fundamental sources of trade and economic tensions between the two sides\u201d, suggesting that considerable negotiation still lies ahead.</p> <p><strong>The peak body representing farmers in NSW has questioned the state government\u2019s failure to fund</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/16/nsw-government-fails-to-keep-promise-to-provide-regional-towns-with-renewable-backup-power\">a promise to provide regional towns with renewably sourced emergency backup power</a> during disasters.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 16 January. Top stories Donald Trump has signed the first phase of a new trade agreement with China after two years of tension between the two superpowers that have rattled economies around the world. Some $250bn worth of US tariffs will stay in place on Chinese industrial goods but tariffs will halve elsewhere on electronics and footwear, while China will buy about $200bn of US goods and services. But analysts have warned this first phase \u201chardly addresses in any substantive way the fundamental sources of trade and economic tensions between the two sides\u201d, suggesting that considerable negotiation still lies ahead. The peak body representing farmers in NSW has questioned the state government\u2019s failure to fund a promise to provide regional towns with renewably sourced emergency backup power during disasters. Thirty million dollars had been pledged for the regional community energy fund but the money has not yet been delivered, to the ire of NSW Farmers. \u201cThe bushfire crisis has further prioritised the need for small scale alternative and local renewable energy sources,\u201d it says. \u201cLike many others, dairy farmers on the south coast lost power and had to dump fresh milk and stop milking.\u201d Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, has stepped down alongside his entire government as Vladimir Putin embarks on a sweeping reshuffle of Russia\u2019s leadership. Putin has called for a national referendum to reform the constitution, installing future two-term presidential limits from 2024, prompting analysts to believe the 67-year-old will look to return as a prime minister with significantly enhanced powers when his current presidential term concludes. The opposition figure Alexei Navalny dismissed the proposals: \u201cWhat idiots (and/or crooks) are all those who said that Putin would leave in 2024\u201d. Australia A specially deployed team of firefighters has successfully prevented the extinction of \u201cdinosaur trees\u201d, with Wollemi pines, recorded as far back as 200m years ago, being saved thanks to \u201can unprecedented environmental protection mission\u201d. The decision to defund a climate change adaptation research body in 2017 has left Australia \u201cnot well positioned\u201d to deal with fires and the \u201csilent killer\u201d of drought, the program\u2019s director has said. The science minister, Karen Andrews, has supported Scott Morrison\u2019s pivot on his government\u2019s climate policy but there are doubts whether backbenchers including Craig Kelly, George Christensen and Barnaby Joyce will toe the new line. An Australian journalist, Scott McIntyre, has received a suspended sentence after being found guilty by a Japanese court of trespassing during an attempt to locate his children, whom he has not seen for eight months. The world Global climate scientists have revealed that the past decade has been the hottest in 150 years, with one researcher calling the succession of records being broken year-on-year \u201cthe drumbeat of the Anthropocene\u201d. Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani has warned Europe its Middle East-based troops \u201ccould be in danger\u201d after the UK and leading EU nations paved the way for the potential reimposition of international sanctions on Iran. The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has named her seven trial managers, allowing the Trump impeachment trial to begin in earnest next week. The president stands accused of obstructing Congress and being guilty of abusing his power. Japan\u2019s environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, will become the nation\u2019s first sitting cabinet minister to take paternity leave, announcing he will leave his post for two weeks in a move many hope will positively impact attitudes towards male parenting. Recommended reads From Patti Smith to Greta Gerwig, Louisa May Alcott\u2019s character Jo March has inspired generations of women. But Little Women\u2019s heroine, like the book\u2019s author, was subjected to strictures of the times that meant an underwhelming resolution of her story. As self-confessed Jo fan, Jo Tovey says the new adaptation of Little Women offers a long-overdue rework. The economic flow-on effects of the Australian bushfires crisis are hard to forecast but as businesses return from January holidays the argument for fiscal stimulus is strong, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cIt is clear that we did not end 2019 with any great sense of economic optimism, and the bushfires will have done nothing to improve that.\u201d He has been targeted by George Christensen and accused of advocating terrorism but Perth-born Abdul Abdullah just wants his art to provoke. \u201cI\u2019m a seventh-generation Australian and I\u2019ve got the Australian sensibility of relentlessly giving people shit,\u201d he tells Jenny Valentish. Listen Twenty months on from their highly publicised royal wedding Harry and Meghan want out, unleashing myriad questions \u2013 from taxpayers\u2019 support for the royals to the future of the institution itself. On this episode of Today in Focus Anushka Asthana speaks with Hadley Freeman, as well as Dan Sabbagh about ongoing intelligence threats from the Chinese telco Huawei. Sport Perhaps the least predictable outcome of the Australian bushfires crisis has been the public redemption of Nick Kyrgios. Having prompted a movement of sports-related philanthropy, now we await on-court redemption, writes Russell Jackson. It\u2019s been 15 years since Australia could lay claim to consistent cricketing dominance but with an unrivalled bowling attack, a generational No 3 unearthed and an undefeated summer under their belts, Sam Perry asks whether Australia are back. Media roundup The NSW Labor leader, Jodi McKay, says the Berejiklian government cannot claim that the state\u2019s bushfire response was a success and is demanding an independent public inquiry into the fires, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. A Chinese-owned company\u2019s plan to tap 100m litres of local groundwater in the drought-hit Southern Downs region of Queensland has left farmers and landholders furious, writes the Australian, after the council approved plans in exchange for upgrading local roads. And bones unearthed in WA in 2017 have been confirmed as being from the largest carnivorous dinosaur found in Australia, the ABC reports. Coming up The Australian Open draw will be announced during a ceremony with defending champions Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka in Melbourne tonight. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 It\u2019s official \u2013 an active sex life past your 50s could keep you smarter, for longer. That\u2019s the verdict of the latest research from Coventry University, which according to Sirin Kale is just one of six good reasons why regular sex could be good for you.

      "body": "<h2>What is the four-hour target?</h2> <p>In 2004 the Labour government required hospitals in England to treat and then discharge, admit or transfer 98% of all patients within four hours of their arrival at an A&amp;E unit. The coalition government cut that to 95% in 2010.</p> <p>2004 was the first time the NHS had ever come under such a target. Before that patients could, and in some cases did, spend many hours \u2013 sometimes days \u2013 waiting for emergency care.</p> <h2>What effect has it had?</h2> <p>It forced hospitals to prioritise the care provided at their emergency departments and ensure that as few people as possible waited beyond four hours. Publication of each NHS trust\u2019s performance figures every month meant none wanted to be named and shamed for missing the target.</p> <p>As a result, A&amp;Es have got more staff and more resources, reflecting their central importance in hospitals. The four-hour standard is the best-known of the NHS\u2019s batch of waiting-time targets. Others cover planned treatment in hospital, cancer care and some forms of mental health treatment.</p> <h2>Did A&amp;E staff embrace the change?</h2> <p>A&amp;E doctors were initially sceptical or opposed to the target. Some still complain that its existence gives people an incentive to go to A&amp;E \u201cbecause it\u2019s the one place in the NHS where the lights are always on\u201d instead of waiting days or even weeks to see a GP, and this has contributed to emergency departments becoming increasingly overwhelmed in recent years. </p> <p>A supposed maximum wait of four hours has encouraged some people to use A&amp;E as an \u201canything and everything\u201d service, for often minor ailments, rather than just accidents and emergencies, they say. However, A&amp;E specialists accept that it has improved care by ensuring that as far as possible patients \u2013 with potentially serious illnesses \u2013 are seen fairly quickly.</p> <h2>Why might the target be axed?</h2> <p>NHS England has been looking into replacing the four-hour wait since 2018. It claims that a more \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d way of measuring A&amp;E performance may well be needed.</p> <p>As Matt Hancock said on Wednesday: \u201cWe will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>But many doctors and NHS experts believe the target may be scrapped simply because of the bad headlines that the increasing inability to deliver it generates every month when the latest performance figures appear.</p> <p>Last month, for example, some trusts dealt with less than 50% of patients within four hours. Overall, hospital A&amp;Es managed to deal with just 68.6% against the 95% target, which has been missed every month since July 2015.</p> <h2>Why are so many people unconvinced by, or opposed to, the idea of replacing the target with a different measure?</h2> <p>Because it has succeeded in its original aim, of ensuring that no one has to wait an unreasonably long time \u2013 which could damage their health. It has \u201cplayed a crucial part in driving improvements in waiting times for patients\u201d, said Prof Donal O\u2019Donoghue of the Royal College of Physicians.</p> <p>Also, the public appear to like the fact that they can access urgent and emergency care quickly. If the target disappears there may be a backlash.</p> <p>Making less sick patients wait longer than four hours while more serious cases get priority \u2013 which would happen if NHS England did replace the target wait \u2013 could involve risk, as some of those may also have a more serious condition, such as a heart problem.</p> <h2>What will happen next?</h2> <p>NHS England\u2019s review group under Prof Stephen Powis, which is looking at waiting times, is continuing its work. Its recommendations will be influenced by the evidence from the 14 NHS trusts that are trialling an alternative to the four-hour guarantee.</p> <p>The strong opposition from senior doctors may makes wholesale abolition of the four-hour target harder to do, given that both NHS leaders and Hancock have said that any alternative has to have the support of clinicians.</p>",

However, A&amp;E specialists accept that it has improved care by ensuring that as far as possible patients \u2013 with potentially serious illnesses \u2013 are seen fairly quickly. Why might the target be axed? NHS England has been looking into replacing the four-hour wait since 2018. It claims that a more \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d way of measuring A&amp;E performance may well be needed. As Matt Hancock said on Wednesday: \u201cWe will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate.\u201d But many doctors and NHS experts believe the target may be scrapped simply because of the bad headlines that the increasing inability to deliver it generates every month when the latest performance figures appear. Last month, for example, some trusts dealt with less than 50% of patients within four hours. Overall, hospital A&amp;Es managed to deal with just 68.6% against the 95% target, which has been missed every month since July 2015. Why are so many people unconvinced by, or opposed to, the idea of replacing the target with a different measure? Because it has succeeded in its original aim, of ensuring that no one has to wait an unreasonably long time \u2013 which could damage their health. It has \u201cplayed a crucial part in driving improvements in waiting times for patients\u201d, said Prof Donal O\u2019Donoghue of the Royal College of Physicians. Also, the public appear to like the fact that they can access urgent and emergency care quickly. If the target disappears there may be a backlash. Making less sick patients wait longer than four hours while more serious cases get priority \u2013 which would happen if NHS England did replace the target wait \u2013 could involve risk, as some of those may also have a more serious condition, such as a heart problem. What will happen next? NHS England\u2019s review group under Prof Stephen Powis, which is looking at waiting times, is continuing its work. Its recommendations will be influenced by the evidence from the 14 NHS trusts that are trialling an alternative to the four-hour guarantee. The strong opposition from senior doctors may makes wholesale abolition of the four-hour target harder to do, given that both NHS leaders and Hancock have said that any alternative has to have the support of clinicians.",

Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams flags the interview for the vice-president\u2019s office.</p> \n<h2>2-3 July</h2> \n<p>At a conference on Ukraine in Toronto, the special envoy Kurt Volker meets one-on-one with Zelenskiy.

According to multiple accounts, after Sondland makes the Biden request, then national security adviser John Bolton abruptly terminates the meeting, later calling it a \u201cdrug deal\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>18 July</strong></h2> \n<p>The Office of Management and Budget <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-ordered-hold-on-military-aid-days-before-calling-ukrainian-president-officials-say/2019/09/23/df93a6ca-de38-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html\">informs</a> the Pentagon and state department that Trump has suspended $391m in military aid for Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D008.pdf\">testimony</a> by the senior diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor: \u201cIn a regular, NSC secure video conference call on 18 July, I heard a staff person from the Office of Management and Budget say that there was a hold on security assistance to Ukraine but could not say why.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>25 July</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump speaks on the phone with Zelenskiy, reminding him that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d and then asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d. Trump wants Ukraine to announce investigations designed to make Joe Biden look bad and to cast doubt on Russian tampering in the 2016 US election.</p> \n<p>That same day, the defense department receives two inquiries from Ukrainian officials about the status of US military aid, according to the deputy assistant secretary of defense, Laura Cooper.</p> \n<h2>26 July</h2> \n<p>Sondland is in Kyiv for meetings with Zelenskiy. He takes David Holmes, a state department official, to lunch. At lunch Sondland orders wine and calls Trump. Sondland tells Trump that Zelenskiy \u201cloves your ass\u201d, according to Holmes\u2019 account, and Trump replies, \u201cSo, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u201d Hanging up, Sondland tells Holmes that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about\u201d Ukraine and \u201conly cares\u201d about the Biden investigation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Early August</strong></h2> \n<p>High-level Ukrainian officials are made aware of the suspension of US military aid designed to help in their fight against Russian forces, according to a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/ukraine-aid-freeze-impeachment.html\">report</a>. But there are indications they were aware even sooner.</p> \n<h2><strong>12 August</strong></h2> \n<p>A whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/whistleblower-trump-ukraine-read-in-full-text-document\">complaint</a> against Trump is secretly filed to the inspector general of the intelligence community. For six weeks, the Trump administration will block Congress from obtaining the complaint.</p> \n<h2><strong>16 August</strong></h2> \n<p>A security council recommendation that aid for Ukraine be released is raised in a meeting with Trump, <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191108_-_vindman_transcript_excerpts_final_-_913864.pdf\">according</a> to Vindman. But \u201cthe president didn\u2019t act on the recommendation\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Late August</h2> \n<p>Bolton meets with Trump one-on-one in the Oval Office and encourages him to release military aid. \u201cThe president was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistance,\u201d the Bolton aide Tim Morrison later testified.</p> \n<h2><strong>27 August</strong></h2> \n<p>Bolton visits Taylor in Kyiv. Taylor brings up his concerns about suspended military aid. Bolton is \u201cvery sympathetic\u201d, Taylor later <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D008.pdf\">testifies</a>, and tells him to send a cable directly to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, raising his concerns.</p> \n<h2>28 August</h2> \n<p>Politico publishes the article, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531\">Trump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia</a>. Taylor testified he was not aware of Ukrainians knowing about the suspension before the publication of this article.</p> \n<h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> \n<p>Bilateral meetings in Warsaw. Zelenskiy sits down with Pence and immediately brings up the suspension of aid. Separately, Sondland meets with the Zelenskiy aide Andriy Yermak and tells him \u201cthat resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks\u201d, according to Sondland.</p> \n<h2>7 September</h2> \n<p>In a phone call, Trump tells Sondland \u201cthat there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelenskiy must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it\u201d, <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191114_-_morrison_transcript_excerpts_final.pdf\">according to</a> Morrison.</p> \n<h2><strong>9 September</strong></h2> \n<p>Taylor texts Sondland: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>The intelligence community inspector general transmits a letter to the House intelligence committee notifying it of the existence of a whistleblower complaint.</p> \n<h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> \n<p>The military aid<strong> </strong>is released.</p> \n<h2><strong>24 September</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8e23cecd-2522-407e-bb53-989b0937aa05\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Q-pdDV_Fqk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/pelosi-impeachment-inquiry-trump-ukraine\">announces a formal impeachment inquiry</a>, accusing Trump of \u201ca betrayal of his oath of office, a betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>25 September</strong></h2> \n<p>The White House releases a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-ukraine-president-phone-call-transcript-takeaways\">partial \u201ctranscript\u201d</a> of the 25 July call, hours before Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\">first face-to-face meeting</a> with Zelenskiy at the United Nations.

Holmes says he heard Trump ask about \u201cinvestigations\u201d. Hill says Sondland was assigned by the president to a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d that diverged from \u201cnational security policy\u201d. She warns against spreading the conspiracy theory that Ukraine not Russia was behind 2016 election tampering.</p> \n<h2>3 December</h2> \n<p>The intelligence committee releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/03/trump-impeachment-report-inquiry-house-democrats-findings-latest\">a report</a> contending that Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. The impeachment inquiry is referred to the judiciary committee.</p> \n<h2>4 December</h2> \n<p>The House judiciary committee begins public hearings with testimony by four constitutional law experts. Three experts called by Democrats said that Trump\u2019s conduct clearly represents impeachable conduct, while a witness called by Republicans said that more time was needed to investigate the case.</p> \n<h2>5 December</h2> \n<p>Pelosi announces that she was directing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/03/trump-impeachment-inquiry-judiciary-committee\">judiciary committee</a> to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.</p> \n<h2>10 December</h2> \n<p>Democratic congressional leaders unveil two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \u201cPresident Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States,\u201d one article states.</p> \n<h2>13 December</h2> \n<p>On a straight party-line vote, the House judiciary committee votes to move the articles of impeachment to the House floor.</p> \n<h2>18 December</h2> \n<p>The House of Representatives impeaches Trump. A first article of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power, was approved by a vote of 230-197. A second article, charging obstruction of Congress, was approved 229-198, with one \u201cpresent\u201d vote in both cases.</p> \n<h2><strong>24 December</strong></h2> \n<p>The Republican Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski says she is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/26/trump-impeachment-lisa-murkowski-disturbed-by-mitch-mcconnells-stance\">disturbed</a>\u201d by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge earlier in the month to work in \u201ctotal coordination\u201d with the White House on the Senate impeachment trial.</p> \n<h2><strong>28 December</strong></h2> \n<p>Joe Biden, the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate, says he would testify at the impeachment trial if he was subpoenaed, marking a U-turn on previous comments.</p> \n<h2><strong>6 January</strong></h2> \n<p>John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, says he would be prepared to testify in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump if he is subpoenaed. He said in a statement that he was trying to meet his \u201cobligations both as a citizen and as former national security adviser\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>7 January</strong></h2> \n<p>The House returns from recess without referring the impeachment articles to the Senate, as expected. Pelosi, who had objected to McConnell\u2019s vows to work hand-in-glove with the White House, says she is waiting to see what plans the Senate is making for a trial. McConnell claims to have the votes to proceed.</p> \n<h2>15 January</h2> \n<p>The House of Representatives names seven impeachment managers and votes to transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump on 24 September. Over the next three months, Congress investigated an alleged plot by Trump to use the power of his office to solicit interference from Ukraine in the 2020 election. On 18 December, Democrats approved two articles of impeachment against Trump: one for abuse of power, and one for obstruction of Congress.On 15 January, the House named impeachment managers and voted to send the articles to the Senate, where a trial will play out in which a two-thirds majority vote would be required to remove Trump from office. Here\u2019s a timeline of key events so far: April and May Through his personal emissary, Rudy Giuliani, Trump applies pressure on Ukraine to announce investigations tied to American politics. Immediately after Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s 21 April election as president of Ukraine, Giuliani contacts a Zelenskiy aide and introduces himself as \u201can advisor to the vice-president.\u201d The Ukrainian president-elect, Zelenskiy, meets with subordinates on 7 May to discuss how to avoid being dragged into US politics. 23 May In a White House meeting, Trump is unmoved by the enthusiasm of a delegation of officials freshly returned from Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in Kyiv. \u201cHe just kept saying: talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,\u201d the EU ambassador Gordon Sondland testified. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he meant. He kept repeating it, though: \u2018They tried to take me down, they tried to take me down.\u2019\u201d 28 May In an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, Giuliani says he would like to see the Ukrainians undertake investigations related to the 2016 election, the gas company Burisma and Hunter and Joe Biden. Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams flags the interview for the vice-president\u2019s office. 2-3 July At a conference on Ukraine in Toronto, the special envoy Kurt Volker meets one-on-one with Zelenskiy. Volker testified he did not mention investigations, but his senior colleagues have testified that Volker\u2019s plan going into the meeting with Zelenskiy was to ask for \u201ccooperation on investigations\u201d. 3 July Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the top adviser on Ukraine on the National Security Council, is made aware of the suspension of military aid for Ukraine. In testimony, Vindman said: \u201cBut by 3 July, that\u2019s when I was concretely made aware of the fact that there was a hold placed by [Office of Management and Budget].\u201d 10 July At a dramatic White House meeting, Trump emissaries ask top Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, shocking US national security officials. According to multiple accounts, after Sondland makes the Biden request, then national security adviser John Bolton abruptly terminates the meeting, later calling it a \u201cdrug deal\u201d. 18 July The Office of Management and Budget informs the Pentagon and state department that Trump has suspended $391m in military aid for Ukraine. According to testimony by the senior diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor: \u201cIn a regular, NSC secure video conference call on 18 July, I heard a staff person from the Office of Management and Budget say that there was a hold on security assistance to Ukraine but could not say why.\u201d 25 July Trump speaks on the phone with Zelenskiy, reminding him that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine\u201d and then asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d. Trump wants Ukraine to announce investigations designed to make Joe Biden look bad and to cast doubt on Russian tampering in the 2016 US election. That same day, the defense department receives two inquiries from Ukrainian officials about the status of US military aid, according to the deputy assistant secretary of defense, Laura Cooper. 26 July Sondland is in Kyiv for meetings with Zelenskiy. He takes David Holmes, a state department official, to lunch. At lunch Sondland orders wine and calls Trump. Sondland tells Trump that Zelenskiy \u201cloves your ass\u201d, according to Holmes\u2019 account, and Trump replies, \u201cSo, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u201d Hanging up, Sondland tells Holmes that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about\u201d Ukraine and \u201conly cares\u201d about the Biden investigation. Early August High-level Ukrainian officials are made aware of the suspension of US military aid designed to help in their fight against Russian forces, according to a New York Times report. But there are indications they were aware even sooner. 12 August A whistleblower complaint against Trump is secretly filed to the inspector general of the intelligence community. For six weeks, the Trump administration will block Congress from obtaining the complaint. 16 August A security council recommendation that aid for Ukraine be released is raised in a meeting with Trump, according to Vindman. But \u201cthe president didn\u2019t act on the recommendation\u201d. Late August Bolton meets with Trump one-on-one in the Oval Office and encourages him to release military aid. \u201cThe president was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistance,\u201d the Bolton aide Tim Morrison later testified. 27 August Bolton visits Taylor in Kyiv. Taylor brings up his concerns about suspended military aid. Bolton is \u201cvery sympathetic\u201d, Taylor later testifies, and tells him to send a cable directly to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, raising his concerns. 28 August Politico publishes the article, Trump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia. Taylor testified he was not aware of Ukrainians knowing about the suspension before the publication of this article. 1 September Bilateral meetings in Warsaw. Zelenskiy sits down with Pence and immediately brings up the suspension of aid. Separately, Sondland meets with the Zelenskiy aide Andriy Yermak and tells him \u201cthat resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks\u201d, according to Sondland. 7 September In a phone call, Trump tells Sondland \u201cthat there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelenskiy must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it\u201d, according to Morrison. 9 September Taylor texts Sondland: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d The intelligence community inspector general transmits a letter to the House intelligence committee notifying it of the existence of a whistleblower complaint. 11 September The military aid is released. 24 September Pelosi announces a formal impeachment inquiry, accusing Trump of \u201ca betrayal of his oath of office, a betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections\u201d. 25 September The White House releases a partial \u201ctranscript\u201d of the 25 July call, hours before Trump\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Zelenskiy at the United Nations. It\u2019s awkward. 26 September The whistleblower complaint is released. Citing \u201cmore than half a dozen US officials\u201d, it presents an accurate version of the Trump-Zelenskiy call and alleges that the White House tried to cover up the call. 4 October Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, testifies. Afterwards, investigators release WhatsApp messages showing US diplomats pursuing a \u201cdeliverable\u201d for Trump in Ukraine in the form of the Biden and 2016 election-tampering \u201cinvestigations\u201d. 8 October The White House releases a letter refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, and accusing Democrats of trying to reverse the result of the 2016 election. 11 October Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testifies about her shock on learning about an ultimately successful campaign in Ukraine to destroy her ambassadorship, involving Giuliani. \u201cThe president did make a decision, but I think influenced by some who are not trustworthy,\u201d she testified. When she sought advice on how to stop the attack, she said, she was told to tweet something nice about Trump. 14 October Fiona Hill, the senior director for Europe and Russia in the National Security Council, testifies. She describes a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine run by Giuliani, describes the 10 July White House meeting, which she attended, and says Bolton told her to take her concerns to the top NSC lawyer. 16 October P Michael McKinley, a top Pompeo deputy, testifies. He says he resigned owing to the \u201cemerging information on the engagement of our missions to procure negative political information for domestic purposes, combined with the failure I saw in the building to provide support for our professional cadre in a particularly trying time.\u201d 17 October Sondland testifies. He says he took Trump at his word that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine. He will later return to Capitol Hill to partially or fully reverse that testimony. 22 October Taylor testifies. In a 15-page opening statement, he describes his concern to discover an \u201cirregular, informal policy channel\u201d by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine \u201crunning contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy\u201d. 29 October Vindman testifies. He describes his alarm at witnessing the White House subvert US foreign policy in favor of Trump\u2019s domestic political agenda and says he took his concerns to the top NSC lawyer. 31 October The House votes on a resolution laying out a process to move impeachment from closed-door depositions to open hearings. Tim Morrison, the senior director for Russian affairs at the National Security Council, testifies a day after announcing that he will resign his post in short order. 5 November The impeachment committees begin releasing testimony transcripts. The overlapping testimonies tell the same story, of demands by US officials of Ukraine steadily ratcheting up between May and September, from a demand to investigate corruption to a demand that \u201cPresident Zelenskiy to go to a microphone and say \u2018investigations\u2019, \u2018Biden\u2019, and \u2018Clinton\u2019.\u201d 13 November Public impeachment hearings begin. Ambassador Bill Taylor and the deputy assistant secretary of state, George P Kent, testify. Taylor quotes Trump as demanding \u201cinvestigations\u201d of Ukraine in a phone call overheard by an aide. 15 November Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifies that she felt \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by Trump\u2019s personal attacks on her, and that she was \u201camazed\u201d corrupt elements in Ukraine had found willing American partners to take her down. Taylor aide David Holmes is deposed behind closed doors. 16 November Mark Sandy, an official at the Office of Management and Budget, is deposed. He says the hold on military aid was highly unusual and there was no explanation given. 19 November Pence aide Jennifer Williams and Lt Col Alexander Vindman testify about the 25 July call. \u201cWhat I heard was inappropriate and I reported it,\u201d Vindman says. \u201cI did so out of a sense of duty.\u201d Former envoy Kurt Volker and the national security council senior director, Tim Morrison, also testify. 20 November Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the Pentagon official Laura Cooper and the under secretary of state, David Hale, testify. Sondland confirms every key allegation: a White House meeting and military aid were conditioned on an announcement of investigations and \u201ceveryone was in the loop.\u201d \u201cWe followed the president\u2019s orders,\u201d he says. 21 November The former national security council senior director Fiona Hill and state department aide David Holmes testify. Holmes says he heard Trump ask about \u201cinvestigations\u201d. Hill says Sondland was assigned by the president to a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d that diverged from \u201cnational security policy\u201d. She warns against spreading the conspiracy theory that Ukraine not Russia was behind 2016 election tampering. 3 December The intelligence committee releases a report contending that Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. The impeachment inquiry is referred to the judiciary committee. 4 December The House judiciary committee begins public hearings with testimony by four constitutional law experts. Three experts called by Democrats said that Trump\u2019s conduct clearly represents impeachable conduct, while a witness called by Republicans said that more time was needed to investigate the case. 5 December Pelosi announces that she was directing the judiciary committee to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. 10 December Democratic congressional leaders unveil two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \u201cPresident Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States,\u201d one article states. 13 December On a straight party-line vote, the House judiciary committee votes to move the articles of impeachment to the House floor. 18 December The House of Representatives impeaches Trump. A first article of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power, was approved by a vote of 230-197. A second article, charging obstruction of Congress, was approved 229-198, with one \u201cpresent\u201d vote in both cases. 24 December The Republican Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski says she is \u201cdisturbed\u201d by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge earlier in the month to work in \u201ctotal coordination\u201d with the White House on the Senate impeachment trial. 28 December Joe Biden, the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate, says he would testify at the impeachment trial if he was subpoenaed, marking a U-turn on previous comments. 6 January John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, says he would be prepared to testify in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump if he is subpoenaed. He said in a statement that he was trying to meet his \u201cobligations both as a citizen and as former national security adviser\u201d. 7 January The House returns from recess without referring the impeachment articles to the Senate, as expected. Pelosi, who had objected to McConnell\u2019s vows to work hand-in-glove with the White House, says she is waiting to see what plans the Senate is making for a trial. McConnell claims to have the votes to proceed. 15 January The House of Representatives names seven impeachment managers and votes to transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate.",

      "body": "<p>James Murdoch claims he has never watched Succession, the drama series that documents the professional and personal rebellions of a billionaire media family suspiciously similar to his own. But his comments attacking the family business\u2019s record on climate crisis coverage \u2013 which blindsided other parts of the family \u2013 suggest he may have picked up a few pointers from the HBO show.</p> <p>The declaration that he and his wife, Kathryn, felt \u201cfrustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage\u201d of the climate crisis, particularly the \u201congoing denial among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary\u201d, focused an awkward light on the family\u2019s businesses \u2013 but could help James differentiate himself from his father, Rupert, and brother, Lachlan.</p> <p>His statement raised eyebrows, not least because until 18 months ago James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He is also still a director of News Corp, which owns the family\u2019s newspaper interests. Peter Barnes, a board member, said the board had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/15/james-murdochs-attack-on-news-corp-and-fox-news-has-not-been-discussed-by-board-director-says\">yet to discuss the comments</a>.</p> <p>But making a public stand on the issue has also helped the 47-year-old make clear to the wider world that he is heading in a different direction from the family business, as he looks to make investments in media companies with a more liberal standpoint. He has already <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-murdoch-donates-pete-buttigiegs-presidential-campaign-1202201\">donated</a> to the US presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, joined the board of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd557542-6065-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e\">made clear</a> he wants to distance himself from the conservative outlets associated with his surname.</p> <p>Alice Enders, of media analysts Enders, suggested Murdoch had always had a genuine and sincere concern about environmental issues throughout his career: \u201cHe and his wife believe in this so fundamentally and so strongly. They obviously believe that the media has a very important role in this.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to decide that the public domain is the best place to air a difference of views.\u201d</p> <p>The move caps a long journey for an individual who has often seemed uneasy with his enormous privilege, without ever rejecting it. After dropping out of Harvard in the mid-90s and working as a cartoonist, he helped to run the <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2014/04/19/i-actually-met-james-murdoch-el-p-talib-kweli-dj-premier-and-label-founders-remember-hip-hop-indie-powerhouse-rawkus/\">pioneering New York hip-hop record label Rawkus Records</a>, providing funding for the operation. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/11/james-murdoch-hip-hop\">one person</a> who visited the offices in this period, the twentysomething had \u201cpierced ears and eyebrow, dyed hair, a goatee, and a poster of Chairman Mao on his wall in New York\u201d, apparently rebelling against his family while also using its funds to subsidise his interests.</p> <p>After exiting the music industry \u2013 having sold a majority stake in Rawkus to his father \u2013 he was brought into the family business, having a brief stint advising on internet investments during the dotcom boom, followed by a spell running Asian pay-TV operator Star. But he shocked the British media scene when he was appointed as chief executive of BSkyB, a listed FTSE 100 company, at the age of 30.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7541daf7c9bc7fa3ec4de902c9098e98bf6aebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7541daf7c9bc7fa3ec4de902c9098e98bf6aebd/0_197_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Al Gore speaks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Al Gore speaks at the UN climate change conference in 2018 in Katowice, Poland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grzegorz Celejewski/Agencja Gazeta/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was during this time that he became increasingly concerned about climate change, inviting former US vice-president Al Gore to give a talk on the topic, and was an early convert to making businesses carbon neutral. Following a stint at the European arm of News Corp \u2013 where he was in charge as the phone-hacking scandal ravaged its newspapers and forced the closure of the News of the World \u2013 he became chief executive of 21st Century Fox until it was sold to Disney at the end of 2018.</p> <p>While there had been suggestions that James \u2013 until recently seen as the heir apparent \u2013 would join the combined behemoth, he instead walked away with billions of dollars.

      "bodyText": "James Murdoch claims he has never watched Succession, the drama series that documents the professional and personal rebellions of a billionaire media family suspiciously similar to his own. But his comments attacking the family business\u2019s record on climate crisis coverage \u2013 which blindsided other parts of the family \u2013 suggest he may have picked up a few pointers from the HBO show. The declaration that he and his wife, Kathryn, felt \u201cfrustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage\u201d of the climate crisis, particularly the \u201congoing denial among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary\u201d, focused an awkward light on the family\u2019s businesses \u2013 but could help James differentiate himself from his father, Rupert, and brother, Lachlan. His statement raised eyebrows, not least because until 18 months ago James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He is also still a director of News Corp, which owns the family\u2019s newspaper interests. Peter Barnes, a board member, said the board had yet to discuss the comments. But making a public stand on the issue has also helped the 47-year-old make clear to the wider world that he is heading in a different direction from the family business, as he looks to make investments in media companies with a more liberal standpoint. He has already donated to the US presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, joined the board of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, and made clear he wants to distance himself from the conservative outlets associated with his surname. Alice Enders, of media analysts Enders, suggested Murdoch had always had a genuine and sincere concern about environmental issues throughout his career: \u201cHe and his wife believe in this so fundamentally and so strongly. They obviously believe that the media has a very important role in this.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to decide that the public domain is the best place to air a difference of views.\u201d The move caps a long journey for an individual who has often seemed uneasy with his enormous privilege, without ever rejecting it. After dropping out of Harvard in the mid-90s and working as a cartoonist, he helped to run the pioneering New York hip-hop record label Rawkus Records, providing funding for the operation. According to one person who visited the offices in this period, the twentysomething had \u201cpierced ears and eyebrow, dyed hair, a goatee, and a poster of Chairman Mao on his wall in New York\u201d, apparently rebelling against his family while also using its funds to subsidise his interests. After exiting the music industry \u2013 having sold a majority stake in Rawkus to his father \u2013 he was brought into the family business, having a brief stint advising on internet investments during the dotcom boom, followed by a spell running Asian pay-TV operator Star. But he shocked the British media scene when he was appointed as chief executive of BSkyB, a listed FTSE 100 company, at the age of 30. It was during this time that he became increasingly concerned about climate change, inviting former US vice-president Al Gore to give a talk on the topic, and was an early convert to making businesses carbon neutral. Following a stint at the European arm of News Corp \u2013 where he was in charge as the phone-hacking scandal ravaged its newspapers and forced the closure of the News of the World \u2013 he became chief executive of 21st Century Fox until it was sold to Disney at the end of 2018. While there had been suggestions that James \u2013 until recently seen as the heir apparent \u2013 would join the combined behemoth, he instead walked away with billions of dollars. In the process, he left his brother in charge of a new, much smaller, Fox Corporation, which controls a group of television channels including Donald Trump\u2019s favourite outlet, Fox News. Enders said that Murdoch\u2019s approach to the environment contrasted with his father\u2019s focus on profits at all costs. While it would be hard for the likes of Fox News to U-turn on the issue of the climate crisis, she suggested it could encourage journalists within the organisation to voice their concerns about coverage: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are going to be standing up at News Corp meetings making these points.\u201d Individuals who have worked with Murdoch at BSkyB insist that his commitment to environmental issues is sincere, while also pointing to the influence of his wife, Kathryn, who put her name to the joint statement. In recent days she has used Twitter to share links to stories about investment company BlackRock putting climate change at the centre of its investment strategy and a story in the Murdoch-owned New York Post suggesting conservatives have answers to climate change. She also linked to an article in Vice \u2013 an outlet in which James\u2019s company recently bought a minority stake \u2013 blaming the bosses of large fossil fuel producers for the bushfires in Australia. The piece is withering about claims that arsonists are responsible for the natural disaster unfolding in Australia, mocking \u201cRupert Murdoch\u2019s rightwing media outlets\u201d for spreading such claims, which have \u201cbeen given a huge platform in the US by Donald Trump Jr and Sean Hannity\u201d \u2013 critiquing both the president\u2019s son and one of Fox News\u2019s most prominent hosts. On Wednesday it appeared that at least one part of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspaper empire was listening. The Northern Territory News \u2013 one of the company\u2019s most rambunctious tabloids \u2013 ran a front-page editorial breaking with the party line of many other Murdoch outlets: \u201cNow is not the time to play the blame game,\u201d its front page declared. \u201cNow is the time to discuss climate change.\u201d",

They pointedly urged NHS leaders and ministers to concentrate on delivering the long-established maximum waiting time for emergency care rather than finding \u201cways around\u201d it.</p> <p>Under the target, 95% of people arriving at A&amp;E in England are meant to be treated and then discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours. But performance against the target plunged to a new record low of just 68.6% last month in hospital-based A&amp;E units as a result of staffing problems, the decade-long squeeze on the NHS budget and the dramatic growth in the number of patients seeking care.</p> <p>The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), which represents A&amp;E doctors, was responding to Wednesday\u2019s apparent confirmation by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that the target \u2013 introduced by Labour in 2004 \u2013 is set to be axed because it is no longer deemed to be \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that a viable replacement for the four-hour target exists and believe that testing [of alternatives to the target] should soon draw to a close,\u201d said Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the RCEM.</p> <p>\u201cRather than focus on ways around the target, we need to get back to the business of delivering on it.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWe will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate.</p> <p>\u201cThe four-hour target in A&amp;E \u2013 which is often taken as the top way of measuring what\u2019s going on in hospitals \u2013 the problem with that target is that increasingly people are treated on the day and are able to go home. It\u2019s much better for the patient and also better for the NHS and yet the way that\u2019s counted in the target doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>At prime minister\u2019s questions Boris Johnson told MPs that delays for NHS care were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowed that \u201cwe will get those waiting lists down\u201d as he repeated his pledge to recruit 6,000 extra GPs and provide 50m more appointments with surgery staff.</p> <p>Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, warned that any dilution of the four-hour wait would be \u201cpremature and unjustified.

      "bodyText": "Plans to scrap the four-hour A&amp;E target have sparked a furious backlash from doctors and nurses, with some claiming it is driven by ministers\u2019 desire to avoid negative publicity about patients facing increasingly long delays. A&amp;E consultants led a chorus of medical opposition to the move. They pointedly urged NHS leaders and ministers to concentrate on delivering the long-established maximum waiting time for emergency care rather than finding \u201cways around\u201d it. Under the target, 95% of people arriving at A&amp;E in England are meant to be treated and then discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours. But performance against the target plunged to a new record low of just 68.6% last month in hospital-based A&amp;E units as a result of staffing problems, the decade-long squeeze on the NHS budget and the dramatic growth in the number of patients seeking care. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), which represents A&amp;E doctors, was responding to Wednesday\u2019s apparent confirmation by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that the target \u2013 introduced by Labour in 2004 \u2013 is set to be axed because it is no longer deemed to be \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that a viable replacement for the four-hour target exists and believe that testing [of alternatives to the target] should soon draw to a close,\u201d said Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the RCEM. \u201cRather than focus on ways around the target, we need to get back to the business of delivering on it.\u201d Hancock told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWe will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate. \u201cThe four-hour target in A&amp;E \u2013 which is often taken as the top way of measuring what\u2019s going on in hospitals \u2013 the problem with that target is that increasingly people are treated on the day and are able to go home. It\u2019s much better for the patient and also better for the NHS and yet the way that\u2019s counted in the target doesn\u2019t work.\u201d At prime minister\u2019s questions Boris Johnson told MPs that delays for NHS care were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowed that \u201cwe will get those waiting lists down\u201d as he repeated his pledge to recruit 6,000 extra GPs and provide 50m more appointments with surgery staff. Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, warned that any dilution of the four-hour wait would be \u201cpremature and unjustified. We would be greatly concerned about what it would mean for patients, and whether it might be happening simply to disguise a collapse in NHS performance due to unnecessary long-term underfunding, avoidable workforce shortages and predictable growth in patient need.\u201d The Emergency Care Association, to which 8,000 A&amp;E nurses belong, said ministers should exercise \u201cextreme caution\u201d in decisions about the target because \u201cit could cause significant detriment to patient safety within our emergency departments if the four-hour target was abolished\u201d. There are fears that patients thought to have only minor ailments could come to harm by having to wait a lot longer than four hours because they also have a more serious condition. Many doctors suspect that NHS England\u2019s possible replacement of the 95% target is linked to ministers\u2019 desire to limit the embarrassment the service\u2019s inability to meet it brings every time the monthly performance figures are published. The target is enshrined in the NHS constitution and covers the 25 million patients a year who seek help at a hospital A&amp;E, a minor injuries unit or urgent care centre. \u201cChanging any target for political expedience alone is plain wrong,\u201d said Dr Nick Scriven, the immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents specialists in hospital care of the very sick. \u201cIf the target were to be removed without [a] clinically-driven data-proven exercise to identify a better one, then it would look like the government removing something purely because it is not now being met by a service under immense strain and would be the wrong thing to to do,\u201d he said. One consultant anaesthetist said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear bad news. It feels like it\u2019s \u2018talk to the hand cos the face ain\u2019t listening\u2019.\u201d Dr Simon Walsh, the British Medical Association\u2019s emergency medicine lead, said: \u201cTargets are an important indicator when services are struggling and there is a very real concern that any change to targets will effectively mask underperformance and the effects of the decisions politicians make about resourcing the NHS.\u201d The Royal College of Physicians, which speaks for hospital doctors in England, stressed that the target had \u201cplayed a crucial part in driving improvements in waiting times for patients\u201d. Many A&amp;E doctors believe that the four-hour wait encourages some people to seek care inappropriately at A&amp;E instead of waiting for a GP appointment but also concede that it has ensured that no one goes without care for too long. Scriven chided Hancock for appearing to \u201cpre-empt and sideline\u201d the conclusions of NHS England\u2019s review group led by its medical director, Prof Stephen Powis. It may recommend replacing both the four-hour target and the requirement that patients should receive non-urgent hospital treatment, mainly surgery, inside 18 weeks. Hancock has \u201cplaced them in an invidious position for what appears nothing more than political posturing\u201d, said Scriven. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the review of targets \u201cmust be transparent and based on watertight clinical evidence, otherwise patients will think Matt Hancock is trying to move the goalposts to avoid scrutiny\u201d. Fourteen NHS trusts in England are trialling a new way of measuring A&amp;E waits as part of NHS England\u2019s review of NHS access standards. When it first came in the target required hospitals to treat 98% of A&amp;E arrivals within four hours. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government reduced that to 95% in 2010. The target was last met in July 2015. and performance has dropped 10% in the last year alone. Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, made clear last year that the least sick patients, such as those with a sprained finger, may well have to wait longer than four hours as a result of a likely shake-up.",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of Russia\u2019s leadership, accepting the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and proposing constitutional amendments that would enable him to hold onto power even after leaving the presidency in 2024. In a surprise move, Russia\u2019s government said it would resign in full just hours after Putin announced plans for a national referendum that would shift power away from a successor to the presidency. Putin\u2019s shakeup sent shock waves through Russia\u2019s political elites, who were left pondering what his intentions were and speculating about future cabinet appointments. The president is laying the groundwork as he prepares for a transition in 2024 that analysts say will likely see him abandon the presidency but remain Russia\u2019s dominant politician in a beefed-up role as Russia\u2019s prime minister or in the government\u2019s State Council instead. The 67-year-old has in effect ruled Russia since 2000, making him the longest-serving leader since Stalin, and what he plans to do in 2024 remains the most important political question in the country. In a televised speech before senior officials, Putin suggested amending Russia\u2019s constitution to limit a future president to two terms in office \u2013 he has served four \u2013 tightening residency requirements for presidential candidates, and letting parliament choose candidates for prime minister and the cabinet, in effect weakening the presidency. Shortly after the speech, Medvedev said that Russia\u2019s government would resign in full, allowing Putin to appoint new ministers. Medvedev, who also announced his intention to step down, was appointed to a new position as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, which is headed by Putin. Russian media reported that government ministers were blindsided by the decision to resign. Russia\u2019s tax service chief Mikhail Mishustin has been chosen by Putin as Medvedev\u2019s replacement, the Kremlin said later on Wednesday. The 53-year-old has worked in the government since 1998 and kept a low profile while serving as the head of the Federal Tax Service since 2010. Putin presented his amendments to the constitution as a significant change to Russia\u2019s governing document, and called for the first nationwide referendum since 1993 to confirm them. An elections official said within an hour of Putin\u2019s speech that a referendum could be prepared as soon as the proposals to amend the constitution were formalised. Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT television station, wrote that \u201ceffectively, power in Russia is moving to the legislative branch\u201d. Less credulous observers saw an attempt by Putin to lay the groundwork for a transition of power in 2024, when he should, under the constitution, step down from the presidency after serving two terms back-to-back as Russia\u2019s head of state. \u201cThe main result of Putin\u2019s speech: what idiots (and/or crooks) are all those who said that Putin would leave in 2024,\u201d wrote Alexei Navalny, a vocal leader of Russia\u2019s opposition. The question of whom Putin will name as his successor has been guessed at widely. Alexey Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based thinktank, said Putin\u2019s constitutional amendments were an attempt to plan for his transition in 2024 and to reduce the focus on whom he would select as a successor by making that role less important. \u201cThe president won\u2019t be as dominating a figure [as Putin].\u201d said Makarkin. \u201cSo the naming of his successor won\u2019t be such a crucial decision.\u201d Few expect Putin will want to retire from public life, or that he could do so safely. Instead, he could become prime minister again, as he did in 2008, or follow political models from countries such as Kazakhstan, where the former president Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped down from the presidency last year but remained head of the security council and the ruling party. \u201cIt\u2019s still early to say what role Putin will play,\u201d Makarkin continued.

But Putin\u2019s remarks were a \u201cdistinct signal\u201d that he would not remain president after his current term ends, Makarkin said. Under term limits, Putin left the presidency for four years in 2008 in a tumultuous period during which Russia fought a war in Georgia, faced growing anti-Kremlin protests, and failed to block a Nato intervention in Libya. By 2012, Putin was back, and his temporary replacement, Dmitry Medvedev, no longer seen as a viable successor in the long term. Russia is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in 2021, and the proposed amendments would make it doubly important for Putin to hold a loyal majority in the State Duma, perhaps forging a formal relationship with United Russia, the country\u2019s ruling party. Despite enjoying full-throated support from United Russia, Putin has declined to take on a leading role in the party.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin made two things clear as he embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of Russia\u2019s government on Wednesday: first, that Russia will probably bid farewell to him as president after 2024. And second, that when he leaves the presidency, he will definitely not be leaving power. No one really expected Putin to retire in 2024, when term limits dictate he cannot run for re-election. But pride and an interest in self-preservation dictate that he keep his hands on the levers of power. \u201cHe is the founder of this system \u2013 he wants to keep control,\u201d said Alexey Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies. But remaking the presidency, which under Putin has enjoyed a singular and unchecked power, will take years. The blistering pace of developments on Wednesday \u2013 Putin announced plans to amend the constitution to weaken Russia\u2019s next president, and then an hour later his prime minister and government announced plans to resign \u2013 showed that the groundwork for the transition is being laid years before Putin must leave the Kremlin under term limits. It is likely to end with him as prime minister or as the head of a newly empowered State Council, observers said, or in another role insulated from the power of his potential successor. That successor is not likely to be Mikhail Mishustin, the tax official whom Putin named as his choice for Russia\u2019s new prime minister, and who is seen as an able caretaker of the government while Putin sets out his succession plans. Meanwhile, a cast of loyal confidants, including old colleagues, aides, regional heads and former bodyguards, have all been tipped as potential heirs. Putin has left his options open with Mishustin\u2019s selection, and sought to minimise infighting among the political elite by keeping his cards close to his chest. Putin has good reason to plan ahead for this transition, likely the most meaningful and fraught of his career. The 2011-12 protests, still the largest of Putin\u2019s time in power, were sparked by botched parliamentary elections. But they came after Putin had announced his plans to return to the presidency, sparking concern among opponents that the Putin decade could become the Putin generation (it did), or potentially a lifetime of rule under Putin. That is also a possibility. Putin has already become the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Joseph Stalin, and by 2024, will be just six years shy of the Soviet leader\u2019s three decades in power. Opposition leaders such as Alexei Navalny commented that Putin was interested in being \u201cleader for life\u201d. Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister and Putin critic, said he wanted to retain power \u201cfor ever\u201d. In Russia, the most pressing question is not whether Putin will stay in power after 2024, but simply how he plans to accomplish it.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the Caledonian Sleeper train has resigned a day after the Scottish transport secretary said faults with the embattled rail service would take another two months to fix. Ryan Flaherty, who had been managing director of the London-to-Scotland sleeper service for almost two years, announced on Wednesday that he would leave the position as soon as a successor had been appointed. Serco, the outsourcing company that runs the much-criticised franchise service, said Flaherty was leaving for family reasons and would move to a different job within the company, in south-west England, closer to his home. The announcement of Flaherty\u2019s decision to stand down came a day after the Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, told MSPs that he had engaged directly with Serco bosses about faults with the \u00a3150m fleet of new sleeper carriages made by the Spanish train company CAF. Matheson said it would take another \u201ccouple of months\u201d to fix the numerous faults that have plagued the sleeper service since Serco relaunched the train as a luxury \u201chotel on wheels\u201d. The new train, which was launched in April 2019, has been beset with difficulties including severe delays, midnight evacuations, botched reservations, broken air conditioning and a fault that led to emergency exit windows being locked shut. The Caledonian Sleeper was last week named by the Office of Rail and Road as the UK\u2019s most-complained about rail service. Figures showed the train had 394 complaints per 100,000 journeys between July and September 2019 \u2013 up 221% on the same period in 2018. Stressed train staff also voted to strike, alleging that Serco bosses had ignored \u201cserious concerns raised by staff that have ruined working lives and placed the workforce under intolerable pressure\u201d. Matheson said: \u201cNot only have I engaged with Serco on this matter, I have also engaged directly with senior executives within CAF around the specific problems which have been experienced with the introduction of the new rolling stock. There are a range of measures which have been taken as a result of that. \u201cThere has been a rolling programme of retrospective technical work that has been undertaken on the new rolling stock by CAF.\u201d Matheson said good progress had been made in addressing the faults, but that Serco expected it to take a couple of months until work was completed to \u201censure all the technical issues which have had an impact on the passenger experience have been closed out\u201d. John Whitehurst, Serco\u2019s managing director for transport, said: \u201cRyan has led Serco Caledonian Sleeper during a transformational period.

      "bodyText": "Next week the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists will unveil the current time on its Doomsday Clock, meant to convey the nuclear dangers facing the world. The closer the clock is to midnight, the greater the existential threat. If the stand-off between Iran and Donald Trump persists, or takes a frightening turn for the worse, then the clock\u2019s hands may be closer to the bell tolling than they have ever been. This would mean the danger to the planet was judged greater than at any time since the first H-bomb tests. The drumbeat of war reverberates around the Middle East. On Tuesday, Britain, France and Germany said that they had been \u201cleft with no choice\u201d but to trigger a dispute mechanism in the six-nation nuclear deal with Iran after Tehran declared, in the aftermath of the US assassination of its top general, that it would no longer observe the pact\u2019s \u201coperational restrictions\u201d. Iran\u2019s president then warned that European soldiers in the Middle East \u201ccould be in danger\u201d, a clear indication that if the continent stood with Mr Trump then its forces could expect to be treated as enemy combatants. Europe, including Britain, must not follow the folly of President Trump\u2019s strategy. Last year he pulled out of the nuclear deal saying it was not working when it was. He then gambled that crippling economic sanctions would bring down Tehran\u2019s regime. That has not paid off. Rather Iran has lashed out with a series of audacious strikes against Sunni Arab rivals and western targets. It began slowly walking away from the nuclear deal.

In its way, it\u2019s a home movie that, like so many others, makes the dad behind the camera a mostly absent figure, privileging images of the wife and children. But his presence breaks through as his wife, Nargis, talks about the religious faith he has mostly grown away from \u2013 and yells at him for flirting with other women. A powerful, personal piece of work. \u2022 Midnight Traveler is released in the UK on 17 January.",

      "body": "<p>My colleague and friend Nick Mason, who has died aged 81, became deputy sports editor of the Guardian after the demise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\" title=\"\">Robert Maxwell</a>\u2019s ill-fated 24-hour London Daily News in the summer of 1987. </p> <p>Like Nick, I had worked on the sports desk of the LDN, which survived barely six months. I began working as a freelance subeditor at the Guardian and the then sports editor, Mike Averis, asked me if he should take on Nick as his deputy.</p> <p>Mike did not really need to ask.

Like Nick, I had worked on the sports desk of the LDN, which survived barely six months. I began working as a freelance subeditor at the Guardian and the then sports editor, Mike Averis, asked me if he should take on Nick as his deputy. Mike did not really need to ask. Before the LDN, Nick had been deputy sports editor at the Sunday Times, where he and his editor, John Lovesey, had helped to transform sports journalism. Before that, the sports pages had tended to be hived off in the back of papers, mainly made up of stories and match reports with little linking them to the real world of news.

Questions will remain about whether the tension between Nandy\u2019s call to listen to communities that voted for Brexit and her defence of the principle of free movement can be resolved.

Ordinary party members have the other 50% of the votes.</p> <p>Under the new Labour leadership rules, the affiliated organisations play a part because they can nominate candidates. If a candidate fails to get nominated by 5% of constituency Labour parties, they need to get nominations from at least 5% of the affiliate vote, with at least three organisations nominating them.</p> <p>That does not sound too challenging; finding just three organisations to back you out of 22 should not be too hard. But Labour insiders say that, without the support of one of the five big unions, it is impossible to reach the 5% threshold. That is because the vast majority of 2m-odd votes available in this section are allocated to these five unions.</p> <p>The Labour party will not release figures showing what percentage of the vote each organisation has in the affiliates section. But here are figures from a party insider showing what the numbers were in 2016. They will have changed a bit since then, but I\u2019m told these are still a good rough guide to what the situation is now.</p> <p>Unite - around 550,000 affiliated members - 28% of the total vote</p> <p>Unison - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote</p> <p>Usdaw - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote</p> <p>GMB - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote</p> <p>CWU - around 150,000 affiliated members - 8% of the total vote.</p> <p>The other unions are relatively tiny compared to these big five. According to these figures, the TSSA was the next biggest union in 2016, with around 18,000 members, and 0.9% of the vote. And the entire membership of the socialist societies was less than 26,000, comprising 1.3% of the vote at most.</p> <p>(If anyone has got more up-to-date figures, please do get in touch.)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T17:06:12.431Z\">at 5.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1f33b28f0852212f74e8bb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T16:04:50.207Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer now just one nomination away from getting on final leadership ballot</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sera</strong>, the Labour environment campaign (originally it was the Socialist Environment and Resources Association), has endorsed Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leader. That may not sound very significant, because Sera is a tiny organisation, but it is one of the 20 socialist societies affiliated to Labour and as such it can nominate candidates for the party leadership.</p> <p>Starmer and the other four candidates still in the race - Rebecca Long-Bailey, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry - have already received enough nominations from MPs to make it on to the ballot.</p> <p>But they won\u2019t be allowed on the ballot unless they clear another hurdle. Under a rule introduced under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, they must either get nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (which means 33 of them), or get nominations from at least three affiliates (at least two of which must be trade unions; the other could be a union or a socialist society), comprising between them at least 5% of the affiliate membership.</p> <p>Starmer has already had an endorsement from Unison, which on its own accounts for more than 5% of the total affiliate membership.

It may not have amounted to an all-encompassing vision, but Nandy has a very good turn of phrase - eg, \u201cthe lesson from history is that the path of least resistance has never pointed towards progress\u201d, or \u201cLabour is not yet in power, but we should never believe we are powerless\u201d - and the speech contained some serious arguments. Here is a summary of the main points from what was in it, and from her Q&amp;A.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Nandy said Labour \u201cfailed on Russia\u201d under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. </strong>She did not refer to Corbyn by name in this passage (or anywhere else in the speech), but this critique was clearly aimed at Corbyn and his advisers. It is one of the strongest attacks on any aspect of the Corbyn leadership we have heard during this contest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Russia is a regime that discriminates against LBGT people,</p> <p>That demonises Muslims and other minorities and suppresses basic rights.</p> <p>That has invaded its neighbour and occupied a chunk of its sovereign territory.</p> <p>That used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK and murdered a homeless person.<br></p> <p>It was totally wrong that our response to this was to cast doubt on what happened and call only for dialogue. At a crucial moment, we hesitated in condemning an authoritarian regime that supports Trump, invades its neighbours, steals its country\u2019s wealth, interferes in elections in Europe and America, attacks minority communities and then used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK.</p> <p>We stood with the Russian government, and not with the people it oppresses, who suffer poverty and discrimination. We failed the test of solidarity.</p> <p>And as a result, we let the Tories get away with their own shocking weakness on Putin\u2019s Russia: suppressing the ISC report; failing to answer basic questions on their own funding by rich Russian oligarchs; letting the city of London become a paradise for corrupt money laundering.</p> <p>The Labour leadership failed on Russia. We must put this right.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour should have defended free movement.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/15/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-trump-praises-boris-johnson-for-suggesting-us-should-draft-new-iran-deal-live-news?page=with:block-5e1f19408f0852212f74e730#block-5e1f19408f0852212f74e730\">1.54pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She appeared to rule out signing a trade deal with President Trump, saying the UK should not reach such a deal with any country not ratifying the Paris climate change agreement</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50297029\">The US is withdrawing from this agreement.</a> Nandy said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We cannot turn up at the G20 and pledge our commitment to the Paris agreement while continuing to use government money to invest in fossil fuel projects overseas. Or export plastic waste to dump it in South-East Asia.</p> <p>As we look to forge new trading alliances across the world, we will need to make choices. We should be clear now: we would refuse to agree any trade deal with a country that has not ratified the Paris agreement. We must use trade to support climate action, not hamper it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour missed an opportunity to push for a soft Brexit after the referendum.</strong> This was a moment when remain and leave voters could have been brought together, she argued. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She criticised the Labour remain case in the referendum for its lack of vision, saying it was too focused on defending the status quo.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In recent years the question of internationalism has been reduced to a discussion on the left that can be reduced to this: EU \u2013 in or out?</p> <p>It has polarised the whole country, most of whom had much more complex and nuanced views about EU membership and EU structures than this reductionist debate would have us believe.</p> <p>So we were unable to hear those leave voters who thought close international cooperation was important or remain voters who disliked some of the decisions and direction the EU had taken. Complexity was airbrushed from the debate. Unable to have an honest conversation about what needed to change, we were left defending what was, not being honest with the public about how to build better, more democratic cooperation with our closest neighbours.</p> <p>How could it be that Labour \u2013 a force for radical change that has won only three times in our history when we\u2019ve had an ambitious story to tell about the future - was simply on the back foot defending the status quo?</p> </blockquote> <p>(Arguably, this is unfair. If the argument about Brexit became binary, that was largely because referendums by their nature reduce matters to a binary choice.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour should have accepted that the referendum vote was \u201ca call for more power and control\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said in the Q&amp;A that she did not use the phrase green new deal because it was a phrase that \u201cmeans absolutely nothing to most of my constituents\u201d.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/15/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-trump-praises-boris-johnson-for-suggesting-us-should-draft-new-iran-deal-live-news?page=with:block-5e1f19858f0852212f74e732#block-5e1f19858f0852212f74e732\">2.02pm.)</a> This will be seen as a dig at Rebecca Long-Bailey, who has championed the plan, although Nandy stressed that she was not opposed to the policy; she was just concerned about the way it was described.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she was not someone who had always wanted to be Labour leader since childhood.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/15/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-trump-praises-boris-johnson-for-suggesting-us-should-draft-new-iran-deal-live-news?page=with:block-5e1f16648f088d80a182b57d#block-5e1f16648f088d80a182b57d\"> 1.46pm.)</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d1a92e323380dccc641b5fe656a5bf10174153\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d1a92e323380dccc641b5fe656a5bf10174153/0_143_5441_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy speaking at the RSA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy speaking at the RSA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T17:53:24.346Z\">at 5.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1f26f68f08d66fcfaa477d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T14:52:28.502Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former MP Keith Vaz launches surprise Labour comeback</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The disgraced former MP <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/labour-keith-vaz-stands-down\">Keith Vaz</a> </strong>has made a surprise bid to re-enter Labour politics after being declared as the chair of the constituency party that he represented for 32 years, my colleague <strong>Rajeev Syal</strong> reports.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/15/former-mp-keith-vaz-launches-surprise-labour-comeback\">Former MP Keith Vaz launches surprise Labour comeback</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1f242a8f0852212f74e7c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T14:50:38.979Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Listing Extinction Rebellion as extreme ideology 'absolute disgrace', says Long-Bailey</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In her speech in the Queen\u2019s speech debate earlier <strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey,</strong> the shadow business secretary and Labour leadership candidates, said she was \u201calarmed\u201d about the report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/xr-extinction-rebellion-listed-extremist-ideology-police-prevent-scheme-guidance\">counter-terrorism police had listed Extinction Rebellion as an \u201cextreme ideology\u201d.</a> She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reports that the government\u2019s response to defend the recommendation to list them [Extinction Rebellion] alongside neo-Nazi terrorists was an absolute disgrace and I urge [Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary] to speak to her colleagues about this because it\u2019s absolutely absurd that our school strikers, that our climate activists who are trying to fight to be heard here in Westminster are being listed alongside terrorist organisations when they\u2019re simply trying to save the planet and deliver a world for their children and grandchildren.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much of her speech was devoted to the climate crisis, and Long-Bailey argued that the government\u2019s target to cut emissions in the UK to zero by 2050 was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IPCC, the world\u2019s leading body on climate change, says that the entire world needs to reach net zero by 2020 to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming.</p> <p>Given the UK\u2019s historic responsibility for climate change and our wealth and resources to do something about it, we clearly need to be ahead of the curve by this, and we need to be honest, that 2050 is not good enough, not if we\u2019re serious about keeping our people safe, and I\u2019d urge the government to revisit this target.</p> </blockquote> <p>Long-Bailey also said the government had to be honest about the fact that it was not on track to meet its targets. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s be honest about what that means.

It will probably be like this for a while, for various structural reasons. Boris Johnson clearly doesn\u2019t feel remotely threatened by the outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (even when Corbyn has a point, as he did today), there are no awkward squad Tory MPs posing difficult questions and the Labour leadership contest - where what is said in the next few weeks by candidates will decide the outcome - did not feature, because none of Corbyn\u2019s potential successors got a question.</p> <p>Corbyn devoted all his questions to health and social care and the points he made about what has happened to the NHS after 10 years of Tory government were strong and unanswerable. But as an election loser who is working his notice, Corbyn doesn\u2019t really have the authority to unsettle Johnson, and the PM rambled through quite easily. Corbyn\u2019s reference to the Labour manifesto gave Johnson the chance to deliver an effective put-down. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/15/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-trump-praises-boris-johnson-for-suggesting-us-should-draft-new-iran-deal-live-news?page=with:block-5e1f007c8f088d80a182b476#block-5e1f007c8f088d80a182b476\">12.11pm.)</a> Otherwise, on the NHS, Johnson did not have an answer to the question as to why waiting times had got so much worse over the last 10 years, but as usual he sought to brush this off with super-charged, \u2018will do better\u2019 optimism.</p> <p>In a small chamber dominated by supportive Tory MPs, this worked. But for quite how long can he pull this off? Exchanges like today\u2019s must be helping to convince Johnson that, if he has not measurably improved the NHS after five years, he will be in real trouble. But he also has a tendency to over-promise - at one point today he came close to committing to cure dementia (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/15/pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-trump-praises-boris-johnson-for-suggesting-us-should-draft-new-iran-deal-live-news?page=with:block-5e1f03438f0852212f74e622#block-5e1f03438f0852212f74e622\">12.20pm)</a>, which would be headline news if anyone believed him - and a lot of he is saying at this point in his premiership may pose problems for him further down the line, when reality catches up with him.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1f06098f0852212f74e650\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T12:33:14.889Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sir Ed Davey,</strong> the acting Lib Dem leader, says widowed parents with children used to receive payments while they had children at home.

      "bodyText": "Lisa Nandy, one of the Labour leadership candidates, has said that under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership the party \u201cfailed on Russia\u201d. In a speech on foreign policy, in which she also said the party should have defended free movement, she said: We stood with the Russian government, and not with the people it oppresses, who suffer poverty and discrimination. We failed the test of solidarity. There is a full summary of her speech and Q&amp;A at 3.36pm. Andrew Fisher, who worked for Corbyn as head of policy until the election, accused Nandy of repeating a false Tory smear. He posted this on Twitter. Keir Starmer has set out his vision for what he describes as a \u201cmoral socialism\u201d focused on combating inequality and injustice, promising also to put the climate emergency at the centre of all policies if he becomes Labour leader. Boris Johnson has said the government \u201cwill legislate\u201d to make sure no one who served in the armed forces suffers \u201cvexatious or unfair prosecution\u201d for historic cases where no new evidence has been provided. He was speaking in PMQs in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Sarah Jones, who asked how this Tory commitment squared with the government\u2019s promise to legislate for a body to investigate killings during the Troubles (a promise made as part of the deal to re-establish power-sharing at Stormont). Jones said: The press were briefed last year that the prime minister was going to bring an end to all ongoing investigations from the conflict, and he said on Monday that he wouldn\u2019t support vexatious claims when there was no new evidence, but, of course, the Stormont agreement includes the Historical Investigations Unit and the point of all the ongoing investigations is that the original evidence has never been properly investigated. So will the prime minister today tell us, yes or no, whether he now supports the investigation of every single outstanding claim? Johnson responded: We will go ahead and, as I said yesterday, I think there\u2019s a good balance that\u2019s been struck in getting Stormont going again, between those who need truth and those who need certainty and the protection of our armed services and nothing in the agreement, I want to reassure the house, will stop us from going ahead with legislation to make sure that no one who served in our armed forces suffers unfair prosecution, vexatious or unfair prosecution for cases that happened many years ago where no new evidence has been provided. We will legislate to ensure that that cannot happen. The European parliament has said EU citizens living in the UK after it leaves the bloc risk discrimination in jobs and housing, because the government will not issue physical documents under the settled-status scheme. The disgraced former MP Keith Vaz has made a surprise bid to re-enter Labour politics after being declared as the chair of the constituency party that he represented for 32 years, the Guardian can disclose. Matt Hancock has signalled that four-hour waiting targets for A&amp;E are likely to be scrapped for the NHS in England after the worst figures on record this winter. The \u00a330m no-deal Brexit traffic management system operating on the main roads to Dover is being fully dismantled before the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 January. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. In a blog the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire has praised the politics of Lisa Nandy\u2019s comments on free movement. (See 1.54pm.) Here\u2019s an extract. Sources close to Nandy describe the intervention as a \u201cstrong defence of free movement\u201d. Politically, the point of offering it is clear: she has no hope of winning among the Labour selectorate if her agenda on towns and regional inequality is seen as synonymous with a rightward lurch on migration. In framing her reservations with EU migration as it currently exists in terms members like and understand \u2013 that is, the failure of successive governments to invest in education and skills training, particularly in the communities that need it most \u2013 Nandy will hope she has gone some way to defusing the issue. Will it work? Questions will remain about whether the tension between Nandy\u2019s call to listen to communities that voted for Brexit and her defence of the principle of free movement can be resolved. But the fact that she has moved to answer them in her own terms, before her opponents have had the opportunity to ask them, goes some way to explaining why it is her leadership campaign that currently appears to be gaining momentum. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels Rebecca Long-Bailey has announced that she will formally launch her campaign at an event starting at 7pm on Friday. This is about the worst possible time of the week to hold an event if you want it to attract extensive coverage in national newspapers (on Fridays their deadlines are earlier than usual, because they print in larger numbers for Saturday), but given the way most papers cover the Long-Bailey wing of the Labour party, this may be deliberate. The timing will, however, suit supporters who want to attend the event in Manchester after work. There are 12 trade unions affiliated to Labour and 20 socialist societies. They all get voting rights at party conference, in accordance with the number of members they have paying to be affiliated to Labour, and collectively they have 50% of the votes at party conference. Ordinary party members have the other 50% of the votes. Under the new Labour leadership rules, the affiliated organisations play a part because they can nominate candidates. If a candidate fails to get nominated by 5% of constituency Labour parties, they need to get nominations from at least 5% of the affiliate vote, with at least three organisations nominating them. That does not sound too challenging; finding just three organisations to back you out of 22 should not be too hard. But Labour insiders say that, without the support of one of the five big unions, it is impossible to reach the 5% threshold. That is because the vast majority of 2m-odd votes available in this section are allocated to these five unions. The Labour party will not release figures showing what percentage of the vote each organisation has in the affiliates section. But here are figures from a party insider showing what the numbers were in 2016. They will have changed a bit since then, but I\u2019m told these are still a good rough guide to what the situation is now. Unite - around 550,000 affiliated members - 28% of the total vote Unison - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote Usdaw - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote GMB - around 400,000 affiliated members - 20% of the total vote CWU - around 150,000 affiliated members - 8% of the total vote. The other unions are relatively tiny compared to these big five. According to these figures, the TSSA was the next biggest union in 2016, with around 18,000 members, and 0.9% of the vote. And the entire membership of the socialist societies was less than 26,000, comprising 1.3% of the vote at most. (If anyone has got more up-to-date figures, please do get in touch.) Sera, the Labour environment campaign (originally it was the Socialist Environment and Resources Association), has endorsed Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leader. That may not sound very significant, because Sera is a tiny organisation, but it is one of the 20 socialist societies affiliated to Labour and as such it can nominate candidates for the party leadership. Starmer and the other four candidates still in the race - Rebecca Long-Bailey, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry - have already received enough nominations from MPs to make it on to the ballot. But they won\u2019t be allowed on the ballot unless they clear another hurdle. Under a rule introduced under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, they must either get nominations from 5% of constituency Labour parties (which means 33 of them), or get nominations from at least three affiliates (at least two of which must be trade unions; the other could be a union or a socialist society), comprising between them at least 5% of the affiliate membership. Starmer has already had an endorsement from Unison, which on its own accounts for more than 5% of the total affiliate membership. Now, with Sera backing him, he needs the support of just one more union to be on the ballot. Announcing their reason for Sera\u2019s decision, its co-chairs, Jake Sumner and Melanie Smallman, said: We looked hard at the record and competences of all of the candidates and it was very clear to us that Keir stood out as the candidate who had consistently supported Sera\u2019s positions within the party and in parliament \u2013 opposing the expansion of Heathrow airport, standing up to protect environmental legislation in the Brexit debate, and campaigning with us on air quality. Most importantly, we are in a race to tackle the climate emergency. We need a leader who can take on the government now and who has the experience and broad appeal to take Labour into power and urgently deliver the measures needed to address the looming climate emergency. Lisa Nandy\u2019s speech to the RSA thinktank earlier on foreign policy was a lot more substantial than the speech she delivered on Monday. It may not have amounted to an all-encompassing vision, but Nandy has a very good turn of phrase - eg, \u201cthe lesson from history is that the path of least resistance has never pointed towards progress\u201d, or \u201cLabour is not yet in power, but we should never believe we are powerless\u201d - and the speech contained some serious arguments. Here is a summary of the main points from what was in it, and from her Q&amp;A. Nandy said Labour \u201cfailed on Russia\u201d under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. She did not refer to Corbyn by name in this passage (or anywhere else in the speech), but this critique was clearly aimed at Corbyn and his advisers. It is one of the strongest attacks on any aspect of the Corbyn leadership we have heard during this contest. Russia is a regime that discriminates against LBGT people, That demonises Muslims and other minorities and suppresses basic rights. That has invaded its neighbour and occupied a chunk of its sovereign territory. That used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK and murdered a homeless person. It was totally wrong that our response to this was to cast doubt on what happened and call only for dialogue. At a crucial moment, we hesitated in condemning an authoritarian regime that supports Trump, invades its neighbours, steals its country\u2019s wealth, interferes in elections in Europe and America, attacks minority communities and then used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK. We stood with the Russian government, and not with the people it oppresses, who suffer poverty and discrimination. We failed the test of solidarity. And as a result, we let the Tories get away with their own shocking weakness on Putin\u2019s Russia: suppressing the ISC report; failing to answer basic questions on their own funding by rich Russian oligarchs; letting the city of London become a paradise for corrupt money laundering. The Labour leadership failed on Russia. We must put this right. She said Labour should have defended free movement. (See 1.54pm.) She appeared to rule out signing a trade deal with President Trump, saying the UK should not reach such a deal with any country not ratifying the Paris climate change agreement. The US is withdrawing from this agreement. Nandy said: We cannot turn up at the G20 and pledge our commitment to the Paris agreement while continuing to use government money to invest in fossil fuel projects overseas. Or export plastic waste to dump it in South-East Asia. As we look to forge new trading alliances across the world, we will need to make choices. We should be clear now: we would refuse to agree any trade deal with a country that has not ratified the Paris agreement. We must use trade to support climate action, not hamper it. She said Labour missed an opportunity to push for a soft Brexit after the referendum. This was a moment when remain and leave voters could have been brought together, she argued. She criticised the Labour remain case in the referendum for its lack of vision, saying it was too focused on defending the status quo. In recent years the question of internationalism has been reduced to a discussion on the left that can be reduced to this: EU \u2013 in or out? It has polarised the whole country, most of whom had much more complex and nuanced views about EU membership and EU structures than this reductionist debate would have us believe. So we were unable to hear those leave voters who thought close international cooperation was important or remain voters who disliked some of the decisions and direction the EU had taken. Complexity was airbrushed from the debate. Unable to have an honest conversation about what needed to change, we were left defending what was, not being honest with the public about how to build better, more democratic cooperation with our closest neighbours. How could it be that Labour \u2013 a force for radical change that has won only three times in our history when we\u2019ve had an ambitious story to tell about the future - was simply on the back foot defending the status quo? (Arguably, this is unfair. If the argument about Brexit became binary, that was largely because referendums by their nature reduce matters to a binary choice.) She said Labour should have accepted that the referendum vote was \u201ca call for more power and control\u201d. She said in the Q&amp;A that she did not use the phrase green new deal because it was a phrase that \u201cmeans absolutely nothing to most of my constituents\u201d. (See 2.02pm.) This will be seen as a dig at Rebecca Long-Bailey, who has championed the plan, although Nandy stressed that she was not opposed to the policy; she was just concerned about the way it was described. She said she was not someone who had always wanted to be Labour leader since childhood. (See 1.46pm.) The disgraced former MP Keith Vaz has made a surprise bid to re-enter Labour politics after being declared as the chair of the constituency party that he represented for 32 years, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. In her speech in the Queen\u2019s speech debate earlier Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and Labour leadership candidates, said she was \u201calarmed\u201d about the report that counter-terrorism police had listed Extinction Rebellion as an \u201cextreme ideology\u201d. She said: The reports that the government\u2019s response to defend the recommendation to list them [Extinction Rebellion] alongside neo-Nazi terrorists was an absolute disgrace and I urge [Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary] to speak to her colleagues about this because it\u2019s absolutely absurd that our school strikers, that our climate activists who are trying to fight to be heard here in Westminster are being listed alongside terrorist organisations when they\u2019re simply trying to save the planet and deliver a world for their children and grandchildren. Much of her speech was devoted to the climate crisis, and Long-Bailey argued that the government\u2019s target to cut emissions in the UK to zero by 2050 was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. She said: The IPCC, the world\u2019s leading body on climate change, says that the entire world needs to reach net zero by 2020 to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming. Given the UK\u2019s historic responsibility for climate change and our wealth and resources to do something about it, we clearly need to be ahead of the curve by this, and we need to be honest, that 2050 is not good enough, not if we\u2019re serious about keeping our people safe, and I\u2019d urge the government to revisit this target. Long-Bailey also said the government had to be honest about the fact that it was not on track to meet its targets. She said: Let\u2019s be honest about what that means. It\u2019s not like failing an exam or a driving test, failing on climate change means devastating fires sweeping across Australia and the Amazon, it means critical threats to our food security, our water security and our entire ecosystem on which we all depend. Q: What do you think about Labour\u2019s stance on Russia? Nandy says she has not been in the shadow cabinet since 2016. She says she does not know why the party adopted the position it did, but she says appearing to show support for President Putin was a mistake. Q: Why did you not mention the green new deal in your speech? Nandy says she did not use the phrase because \u201cit means absolutely nothing to most of my constituents\u201d. She says the party needs to find the right language to explain its policies. Q: Are you saying that if President Trump pulls out of the Paris climate change accord, the UK should refuse to do a trade deal with him? Nandy says some of the most inspiring thing she has seen have involved the use of trade deals to drive up standards. That is what she means by standing by your values. And she says she thinks her constituents in Wigan care about this as much as anyone else. As for whether this would harm the economy, Nandy says the biggest threat to the world is the climate crisis. She says Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, has made this point. Q: How would you make the House of Commons function more effectively? Nandy says she would like to defend the Commons. In the last parliament MPs were trying to do the right thing. Q: Who is to blame for Labour\u2019s failures on Brexit? Nandy says this has been a collective failure. She says she tried to make the case after the referendum for Labour to engage in a conversation about what should come next. She lost, she says. In 2019 she made the case for Labour backing a soft Brexit. But she lost, she says. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary of the speech and Q&amp;A soon. This is what Lisa Nandy said about free movement in her speech. We should have been bold enough to defend free movement, and the opportunities and benefits it brings. But this would have required recognising it has flaws, and not dismissing concerns as simply racist anti-immigrant sentiment. We should acknowledge that over decades governments have used the steady influx of skilled labour to cover up a lack of investment in skills and training in the UK and address this. I believe in free movement. If it were paired with renewed and radical investment that enabled opportunities for young people, decent jobs, training and skills - then the same concerns would have fallen away. I have fought for the rights of migrant workers in the UK all my life and unlike Boris Johnson, I know that the so-called Red Wall communities do too. Q: You voted for airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq, but against them in Syria. What are your tests for military intervention? Nandy says it is about what the consequences would be. She says Wigan is a town with many people in the armed services. They go off to war, and risk death. She says the legality of any military action is a key test. On air strikes against Syria, she was genuinely open-minded, she says. She says there was a huge row about this in shadow cabinet. She says air strikes would have hit civilian populations. Nandy is now taking questions from journalists. Q: Should the UK be close to Saudia Arabia? No, says Nandy. She says it is shameful that the UK has not distanced itself from Saudia Arabia. Q: You back freedom of movement. Could you offer that to the EU in return for a soft Brexit? Nandy says she thinks she was the first Labour MP to say it was a mistake for Labour to say free movement had to end. She says the party loses its way when it pretends its values are not its values. People benefit from free movement, she says. And she says, in the negotiation with the EU, free movement would always be on the table. Labour should stand for jobs. It should adopt a stance that would prioritise jobs. But she says Labour is now far away from that position. The UK is leaving the EU with the loosest of all arrangements. She says the UK has to think seriously about how it remains a competitive nation. Q: The 2015 Labour leadership contest was a choice between three continuity candidates, and one change candidate, and the change candidate won. This time there seems to be one continuity candidate, and the others represent change. What is different about you from the other candidates? Nandy says she is not interested in differentiating herself from the other candidates. She is not someone who has always wanted to be Labour leader since she was seven, she says. Q: What did you want to be when you were seven? Probably a baker, says Nandy - although she says she cannot cook. Returning to the question, Nandy says she has always thought that it is not enough for Labour just to change the leader to succeed. She says a different approach is needed. Nandy says she likes the approach followed by Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand. She is in this contest because she thinks this is a moment when Labour must step up. The path back to power will be steep, she says. She says in places like Wigan you can feel the ground beneath you move (metaphorically). She says there is a hole where Labour should be. She says the path back to power may be steep, but it does not have to be long. She says she thinks Labour could win the next election. Q: What is your view on Israel/Palestinian? Nandy says for the last seven year she has been vice chair, and then chair, of Labour Friends of Palestine. She says she has been ashamed of the obvious antisemitism in the party. And she has been ashamed of Labour\u2019s reluctance to defend the right of Israel to exist. She says she has always defended the two state solution because that is the only solution. Q: What is your instinct on interventionism? Nandy says she worked for a refugee organisation before she was an MP. She has never believed in the UK going it alone. She is not a pacifist. Sometimes you have to stand up to get peace. She says she marched against the Iraq war. She worked for a Labour MP who voted against the war. Labour has been scarred by Iraq, she says, and it has been hard to move on. But she says it is important to recognise that there are times when you stand up for the country. She says the Iraq war had popular support. It was hard for Labour MPs to vote against it, she says. She says the UK should be a challenging partner in the relationship with the US. It should be demanding assurances that the killing of Qassem Suleimani. Q: What would your view be of a trade deal after Brexit? Nandy says she has had a view on what sort of Brexit the UK needs. It put her at odds with the government, and with the Labour leadership. She wants a soft Brexit, she says. She says there was a moment when Theresa May opened the door for a soft Brexit. Labour should have taken that chance, she says. She says Labour has rendered itself \u201cirrelevant\u201d because it did not take that chance. She says Labour needs to think harder about what trade deals achieve. They are big and clunky, focusing mostly on agriculture. They do not focus on the trade that actually takes place. She says when Rolls-Royce sells products, 80% of the value comes from services. Lisa Nandy has finished her speech, and she is now taking question. She is on stage at the RSA with Matthew Taylor, who runs the RSA and who used to work as head of policy for Tony Blair in Downing Street. There is a live feed here. Q: Why is internationalism so important to you? Because this is the moment for Labour, she says. She says she wants to see an internationalist Labour party. She says she was in despair during the Brexit referendum about the way people were just asked to choose between one of two sides. She says Labour has to connect the local and the global. It has to choose both, she says. Here are some lines from the Lisa Nandy speech. I will do a full summary when I have had a chance to read the text. Jackson Carlaw has launched his campaign to become the next leader of the Scottish Conservatives, a role he has been filling on an interim basis since Ruth Davidson stepped down last August. Carlaw, who enjoys majority support within the party but still faces a contest with shadow social security secretary Michelle Ballantyne, proposed the following: Tax cuts for middle-earners. Those earning \u00a327,000 and above now pay more than in the rest of the UK after the SNP changed Scottish tax bands. A sweeping policy review. Carlaw has already signalled that he wants to put forward a more populist policy agenda, to dovetail with Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for the UK party, and win over blue-collar voters disillusioned with the SNP and Labour. Restoring the 2.000 teachers who he says have been lost from Scotland\u2019s classrooms since the SNP came into power in 2007 and attacking Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s performance in what has been her key priority in government Carlaw, who has not always employed the most judicious turn of phrase when referring to the first minister, said he would be \u201ctaking down\u201d the SNP leader. Sturgeon immediately responded on Twitter \u201cTough man talk - but didn\u2019t he just \u2018take me on\u2019 in the general election and lose half his seats? On the strength of that performance, he\u2019s certainly my favoured candidate for Tory leader!\u201d Earlier in the day, Douglas Ross, a junior Scotland Office minister, told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that the Tories will block a second independence referendum for up to 50 years, regardless of SNP success in elections. Ross said that the party\u2019s \u201conce in a generation\u201d pledge made in advance of the 2014 referendum should last \u201c30, 40 or 50 years\u201d. He added that the pledge \u201cwas given in the Scottish parliament by Nicola Sturgeon when she was deputy first minister of Scotland, in the final debate that the Scottish parliament held before the referendum campaign. It was written down in the official report.\u201d In the Commons Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and a Labour leadership candidate, is speaking now in the Queen\u2019s speech debate. She has been focusing on the climate crisis, defending Labour\u2019s plans for a green new deal, and criticising the government for not doing enough to cut carbon emissions. You can watch on the parliamentary website here. And Lisa Nandy, another leadership candidate, is also on her feet, delivering a speech at the RSA thinktank on foreign policy. There is a live feed here. I will post highlights from both speeches in due course. Last week\u2019s PMQs felt flat and underpowered, and frankly a bit dull, and this week\u2019s was too. It will probably be like this for a while, for various structural reasons. Boris Johnson clearly doesn\u2019t feel remotely threatened by the outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (even when Corbyn has a point, as he did today), there are no awkward squad Tory MPs posing difficult questions and the Labour leadership contest - where what is said in the next few weeks by candidates will decide the outcome - did not feature, because none of Corbyn\u2019s potential successors got a question. Corbyn devoted all his questions to health and social care and the points he made about what has happened to the NHS after 10 years of Tory government were strong and unanswerable. But as an election loser who is working his notice, Corbyn doesn\u2019t really have the authority to unsettle Johnson, and the PM rambled through quite easily. Corbyn\u2019s reference to the Labour manifesto gave Johnson the chance to deliver an effective put-down. (See 12.11pm.) Otherwise, on the NHS, Johnson did not have an answer to the question as to why waiting times had got so much worse over the last 10 years, but as usual he sought to brush this off with super-charged, \u2018will do better\u2019 optimism. In a small chamber dominated by supportive Tory MPs, this worked. But for quite how long can he pull this off? Exchanges like today\u2019s must be helping to convince Johnson that, if he has not measurably improved the NHS after five years, he will be in real trouble. But he also has a tendency to over-promise - at one point today he came close to committing to cure dementia (see 12.20pm), which would be headline news if anyone believed him - and a lot of he is saying at this point in his premiership may pose problems for him further down the line, when reality catches up with him. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, says widowed parents with children used to receive payments while they had children at home. These payments were cut, and replaced with payments lasting just 18 months. Will the government review this? Johnson says he will meet Davey to discuss this. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Snap verdict coming up soon. Maria Miller, a Conservative, asks what the government will do to protect children from online abuse. Johnson says the cabinet discussed this yesterday. The government will be taking more action in the near future. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth The SNP\u2019s Douglas Chapman asks about the end of the Erasmus+ scheme. It will be a disaster, he says, quoting Muriel Gray. Johnson says there is \u201cno threat\u201d to the Erasmus+ scheme. Helen Grant, a Conservative, asks about the government\u2019s plans for the UK-Africa investment summit. Johnson says this will take place on 20 January. It will allow the UK to show its huge commitment to Africa, and the opportunities there are there. Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative, says after the UK has left the EU, it will be able to lead the world in animal welfare standards. Will Johnson make this his priority? Yes, says Johnson. As the UK leaves the EU, it will be able to ban the live shipment of animals. Under Labour plans this would not be possible, he says. This is from the Full Fact fact-checking website. Sir Desmond Swayne asks about the government\u2019s plans for a commission looking at the relationship between the government and the judiciary. It is a closed question, and Johnson gives a non-commmital reply. Swayne then asks about bygones. That seems to be a reference to Brexit, and the supreme court. Johnson says the government wants to stop the abuse of judicial review. Labour\u2019s Debbie Abrahams says dementia is the biggest cause of death in the UK. Will the PM commit to more research into this? Johnson says the government is doubling funding on this. He wants a \u201cmoon shot\u201d and to be able to cure this, if possible. Sir David Amess, a Conservative, says Johnson promised to make Southend a city. Johnson says the citification of Southend continues. Labour\u2019s Clive Efford says research this week shows the oceans are heating up at a catastrophic rate. The government will miss most of its environmental goals for 2020. Will the PM give the new Office for Environmental Protection powers to fine the government if it misses targets? Johnson says the Office for Environmental Protection will have powers to hold the government to account. Johnson restates his commitment to rolling out superfast broadband. The SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, says the PM is a \u201cdemocracy denier\u201d. He says Johnson refusal to allow Scotland another independence referendum is unsustainable. Johnson says Blackford and the SNP are the deniers of democracy, because they said they would abide by the result of the 2014 poll. Blackford says the only union Johnson is interested in is his union with Donald Trump. What backroom deals are being done with Trump? Johnson criticises the SNP\u2019s record on education. Children are not getting the chances they deserve because of the SNP\u2019s obsession with independence. \u201cChange the record,\u201d he says. Robert Halfon, a Conservative, says white working class boys underperform at school. Does Johnson agree the government should invest in apprenticeships? Johnson says he does accept this. The government will reform the apprenticeship levy, he says. Corbyn asks why the government is putting into law an inadequate funding level. The NHS needs more, he says. Johnson promised a clear plan on social care last summer. Where is it? Johnson says he wants to hold cross-party talks on this. He wants to ensure no one has to sell their home to pay for care. He can do this with Labour support. He says he is now tackling a problem shirked by many previous governments. Corbyn says Labour has a plan for free personal care, with support for carers. He offers to send Johnson a copy of the manifesto. He says the legislation being published today committing the government to raising NHS spending is a \u201cgimmick\u201d. He says the Tories should fund the NHS properly. Johnson says he is glad Corbyn is still fighting on his manifesto, because the public made it clear what they thought of it. He says the Tories are now the party of the NHS, and they support the policies that would pay for it. Corbyn says action is needed urgently. Last week a patient in his 90s had to wait more than four hours because a bed was not available. And last month more than 2,000 patients had to wait more than 12 hours for a bed. Johnson says what happened to this patient was unacceptable. But most patients get fantastic treatment. The hospital in Leicester involved in this case is being rebuilt, he says. Corbyn says Johnson promised 40 new hospitals, but it turned out to be just six. He says the investment in the NHS will not be enough. Johnson says the Tories had to pick up from the mess left by Labour. He says he is putting more money into the NHS. Jeremy Corbyn asks why patients are waiting longer for NHS care after 10 years of Tory government. Johnson says the government is investing record sums in the NHS. Today the legislation is being published that will guarantee this funding. Corbyn says the number of people waiting more than four hours at A&amp;E for more than four hours is at a record high. And waits for cancer treatment are growing. Why is this allowed? Johnson says the NHS is doing a fantastic jobs. But waits for cancer treatment are \u201cunacceptable\u201d, he says. He says the government will get those times down. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Tory, asks when the whole country will get gigabit broadband. By 2025, says Johnson. Labour\u2019s Gill Furniss asks Boris Johnson about the loss of steel industry jobs. When will the government bring forward a comprehensive plan for this industry? Johnson says the government is doing all it can to ensure that steel made in this country has competitive advantages. Everyone working for Liberty Steel will be able to stay in the industry because they will be offered jobs in a successor company. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Boris Johnson wants to move CCHQ, the Conservative party\u2019s HQ (CC stands for Conservative Campaign), out of London, according to ConservativeHome. A No 10 source told the website it should be in the north or the Midlands. Paul Goodman reports: Downing Street told us that the new venue should be \u201csomewhere reasonably close to a university with good maths/physics departments (we should get a data team up there), good train links, well placed in political terms\u201d. Given the reference to maths, physics and data, it seems likely that the source was Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s most senior adviser. He is obsessed about the need for more science skills in government and in politics. Jess Phillips, the Labour leadership candidate, has released a new campaign video this morning. It is basically a round-up of some of her greatest hits in the House of Commons. The news that the Leave Means Leave Brexit party will go ahead in Parliament Square on 31 October will no doubt revitalise the campaign to get Big Ben chiming on the night. Two newspapers, the Sun and the Daily Express, are running front page stories today about Boris Johnson supposedly backing a crowdfunding plan to raise the \u00a3500,000 cost - even though, as my colleague Peter Walker reports in his story on this, the plan does not exist. On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning the Tory Brexiter Mark Francois claimed that the \u00a3500,000 needed could be raised from the public within days. He said: It seems to me and many of my colleagues in the House of Commons patently daft that we have got the most iconic clock in the world - literally, it\u2019s a world heritage site - that that should stay silent on this occasion. Francois has said he would donate \u00a31,000 to the cause. On the Today programme this morning Iain Duncan Smith, another Tory Brexiter, said that he would be happy to chip in for this too. Will this madness ever end? Perhaps Brexit will turn out to be a great success, but if it doesn\u2019t, anyone telling the story of Britain\u2019s national decline is going to have to include a chapter about the fetishisation of a Victorian clock and why it has become such an all-embracing Brexiter obsession. It is quite peculiar ... Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has said that the party Leave Means Leave is planning for Parliament Square to celebrate Brexit on the night of 31 January is going ahead. Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional relations secretary, claimed this morning that the Scottish government had \u201cmany options\u201d it could follow to ensure a second independence referendum took place. Under the Scotland Act the Scottish government needs Westminster approval to hold a vote, but yesterday Boris Johnson said he would not allow this. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme, Russell said: I think you can either have democracy or you can have dictatorship, you can\u2019t have both. If Boris Johnson wants to be a dictator that simply says \u2018other people\u2019s votes don\u2019t matter, Scotland\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter, Scotland isn\u2019t a nation\u2019, that is a decision which cannot hold in my view, because it goes so much against the views of the people of Scotland. Even those who are not in favour of independence, we know, are in favour of saying it is right that if the people of Scotland vote for something they get their chance to choose. That is all this is about. The Scottish government has refused to rule out taking legal action in a bid to win the right to hold a fresh independence ballot. Russell said SNP ministers had \u201cmany options\u201d but added he did \u201cnot want to go into them\u201d. Matt Hancock has signalled that four-hour waiting targets for A&amp;E are likely to be scrapped for the NHS in England after the worst figures on record this winter, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. She says: The health secretary said it would be better if targets were \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d and the \u201cright targets\u201d, as he defended the NHS\u2019s failure to meet the standard that 95% of patients attending A&amp;E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. The target was put under review by Theresa May\u2019s government and the NHS unveiled plans last March to pilot changes that would prioritise patients with serious conditions while patients with minor problems could wait longer than four hours. A decision about the flagship four-hour target is due to be taken by NHS England in the coming months. And here is her story in full. Jess Phillips, another Labour leadership contender, was in Glasgow yesterday, and she gave an interview to the Daily Record. Here are the main points. Phillips strongly criticised John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, for saying last summer that Labour would not oppose having a second referendum on Scottish independence. She said: For Scottish Labour, that was like pulling the rug away without any forewarning ... What John McDonnell did harmed Scottish Labour. She suggested this move by McDonnell implied that a Labour government would operate in alliance with the SNP and she said this was damaging to the party. She said: Why would you vote Labour in Scotland if you knew you could vote SNP and get a Labour government? She described herself as a unionist. Asked about this, she said: Yes \u2026 I am proud to be from the United Kingdom. I would never, ever want to see the break up of our nation. She said she was open to being persuaded of the case for decriminalising drugs. Asked about this she said: I am absolutely open minded to be brought round on that matter. She said she backed calls for safe consumption rooms for drug addicts. She said that her brother used to be a heroin addict and that as a result this issue really mattered to her. She was lukewarm in her support for the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, before admitting that she had not had many dealings with him. In a speech this afternoon Lisa Nandy, one of the five candidates still in the contest for the Labour leadership, will criticise Labour remainers for not being internationalist enough. According to a preview by Jane Merrick for the i, Nandy will argue that remainers were so focused on making the case for staying in the EU that the ended up paying only \u201clip service\u201d to its broader internationalist traditions. We have not seen the full text of the speech yet, but according to the i Nandy will say: For Labour internationalism has become just about being in the EU. We\u2019ve paid lip service to our proud internationalist history but without ever explaining what that meant for the future. Because we\u2019ve been locked in a corrosive debate solely focused on remain or leave. One of the problems with the referendum was that there was no story about our place in the world. They said we were a small nation with a proud history of punching above our weight. We said we\u2019ll cut your mobile phone roaming charges. Nandy voted remain in the 2016, but she represents Wigan, where 64% of people voted leave, and in the last parliament she was one of the Labour MPs arguing that the party should accept the result of the referendum and implement a soft version of Brexit. As the BBC reports, the government\u2019s decision to offer a rescue package to the regional airline company Flybe has been criticised by the British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh. In a private letter to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, Walsh said Flybe did not need government support. According to the BBC, Walsh said: Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its operations by subsidising regional routes. Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. Flybe\u2019s precarious situation makes a mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional flights if a third runway is built. But Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has defended the government\u2019s move. She told BBC Breakfast: The government isn\u2019t in the market to bail out private companies. What we do on a case by case basis is look to see whether a business is viable. In the case of Flybe, it is a viable business. There are structural challenges ... The regional connectivity role that it provides for the UK means that there are some routes that are very tricky, and what we have agreed to do as a government is a review of regional connectivity that takes into account, for example, our net zero carbon emissions. And what that will do is it will continue to create a level playing field for all airlines. Ostensibly Boris Johnson is a close ally of Donald Trump\u2019s, but on matters of substance the Johnson government has shown some willingness to keep its distance from Washington and how the relationship will end up remains to be seen. On Huawei, Johnson is so far refusing to adopt the Washington line. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, the UK is rejecting some of the warnings coming from the Trump administration and the Times today (paywall) says opinion in government is \u201cleaning towards rejecting US demands to ban the company on security grounds\u201d. And on Iran, although the UK did not criticise the decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, its support wasn\u2019t unequivocal and full-throated. It is hard to know where the relationship will end up, but yesterday there was an interesting development when Johnson used his BBC interview to urge Trump to come up with a replacement to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Obama-era deal to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon that Trump has rejected. Johnson said this even though Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, later told MPs that the UK had still not given up on the JCPOA. Trump has welcomed Johnson\u2019s comments. Overnight he tweeted this. Trump\u2019s tweet is based on a misquote; it leaves out an \u201cif\u201d. What Johnson actually said was: \u201cIf we are going to get rid of [the JCPOA], let\u2019s replace it and let\u2019s replace it with the Trump deal.\u201d Trump may have praised Johnson\u2019s intervention, but it has been criticised by the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. According to Reuters, in a speech yesterday Rouhani said the offer of a Trump deal was \u201cstrange\u201d and he said Britain and the US should stick with the JCPOA. He said: This Mr Prime Minister in London, I don\u2019t know how he thinks. He says let\u2019s put aside the nuclear deal and put the Trump plan in action. If you take the wrong step, it will be to your detriment. Pick the right path. The right path is to return to the nuclear deal. We are likely to hear more on this at PMQs. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Peers resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 1pm: Lisa Nandy, the Labour leadership candidate, gives a speech on foreign policy. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

We need the two together.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Richard Leese, the Labour leader of Manchester city council, said it was clear that he, Blake and the Tory West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, were all \u201csinging off the same hymn sheet\u201d in their calls for HS2 to get the go-ahead.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get down to what investment we need, we should not be making choices between local services, between Northern Powerhouse rail and HS2. The north of England is absolutely fed up of getting the crumbs from the table,\u201d Leese said.</p> <p>Street said: \u201cI\u2019m probably the only person in the room that knows exactly what the Oakervee [report] says because I sat on the review ... What I am utterly confident of is that there is a strong economic case that will eventually win through. The reason there is a strong economic case is that we can already see the benefits on the ground in the West Midlands.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Heaton-Harris, the rail minister, told the meeting that he could see both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail were important but added: \u201cThe transport secretary has spoken to Doug Oakervee and is now waiting for the final report \u2026 Only once we have the data from an independent source can we make a decision about its future. We hope to make that decision shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, who chaired the meeting, said: \u201cThe turnout at the meeting was high, which does suggest people are concerned.

And there is very strong feeling that it should not be either or \u2013 you\u2019ve got to do both. And the third point is that, pending the Oakervee report, we are not getting government being full-heartedly behind the project.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/07/cancelling-hs2-would-fail-new-tory-voters-boris-johnson-told\">Cancelling HS2 would fail new Tory voters, Boris Johnson told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lobbying efforts on both sides of the debate have significantly stepped up in recent weeks.

      "bodyText": "Supporters of HS2 are growing increasingly anxious that Boris Johnson is prepared to scrap part of the high-speed railway project or overhaul it in a bid to redirect the money towards other transport in the north of England. Local government leaders from the north and Midlands are privately concerned there has been a change of tone from No 10 since Christmas, causing nervousness that the government could scale back the scheme. One pro-HS2 source with knowledge of Downing Street\u2019s thinking said the future of the project, first announced in 2009, was \u201changing in the balance\u201d since the election campaign. Johnson\u2019s transport adviser, Andrew Gilligan, is known to be against HS2, and Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, is also not keen, having described it last year as a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d. The parts most under threat are thought to be the first leg between London and Birmingham or even the eastern leg from Birmingham to Leeds, with billions potentially redirected towards other transport links in the north and Midlands such as the proposed Northern Powerhouse rail project. This is a plan for a fast rail route between Manchester and Leeds, as well as potentially other northern cities. Johnson has for months been expected to endorse HS2 if it can reduce its costs, after commissioning a review by Douglas Oakervee, which is understood to support the whole line going ahead. However, the government is dragging its feet over the publication of the Oakervee report and final decision, claiming the document is not finished yet even though it was submitted to the Department for Transport in November. A DfT source insisted \u201cthere is no final report\u201d as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, \u201chad some questions\u201d about earlier drafts and it was sent back for revisions. No 10 said Johnson was not in a position to make a decision because he had not yet seen the report. At a packed meeting in parliament on Tuesday, council leaders from across the north of England and Midlands said it was crucial that the project went ahead. Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds council and chair of the Core Cities project, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in Leeds is just the promise of HS2 coming in has been transformational in itself \u2026 I want to make it absolutely clear that we can\u2019t talk about Northern Powerhouse rail or HS2. We need the two together.\u201d Sir Richard Leese, the Labour leader of Manchester city council, said it was clear that he, Blake and the Tory West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, were all \u201csinging off the same hymn sheet\u201d in their calls for HS2 to get the go-ahead. \u201cWhen we get down to what investment we need, we should not be making choices between local services, between Northern Powerhouse rail and HS2. The north of England is absolutely fed up of getting the crumbs from the table,\u201d Leese said. Street said: \u201cI\u2019m probably the only person in the room that knows exactly what the Oakervee [report] says because I sat on the review ... What I am utterly confident of is that there is a strong economic case that will eventually win through. The reason there is a strong economic case is that we can already see the benefits on the ground in the West Midlands.\u201d Chris Heaton-Harris, the rail minister, told the meeting that he could see both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail were important but added: \u201cThe transport secretary has spoken to Doug Oakervee and is now waiting for the final report \u2026 Only once we have the data from an independent source can we make a decision about its future. We hope to make that decision shortly.\u201d Afterwards, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, who chaired the meeting, said: \u201cThe turnout at the meeting was high, which does suggest people are concerned. There is a concern that the repricing that\u2019s going on with HS2, which was always going to come, will be used as a reason to stop the scheme or curtail it, such as the eastern leg not getting built. \u201cA second issue is that this is being posed as \u2018you can have HS2 or you can have Northern Powerhouse rail but not both of them\u2019. And there is very strong feeling that it should not be either or \u2013 you\u2019ve got to do both. And the third point is that, pending the Oakervee report, we are not getting government being full-heartedly behind the project.\u201d Lobbying efforts on both sides of the debate have significantly stepped up in recent weeks. Council leaders, mayors, a group of Birmingham MPs and the former chancellor George Osborne have all publicly urged the prime minister to go ahead. Meanwhile, a group of newly elected Tory MPs called on him to scrap the project. Lord Berkeley, who was deputy on the Oakervee review, released his own minority report saying he did not endorse the conclusions of the rest of the panel, warning that costs had spiralled to more than \u00a3100bn. Dame Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative former cabinet minister and leading critic of HS2, said: \u201cI think it is time to reprioritise \u2026 We\u2019ve got routes from London to Birmingham; that shouldn\u2019t be a priority. It\u2019s Birmingham northwards that should be the priority. I would absolutely freeze the London to Birmingham stretch and put it on ice.\u201d A study by the National Trust and the Woodland Trust and wildlife bodies found this week that HS2 will destroy or irreparably damage five internationally protected wildlife sites, 693 local wildlife sites, 108 ancient woodlands and 33 legally protected sites of special scientific interest. This was disputed by HS2 Ltd, which said the data was not new and that it included all sites within 500 metres of the line regardless of how they were affected. On the future of the project, an HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: \u201cWe await the publication of the government\u2019s official review into HS2. Investment in a state-of-the-art high-speed line is critical for the UK\u2019s low-carbon transport future, will provide much-needed rail capacity up and down the country, and is integral to rail projects in the north and Midlands which will help rebalance the UK economy.\u201d",

This is not expected to stand up in court, but that isn\u2019t even half the story. Even if Meghan were victorious, she might have watched her own father give evidence against her.

      "bodyText": "The University of Sussex is offering students up to \u00a3100 if they suffered \u201cdistress and inconvenience\u201d during recent strikes, becoming the first British university to give compensation to students in the middle of industrial action. The move is a sign of the increasing efforts by universities to resolve student complaints swiftly and head off action through the courts or regulators that could lead to more damaging penalties. Sussex launched its \u201cindustrial action ex gratia scheme\u201d this week, with an email to all students inviting them to apply for cash payouts resulting from the national University and College Union (UCU) strikes that took place in November and December. Kelly Coate, pro-vice chancellor for education and students, wrote in the email: \u201cWe do recognise that some students may have experienced distress and/or inconvenience during the strike days. So we have moved quickly to provide an opportunity for you to tell us if you feel you experienced any distress and inconvenience \u2013 and to what extent \u2013 and have decided to launch an \u2018ex-gratia\u2019 payment scheme in respect of this \u2013 which is now open. The University of Sussex believes this is important to offer its students.\u201d Sussex was one of 60 UK universities where staff voted to take eight days of strike action over pay or pensions. In addition staff are still taking action short of a strike, such as working strictly to contracted hours, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures or classes lost to industrial action. Students can apply for payments through an online form on the university\u2019s website. It asks students to rate the \u201cdistress and inconvenience\u201d to their learning as minor, moderate or significant, as well as details of modules or supervisions affected, and their attendance record. Sussex said it was following guidance from the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), with \u00a340 for minor distress and inconvenience, increasing to \u00a3100 for significant distress and inconvenience. Jim Dickinson, associate editor of the Wonkhe higher education policy website, said the OIA had indicated that lost learning opportunities were grounds for students to claim compensation from universities. \u201cIt looks to me like Sussex has got ahead of the curve here, rather than waiting for complaints to come in and end up with the OIA or the courts. They\u2019ve got in front of that and developed a compensation scheme before being caught out by individual complaints,\u201d he said. While many universities compensated their students after the previous industrial action in 2018, Sussex is the first to offer compensation in the midst of an ongoing dispute, which could see further strikes later this year. Dickinson noted parallels between Sussex\u2019s offer and the automatic delay repayment schemes operated by railway companies. \u201cWhat we are starting to see is a fundamental change in the relationship between students and universities that is much more focused on the individual rights of students to get what it is they were promised,\u201d Dickinson said. Jo Grady, the UCU\u2019s general secretary, said she wasn\u2019t surprised universities were mollifying students whose studies had been \u201cdisrupted by avoidable strike action\u201d. \u201cStudents have told us that they are right behind us when it comes to the fight for fair pay and decent pensions in higher education, and the employers\u2019 main focus should be on avoiding any further disruption by resolving these disputes as quickly as possible,\u201d Grady said. Talks between UCU and employers over contributions to the University Superannuation Scheme (USS) at the core of the dispute are taking place this month, with UCU warning that further industrial action is likely unless the matter is resolved. UCU has reopened strike ballots at a further 37 universities, which may see more universities affected after balloting closes on 28 January.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Eleanor, 34, Northamptonshire</strong></h2> <p>I had three miscarriages in 2018, all under 12 weeks. I became very anxious to the point that it was impacting every area of my life. It affected my sleep and I had very negative thoughts. I spent a lot of time crying and kept having flashbacks to the third, most traumatic miscarriage, particularly when I was trying to sleep or relax. I had such severe bleeding that I was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. My family struggled to understand the impact it had on me. Only one friend, who had also had a miscarriage, seemed to get it. The professionals who dealt with me when I was admitted were clearly ill-equipped to cope with any mental health implications, which was not their fault. It was only when I self-referred for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) months later that I was able to get the support I needed.</p> <h2><strong>Nicole, 33, London</strong></h2> <p>I found out I had an ectopic pregnancy four months before my wedding day. They had to operate to terminate the pregnancy and I lost a fallopian tube. I think it is difficult for people to understand what it means to lose a pregnancy early on. Terms such as a \u201cbundle of cells\u201d and \u201cnot a viable pregnancy\u201d are often used to downplay what it means to lose a pregnancy. My heart breaks every time I think of it and what it meant to be pregnant. While it was a \u201cbundle of cells\u201d to doctors and \u201cnot a viable pregnancy\u201d, it was a dream to me to be pregnant. It will always break my heart in a way only other women in my situation will understand.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous</strong></h2> <p>I have suffered from PTSD symptoms since having six first-trimester miscarriages. This has included vivid flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, panic attacks and depression. Triggers include menstrual bleeding and the smell or sight of blood. I did not receive any mental health support at the time. I have had to seek out private CBT and EMDR (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) therapy to deal with the symptoms. Friends and family haven\u2019t really known what to say and had little understanding of the trauma I was suffering. It has affected every aspect of my life. Thankfully, I have two healthy children, but the pregnancy, immediately following the miscarriages, was very stressful.</p> <h2><strong>Bibi, 40, Austria</strong></h2> <p>After miscarrying at 14 weeks I had to wait a week for the foetus to be expelled naturally. I remember taking at least five long showers a day, sometimes even more, because I felt so disgusting. Afterwards, I began having nightmares and kept asking myself if I was being punished somehow, because I had avoided being pregnant for so long. Everyone kept telling me that it was OK and I would get pregnant again, like: \u201cWho cares if you lost your child? There will be others.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if my kid was technically not a human being but just a lump of cells \u2013 it was my kid, and it was gone.</p> <p>Since then I no longer want to even think about getting pregnant again. Luckily, my husband (not the father of my miscarried child, we divorced a year after this event) is also child-free, but I grieve the loss of my kid every single day.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous</strong></h2> <p>Five months on, I still haven\u2019t really come to terms with miscarrying at 12 weeks. I have only just told my mum and my therapist. My relationship broke down because of what happened and I am extremely isolated because my friends are at a loss as to how to support me. There isn\u2019t much literature or specialised help available. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a thing that anyone speaks about.</p> <p>I had no idea it would turn my life upside down. I was excited at the thought of having a child; it was unplanned, but not a bad thing. I was happy to adapt my lifestyle and have the conversation with my partner that I would like to keep the child. There would never be a \u201cperfect\u201d time for a baby, so why not now? Unfortunately, I started getting abdominal pains and they got worse. The pain was akin to bad period pain, but sharper. I was told this could happen in early pregnancy. Then came the bleeding and the black-out inducing pain. Finally, I had to admit something was wrong.</p> <p>My therapist thinks it is clear that I have PTSD from the scenario, which I am trying my best to process. Couple that with feeling as if my body failed me and feeling at fault, and it really has resulted in a life-changing level of trauma.</p> <p>At this point, it seems uncertain if I will ever fully process or move on from what happened. I feel for my partner who also went through it too; we both lost so much during this time. I think we both have a lot of regrets, but neither of us knew how to voice our feelings without fear of hurting the other. We eventually drifted apart and split up, doubling our loss.</p> <h2><strong>Kat</strong><strong>, 32, Stockton-on-Tees</strong></h2> <p>My partner and I are grieving for something we never had. I experience waves of extreme sadness and disappointment almost daily and I have had to leave rooms if someone is there with a baby out of fear that I become upset. We had no aftercare or support after the miscarriage and relied on websites such as <a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/\" title=\"\">Tommy\u2019s</a> in order to understand what was happening.</p> <p>After my miscarriage, I received a 12-week ultrasound letter, a phone call from the midwife to book another appointment and an invitation to book a cervical smear (that I couldn\u2019t have because you need to wait 12 weeks after pregnancy). Each one of these pushed me backwards to a place of upset and confusion. We have sent an official complaint to our local hospital. We can only hope they make changes for other women who go through this.</p> <h2><strong>Liz, 35, Shoreham-by-Sea</strong></h2> <p>We have been trying for a baby for seven years and I have had six miscarriages in that time \u2013 all before 11 weeks. It has had a massive impact on my mental health and that of my husband. It\u2019s like being on a constant rollercoaster. There are days when we feel positive, but also days when we feel the future is bleak.</p> <p>With some of the miscarriages, I had severe anxiety after surgery. It was almost as if I had postnatal depression but without a baby. It would take me more than an hour and a half to leave the house \u2013 I would stand in my hallway with my coat on just gearing myself up.</p> <p>It has been a long journey for me and my husband. His anxiety and depression came later, as he was so focused on supporting me. We have a lot of help from both of our families. However, mental health support was almost nonexistent. There were times when everything felt very dark and bleak.</p> <p>We are now receiving treatment at a genetics fertility clinic in Spain and are hopeful that we will be able to have a baby of our own this year. The loss that we have experienced will never leave us, and we both believe that this could have been reduced if we had been supported more by the NHS.</p> <h2><strong>Anonymous</strong></h2> <p>I think it was the well-meaning advice people gave me when I was recovering from my miscarriage that hurt the most: \u201cAt least you know you can get pregnant\u201d and \u201cMy friend had seven miscarriages \u2026\u201d (as if it\u2019s a competition?). I didn\u2019t need any of that. I just needed someone to tell me they were sorry for my loss. I might not have met that child, but in my head I was already a mum and then suddenly I wasn\u2019t. I felt such a failure.</p> <p>I have been on antidepressants ever since. When I became pregnant for the second time, at the end of 2017, I couldn\u2019t relax and enjoy it. Instead of being happy when I felt my bump kick and move, I was terrified the baby was dying. I still struggle with anxiety. As I went into my third trimester and my anxiety about the pregnancy went through the roof, I was convinced I had damaged her, but my baby was born happy and healthy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have always been motivated by a burning desire to tackle inequality and injustice, to stand up for the powerless against the powerful. That\u2019s my socialism. If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right. It\u2019s why I spent 20 years fighting the death penalty across the world, why I marched against the Iraq war, and why I defended the rights of victims of domestic violence as director of public prosecutions. Today\u2019s inequalities and injustices are obvious: a radical Labour government is needed now more than ever. Inequalities of every type \u2013 in power, education, health and wealth \u2013 have become ingrained in our society. A generation of children, including my own, have never known a time without homelessness on our streets. Our public services have been decimated by cuts, leaving schools begging parents for money, and sick patients in hospital corridors. The Tories\u2019 assault on welfare has stripped people of their dignity. The future of our children is too often determined by where they are born, and their class, race and gender. We cannot walk past these inequalities and injustices. Labour lost the election. But the moral fight against inequality and injustice must continue. We must lead that fight against a prime minister with no conviction or principles. Our arguments must be made in parliament, and we must also take them to the country \u2013 to the communities we lost at the election, whose trust we need to win back. As we learn the lessons of our defeat we must relentlessly focus on the future. We can win again if we make the moral case for socialism, a moral socialism that is relevant to people\u2019s everyday lives and the challenges we face as we move into the 2020s and 2030s. There are three foundations to this: economic justice, social justice and climate justice. I believe the free-market economy has failed. It leaves too many people behind, and has fuelled gross inequality. We should be arguing for a new economic model that reduces that inequality, supports trade unions, gives people a real voice in their workplace and enables communities to thrive. The argument that something can be good for the economy but bad for the environment must end. If it\u2019s bad for the environment, then it is bad for the economy. We are the party of the green new deal, and that must be hardwired into everything we say and do. Businesses, investors and consumers clearly have their role to play, but only a determined lead from government can make this happen. The UK can set an example that leads the world, but only if it is seen to be forging an international alliance to end the climate crisis. As we move forward, we must continue to be the party that opposes austerity, supports common ownership and champions investment in our public services. We need to properly fund and defend our NHS and to make the case for a social care system that tackles the scandalous neglect of older and disabled people. We must argue for radical devolution of power to our nations, regions, towns and cities. Many people across the country are understandably frustrated because decisions are taken about them, without them. We need to break the grip Westminster has over our politics and put decisions in the hands of our communities. There are two parts to being Labour. First, enabling everyone to get a decent education, the best job they can, better standards of living and a fulfilling life. The free market has failed in this endeavour. We have to fight to put wealth, power and opportunity in the hands of all. The second part is just as important. People\u2019s lives don\u2019t always work out the way they want. I have seen this at first hand in all the work I have ever done. Labour should always stand by people. The social security system should be decent, strong and unbreakable, with dignity at its heart.

      "body": "<h2>UP FOR THE CUP</h2> <p>Newcastle United are going to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1955, The Fiver really is beginning to believe it. Partly because they nearly fell at the first hurdle against Rochdale the other weekend, the perfect sliding-doors start to a Cup fairytale. Partly because Joelinton is now the sort of goalscoring machine that puts the likes of Malcolm McDonald, Kevin Keegan, Peter Beardsley, Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer (combined major honours with the Toon: 0) to shame. But mainly because, when Newcastle finally win something again, which most mathematical models suggest they probably will at some point in the next few centuries, they\u2019ll be managed not by a messianic bleeds-black-and-white Keeg/Bobby/Rafa-style crowd favourite, but an underwhelming and unpopular former Sunderland boss instead. The story, eight decades in the making and counting, is just bound to end that way.

Unlike the Toon, Tottenham Hotspur have won the Cup on many occasions since the 50s, though their last victory was way back in 1991, and they don\u2019t have the likes of Gazza or Gary Lineker to call on any more. Plus who\u2019ll write the Cup-final single now Chas has passed on? It\u2019s too big a burden for Dave alone, and the drummer\u2019s no help. Still, that\u2019s a bridge they\u2019ll have to cross should they make it that far, the prospect a little more likely in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s win over Middlesbrough, the emergence of exciting full-back Japhet Tanganga and the capture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/15/gedson-fernandes-seals-tottenham-loan-benfica\">Gedson Fernandes on loan from Benfica</a>. The only problem is the upcoming fourth-round tie at Southampton, because Danny Ings versus the perpetually confused Davinson S\u00e1nchez doesn\u2019t look a fair fight to us.</p> <p>Maybe Spurs will have to wait until next year, which will at least solve the Cup-final song problem, because they could simply re-release <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ddjdlqf7vo\">When The Year Ends In One</a>, kicking that particular can down the road. Newcastle may have to put open-topped-bus-route plans on hold too, as history tells us it\u2019s lucky for both Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers when the year ends in zero. United won the trophy in 1990, you see, while Wolves\u2019 last success came at the notoriously dull 1960 final, after which they were pelted with apple cores, orange peel and scrunched-up bits of the match programme by a Wembley crowd bored beyond tears. Could one of these famous old clubs extend this extremely tenuous two-club 30-year pattern in 2020? They\u2019ll both certainly try to keep the dream alive at Old Trafford, United possibly with Eric Bailly, Wolves without Diogo Jota.

      "bodyText": "UP FOR THE CUP Newcastle United are going to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1955, The Fiver really is beginning to believe it. Partly because they nearly fell at the first hurdle against Rochdale the other weekend, the perfect sliding-doors start to a Cup fairytale. Partly because Joelinton is now the sort of goalscoring machine that puts the likes of Malcolm McDonald, Kevin Keegan, Peter Beardsley, Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer (combined major honours with the Toon: 0) to shame. But mainly because, when Newcastle finally win something again, which most mathematical models suggest they probably will at some point in the next few centuries, they\u2019ll be managed not by a messianic bleeds-black-and-white Keeg/Bobby/Rafa-style crowd favourite, but an underwhelming and unpopular former Sunderland boss instead. The story, eight decades in the making and counting, is just bound to end that way. Bernard Cribbins, ladies and gentlemen. Having said all that, Newcastle aren\u2019t the only big club looking to return to their long-gone glory days. Unlike the Toon, Tottenham Hotspur have won the Cup on many occasions since the 50s, though their last victory was way back in 1991, and they don\u2019t have the likes of Gazza or Gary Lineker to call on any more. Plus who\u2019ll write the Cup-final single now Chas has passed on? It\u2019s too big a burden for Dave alone, and the drummer\u2019s no help. Still, that\u2019s a bridge they\u2019ll have to cross should they make it that far, the prospect a little more likely in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s win over Middlesbrough, the emergence of exciting full-back Japhet Tanganga and the capture of Gedson Fernandes on loan from Benfica. The only problem is the upcoming fourth-round tie at Southampton, because Danny Ings versus the perpetually confused Davinson S\u00e1nchez doesn\u2019t look a fair fight to us. Maybe Spurs will have to wait until next year, which will at least solve the Cup-final song problem, because they could simply re-release When The Year Ends In One, kicking that particular can down the road. Newcastle may have to put open-topped-bus-route plans on hold too, as history tells us it\u2019s lucky for both Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers when the year ends in zero. United won the trophy in 1990, you see, while Wolves\u2019 last success came at the notoriously dull 1960 final, after which they were pelted with apple cores, orange peel and scrunched-up bits of the match programme by a Wembley crowd bored beyond tears. Could one of these famous old clubs extend this extremely tenuous two-club 30-year pattern in 2020? They\u2019ll both certainly try to keep the dream alive at Old Trafford, United possibly with Eric Bailly, Wolves without Diogo Jota. It should be fun to watch, though we\u2019ve stocked up on fresh fruit and old copies of United Review, just in case.

Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has revealed that fears over safety in the Middle East mean Manchester United have changed their plans to put their feet up in Qatar during the winter break. Liverpool\u2019s upcoming title defence has been dealt a blow by news that the Africa Cup of Nations is set to be shifted back to January and February. Lucy Bronze has swooped the women\u2019s England player of the year gong, with Jordan Henderson making off with the men\u2019s bauble.

Perpetual crisis-club Macclesfield live to play another day after court proceedings revealed an offer for shares in them was at an advanced stage.

It could be named proportional transferable voting. I suggest that this would meet the requirements outlined by Peter Kellner, and supported by Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips. Greg Conway Amersham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Whatever the flaws of PR, the risk to the \u201cconstituency link\u201d, which Keir Starmer is keen to protect, need not be one of them. Having several MPs in one constituency is no less intimate than being a patient in a group practice of GPs. In both, you can choose which one suits your particular concern, and you may find that colleagues support each other on behalf of their constituents. Dr Sebastian Kraemer London \u2022 Polly Toynbee writes that tactical voting won no seats in December\u2019s election. In ousting the sitting Tory MP in St Albans, voters certainly think tactical voting secured a Liberal victory here.

At meetings I attend there are individuals who have lost jobs, families and have been rough sleepers. AA being for \u201cthe people who sit at the top of our society,\u201d not for the marginalised is the opposite of my experience. Membership of AA is free, unlike the $197 (reduced rate) for Ms Whitaker\u2019s Tempest, which would make her organisation only for the socially advantaged. AA meetings are full of people who have lapsed many times and are unfailingly welcomed back as opposed to being made to feel \u201ckind of stupid\u201d. Men are twice as likely to be affected by alcoholism but membership of AA is 38% female. The \u201cego\u201d that AA refers to relates to obsessively thinking about oneself rather than reaching out to others for help and offering support to them. Many atheists attend AA.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Holly Whitaker\u2019s assertion that patriarchy is the root of the AA programme paints a picture of AA I do not recognise. I am a woman, member of AA and a feminist. AA is one of the only places I go in my daily life where everyone is equal and anyone can share their feelings without fear of judgement. There is no hierarchy. Us women are not required to hand power over to men.</p> <p>Yes, AA was founded at a time when patriarchy was rife, and arguably the literature should be modernised \u2013 but the groups work as a melting pot that not only gives women space to find their voice, but also works to break down toxic masculinity and aid men in showing emotional vulnerability. Patriarchal structures are deeply embedded in our society and must be challenged. But it\u2019s dangerous to claim an organisation that works to dismantle an alcoholic\u2019s feelings of worthlessness \u2013 often the consequences of patriarchy \u2013 is part of the problem. It isn\u2019t.</p> <p>While all methods of getting sober are to be celebrated, and I wish Ms Whitaker well, what many AA members take issue with is Ms Whitaker\u2019s misrepresentation of a recovery method in which she didn\u2019t actively engage; she has admitted to attending less than 10 AA meetings and not working the suggested programme. One can only speculate then as to why her company focuses heavily on denigrating AA\u2019s free programme when promoting their $500 sobriety course.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As someone who has managed their alcoholism over 20 years through AA, I found Holly Whitaker\u2019s criticisms ill informed. Perhaps her few months in AA was not long enough for her to come to terms with the confusion and anger all alcoholics feel when they attempt to quit. Her characterisation of AA as only designed for a male with a rampant ego is wrong. Most men in AA in my experience suffer from low self-esteem. Many meetings have more women than men, and both sexes relate to the message of powerlessness over alcohol. It is very wrong to say AA makes people feel stupid if they drink again. Everyone is aware of the power alcohol exerts and anyone who wants to stop is welcomed back to AA regardless of how difficult they find it.</p> <p>It is a programme of abstinence, but no one in AA seeks to stop anyone \u201ctrying again\u201d. It\u2019s up to them. AA has supported and helped hundreds of people of both sexes, and, unlike her organisation, it is free. Recovery should not be income dependent. However, if her organisation is enjoying success and recovery, I wish it well. She is quite right to highlight the enormous commercial pressures on women to drink alcohol, and the harm this is causing.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

AA meetings are full of people who have lapsed many times and are unfailingly welcomed back as opposed to being made to feel \u201ckind of stupid\u201d. Men are twice as likely to be affected by alcoholism but membership of AA is 38% female. The \u201cego\u201d that AA refers to relates to obsessively thinking about oneself rather than reaching out to others for help and offering support to them. Many atheists attend AA. Name and address supplied \u2022 Holly Whitaker\u2019s assertion that patriarchy is the root of the AA programme paints a picture of AA I do not recognise. I am a woman, member of AA and a feminist. AA is one of the only places I go in my daily life where everyone is equal and anyone can share their feelings without fear of judgement. There is no hierarchy. Us women are not required to hand power over to men. Yes, AA was founded at a time when patriarchy was rife, and arguably the literature should be modernised \u2013 but the groups work as a melting pot that not only gives women space to find their voice, but also works to break down toxic masculinity and aid men in showing emotional vulnerability. Patriarchal structures are deeply embedded in our society and must be challenged. But it\u2019s dangerous to claim an organisation that works to dismantle an alcoholic\u2019s feelings of worthlessness \u2013 often the consequences of patriarchy \u2013 is part of the problem. It isn\u2019t. While all methods of getting sober are to be celebrated, and I wish Ms Whitaker well, what many AA members take issue with is Ms Whitaker\u2019s misrepresentation of a recovery method in which she didn\u2019t actively engage; she has admitted to attending less than 10 AA meetings and not working the suggested programme. One can only speculate then as to why her company focuses heavily on denigrating AA\u2019s free programme when promoting their $500 sobriety course. Name and address supplied \u2022 As someone who has managed their alcoholism over 20 years through AA, I found Holly Whitaker\u2019s criticisms ill informed. Perhaps her few months in AA was not long enough for her to come to terms with the confusion and anger all alcoholics feel when they attempt to quit. Her characterisation of AA as only designed for a male with a rampant ego is wrong. Most men in AA in my experience suffer from low self-esteem. Many meetings have more women than men, and both sexes relate to the message of powerlessness over alcohol. It is very wrong to say AA makes people feel stupid if they drink again. Everyone is aware of the power alcohol exerts and anyone who wants to stop is welcomed back to AA regardless of how difficult they find it. It is a programme of abstinence, but no one in AA seeks to stop anyone \u201ctrying again\u201d. It\u2019s up to them. AA has supported and helped hundreds of people of both sexes, and, unlike her organisation, it is free. Recovery should not be income dependent. However, if her organisation is enjoying success and recovery, I wish it well. She is quite right to highlight the enormous commercial pressures on women to drink alcohol, and the harm this is causing.

Research published in the European Heart Journal found that your heart expends a mild-to-moderate effort during sex, similar to walking up a flight of stairs. Of course, unless you\u2019re having Kama Sutra marathons, that\u2019s probably not enough exertion to meet the government recommendation of 150 minutes of exercise a week. But it\u2019s better than nothing. Just don\u2019t let your partner do all the work. It\u2019s good for stress Sex, including masturbation, is a ferocious stress-reliever.A 2006 paper in Biological Psychology found that people who have penetrative or non-penetrative sex or masturbate cope better with stress. It certainly gives a new dimension to the term stress balls. It boosts your wellbeing A 2007 study of 3,000 Americans aged between 57 and 85 found that those who were sexually active in later life reported higher levels of general health than their non-active peers. Of course, these people might be more sexually active because they are healthier, but other studies have pointed to a link between sexual activity and general wellbeing. It\u2019s a natural drug In the 1950s, the controversial US psychologist Harry Harlow placed rhesus monkeys in a cage and gave them the option of a wire \u201cmother\u201d that dispensed milk or a soft-cloth \u201cmother\u201d that they could cuddle. The monkeys preferred the company of the soft-cloth mother, even though it didn\u2019t dispense milk. Like monkeys, humans have a powerful need for touch. When we touch each other, the brain releases the hormone oxytocin, the so-called love drug. Released during sex, oxytocin helps you to feel tranquil and loving, and even helps with sleep. So the next time you feel inexplicably in love with a one-night stand, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s just the hormones talking. It might keep you smarter, for longer Research from Coventry University, published in Age and Ageing, found that people who were sexually active into old age (defined as adults between 50 and 89) performed better on cognitive tests than their non-sexually active peers. In particular, men seemed to benefit the most, performing well in tests involving number sequencing and recall. Women also performed well in recall tests, but not as well in number sequencing. It could fend off illness \u2013 maybe There\u2019s limited evidence to show that having moderate amounts of sex can be associated with higher levels of the antibody immunoglobulin A. A 2004 study published in Psychology Report found that people who had sex once or twice a week had 30% higher levels of immunoglobulin A than those who had no sex. However, those who had sex more than twice a week had lower levels than celibate people. Seems it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Sirin Kale",

He also openly and consistently disputes the link between climate change and worsening disasters and \u201chat tips\u201d Kelly for his work in this space, linking to Kelly\u2019s posts. Matt Canavan Unashamedly pro-coal, the Queensland senator declared it had been \u201csuch an honour to represent the Australian mining sector\u201d when he briefly stepped down from the ministry, during the section 44 constitutional issues which weighed down the previous parliament. While agreeing that Australia should reduce carbon emissions, he also told the ABC on 12 December: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t agree with is that doing so in Australia would significantly or at all reduce bushfire risk. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can at all, at this stage, link individual events to particular outcomes. The fires have not started due to climate change.\u201d Barnaby Joyce After leading the charge against the carbon price, Joyce has since acknowledged climate change is real and happening. Yet he continues to float debunked theories. \u201cThere are a range of things that affect the climate and, on a global scale, you should be part of it, and acknowledge it would have an effect and I acknowledge that there are other issues as well,\u201d he told Sky News on 11 November. \u201cThere\u2019s just the oscillation of the seasons. There\u2019s a change in the magnetic field of the sun.\u201d Gerard Rennick Another Queensland rightwinger, Rennick made headlines during the 2019 election campaign for accusing the weather bureau of rewriting records as part of the \u201cglobal warming agenda\u201d. After his surprise election to the Senate, Rennick doubled down on his views during a November 2019 interview with Sky News. \u201cYeah, it is a serious accusation. And I\u2019ll stand by it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the record, the changing records and the way they\u2019ve gone about it.\u201d As the bushfire season took hold, Rennick continued to use his social media to deny the impact of humans on climate change. Sam McMahon The NT senator insists it is the Greens\u2019 agenda which led \u201cto these horrible fires\u201d.",

He also notes that \u201cfiscal policy, rather than monetary policy, is the best policy tool to immediately respond to such events\u201d. The call for fiscal stimulus was of course present well before the bushfires took hold. The government declined to provide any in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), and remained committed to its budget surplus. With the government now committing to spending money to respond to the bushfires, it will be interesting to see if it uses this as an excuse to increase general economic stimulus and use the bushfires as a cover for a possible budget deficit this financial year. Given the Myefo saw a $2.1bn downward revision in the budget surplus forecast to $5bn it would not take a great deal of reduced economic activity to knock that even close to a deficit. The recent data suggests the need for economic stimulus remains. On Wednesday the latest building activity data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the commencement of private sector residential building fell another 3.6% in the September 2019 quarter \u2013 the fifth consecutive fall: There is also the continuing rundown of work in the pipeline. The number of buildings with approval but which have yet to begin construction is well off its recent peaks in Sydney and Melbourne: The latest engineering construction figures, also out on Wednesday showed there is some increase in the work being done for the public sector, but overall engineering work remains flat: It suggests very much the need for government stimulus and infrastructure spending remains crucial for providing work in the private sector, especially given the recent slowing of government infrastructure spending: Where things remain somewhat unclear is the household sector. The latest retail trade figures out last week saw a massive 0.9% increase in retail spending in November. Given this was the biggest one-month increase for three years, it could be the sign that households are starting to spend again. While I am usually rather sceptical of big increases or falls in seasonally adjusted figures given how erratic they can be, anecdotally I do believe there was a big jump in spending in November: It is clear now that \u201cBlack Friday\u201d sales are a thing in Australia. The Thanksgiving weekend sales that dominate the US have migrated to Australia, without the turkey dinner and arguments with the in-laws. That weekend I decided to do some early Christmas shopping and was stunned to discover the complete lack of car parks in a number of department stores around Canberra. It was busier than I could recall it ever being for Boxing Day sales. Which brings us to the big question. Right now the ABS is trying to work out just how greatly our shopping habits have changed. If the big boost in November came at the expense of big pre-Christmas and post-Christmas shopping in December, then it is just a blip and nothing more. If not, then we might be able to say that things are looking up. The reality is that December has become much less important over the past 20 years, and that November has become slightly more important over the past four years: For non-food retailers, December used to be worth around six and a half weeks of normal shopping; now it is about five and half weeks.

A month ago the market was pricing in another rate cut to 0.5% to occur by May; now it thinks it will happen only by July. It would seem the market believes the government will need to respond to the bushfires with increased spending and that this may offset the urgency for another interest rate cut \u2013 and yet another rate cut still remains more likely than not. It is clear that we did not end 2019 with any great sense of economic optimism, and the bushfires will have done nothing to improve that \u2013 the budget surplus may remain, but the economy continues to struggle.

In December, Abdullah\u2019s artworks All Let Us Rejoice and For We Are Young and Free were singled out of the touring exhibition Violent Salt by Nationals MP George Christensen and Mackay local councillor Martin Bella. The whole exhibition \u2013 populated largely by Aboriginal artists \u2013 is overtly political, but Abdullah\u2019s work featured the armed forces, any reference to which seemingly provides a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/28/the-yassmin-abdel-magied-bash-a-thon-is-all-part-of-the-anzac-day-ritual\">hall pass for aggressive jingoism</a> and an interpretation of insult to Anzacs, no matter the original intention of the artist or writer. Bella complained on Facebook that the works were disrespectful, and that Abdullah had defaced images of serving soldiers; Christensen that taxpayers and ratepayers should not subsidise political messages that attacked soldiers.</p> <p>Abdullah, whose grandfathers both fought in the second world war in New Guinea, had worked with Yogyakarta workshop DGTWB to create embroideries of Australian military personnel, their eyes obscured by sunglasses. Stamped over their unreadable faces are crude smiley emojis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c035ca39bb16ef18226dd1804291329867032be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c035ca39bb16ef18226dd1804291329867032be3/0_0_1772_2067/857.jpg\" alt=\"For We Are Young and Free by Abdul Abdullah, 2017\" width=\"857\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For We Are Young and Free by Abdul Abdullah, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The backlash from Christensen and Bella\u2019s Facebook posts was swift and brutal. Abdullah\u2019s works were removed from the walls of Artspace Mackay at the behest of the Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, and threats were made to both Abdullah and gallery staff.</p> <p>For Abdullah, it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Back in 2016 he was <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/brothers-turn-experience-into-art-ng-ya-389361\">pictured in the West Australian</a> in front of one of his works that depicted a balaclava. Some readers, taking into account his name, made the assumption that the work was advocating terrorism. It was actually a collage, with one eye belonging to Kanye, one to Beyonc\u00e9, and the mouth to Madonna. The clue was in the title: Entertainers (Kanye, Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna).</p> <p>The reaction was much the same, he says: \u201cState gallery; tax-payer funded; their tax dollars are supporting terrorism; petition to stop the show; threats made to the gallery; letters to the editor.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m a seventh-generation Australian and I\u2019ve got the Australian sensibility of relentlessly giving people shit</p> <footer> <cite>Abdul Abdullah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is pleased that the director of the Noosa regional gallery, where Violent Salt travelled to next, reached out to the local RSL to open up the dialogue, and that the same may be happening with the other points of the tour.</p> <p>Abdullah says his previous work on this theme has only had positive responses from veterans. The juxtaposition of the intimidating exterior of the military subjects with the smiley emojis is an indication of the brave faces such personnel are forced to wear. \u201cI think veterans are treated poorly when they come back to Australia.

      "bodyText": "As an artist, Abdul Abdullah wears his humour on his sleeve, but also on his skin. His tattoo of the Southern Cross encircles an Islamic crescent moon and star, and he got it for the purpose of Them and Us, his photographic self-portrait that won the 2011 Blake prize for human justice. In his 2013 work, Self-Portrait as an Ultra-nationalist, he wears a \u201cFuck off we\u2019re full\u201d T-shirt and an Australian flag. The same year, he made It Doesn\u2019t Matter How I Feel, in which he\u2019s painted black except for his hands, one of which is held in a thumbs-up, the other extending the middle finger. I could go on. \u201cI\u2019m a seventh-generation Australian and I\u2019ve got the Australian sensibility of relentlessly giving people shit,\u201d he says innocently. Born in Perth in 1986, Abdullah can make the rare claim that one of his ancestors came to the country 200 years ago, on the naughty ship Indefatigable. When he talks to Guardian Australia, he\u2019s downing brushes at his studio in St Leonards, Sydney, finishing up a 12m painting for his show at the Armory Art Fair in New York. He\u2019s as genial today as he is in his 2015 Ted Talk (in which he wore the T-shirt \u201cAustralia: Drive it Like You Stole It\u201d), when he said that he hoped his work would \u201ccreate an environment that encourages critical thinking\u201d. Unfortunately, you can only lead the horse to water. In December, Abdullah\u2019s artworks All Let Us Rejoice and For We Are Young and Free were singled out of the touring exhibition Violent Salt by Nationals MP George Christensen and Mackay local councillor Martin Bella. The whole exhibition \u2013 populated largely by Aboriginal artists \u2013 is overtly political, but Abdullah\u2019s work featured the armed forces, any reference to which seemingly provides a hall pass for aggressive jingoism and an interpretation of insult to Anzacs, no matter the original intention of the artist or writer. Bella complained on Facebook that the works were disrespectful, and that Abdullah had defaced images of serving soldiers; Christensen that taxpayers and ratepayers should not subsidise political messages that attacked soldiers. Abdullah, whose grandfathers both fought in the second world war in New Guinea, had worked with Yogyakarta workshop DGTWB to create embroideries of Australian military personnel, their eyes obscured by sunglasses. Stamped over their unreadable faces are crude smiley emojis. The backlash from Christensen and Bella\u2019s Facebook posts was swift and brutal. Abdullah\u2019s works were removed from the walls of Artspace Mackay at the behest of the Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, and threats were made to both Abdullah and gallery staff. For Abdullah, it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Back in 2016 he was pictured in the West Australian in front of one of his works that depicted a balaclava. Some readers, taking into account his name, made the assumption that the work was advocating terrorism. It was actually a collage, with one eye belonging to Kanye, one to Beyonc\u00e9, and the mouth to Madonna. The clue was in the title: Entertainers (Kanye, Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna). The reaction was much the same, he says: \u201cState gallery; tax-payer funded; their tax dollars are supporting terrorism; petition to stop the show; threats made to the gallery; letters to the editor.\u201d He is pleased that the director of the Noosa regional gallery, where Violent Salt travelled to next, reached out to the local RSL to open up the dialogue, and that the same may be happening with the other points of the tour. Abdullah says his previous work on this theme has only had positive responses from veterans. The juxtaposition of the intimidating exterior of the military subjects with the smiley emojis is an indication of the brave faces such personnel are forced to wear. \u201cI think veterans are treated poorly when they come back to Australia. There\u2019s a culture of ignoring mental health concerns in serving men and women, and also police force, ambulance workers and firefighters.\u201d It was for this reason that, in 2016, he painted Craig Campbell, who left the police force with PTSD after defending two Middle Eastern men during the Cronulla Riots. \u201cHe was treated quite poorly by the NSW police and only fairly recently won his legal battle to get his treatment,\u201d Campbell says.

Abdullah painted Mundine a crown, the way Basquiat would when he painted Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard.

That a show was recently shut down seems reminiscent of Joh Bjelke-Petersen\u2019s tenure as Queensland premier, when police regularly invaded punk shows and harassed people in attendance. According to the ABC, Sergeant Nathan Trueman of the strike force has also requested that streaming services remove OneFour\u2019s music from their libraries. \u201cI listen to their music a lot,\u201d Abdullah says. \u201cThe idea of an institution or power structure deciding what can and cannot be rapped about, or what is appropriate to make art about, is absurd.

In 2018, the NSW government announced a $30m program to fund small-scale renewable energy generation and storage in regional and remote communities, through a scheme known as the Regional Community Energy Fund (RCEF). One of the scheme\u2019s three promised aims was to award grants to renewable projects providing regional towns emergency backup power during disasters. The aim was to use renewables and storage to build emergency backup systems for key buildings \u2013 town halls or evacuation centres, for example. The government promised to make funding available for the backup power projects in the program\u2019s second round in mid- to late-2019, most likely between June and September. But the funding was never opened and the NSW government is not answering questions to explain why. The delays mean that funding for the backup power projects was not available before the current bushfire disaster, which caused power outages in regional communities across the state. It is not clear whether projects would have been approved and commenced in time to help in the current disaster, even if the government had lived up to its promised timeline.

Here was Kyrgios himself claiming that he only finds top gear when he is representing Australia. Surely even Warnie is on board now?</p> <p>Which brings us to next week\u2019s season-opening grand slam. Despite the recent revival of Brand Kyrgios, there\u2019s nothing to suggest he\u2019ll end the next fortnight claiming his first major title, further uniting the nation. (That will fall to Ash Barty \u2013 no pressure.) Kyrgios has said so himself, claiming that at individual events like this, he doesn\u2019t feel the same level of inspiration. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing for myself, I find it hard to get up.

What is wrong with our Nick, they ask. What\u2019s holding him back?</p> <p>This week, not for the first time, Roger Federer stepped up with the answers. \u201cNick doesn\u2019t need to improve a whole lot in his game, he knows he can beat everybody,\u201d the Swiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the forehand, the backhand, the serve and volleys and all that stuff. With Nick, we know it\u2019s elsewhere \u2013 it\u2019s his mind. How much can he do, does he want to do?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a perfect slice of Federerism, that \u2013 friendly, humble, chatty. Start with a compliment. Give the media the quotes they crave. Show concern for you opponent but fill your comments with all the alpha male subtext 20-time grand slam champions are allowed. And to finish, whip the insults into the open court. Voila. Our Nick has \u201call that stuff\u201d? Sure, but none of Roger\u2019s trophies.</p> <p>There has always been blame on both sides of the Kyrgios \u201cdebate\u201d, such as it is. The Nick knockers veer between sour-faced fogeyism and borderline white supremacy, while the boosters ignore Kyrgios\u2019s worst behaviour and pretend that a basketball jersey is a personality. In the middle somewhere lies an infuriating, funny, petulant, brilliant, inconsistent, even loveable young man, and one less easy to categorise.</p> <p>And anyway, a lot of the most strident criticism shows nothing more than the passing of time, and the tendency of the old to resent the young. They see Kyrgios as the avatar of a wastrel generation \u2013 a walking, trash-talking manifestation of the \u201cOK Boomer\u201d meme. I once told a renowned and articulate former sportswriter that the best Australian sports book not yet written would pierce the surface of Planet Kyrgios. His reply: \u201cWhy would <em>anyone </em>want to read about that fuckwit?\u201d</p> <p>Of course, we do want to read about him, to talk about him and, most of all, to watch him. One reason for this is the basic scarcity elsewhere of Kyrgios\u2019s qualities. To my mind, Australia currently possesses only three sportspeople whose brilliance is so original and distinct. They are Sam Kerr, Glenn Maxwell and Kyrgios (Steve Smith\u2019s brilliance is now monotonous, his relentless scoring a foregone conclusion). Each has challenged conventions, orthodoxies and mores \u2013 Kerr exposing the obviously sexist lie that the Socceroos are the national football team most worth watching, Maxwell that a man who reverse sweeps the first delivery of his innings is not acting at random just to get the Invincibles turning in their graves.</p> <p>For individual ranking and global esteem, Kyrgios is not in Kerr\u2019s league. Although the \u2019tweeners are cute, he is not an innovator of Maxwell\u2019s ilk. But unlike the others, Kyrgios\u2019s moments of spontaneous genius are derived of a certain madness and fury, which adds the kind of frisson most sport lacks. When every movement is laced with danger, it produces a certain level of suspense. Kerr and Maxwell\u2019s best moments could be frozen in time, sculpted by artisans and poured in bronze. Kyrgios is the open furnace from which such objects emerge.</p> <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll never expect Nick Kyrgios to win it all, but it is a victory of a kind that he has finally felt the love, and spent a few weeks as Our Nick. As Steve Kerrigan so sagely put it, I don\u2019t know what the opposite of letting someone down is, but he\u2019s done the opposite.</p>",

There is an irony there that reflects worst on the critics \u2013 those who often say he\u2019s disgracing his country\u2019s good name, when, for most of the tennis calendar, he\u2019s merely lowering his own colours. Here was Kyrgios himself claiming that he only finds top gear when he is representing Australia. Surely even Warnie is on board now? Which brings us to next week\u2019s season-opening grand slam. Despite the recent revival of Brand Kyrgios, there\u2019s nothing to suggest he\u2019ll end the next fortnight claiming his first major title, further uniting the nation. (That will fall to Ash Barty \u2013 no pressure.) Kyrgios has said so himself, claiming that at individual events like this, he doesn\u2019t feel the same level of inspiration. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing for myself, I find it hard to get up. My motivation levels are pretty low most of the time, but something about these guys and playing for them brings it out of me and I just love it.\u201d So, the renaissance is already looking more like a blip, and accordingly, the dawn of another Australian Open campaign is greeted by the local press how it always is: as an opportunity to play the role of disapproving parents in Meet The Ockers, with visiting tennis stars drafted in as the cross-examined boyfriends and girlfriends. What is wrong with our Nick, they ask. What\u2019s holding him back? This week, not for the first time, Roger Federer stepped up with the answers. \u201cNick doesn\u2019t need to improve a whole lot in his game, he knows he can beat everybody,\u201d the Swiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the forehand, the backhand, the serve and volleys and all that stuff. With Nick, we know it\u2019s elsewhere \u2013 it\u2019s his mind. How much can he do, does he want to do?\u201d It\u2019s a perfect slice of Federerism, that \u2013 friendly, humble, chatty. Start with a compliment. Give the media the quotes they crave. Show concern for you opponent but fill your comments with all the alpha male subtext 20-time grand slam champions are allowed. And to finish, whip the insults into the open court. Voila. Our Nick has \u201call that stuff\u201d? Sure, but none of Roger\u2019s trophies. There has always been blame on both sides of the Kyrgios \u201cdebate\u201d, such as it is. The Nick knockers veer between sour-faced fogeyism and borderline white supremacy, while the boosters ignore Kyrgios\u2019s worst behaviour and pretend that a basketball jersey is a personality. In the middle somewhere lies an infuriating, funny, petulant, brilliant, inconsistent, even loveable young man, and one less easy to categorise. And anyway, a lot of the most strident criticism shows nothing more than the passing of time, and the tendency of the old to resent the young. They see Kyrgios as the avatar of a wastrel generation \u2013 a walking, trash-talking manifestation of the \u201cOK Boomer\u201d meme. I once told a renowned and articulate former sportswriter that the best Australian sports book not yet written would pierce the surface of Planet Kyrgios. His reply: \u201cWhy would anyone want to read about that fuckwit?\u201d Of course, we do want to read about him, to talk about him and, most of all, to watch him. One reason for this is the basic scarcity elsewhere of Kyrgios\u2019s qualities. To my mind, Australia currently possesses only three sportspeople whose brilliance is so original and distinct. They are Sam Kerr, Glenn Maxwell and Kyrgios (Steve Smith\u2019s brilliance is now monotonous, his relentless scoring a foregone conclusion). Each has challenged conventions, orthodoxies and mores \u2013 Kerr exposing the obviously sexist lie that the Socceroos are the national football team most worth watching, Maxwell that a man who reverse sweeps the first delivery of his innings is not acting at random just to get the Invincibles turning in their graves. For individual ranking and global esteem, Kyrgios is not in Kerr\u2019s league. Although the \u2019tweeners are cute, he is not an innovator of Maxwell\u2019s ilk. But unlike the others, Kyrgios\u2019s moments of spontaneous genius are derived of a certain madness and fury, which adds the kind of frisson most sport lacks. When every movement is laced with danger, it produces a certain level of suspense. Kerr and Maxwell\u2019s best moments could be frozen in time, sculpted by artisans and poured in bronze. Kyrgios is the open furnace from which such objects emerge. Perhaps we\u2019ll never expect Nick Kyrgios to win it all, but it is a victory of a kind that he has finally felt the love, and spent a few weeks as Our Nick. As Steve Kerrigan so sagely put it, I don\u2019t know what the opposite of letting someone down is, but he\u2019s done the opposite.",

      "bodyText": "The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, revealed the team that will prosecute Donald Trump in an impeachment trial to get under way in earnest in the Senate early next week. In a morning news conference, Pelosi named seven so-called managers to carry the articles of impeachment to the Senate and make the case that Trump is guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The team will be led by Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee chairman who took the lead in gathering evidence against Trump, and Jerry Nadler, chair of the judiciary committee. \u201cThe emphasis is on litigators,\u201d Pelosi said in introducing the group. \u201cThe emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom. The emphasis is on making the strongest possible case to protect and defend the constitution in the name of the American people.\u201d The announcement raised the curtain on a day of busy impeachment procedure even as Washington buzzed over new evidence of the plot at the heart of the charges against Trump, released by Democrats the night before. Trump is charged with using the power of his office to pressure Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, to announce a false investigation into former vice-president Joe Biden in an effort to damage his political rival. Late on Tuesday, Democrats released communications and notes belonging to Lev Parnas, a close associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, documenting a scheme to \u201cget Zalensky to Annonce that the Biden case will be Investigated\u201d with the direct involvement of \u201cno 1\u201d \u2013 thought to be Trump himself. \u201cTime has been our friend in all of this because it has yielded incriminating evidence, more truth, into the public domain,\u201d Pelosi said. As she spoke, Trump tweeted. \u201cHere we go again,\u201d he wrote, \u201canother Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!\u201d \u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cHe looks forward to having the due process rights in the Senate that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats denied to him, and expects to be fully exonerated.\u201d Even as the case against Trump strengthened, the mechanism that could determine his political fate ground forward. After the naming of impeachment managers, the House was scheduled to hold a vote to send the articles to the Senate. In the afternoon, the articles were to be placed in a hardwood box and escorted across Capitol Hill from the House to the Senate side. \u201cThe president and the senators will be held accountable,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThe American people deserve the truth, and the constitution demands a trial.\u201d Trump is only the third president to face an impeachment trial in the Senate. The Senate will transform into an impeachment court as early as Thursday, with the chief justice of the supreme court, John Roberts, presiding over senators, who serve as jurors. In addition to Schiff and Nadler, other managers were: Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Sylvia Garcia of Texas. As the articles were prepared for the Senate, a debate over whether senators should call witnessesat the trial continued to unfold. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he does not have the votes to simply dismiss the impeachment charges, as the president has suggested, but also has not committed to further testimony. Republican senators were considering an agreement by which each witness called by Democrats, such as the former national security adviser John Bolton, would be rejoined by a Republican witness, such as Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son. But Pelosi warned Republicans on Wednesday against calling \u201cfrivolous\u201d witnesses. \u201cWhat is at stake here is the constitution of the United States,\u201d she said. Trump, Pelosi said, \u201ctried to use the appropriations process as his private ATM machine, in order to advance his personal and political advantage. That is what the senators should be looking into \u2026 They shouldn\u2019t be frivolous with the constitution of the United States, even though the president himself has.\u201d Trump and other Republicans have promoted the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 US presidential election. American intelligence officials have called the president\u2019s continued assertions false and misleading. McConnell, who is negotiating rules for the trial proceedings, has said all 53 Republican senators are on board with his plan to start the session and consider the issue of witnesses later. \u201cThere is little or no sentiment in the Republican conference for a motion to dismiss,\u201d McConnell said. \u2018\u2018Our members feel we have an obligation to listen to the arguments.\u201d Some Republican senators have pushed for the possibility of calling witnesses. \u201cMy position is that there should be a vote on whether or not witnesses should be called,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is leading an effort with Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and the vocal Trump critic Senator Mitt Romney of Utah. Schiff said the latest evidence released by Democrats revealed Trump\u2019s effort \u2018\u2018to coerce Ukraine into helping the president\u2019s re-election campaign\u201d and must be included in the Senate trial. Republicans control the Senate, with 53 members to Democrats\u2019 47 caucus members in the 100-seat chamber, and they are all but certain to acquit Trump. A two-thirds majority of present senators would be required to remove Trump.",

For example, three years ago we made a progressive change to increase the daylight provision and enrichment for all birds in our supply chain for all chicken served in our UK and Irish restaurants, providing pecking objects and perches to encourage the birds to express their natural behaviours. These steps meet higher welfare scheme requirements and are ahead of many of our competitors.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Pizza Hut said: \u201cWe take animal welfare extremely seriously and have stringent policies in place to ensure all our suppliers adhere to the highest standards.

Amid growing concerns about the intensive and large-scale production of meat \u2013 with some birds growing so fast that they routinely suffer from lameness and skin lesions \u2013 World Animal Protection (WAP) has ranked eight of the leading brands according to their commitment, ambition and transparency to improve chicken welfare globally. In the UK it has been calling on Nando\u2019s to urgently improve its chicken welfare policies, but the results of its analysis, published on Wednesday, reveal the chain has for the second consecutive year received a \u201cpoor\u201d rating. The most improved is KFC, which has leaped from \u201cpoor\u201d last year to \u201cmaking progress\u201d. In July it became the first UK fast food chain to sign up to the European Chicken Commitment \u2013 new welfare standards for farmed chickens that will improve the welfare of millions of birds in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. For its report the charity analysed the policies of leading chains with retail operations in the UK; Burger King, Domino\u2019s Pizza Group plc (covering Europe), KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Nando\u2019s, Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Subway. It also included Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc which operates in the US and Canada. Burger King, Pizza Hut and Domino\u2019s were all classed as having a \u201cvery poor\u201d approach to managing chicken welfare. Only three of the chains assessed were classed as \u201cgetting started\u201d or \u201cmaking progress\u201d on improving chicken welfare standards \u2013 KFC, Starbucks and Subway.

We will continue to speak up for chickens and consumers to put pressure on companies to make real change.\u201d In the UK sales of red meat have fallen in recent years, but chicken \u2013 seen as a \u201chealthy\u201d meat \u2013 has seen sales rise. Fast-food chains are also increasingly launching \u201cvegan-friendly\u201d, plant-based versions of traditional meat patties.

All UK and Ireland chicken suppliers and their producers must, as a minimum, comply with EU animal welfare legislation and globally we support the principles of the Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms, which is a framework to safeguard and continually improve animal welfare. A spokesperson for Burger King said: \u201cResponsible animal welfare is a top priority for Burger King UK and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that all animals reared for meat are well cared for and treated. We require our meat suppliers and their producers to support the principles of the globally recognised Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms.\u201d A spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cWe are deeply committed to the health and welfare of all animals in our supply chain and know that our customers expect us to uphold high standards. Together with our suppliers, we work hard to focus on continuous improvement and have led the industry with positive moves on chicken welfare. For example, three years ago we made a progressive change to increase the daylight provision and enrichment for all birds in our supply chain for all chicken served in our UK and Irish restaurants, providing pecking objects and perches to encourage the birds to express their natural behaviours. These steps meet higher welfare scheme requirements and are ahead of many of our competitors. A spokesperson for Pizza Hut said: \u201cWe take animal welfare extremely seriously and have stringent policies in place to ensure all our suppliers adhere to the highest standards. We are also taking steps to ensure we continue to progress in this area \u2013 we support the European Chicken Commitment and as such we will expect our suppliers to meet a series of set requirements for all of the chicken in our supply chain by 2026. In addition to this, all our eggs are now free range, which is something we worked to achieve a year ahead of our target.\u201d KFC said: \u201cWe know our customers care deeply about chicken welfare standards and our business depends on it. We were proud to be one of the first restaurant brands to sign up to the Better Chicken Commitment but we won\u2019t stop there. This is just the beginning and we hope others take confidence from our commitment and join the growing movement to create real change to improve the lives of chickens.\u201d Nando\u2019s said: \u201cWe take animal welfare very seriously, knowing it\u2019s as important to our customers as it is to us. We know that as a recognisable chicken restaurant group we have a responsibility to ensure that every aspect of how we source our chicken is done in the best possible way. We welcome initiatives like the Better Chicken Commitment and share the aspiration and recognition of the need to change, which we believe needs to be a combined effort across the industry. We look forward to keeping everyone updated on our plans as we move forward on this important issue.\u201d Domino\u2019s Inc and Starbucks have been approached for comment.",

We know the transition to a net zero economy is the growth story of the 21st century.\u201d Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cWe\u2019re breaking more records than Usain Bolt, but there are no gold medals for dangerous temperature rises, or the floods and fires that come with it. We cannot run away from the climate emergency.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The \u00a330m no-deal Brexit traffic management system operating on the main roads to Dover is being fully dismantled before the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 January. The steel barriers in place to allow for a contraflow system on the M20 to mitigate against lorry gridlock on the way to the port are being removed after 11 months. The operation to remove the barriers, close gaps in the central reservation system for emergency access, and repaint the roads will take two weeks of overnight work. The roads would be back to normal on 1 February, the day after Brexit, Highways England said. This is the third time the anti-congestion system, known as Operation Brock, has been deactivated but the first time all the barriers are to be removed. They were first put in place for the original Brexit day, 29 March last year. Operation Brock also included a 30mph speed limit for trucks. The contraflow part of the system and a 50mph speed limit for cars was deactivated in April following the first extension to article 50 but were put in place again on 25 October before another potential no-deal crash out on 31 October. Boris Johnson had declared he would rather die in a ditch than ask the EU for another extension. They were deactivated again on 29 October when the EU agreed to a further extension until 31 January, but the barriers remained in place to allow Operation Brock to be quickly reactivated if necessary. Following parliament\u2019s decision to approve the withdrawal agreement, Highways England decided it was safe to remove the barriers too. The barrier was in place on a 15-mile section of the M20 between Maidstone and Ashford since March 2019. About 1,500 metres of barrier have been removed every night since Monday. The operation will continue until 28 January when the last restrictions will be removed before the road is back to normal on 1 February.",

The Trump administration abandoned the nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to give it its official name, in 2018. It put in place biting sanctions against Iran. This unilateral move upended the multilateral bargain at the deal\u2019s core, under which Iran restricted its nuclear programme and allowed rigorous international monitoring of its facilities in return for economic normalisation. With the deal\u2019s remaining parties (France, Germany, the UK and the EU, along with Russia and China) failing to provide economic respite, Iran incrementally broke the deal\u2019s restrictions, arguing that fewer financial dividends merit lessened compliance, a logic dismissed by the Europeans. While Tehran has ostensibly ceased observing key nuclear limits, it has not yet followed through with steps that would set off alarm bells, such as ramping up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/iran-announces-injection-of-uranium-gas-into-1044-centrifuges\" title=\"\">uranium enrichment</a> to 20% or limiting the access of international inspectors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/boris-johnson-uk-us-trade-deal-under-threat-unless-iran-stance-changes-says-trump-ally\">UK-US trade deal under threat unless Iran stance changes, says Trump ally</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The dispute resolution mechanism was devised to tackle technical breaches of the deal, not a political crisis prompted by US abrogation of the agreement. It is hard to see how this process has a better chance of resolving the parties\u2019 mutual grievances than the political talks that preceded it. Resorting to the mechanism, which is an option the Europeans have been debating for months, is therefore a statement of concern over Iran\u2019s violations and also a gambit for bringing Iran back into full JCPOA compliance. The dispute resolution process could, in theory, ratchet up the urgency in talks with the Iranians, holding out the possibility of reinstating UN sanctions against Iran \u2013 which the JCPOA lifted \u2013 should the efforts come to naught.</p> \n<p>But if that is the plan, it also carries risks. For one thing, while the Europeans underscored in their announcement that they had \u201cworked tirelessly to support legitimate trade with Iran\u201d, that labour has not translated into practical dividends for Iran. Nearly a year after they instigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/01/six-more-countries-join-trump-busting-iran-barter-group\" title=\"\">Instex mechanism</a> that sidesteps US sanctions, which was designed to facilitate trade with Iran without exposure to US sanctions, the initial transactions are yet to be finalised. Seen from Tehran, Europe is still asking Iran to deliver fully on its JCPOA commitments while delivering little in return.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7b386431-1eae-45c0-8f9f-9391ffc8b2d2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gO2CEbmdMN0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Furthermore, the decision could tip the debate in Tehran away from what Europe is hoping for: internally, hardliners have argued at each stage of Iran\u2019s carefully staggered breaches for more provocative steps to jolt the deal\u2019s remaining signatories into taking meaningful steps towards upholding their end of the bargain. The Iranians have also indicated that the return of UN sanctions would lead them not just to abandon the JCPOA but to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT) \u2013 a step that would likely push Iran further into the diplomatic cold but also place an obstacle in front of future talks.</p> \n<p>Still, with the dispute resolution process now under way, Europe should work three tracks in parallel. With the Iranians, the Europeans should underscore a key point in their joint statement: that their resort to the mechanism is a means for intensified diplomacy. If Iran refrains from further breaches to the agreement, the process, which theoretically could lead to UN sanctions within 65 days, can be extended. Among themselves, France, Germany and the UK can step up efforts to put INSTEX into effect, and additional means of boosting trade with Iran, which probably requires a certain degree of American acquiescence and European willingness to stand up to U. pressure. </p> \n<p>While Washington will likely seize on the dispute resolution decision to pressure the Europeans into further isolating Tehran, the Europeans can instead make the point to the Americans that nearly two years of coercive policies have neither curbed Iran\u2019s regional influence nor yielded a \u201cbetter\u201d nuclear deal.</p> \n<p>In short, by triggering the resolution mechanism the E3 countries could be embarking on a path that accelerates the crisis they are seeking to prevent. At this point, their priority should be to extend the timeframe provided by the mechanism to seek to convince Iran to resume compliance with the JCPOA in exchange for meaningful economic reprieve. Ultimately, none of the JCPOA\u2019s signatories are fully satisfied with the existing agreement. But building on it, rather than watching it collapse, should be the way forward.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ali Vaez directs the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group</p>",

Resorting to the mechanism, which is an option the Europeans have been debating for months, is therefore a statement of concern over Iran\u2019s violations and also a gambit for bringing Iran back into full JCPOA compliance. The dispute resolution process could, in theory, ratchet up the urgency in talks with the Iranians, holding out the possibility of reinstating UN sanctions against Iran \u2013 which the JCPOA lifted \u2013 should the efforts come to naught. But if that is the plan, it also carries risks. For one thing, while the Europeans underscored in their announcement that they had \u201cworked tirelessly to support legitimate trade with Iran\u201d, that labour has not translated into practical dividends for Iran. Nearly a year after they instigated the Instex mechanism that sidesteps US sanctions, which was designed to facilitate trade with Iran without exposure to US sanctions, the initial transactions are yet to be finalised. Seen from Tehran, Europe is still asking Iran to deliver fully on its JCPOA commitments while delivering little in return. Furthermore, the decision could tip the debate in Tehran away from what Europe is hoping for: internally, hardliners have argued at each stage of Iran\u2019s carefully staggered breaches for more provocative steps to jolt the deal\u2019s remaining signatories into taking meaningful steps towards upholding their end of the bargain. The Iranians have also indicated that the return of UN sanctions would lead them not just to abandon the JCPOA but to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT) \u2013 a step that would likely push Iran further into the diplomatic cold but also place an obstacle in front of future talks. Still, with the dispute resolution process now under way, Europe should work three tracks in parallel. With the Iranians, the Europeans should underscore a key point in their joint statement: that their resort to the mechanism is a means for intensified diplomacy. If Iran refrains from further breaches to the agreement, the process, which theoretically could lead to UN sanctions within 65 days, can be extended. Among themselves, France, Germany and the UK can step up efforts to put INSTEX into effect, and additional means of boosting trade with Iran, which probably requires a certain degree of American acquiescence and European willingness to stand up to U. pressure. While Washington will likely seize on the dispute resolution decision to pressure the Europeans into further isolating Tehran, the Europeans can instead make the point to the Americans that nearly two years of coercive policies have neither curbed Iran\u2019s regional influence nor yielded a \u201cbetter\u201d nuclear deal. In short, by triggering the resolution mechanism the E3 countries could be embarking on a path that accelerates the crisis they are seeking to prevent. At this point, their priority should be to extend the timeframe provided by the mechanism to seek to convince Iran to resume compliance with the JCPOA in exchange for meaningful economic reprieve. Ultimately, none of the JCPOA\u2019s signatories are fully satisfied with the existing agreement. But building on it, rather than watching it collapse, should be the way forward. \u2022 Ali Vaez directs the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group",

Danko Carvajal-Donaire, 20, Claudio Donoso, 20, Nicolas Portilla Astorga, 27, and Jorge Rojas, 22, broke into the Michelin-starred restaurateur\u2019s \u00a35m home in Wimbledon last October. The men admitted conspiring together to trespass with intent to steal after they were caught days after the raid, on the way to another burglary. Rojas was wearing a pendant stolen from Wareing\u2019s home when they were stopped by police. A court official confirmed that the men were each sentenced to 40 months in jail when they appeared at Kingston crown court on Tuesday. \u201cEach of you came to this country with one purpose: crime,\u201d the judge told them as he sentenced them. \u201cNo other reason for your visit to the UK has been offered to me.\u201d Kingston crown court heard that the men had flown in from Chile days before the raid, the Evening Standard reported. They smashed their way through patio doors on the first-floor balcony at Wareing\u2019s home before ransacking the master bedroom. The burglars stole a number of watches, including a gold Rolex and another engraved with \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d, the court was told.

The arrests came after the Metropolitan police said they had dismantled a criminal gang that was recruiting Chileans to come to the UK to carry out high-value burglaries. Of Wareing\u2019s stolen items, only the pendant found on Rojas has been recovered. Wareing, who is a judge on the BBC cookery programme MasterChef: The Professionals, praised police. \u201cWe are pleased that the men have been caught and would like to thank the Wimbledon police for assisting us during this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made us feel safe and secure again in our home and were utterly brilliant.\u201d",

Enlivened by the work of his colleagues there, Baldessari began to experiment with new forms of art-making, including the Wrong series. These works were included in Baldessari\u2019s first one-man show, at the Molly Barnes gallery in LA in 1968.</p> <p>Buoyed by the change in direction, in 1970 Baldessari made a drastic act now etched in the annals of conceptual art: he burned all his paintings. With five friends, he shredded the unsold canvases and took the remains to a local crematorium.</p> <p>In the space of four hours, his entire output from 1953 to 1966 went up in smoke. \u201cThere was a lot of doubt and anxiety,\u201d Baldessari recalled. \u201cBut I breathed a sigh of relief when the crematory door slammed shut.\u201d</p> <p>The resultant ashes were baked into biscuits, some of which were shown in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s groundbreaking survey of conceptual art, Information, that same year. Others were placed in an urn, a plaque recording the artist\u2019s name, the birth and death dates of the destroyed work, and a recipe for the ash biscuits. Cremation Project, Corpus Wafers (With Text, Recipe and Documentation) is now in the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC. </p> <p>A few weeks after the cremation, Baldessari took a job at the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles. Then the city\u2019s hottest school, CalArts with its handsome funding allowed the 39-year-old artist to experiment with new media such as video and film. Among his CalArts works was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udljwzJcTiU\" title=\"\">Baldessari Sings LeWitt (1972)</a>, a madcap video in which the artist intones, a cappella, Sol LeWitt\u2019s 35 Sentences on Conceptual Art to camera.</p> <p>It was in Europe, however, that Baldessari\u2019s career was to really take off. In 1971 he had his first European show, in Amsterdam \u2013 a series of black-and-white photographs in an open ring-binder, adorned with a scrap of newspaper bearing the headline Art Disaster. The following year came nine more European exhibitions, among them ones in London, Bonn and Paris.</p> <p>In Cologne, in 1972, he met the king-making New York gallerist <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ileana-sonnabend-395408.html\" title=\"\">Ileana Sonnabend</a>, who offered to represent him. He would stay with Sonnabend for 26 years, before switching to the Marian Goodman gallery.</p> <p>In 1985, Baldessari began to efface the images of public figures he disliked with stick-on dots. These soon evolved into the painted dots which, as collages, paintings or prints, would occupy him for much of the rest of his life. \u201cA hundred years from now,\u201d Baldessari ruefully noted, \u201cI will probably be remembered as the guy who put dots on faces.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, he began the print series Noses &amp; Ears, Etc. that drew the critical wrath of Marge Simpson. Another print series, Double Bill, saw Baldessari appropriating and pairing the work of fellow artists \u2013 David Hockney and Giovanni di Paolo, for example \u2013 only one of which (Hockney) was acknowledged in the title on the print\u2019s lower edge. Endlessly inventive, in 2007, the 76-year-old artist made his first sculpture, <a href=\"https://www.beyerprojects.com/john-baldessari-sculpture-ear-trumpet\" title=\"\">Beethoven\u2019s Trumpet (with Ear) Opus # 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135</a>, in which the whispers of visitors activated snatches of Beethoven quartets.</p> <p>Like many people of unusual height \u2013 he was 6ft 7in tall \u2013 Baldessari was unexpectedly diffident. This may have contributed to the lateness of his success. He was nearly 60 before the Museum of Contemporary Art in LA gave him a retrospective, although the 30 years that followed saw Baldessari enter the pantheon of greats. A travelling retrospective, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/john-baldessari-pure-beauty\" title=\"\">Pure Beauty, began at Tate Modern in 2009</a> and ended at the Metropolitan Museum in New York two years later. He was awarded a Golden Lion in Venice the same year; President Barack Obama presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 2014.</p> <p>He was equally revered as a teacher, his former students including the artists <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/david-salle-1892\" title=\"\">David Salle</a>, <a href=\"https://tonyoursler.com/\" title=\"\">Tony Oursler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/02/mike-kelley\" title=\"\">Mike Kelley</a>. \u201cStudents are the first to tell you you\u2019re full of shit,\u201d a beaming Baldessari once said. \u201cI like that kind of feedback.\u201d</p> <p>In 1960, he married Carol Ann Wixom, a Montessori teacher; they divorced in 1986. Their children, Annamarie and Tony, survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 John Anthony Baldessari, artist, born 17 June 1931; died 2 January 2020</p>",

These soon evolved into the painted dots which, as collages, paintings or prints, would occupy him for much of the rest of his life. \u201cA hundred years from now,\u201d Baldessari ruefully noted, \u201cI will probably be remembered as the guy who put dots on faces.\u201d In 2006, he began the print series Noses &amp; Ears, Etc. that drew the critical wrath of Marge Simpson. Another print series, Double Bill, saw Baldessari appropriating and pairing the work of fellow artists \u2013 David Hockney and Giovanni di Paolo, for example \u2013 only one of which (Hockney) was acknowledged in the title on the print\u2019s lower edge. Endlessly inventive, in 2007, the 76-year-old artist made his first sculpture, Beethoven\u2019s Trumpet (with Ear) Opus # 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135, in which the whispers of visitors activated snatches of Beethoven quartets. Like many people of unusual height \u2013 he was 6ft 7in tall \u2013 Baldessari was unexpectedly diffident. This may have contributed to the lateness of his success. He was nearly 60 before the Museum of Contemporary Art in LA gave him a retrospective, although the 30 years that followed saw Baldessari enter the pantheon of greats. A travelling retrospective, Pure Beauty, began at Tate Modern in 2009 and ended at the Metropolitan Museum in New York two years later. He was awarded a Golden Lion in Venice the same year; President Barack Obama presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 2014. He was equally revered as a teacher, his former students including the artists David Salle, Tony Oursler and Mike Kelley. \u201cStudents are the first to tell you you\u2019re full of shit,\u201d a beaming Baldessari once said. \u201cI like that kind of feedback.\u201d In 1960, he married Carol Ann Wixom, a Montessori teacher; they divorced in 1986. Their children, Annamarie and Tony, survive him. \u2022 John Anthony Baldessari, artist, born 17 June 1931; died 2 January 2020",

It\u2019s easy to forget the lack of black British writers at the time I was starting out who had the same experience of England as I did. There were only a few allowed to get through.\u201d The success of all his firsts has been hard earned, he adds. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of them but none of it has come easily and sometimes the shine is taken off because it\u2019s been a hard slog.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black mental health has been urgent for 30 years. It has just taken a long time for society to acknowledge this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Theatre seems to be taking inclusivity more seriously, I suggest, with growing visibility of black actors and playwrights on mainstream stages. Does he think it is a watershed moment? \u201cIt might be, he says, \u201cbut what we have got to be wary of is that we don\u2019t just support those whose names are bigger than their colour. We have to keep the door open for more to come through but also not pat ourselves on the back. As soon as we do that, it\u2019s back to what happened in the 1990s. Everyone thought it was solved. Suddenly the teaching stopped.\u201d</p> <p>These days, Dyer is writing at a dizzying rate across films, TV and stage. He is co-directing a play called The Happy Tragedy of Being Woke with Simon McBurney. It is a reworking of a play about cross-cultural adoption. Dyer has two mixed-heritage teenagers with his wife, also an actor, but the idea did not come from personal experience. In the first incarnation of the script, the family was white. In this version, the adopting father is black and has mental health issues. \u201cBlack mental health has been urgent for the last 30 years,\u201d Dyer says. \u201cIt\u2019s just taken a long time for society to acknowledge this.\u201d</p> <p>He is directing a film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/rache-de-lahay-interview-my-white-best-friend-being-a-brown-woman-is-political\">Rachel De-lahay</a>, and co-writing a series about the life of the singer Goldie. Dyer has also made a short film, Dim Sum<em>, </em>as part of the Guardian\u2019s new series of short dramas about Europe: a monologue delivered by a black British bailiff hollowing out the houses of those in debt and reflecting on what modern Britain has become.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a10bed7c8a5f8cc5d9afe0cd8e288cb96e05a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a10bed7c8a5f8cc5d9afe0cd8e288cb96e05a5b/1497_0_2933_3667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Troubled childhood \u2026 Dyer says he grew up \u2018dyslexic and insecure\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Troubled childhood \u2026 Dyer says he grew up \u2018dyslexic and insecure\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dyer grew up in a staunchly working-class household. His father was a foundry worker at Ford\u2019s \u201csweating his heart out every day\u201d and his mother was a nurse. They were as supportive of the acting as they had been of the football. Dyer carved out a career path while he was still at school: he worked a Saturday job to pay for professional actor\u2019s pictures, found an agency to represent him and started doing part-time workshops at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre-royal-stratford-east\">Theatre Royal Stratford East</a>, a bus ride from his home.</p> <p>His pathway into the overwhelmingly white, middle-class world of theatre was made easier by Philip Hedley, the former artistic director of the theatre, who Dyer cites as a seminal force in his career. \u201cHe was a white man who was completely engaging with the whole community no matter who they were. I\u2019ve been involved in theatre since I was 16 and a lot of the stuff I\u2019ve learned is through him. He wrote to my drama school to tell them to take me on, he trained me on his director\u2019s course, he gave me my first gig as a director.\u201d</p> <p>For years while Dyer was an actor, he yearned to be a writer. He grew up \u201cdyslexic and insecure\u201d and thought it simply wasn\u2019t on the cards. Then he was directed by Mike Leigh on stage and that changed everything. \u201cThe play was It\u2019s a Great Big Shame. It was improvised and became one of the great experiences for me in terms of how to create dialogue, scenes, stories.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could feel tensions, concerns and issues \u2013 but they weren't being played out in arenas by the people with voices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Class is still central to his identity. In fact, he says, Death of England is as much about class as it is about race. \u201cMy kinship with Roy is based on our understanding of being working class and British. It\u2019s the most important conversation in Death of England. We\u2019re trying to highlight that what some people consider as the \u2018changes\u2019 taking place now were always there.

There is Kwame Kwei-Armah and there would also have been Madani Younis if he were not leaving for New York. \u201cYes, there\u2019s Kwame, but he had to go to America. Even though he had shows on here, he wasn\u2019t in a position to guarantee himself a living so he had to go to a country that could.\u201d Dyer has known Williams for decades. \u201cHe\u2019s an inspiration for me. It\u2019s easy to forget the lack of black British writers at the time I was starting out who had the same experience of England as I did. There were only a few allowed to get through.\u201d The success of all his firsts has been hard earned, he adds. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of them but none of it has come easily and sometimes the shine is taken off because it\u2019s been a hard slog.\u201d Theatre seems to be taking inclusivity more seriously, I suggest, with growing visibility of black actors and playwrights on mainstream stages. Does he think it is a watershed moment? \u201cIt might be, he says, \u201cbut what we have got to be wary of is that we don\u2019t just support those whose names are bigger than their colour. We have to keep the door open for more to come through but also not pat ourselves on the back. As soon as we do that, it\u2019s back to what happened in the 1990s. Everyone thought it was solved. Suddenly the teaching stopped.\u201d These days, Dyer is writing at a dizzying rate across films, TV and stage. He is co-directing a play called The Happy Tragedy of Being Woke with Simon McBurney. It is a reworking of a play about cross-cultural adoption. Dyer has two mixed-heritage teenagers with his wife, also an actor, but the idea did not come from personal experience. In the first incarnation of the script, the family was white. In this version, the adopting father is black and has mental health issues. \u201cBlack mental health has been urgent for the last 30 years,\u201d Dyer says. \u201cIt\u2019s just taken a long time for society to acknowledge this.\u201d He is directing a film by Rachel De-lahay, and co-writing a series about the life of the singer Goldie. Dyer has also made a short film, Dim Sum, as part of the Guardian\u2019s new series of short dramas about Europe: a monologue delivered by a black British bailiff hollowing out the houses of those in debt and reflecting on what modern Britain has become. Dyer grew up in a staunchly working-class household. His father was a foundry worker at Ford\u2019s \u201csweating his heart out every day\u201d and his mother was a nurse. They were as supportive of the acting as they had been of the football. Dyer carved out a career path while he was still at school: he worked a Saturday job to pay for professional actor\u2019s pictures, found an agency to represent him and started doing part-time workshops at Theatre Royal Stratford East, a bus ride from his home. His pathway into the overwhelmingly white, middle-class world of theatre was made easier by Philip Hedley, the former artistic director of the theatre, who Dyer cites as a seminal force in his career. \u201cHe was a white man who was completely engaging with the whole community no matter who they were. I\u2019ve been involved in theatre since I was 16 and a lot of the stuff I\u2019ve learned is through him. He wrote to my drama school to tell them to take me on, he trained me on his director\u2019s course, he gave me my first gig as a director.\u201d For years while Dyer was an actor, he yearned to be a writer. He grew up \u201cdyslexic and insecure\u201d and thought it simply wasn\u2019t on the cards. Then he was directed by Mike Leigh on stage and that changed everything. \u201cThe play was It\u2019s a Great Big Shame. It was improvised and became one of the great experiences for me in terms of how to create dialogue, scenes, stories.\u201d Class is still central to his identity. In fact, he says, Death of England is as much about class as it is about race. \u201cMy kinship with Roy is based on our understanding of being working class and British. It\u2019s the most important conversation in Death of England. We\u2019re trying to highlight that what some people consider as the \u2018changes\u2019 taking place now were always there. As a working-class man hanging around in working-class areas, I could feel the tensions, concerns, issues, but they weren\u2019t being played out in the arenas in which the people that have the voice were existing.\u201d So did he see it all coming \u2013 the demonising of immigrants, the pulling up of the drawbridge and the landslide? \u201cYou can see that from the pieces I\u2019ve written. The thing that the guy in Dim Sum finds so shocking is that people are surprised by any of it. Of course this is what was going to happen. We stopped listening to the working classes. This is why we are where we are now.\u201d \u2022 Death of England runs at the National Theatre, London, from 31 January. Dim Sum, from the Guardian and Headlong series Europeans: Dramas from a divided union, premieres on 16 January at the Curzon Soho as part of the London short film festival.",

What\u2019s more, it is the persistent individualism of this free-market culture that goads us into believing that the only route to happiness is through self-improvement by changing our consumption habits or improving our bodies. If we suppose that the army\u2019s one valid claim on confidence is that it provides stable and fulfilling work, then even this doesn\u2019t withstand much scrutiny. Just under 15,000 people left the army in the 12 months prior to August 2019, almost 10% more than the number of people it was able to recruit in the same period. Speaking to the BBC recently, a representative of the organisation Forgotten Veterans said the shortfall was being created by parents advising their children away from the military because of reports of veterans suffering from extreme mental distress and homelessness. In early 2019, Theresa May even commissioned an investigation into the exodus. According to a recent BBC report, young people who enter the army are finding themselves with little to do and insufficient pay. Hardly a recipe for a fulfilling and stable life. What does it say about our society that the army \u2013 an arm of the state \u2013 is exploiting a generation\u2019s insecurity for its own recruitment purposes? We face a mental health crisis exacerbated by the material realities of poverty, homelessness and precarious work. We must not send young people into a life of military service, which, at worst, can lead to death, trauma and the perpetration of violence against others, in the name of a dubious and cynical appeal to self-confidence. \u2022 Nathalie Olah is the author of Steal As Much As You Can",

      "bodyText": "The disgraced former MP Keith Vaz has made a surprise bid to re-enter Labour politics after being declared as the chair of the constituency party that he represented for 32 years, the Guardian can disclose. The former minister, who did not stand for parliament at the last election after receiving a six-month Commons ban over drug allegations involving sex workers, was voted in as chair of Leicester East Labour party on Tuesday night. Amid angry scenes, police attended the meeting in Belgrave Neighbourhood Centre. They have since confirmed that they have been asked to investigate an allegation of assault. Inside the meeting, Vaz was voted in as the new chair on a show of hands. While his supporters said he had re-entered politics because the local party was in chaos, other local party members said the meeting involving more than 100 people should not have taken place and that his election should be declared void. There is no implication that Vaz has personally broken any party rules. John Thomas, the former chair of Leicester East Labour party and an ally of Vaz, said Vaz had stood because the local party was failing to function. \u201cThe local party is in absolute chaos. Some people have demanded that Keith get involved,\u201d he said. There was disquiet among some members because the constituency\u2019s new MP, Claudia Webbe, was leftwing, he said. \u201cThe new MP is a Corbyn supporter but the party in Leicester is much more to the right. Keith knows the people here.\u201d One Vaz opponent said it was widely rumoured that the former MP would like to stand again at the next election, and his position as chair would give him a platform for this. \u201cHe wants to get back to Westminster. That is the rumour and now he is perfectly positioned,\u201d the source said. Webbe was voted in with a much-reduced majority in December. Vaz pointedly did not campaign with her during the election. Vaz, once the UK\u2019s longest-sitting MP of Asian origin, was given the longest ban ever received by an MP for offering to buy cocaine for sex workers and obstructing inquiries by the standards commissioner. A parliamentary inquiry examined claims published in the Sunday Mirror in 2016 that he offered to buy cocaine for male sex workers while posing as an industrial washing machine salesman called Jim. At the time, Vaz was chair of the home affairs select committee, which was examining the issues of drug use and prostitution. Vaz\u2019s explanation, which included that he had amnesia and could not recall key events, was \u201cnot believable and, indeed, ludicrous\u201d, the inquiry found. Despite facing the longest ban ever imposed by parliament last year, Vaz is also a member of Labour\u2019s ruling body, the national executive committee. A female party member, who asked not to be named, said she was assaulted as she tried to enter the meeting. Leicestershire police confirmed that the force had received an allegation of assault from Tuesday night\u2019s event. \u201cFurther inquiries are being carried out into the allegation to establish whether any criminal offences have occurred,\u201d a spokesperson said. Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: \u201cVaz has been a malign influence upon UK politics for too long and it\u2019s deeply disappointing that he is still seen as a credible representative of the party in Leicester.\u201d Vaz and Labour have been approached for comment.",

And when the then secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, warned the president that shutting down the border would be illegal, the then attorney general, Jeff Sessions, approved the radical measure \u2013 despite it being against the law. Trump\u2019s obsession with curbing border crossings and building a wall is laid bare in A Very Stable Genius, written by the Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, which is being published by Penguin and a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian. Nielsen was sworn in as the sixth homeland security secretary in December 2017, succeeding John Kelly, who became White House chief of staff. It was a thankless task under a president with obsessive tunnel vision on illegal immigration. Trump habitually complained to aides that Nielsen was not doing enough to tackle the problem, the book recounts. \u201cIn some instances, the volatile president was verbally and emotionally abusive toward Nielsen,\u201d the authors write. \u201c\u2018Kirstjen, you\u2019re just not tough enough,\u2019 Trump would tell her. Trump complained Nielsen did not \u201clook the part\u201d of homeland security secretary. \u201cHe made fun of her and believed that at about five feet four inches she was not physically intimidating. \u2018She\u2019s so short,\u2019 Trump would tell others about Nielsen.

      "body": "<p>When Thant Myint-U was eight he travelled from the US to Burma with his parents to bury his grandfather U Thant, the first non-European secretary general of the United Nations. But the funeral was not a family affair. A group of students and Buddhist monks seized Thant\u2019s coffin and demanded a state ceremony from the country\u2019s military overlords: the corpse became a rallying point for protests. Burmese troops overran the Rangoon University campus where Thant\u2019s body had been held and killed many protesting students. Riots broke out against the army regime and hundreds were killed or imprisoned in the retaliatory crackdown. Myint-U\u2019s parents were told to leave the country quickly. \u201cI missed my fourth-grade classes,\u201d Myint-U writes in <em>The Hidden History </em><em>of Burma</em>, and instead \u201cexperienced firsthand a dictatorship in action\u201d.</p> <p>Starker encounters followed over the years. After graduating from Harvard in 1988, Myint-U helped a group of Burmese dissidents who were planning a revolution from across the Thai border. As a historian, human rights campaigner and UN policy planner, he advocated for the brutally suppressed Burmese democracy movement through the 1990s and 2000s, while remaining undecided on the usefulness of economic sanctions. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cyclonenargis\" title=\"\">Cyclone Nargis</a>, he worked to convince the country\u2019s generals to accept international aid and address the country\u2019s abysmal poverty rates. After the dissolution of the junta in 2011, Myint-U was made an adviser in the Burmese president\u2019s office.</p> <p>This book promises an insider\u2019s view of the country\u2019s political transition, but in many ways the events described bear out the perils of western thinking on Burma, which Myint-U mordantly summarised in <em>The River of Lost Footsteps</em> (2008): \u201cThe military government is bad, Aung San Suu Kyi good, and the international community needs to apply pressure on Rangoon and pressure means no aid, trade sanctions and more isolation.\u201d It was an approach that ignored the country\u2019s beginnings under the British empire and its growth as \u201ca racial hierarchy\u201d. Questions of economic and institutional reform were conveniently sidestepped, along with the region\u2019s long history of ethnic armed conflicts. Diplomats and thinktanks didn\u2019t want to interfere. \u201cShowing solidarity with the democracy movement,\u201d according to Myint-U, \u201cwas politically expedient. Results didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>In 2020, the picture looks bleak. Just last month Aung San Suu Kyi was at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/14/myanmar-genocide-hearings-victims-fury\" title=\"\">international court of justice</a> in The Hague, defending the military, her long-time oppressors, against charges of genocide. At least 800,000 Rohingya Muslims have been pushed out to refugee camps in Bangladesh.

When I went to see his dopey 2001 comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/aug/23/culture.reviews\">Black Knight</a>, it was the first time I truly laughed with abandon post-9/11. With absolute seriousness, I will be forever grateful. So, while Bad Boys for Life has a completely asinine story, generic action, predictable plot beats, moronic dialogue and truly reprehensible politics, I still had a good time.</p> <p>Lawrence, who can tell an entire story on his face in one reaction shot, must shout \u201cOh shit!\u201d a hundred times in Bad Boys for Life.

When I went to see his dopey 2001 comedy Black Knight, it was the first time I truly laughed with abandon post-9/11. With absolute seriousness, I will be forever grateful. So, while Bad Boys for Life has a completely asinine story, generic action, predictable plot beats, moronic dialogue and truly reprehensible politics, I still had a good time.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani has warned that European soldiers in the Middle East could be in danger after the UK, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear agreement that could lead to the reimposition of international sanctions on the country. Rouhani\u2019s remarks on Wednesday were the first direct threat he has made against European powers as tensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned the nuclear deal more than 18 months ago. \u201cToday, the American soldier is in danger, tomorrow the European soldier could be in danger,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised address to his cabinet. He did not elaborate, though European soldiers are deployed alongside US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. France maintains a naval base in Abu Dhabi and Britain has a base in Bahrain. Europe has scrambled to find ways to rescue the 2015 agreement, which traded sanctions relief for curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Since US sanctions were reimposed, Tehran has gradually been increasing its nuclear activities in steps that it says are reversible. On Tuesday, the three European parties to the deal triggered a formal dispute-resolution mechanism citing Iran\u2019s non-compliance with the deal. The process could lead to sanctions being reimposed and the deal to be formally scrapped. Speaking in Delhi on Wednesday, the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, struck a more upbeat note, arguing that the dispute-resolution mechanisms in the deal were intended to resolve issues such as these and that the agreement was \u201cnot dead\u201d. He heralded the agreement as \u201cone of the best deals that has been made in the recent past, one of the few major achievements of multilateral diplomacy\u201d. The Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal in May 2018, arguing it did not comprehensively curb Iran\u2019s misbehaviour including sponsorship of overseas proxies and its missile development. Tehran had been repeatedly certified to be in compliance with the agreement. Zarif rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion on Tuesday that the US president could negotiate a new agreement and brand it a \u201cTrump deal\u201d, arguing it would be difficult to trust the US to stand by the agreement. \u201cIf I have a Trump deal, how long will it last?\u201d he said. Rouhani said the prime minister\u2019s suggestion was \u201cstrange\u201d. \u201cThis Mr Prime Minister in London, I don\u2019t know how he thinks. He says let\u2019s put aside the nuclear deal and put the Trump plan in action,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take the wrong step, it will be to your detriment. Pick the right path. The right path is to return to the nuclear deal.\u201d Separately, the British ambassador to Tehran announced he was returning to London for talks, a day after effigies of him were burned in the streets and judicial officials called for his expulsion for allegedly inciting and organising protests. The Foreign Office said Rob Macaire\u2019s visit to the UK \u201chas been planned for quite a while\u201d and he intended to return to Tehran. The envoy was arrested briefly near the site of a protest on Saturday against the downing of a passenger jet by the Iranian military. He was released but has been targeted by Iranian media outlets and officials. \u201cUnder international law, such a person is a \u2018persona non grata\u2019. The people expect the person to be expelled and that is also what international law calls for,\u201d an Iranian judiciary spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said on Tuesday, according to state media. A Foreign Office spokesman played down Macaire\u2019s recall, saying: \u201cIt is quite normal for our ambassadors to come back to London to have meetings here.\u201d Zarif told a security conference on Wednesday that his country \u201cwas lied to for a couple of days\u201d about the cause of a last week\u2019s plane crash, the first acknowledgment by an Iranian official that the public was knowingly deceived about the fact that the airliner carrying 176 passengers and crew was shot down. His comments point to possible rifts within Iran\u2019s ruling establishment over the accidental shooting down of the jet and the subsequent claims that a technical malfunction was to blame for the crash. The mistaken downing, as well as the government\u2019s belated admission of guilt, has sparked resignations from state media outlets, rare public criticism of Iranian leaders, and protests in Tehran and other cities. Leaders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite, ideologically hardline branch of the military, have taken responsibility for the disaster, but characterised the delay as a procedural matter. After learning of the incident on Wednesday, commanders set up an investigation team that interviewed everyone involved, a process that took about 38 hours, the deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, Brig Gen Ali Abdollahi, said on Tuesday evening. \u201cNaturally, the initial examination takes time,\u201d he said. The Revolutionary Guards have jostled for power and influence with Rouhani\u2019s elected government, which is an uneasy alliance of conservatives and reformists who have sought to open Iran to the outside world \u2013 a policy opposed by many hardliners. A spokesman for Rouhani earlier this week said he was informed of the truth only on Friday afternoon. He announced the following morning that the plane had been shot down in an \u201cunforgivable error\u201d. State media announced on Tuesday that Iran\u2019s supreme leader was due to deliver the sermon at this Friday\u2019s prayers. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not spoken at the prayers for eight years and is thought to only do so during critical periods. The last time he did so was in 2012 when he discussed the Arab spring.",

A KPMG report for the British Hospitality Association concluded that, \u201cin a scenario of free movement ending and no new immigration into the sector being allowed, the industry would need to recruit an additional 62,000 UK workers each year\u201d \u2013 a goal it deems \u201cdeeply implausible\u201d. \u201cYou can sit around and moan, or you can be proactive,\u201d says Zuleika Fennell, the managing director of Corbin &amp; King, a restaurant group that, like Handling\u2019s, is pioneering change in the sector. \u201cWe have to capture kids\u2019 imaginations and retain staff.\u201d With school programmes, a \u00a330,000 starting salary for senior waiters and regular \u201crewards for excellence\u201d for employees on both sides of the pass, Corbin &amp; King puts its money where its mouth is. Handling, too, is optimistic \u2013 but believes we need to let go of our veneration of French service and celebrate a British style of hospitality. We\u2019re a \u201cyoung cuisine\u201d and \u201can arrogant people, who see serving as a poor person\u2019s job,\u201d he says, but at its best \u201cBritish food is about personality, rather than discipline. It\u2019s exciting, it can be spectacular, but it\u2019s relaxed: there\u2019s no looking down on people.\u201d As Hillary Reinsberg, the editor-in-chief of the New York-based restaurant guide The Infatuation puts it: \u201cService these days isn\u2019t about the provenance of your silverware or the formality of a meal \u2013 it\u2019s about paying attention to what diners actually want and making them feel welcome.\u201d Such intangible skills are hard to articulate, says Slegg, \u201cbut when you get it right, it\u2019s like hosting a dinner party every night, without cooking\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Black and minority ethnic offenders are far more likely to be sent to prison for drug offences than other defendants, according to groundbreaking research commissioned by the Sentencing Council. The stark disparity in courtroom outcomes is exposed by the official body that advises judges as it prepares to update guidelines for dealing with drug offenders in England and Wales. The investigation reinforces concerns raised by the review conducted by the Labour MP David Lammy on behalf of the Ministry of Justice in 2017 that found that BAME individuals face bias in court. The Sentencing Council\u2019s research concentrated on associations between an offender\u2019s sex and ethnicity, and the type and length of sentence they received in three supply-related drug crimes. It drew on statistics from crown court records between 2012 and 2015.

The analysis did not identify reasons for the disparities in sentencing outcomes. The council is proposing to update five drug offences guidelines that came into force in 2012 and cover offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) 1971. Its aim is to \u201cbring them up to date with modern drug offending\u201d and to introduce four guidelines for new offences created by the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) 2016. The consultation, which is open to the public as well as lawyers, judges and magistrates, is open until 7 April. The Sentencing Council chair, Lord Justice Holroyde, said: \u201cDrug offending affects a large cross-section of society; from people voluntarily involved in the trade including dealers and users, to families and the community who often have to deal with the aftermath, and it has to be taken seriously. \u201cThe nature of offending is also changing and we are seeing more vulnerable people including children being exploited either through grooming or coercion.

If the courtroom example involved a class A drug, such as heroin, then in the same circumstances the outcome would be for for 93 white offenders, 95 Asian offenders and 95 black offenders to be given immediate custodial sentences. The \u201cother\u201d ethnicity group includes Chinese, Japanese, or south-east Asian offenders, Middle Eastern offenders and those not deemed to be white, black or Asian. In terms of sex differences for offenders, the Sentencing Council explained, if 100 male and female offenders were sentenced for possession with intent to supply a class B drug in otherwise comparable circumstances, then 37 male offenders and 20 female offenders would be expected to be sent to prison immediately. In the same example but with a class A drug, 93 male offenders and 85 female offenders would be expected to be sentenced to immediate custody.

This was a defining moment in LA history, one that revealed the entrenched divides in our society by filling them with gas and setting them on fire. One of these divides was between the black and Korean communities.

In a series of seminal critical essays, Davis lays bare the workings of money and power in Los Angeles \u2013 seen in the hostility of the built environment, development and urban decay.

      "bodyText": "Hugh Grant has defended Prince Harry\u2019s decision to \u201cstep back\u201d from formal royal duties and seek a self-financed life based partly in Canada. Speaking on Andy Cohen\u2019s Radio Andy show on Sirius XM, Grant said: \u201cI\u2019m rather on Harry\u2019s side. The tabloid press effectively murdered his mother, now they\u2019re tearing his wife to pieces.\u201d Grant was reminding listeners of the circumstances surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, who was in a vehicle being pursued by paparazzi, which then crashed, killing three of the four passengers, in Paris in August 1997. Grant added: \u201cI think as a man, it\u2019s his job to protect his family, so I\u2019m with him.\u201d Grant was promoting his new film, The Gentlemen, alongside co-stars Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey. In the film, Grant plays a seedy and unscrupulous tabloid reporter. Grant has been a vociferous campaigner against press intrusion for nearly 10 years. His activism stepped up after the revelation that the voicemail of murdered teenager Milly Dowler had been hacked by the News of the World. In 2018, Grant donated a payout from Mirror Group Newspapers to the Hacked Off anti-hacking campaign. MGN apologised to Grant and others for its \u201cmorally wrong\u201d actions in hacking their phones. Speaking to Cohen, Grant described his relationship with the tabloids as \u201cvery poor\u201d. Grant\u2019s defence of Harry again pits him against longtime antagonist Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror with whom Grant frequently clashes on Twitter. Morgan has called the Duke and Duchess of Sussex \u201cthe two most spoiled brats in history\u201d. Grant won considerable acclaim for his portrayal of the disgraced Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe in the Stephen Frears miniseries A Very English Scandal, which was broadcast in 2018. The Gentlemen has earned more mixed reviews so far. Speaking on Tuesday, the musician Stormzy also came to the couple\u2019s defence, saying there was no \u201ccredible\u201d reason for people not to like Meghan. In an interview with New York radio station Hot 97, he said: \u201cMeghan is a sweet woman, she does her thing \u2026 and they just hate her.\u201d The rapper referred to a clip of Eamonn Holmes on TalkSport, where the presenter says: \u201cI look at her and I think: \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like you.\u2019\u201d Stormzy said that if those expressing such sentiments were made to write down the reasons for their negativity, they would find there was \u201cnothing credible to it\u201d. He also discussed the backlash to an interview he recently gave in which he was asked whether he believed Britain was racist, to which he replied \u201cYes, 100%.\u201d The quote was taken out of context by numerous outlets to imply he believed the UK was entirely racist. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic media spin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing.

      "bodyText": "It has the air of a dish that\u2019s been warming up Alpine winters for centuries, but this take on the potato gratin was, in fact, created by the reblochon marketing team in the 1980s as a way to sell more of their delicious cheese. I hope they got a pay rise, because this is the most comforting carb-fest imaginable: don\u2019t even think of making it unless there\u2019s a nip in the air. Prep 40 min Cook 15 min Serves 6 1.3kg waxy potatoes 2 tbsp butter 1 onion 200g smoked bacon, preferably lardons (optional) 150ml dry white wine 200ml whipping cream 1 garlic clove 1 reblochon cheese (see step 7) 1 Pick and prep the potatoes Start by bringing a large pan of generously salted water to a boil. Wash the potatoes, but don\u2019t bother to peel them \u2013 leave them whole if they\u2019re roughly the same size; if not, cut any large ones to about the same dimensions as the smallest. (Note: you can use an all-round variety such as maris piper instead of a waxy one, but they\u2019ll break up more during cooking.) 2 Cook and cool the potatoes Cook the potatoes in the boiling water until they\u2019re just tender to the point of a knife, but not cooked right the way through (ie, treat them as if you were parboiling them for roast potatoes). Drain well, leave them to steam dry in the hot pan for a couple of minutes, then set aside until cool enough to handle. 3 Fry the onion and bacon Meanwhile, peel and thinly slice the onion and, if using rashers rather than lardons, cut the bacon into short strips. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add the onion and bacon, and fry until the onions are soft and both are just starting to brown. 4 Add the wine and cream Pour the wine into the pan, turn up the heat so it comes up to a simmer, then leave to bubble away until the liquid has reduced to almost nothing. Take the pan off the heat, add the cream and stir it in so it isn\u2019t tempted to split in the hot pan. 5 Rub the pot with garlic and chop the spuds Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Peel the garlic, then cut it in half and rub it cut side down all around the inside of a wide, ovenproof dish or casserole. Once the potatoes are cool enough to interact with without sacrificing your fingertips, cut them into cubes of about 1cm in size; don\u2019t worry if some of the skins fall off while you\u2019re doing this. 6 Fry the potatoes Heat the second tablespoon of butter in a clean frying pan (or decant the sauce and wipe down the first one) over a medium-high heat, then fry the potatoes, tossing or stirring them regularly, until the cubes are golden brown all over. Take care not to break them up too much, though. 7 Prepare the cheese Cut the cheese in half horizontally. Reblochon is a mild, washed-rind cow\u2019s milk cheese, and is quite widely available in supermarkets, as well as cheesemongers, but if you can\u2019t lay your hands on any, a small round of creamy camembert or a slab of brie (about 250g) is probably the best, most widely available alternative. 8 Layer up the casserole Cover the base of the casserole with half the cubed potatoes, spoon over half the onion and bacon mixture, and season very well. Top with one half of the cheese, placing the disc in the centre of the dish. Repeat the layers, finishing with the second reblochon half, rind uppermost and again positioning it in the centre. 9 Bake and serve Bake for 15 minutes, or until browned and bubbling \u2013 if you feel the cheese could do with a bit more help, or if you prefer your potatoes really crisp, stick it under a hot grill for five minutes to finish. Serve hot, preferably with a plain green salad and some well-chilled white wine from the Savoie.",

The bakery firm said it would begin making deliveries in Bristol and Birmingham this week and continue its expansion in London, Newcastle and Glasgow, where there were trials with a variety of delivery firms, including Deliveroo and Uber Eats as well as Just Eat. Deliveries are expected to kick off in Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham in the spring, with a plan to achieve national coverage by the end of the year. Greggs and Just Eat will choose future destinations for expansion depending on customer demand.

However, deliveries are unlikely to be available in Saltash, Cornwall, in the near future after Greggs announced it was closing its only site in the county after a customers shunned its pasties for more local options. Greggs has confirmed the site at Saltash service station will close after a \u201cthorough review\u201d but said it will continue to look for sites in the south-west of England. The company plans to open 100 new stores across the UK in the year ahead after a sales boom partly prompted by the successful launch of its vegan sausage roll.

      "body": "<p>In the final days of December, speculation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\">Rihanna</a> might be about to release her ninth album, known among fans simply as R9, entered overdrive. Despite the many articles and social media posts leaking titbits about the work in progress over the last four years, Rihanna has never shared official details about the project, though <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/rihanna-says-new-album-will-arrive-next-year/\">she once said </a><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/rihanna-says-new-album-will-arrive-next-year/\">her next album</a> would come out in 2019.</p> <p>It\u2019s because of this throwaway comment in 2018 that relations between Rihanna and her \u201cstans\u201d (super fans) reached a kind of mania in late December. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Ybc0snGw9/\">The star </a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Ybc0snGw9/\">has posted</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Ybc0snGw9/\"> taunts</a> about <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/news/rihanna-teases-fans-about-listening-to-but-refusing-to-release-r9/ar-BBYgdTy\">\u201clistening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it\u201d</a>, while her fans are <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/music/rihanna-fan-tweets-r9/\">gleefully joking</a> about breaking into her house and holding her at knifepoint to obtain the album. Whatever Rihanna posts \u2013 whether it\u2019s about the Australian bushfires or a friend who has died \u2013 the response is the same. Among Rihanna\u2019s first tweets of 2020 was a carefree selfie. The first reply came from a fan: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/1214305599069929473\">a picture of a child holding a knife</a>, captioned: \u201cWhere\u2019s the damn album.\u201d</p> <p>When did fans start believing they<em> deserve</em> albums from their favourite pop stars? New albums were once \u201ceagerly awaited\u201d; now fans believe that work is, in effect, being held to ransom. A similar chaotic energy surrounded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\">Frank Ocean</a> in 2016. He hadn\u2019t released music in more than four years; like Rihanna, he had casually teased dates for new music only to miss his own deadlines. For a while, he couldn\u2019t be spotted in public without being criticised on social media for not being in the studio. \u201cFrank Ocean is behaving like a dickhead,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/5/16039400/whos-to-blame-frank-ocean-boys-dont-cry-delay-52c339b81972\">stated </a><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/5/16039400/whos-to-blame-frank-ocean-boys-dont-cry-delay-52c339b81972\">the Ringer critic Justin Charity</a>, although he said Ocean\u2019s fans with their \u201cpsychotic mob chants\u201d were worse. The mood became so embittered, it was hard to tell whether fans still really wanted new work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25dc2bbff5bb8ce93be21f33dd4192ea50373a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25dc2bbff5bb8ce93be21f33dd4192ea50373a08/0_0_4914_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Behaving like a dickhead\u2019?

In the 2010s, online news outlets began to behave like fans themselves, scouring artists\u2019 social media for any clues about big releases and then publishing their findings as gospel. These days, we know a lot about an album before the work is officially announced. (Search \u201ceverything we know about R9\u201d and <a href=\"https://time.com/5751582/rihanna-new-album/\">you\u2019ll</a> <a href=\"https://www.capitalxtra.com/artists/rihanna/lists/r9-new-album-release-date-songs-listen/\">find</a> <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/rihanna-new-album-everything-we-know\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/rihanna-r9-new-album-release-date-info/\">results</a>.) Publications and blogs report on Ocean\u2019s every Tumblr post, contributing to fans\u2019 already frantic anticipation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a> has also been hit hard by this rolling news cycle. In 2013, she <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/grimes-is-deleting-her-tumblr-because-you-took-her-beyonce-and-psy-quotes-too-seriously\">posted an angry </a><a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/grimes-is-deleting-her-tumblr-because-you-took-her-beyonce-and-psy-quotes-too-seriously\">missive</a> on Tumblr, stating: \u201cnothing i write here is an official statement and i really resent this shit turning into news\u201d.</p> <p>If new music does materialise, but fails to meet fans\u2019 high expectations, the backlash is swift and brutal. In the summer of 2016, Ocean broadcast a livestream of himself building a staircase to an ambient soundtrack titled Endless. Endless is a beautiful, haunting piece, and its introduction to the world seemed to convey a message about patience and perseverance. But fans were simply upset that this wasn\u2019t the traditional album they felt they had been promised. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/25/frank-ocean-blonde-review-a-baffling-and-brilliant-five-star-triumph\">That record, Blonde, arrived days later</a>.)</p> <p>In stan culture, everything is hyperbolic. This breed of extreme fandom has emerged from a connected world in which fans can access (and berate) stars at the click of a button. In her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/24/fangirls-by-hannah-ewens-review\">Fangirls: Scenes </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/24/fangirls-by-hannah-ewens-review\">from Modern Music Culture</a>, Hannah Ewens observes that music fans have long been early adopters and innovators in the world of tech. Today, their rhetoric permeates online culture. The binary tendency to declare something either a \u201chit\u201d or a \u201cflop\u201d has rippled through the increasingly polarised music press: in an economy driven by page views, it pays to declare everything either an era-defining masterpiece or a heap of trash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c5410c3798c62f4cbb22511654d6078a7cc17a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c5410c3798c62f4cbb22511654d6078a7cc17a0/0_912_3648_4560/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Stream my record!\u2019 \u2026Justin Bieber sitting on a piano bench covered in graffiti\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stream my record!\u2019 \u2026 Justin Bieber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, Popjustice founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/25/great-pop-power-shift-how-online-armies-replaced-fan-clubs\">Peter Robinson described how online fandom</a> was supplanting the traditional, top-down fan club. With fan bodies becoming more autonomous and organised away from the control of artists and labels, Robinson depicted a stark power imbalance, saying that many artists felt \u201ctrapped by fanbases that invariably look unfavourably on an artist wishing to progress their sound\u201d. He predicted that fan-artist relations might be running headlong towards a \u201cfull-on, real-life siege\u201d. One glance at Rihanna\u2019s Twitter mentions suggests his prophecy is coming true.</p> <p>Stan power can make or break an artist. As hinted at by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a>\u2019s recent cynical plea for his fans to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060120/justin-bieber-yummy-instagram-spotify-itunes-youtube-song-chart\">stream his comeback single in their sleep</a> and use proxy US IP addresses to help it to reach the top of the charts, hardcore fans are well versed in how to manipulate streaming and sales figures, and they mobilise to make sure their faves are successful. They regularly battle other fandoms by pointing to the latest streaming figures or chart positions their icon has achieved, and take pride in having influenced those numbers. In this respect, some stan factions \u2013 usually at the vanguard of digital culture \u2013 feel slightly archaic. Their obsession with the album \u201cera\u201d, charts, sales and commercial success is out of step with how the music industry functions today.</p> <p>The traditional \u201calbum cycle\u201d is certainly not the only way for artists to operate any more. Some have abandoned this model altogether: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/19/pops-need-for-speed-you-have-to-drop-new-stuff-constantly\">German pop star Kim Petras recently said</a> that she likes to make her fans feel \u201cconnected\u201d by dropping music as a weekly event, \u201clike a TV show\u201d. Many artists have ambitions beyond music. Journalist Tshepo Mokoena has explored how black artists, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna in particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/19/work-work-work-beyonces-labour-of-liberation\">reshaped what it means to be a pop star in the 2010s</a>. Their careers no longer centre around album releases \u2013 although those remain their most publicly hyped moments. Instead, with ventures such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Ivy Park and her Homecoming film, or Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/08/rihanna-lingerie-savage-x-fenty-victorias-secret-new-york-fashion-week\">Savage lingerie line</a>, they\u2019ve positioned themselves as curators, designers, businesswomen, directors and all-round entertainers.</p> <p>Berating artists for not releasing albums to schedule feels anachronistic in 2020. As critic Alex Pappademas <a href=\"https://gen.medium.com/the-decade-comic-book-nerds-became-our-cultural-overlords-f219b732a660\">argued of comic-book nerds\u2019 vehement support for movie studios in the 2010s</a>, it represents a \u201cpopulist groundswell in service of the status quo, of corporations, and of power\u201d. For Slate\u2019s 2019 Music Club essay series, critic Jack Hamilton wrote about how <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/music-fandom-stan-culture-pop-stars-fan-armies.html\">poptimism calcified in the music press this decade</a>, creating a world in which every time an artist releases new music, it is characterised as \u201cgifting\u201d. As Hamilton points out, your faves are not generously showering you with presents, they\u2019re selling products. Depicting pop stars as benevolent gift-givers plays into the hands of music industry executives who want us to believe that we are lucky to receive what we get. To borrow a phrase from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/26/yannis-philippakis-foals-interview-observer-music\">Foals frontman Yannis Philippakis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/19/pops-need-for-speed-you-have-to-drop-new-stuff-constantly\">it casts musicians as a kind of Pez dispenser</a>, and their legions of fans as eternally outstretched hands, waiting for the next treat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826f56d2d0fdef3474a30eda54c2eee95074f096\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826f56d2d0fdef3474a30eda54c2eee95074f096/402_365_3298_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foals frontman or human Pez dispenser? ...

Yannis Philippakis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RMV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that stans cast themselves as the people who truly get an artist, this demand for satisfaction \u2013 for product \u2013 fundamentally misunderstands creativity, and fails to appreciate the ebb and flow of human life. Any artist they perceive as slacking may not be in a music-making phase; they may be going through some kind of personal turmoil, writer\u2019s block, or simply be busy with another project. Fan armies pestering idols heightens the pressure that labels, managers and other invested parties can apply to artists to meet contractual obligations, and thus make more profit. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik\">Zayn Malik</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/23/zayn-malik-icarus-falls-review\">second album showed</a>, nobody wants to hear records churned out to meet a quota. Keeping cherished artists tied to the content treadmill until they let fans down isn\u2019t love.</p> <p>For me, music fandom in the 2010s was defined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>\u2019s surprise album release in 2013: one of those rare, thrilling moments when you remember exactly where you were when you first heard something. That album, Beyonc\u00e9, remains one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most mature and complex works, but it can never be separated from the masterstroke of surprise that brought it into the world: \u201cI changed the game with that digital drop,\u201d she rightfully bragged on Nicki Minaj\u2019s Feeling Myself two years later.</p> <p>That kind of shock release from any major pop star no longer feels possible in 2020. Fans are too finely attuned to the minutiae of clues dropped online, too well-trained as internet sleuths. The promise of the number of retweets you might get from being the first to discover a new song registered on ASCAP is too great; as is the number of page views you might get from <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2014/11/someone-may-have-ruined-beyoncs-surprise-album.html\">posting a fake leaked tracklist as news</a>. Fans are even <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-artist-imposters-and-fake-songs-sneak-onto-streaming-services/\">circumventing streaming services\u2019 lax security to upload fake albums</a>, usually comprising old demos, to Spotify and Apple Music: a prank that has brought flashes of chart success and ill-gotten royalties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98e77c9cf7813327b6067996d84bf4d0f38de746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e77c9cf7813327b6067996d84bf4d0f38de746/0_0_2670_1602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young fans meet Stormzy at HMV Cardiff, 7 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A better model of fandom? Young fans meet Stormzy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Lewis Photography/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the start of a new decade, what might a better model of fandom look like \u2013 maintaining the joy of being part of a global collective with a shared passion for a culture-shifting artist, but not privileging constant releases and sales as a measure of love?</p> <p>First, we need space to listen harder and have nuanced discussions. In this column, Tom Ewing argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/29/online-forums-musical-culture-messageboards-social-media-music-essay\">online forums may be the future of fandom</a>, explaining that the behaviour of fans \u201cis guided by limits and defaults baked into the technology\u201d. Subreddits like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/\">r/popheads</a> provide the format for stans to go deep in a way that Twitter and Instagram don\u2019t. On forums for individual artists, such as <a href=\"https://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/\">Kanyetothe</a>, there\u2019s even more willingness to dive into an artist\u2019s back catalogue and explore what already exists.

      "bodyText": "In the final days of December, speculation that Rihanna might be about to release her ninth album, known among fans simply as R9, entered overdrive. Despite the many articles and social media posts leaking titbits about the work in progress over the last four years, Rihanna has never shared official details about the project, though she once said her next album would come out in 2019. It\u2019s because of this throwaway comment in 2018 that relations between Rihanna and her \u201cstans\u201d (super fans) reached a kind of mania in late December. The star has posted taunts about \u201clistening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it\u201d, while her fans are gleefully joking about breaking into her house and holding her at knifepoint to obtain the album. Whatever Rihanna posts \u2013 whether it\u2019s about the Australian bushfires or a friend who has died \u2013 the response is the same. Among Rihanna\u2019s first tweets of 2020 was a carefree selfie. The first reply came from a fan: a picture of a child holding a knife, captioned: \u201cWhere\u2019s the damn album.\u201d When did fans start believing they deserve albums from their favourite pop stars? New albums were once \u201ceagerly awaited\u201d; now fans believe that work is, in effect, being held to ransom. A similar chaotic energy surrounded Frank Ocean in 2016. He hadn\u2019t released music in more than four years; like Rihanna, he had casually teased dates for new music only to miss his own deadlines. For a while, he couldn\u2019t be spotted in public without being criticised on social media for not being in the studio. \u201cFrank Ocean is behaving like a dickhead,\u201d stated the Ringer critic Justin Charity, although he said Ocean\u2019s fans with their \u201cpsychotic mob chants\u201d were worse. The mood became so embittered, it was hard to tell whether fans still really wanted new work. The situation is exacerbated by the music media. In the 2010s, online news outlets began to behave like fans themselves, scouring artists\u2019 social media for any clues about big releases and then publishing their findings as gospel. These days, we know a lot about an album before the work is officially announced. (Search \u201ceverything we know about R9\u201d and you\u2019ll find many results.) Publications and blogs report on Ocean\u2019s every Tumblr post, contributing to fans\u2019 already frantic anticipation. Grimes has also been hit hard by this rolling news cycle. In 2013, she posted an angry missive on Tumblr, stating: \u201cnothing i write here is an official statement and i really resent this shit turning into news\u201d. If new music does materialise, but fails to meet fans\u2019 high expectations, the backlash is swift and brutal. In the summer of 2016, Ocean broadcast a livestream of himself building a staircase to an ambient soundtrack titled Endless. Endless is a beautiful, haunting piece, and its introduction to the world seemed to convey a message about patience and perseverance. But fans were simply upset that this wasn\u2019t the traditional album they felt they had been promised. (That record, Blonde, arrived days later.) In stan culture, everything is hyperbolic. This breed of extreme fandom has emerged from a connected world in which fans can access (and berate) stars at the click of a button. In her book Fangirls: Scenes from Modern Music Culture, Hannah Ewens observes that music fans have long been early adopters and innovators in the world of tech. Today, their rhetoric permeates online culture. The binary tendency to declare something either a \u201chit\u201d or a \u201cflop\u201d has rippled through the increasingly polarised music press: in an economy driven by page views, it pays to declare everything either an era-defining masterpiece or a heap of trash. In 2014, Popjustice founder Peter Robinson described how online fandom was supplanting the traditional, top-down fan club. With fan bodies becoming more autonomous and organised away from the control of artists and labels, Robinson depicted a stark power imbalance, saying that many artists felt \u201ctrapped by fanbases that invariably look unfavourably on an artist wishing to progress their sound\u201d. He predicted that fan-artist relations might be running headlong towards a \u201cfull-on, real-life siege\u201d. One glance at Rihanna\u2019s Twitter mentions suggests his prophecy is coming true. Stan power can make or break an artist. As hinted at by Justin Bieber\u2019s recent cynical plea for his fans to stream his comeback single in their sleep and use proxy US IP addresses to help it to reach the top of the charts, hardcore fans are well versed in how to manipulate streaming and sales figures, and they mobilise to make sure their faves are successful. They regularly battle other fandoms by pointing to the latest streaming figures or chart positions their icon has achieved, and take pride in having influenced those numbers. In this respect, some stan factions \u2013 usually at the vanguard of digital culture \u2013 feel slightly archaic. Their obsession with the album \u201cera\u201d, charts, sales and commercial success is out of step with how the music industry functions today. The traditional \u201calbum cycle\u201d is certainly not the only way for artists to operate any more. Some have abandoned this model altogether: German pop star Kim Petras recently said that she likes to make her fans feel \u201cconnected\u201d by dropping music as a weekly event, \u201clike a TV show\u201d. Many artists have ambitions beyond music. Journalist Tshepo Mokoena has explored how black artists, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna in particular, reshaped what it means to be a pop star in the 2010s. Their careers no longer centre around album releases \u2013 although those remain their most publicly hyped moments. Instead, with ventures such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Ivy Park and her Homecoming film, or Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty and Savage lingerie line, they\u2019ve positioned themselves as curators, designers, businesswomen, directors and all-round entertainers. Berating artists for not releasing albums to schedule feels anachronistic in 2020. As critic Alex Pappademas argued of comic-book nerds\u2019 vehement support for movie studios in the 2010s, it represents a \u201cpopulist groundswell in service of the status quo, of corporations, and of power\u201d. For Slate\u2019s 2019 Music Club essay series, critic Jack Hamilton wrote about how poptimism calcified in the music press this decade, creating a world in which every time an artist releases new music, it is characterised as \u201cgifting\u201d. As Hamilton points out, your faves are not generously showering you with presents, they\u2019re selling products. Depicting pop stars as benevolent gift-givers plays into the hands of music industry executives who want us to believe that we are lucky to receive what we get. To borrow a phrase from Foals frontman Yannis Philippakis, it casts musicians as a kind of Pez dispenser, and their legions of fans as eternally outstretched hands, waiting for the next treat. For all that stans cast themselves as the people who truly get an artist, this demand for satisfaction \u2013 for product \u2013 fundamentally misunderstands creativity, and fails to appreciate the ebb and flow of human life. Any artist they perceive as slacking may not be in a music-making phase; they may be going through some kind of personal turmoil, writer\u2019s block, or simply be busy with another project. Fan armies pestering idols heightens the pressure that labels, managers and other invested parties can apply to artists to meet contractual obligations, and thus make more profit. As Zayn Malik\u2019s second album showed, nobody wants to hear records churned out to meet a quota. Keeping cherished artists tied to the content treadmill until they let fans down isn\u2019t love. For me, music fandom in the 2010s was defined by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s surprise album release in 2013: one of those rare, thrilling moments when you remember exactly where you were when you first heard something. That album, Beyonc\u00e9, remains one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most mature and complex works, but it can never be separated from the masterstroke of surprise that brought it into the world: \u201cI changed the game with that digital drop,\u201d she rightfully bragged on Nicki Minaj\u2019s Feeling Myself two years later. That kind of shock release from any major pop star no longer feels possible in 2020. Fans are too finely attuned to the minutiae of clues dropped online, too well-trained as internet sleuths. The promise of the number of retweets you might get from being the first to discover a new song registered on ASCAP is too great; as is the number of page views you might get from posting a fake leaked tracklist as news. Fans are even circumventing streaming services\u2019 lax security to upload fake albums, usually comprising old demos, to Spotify and Apple Music: a prank that has brought flashes of chart success and ill-gotten royalties. At the start of a new decade, what might a better model of fandom look like \u2013 maintaining the joy of being part of a global collective with a shared passion for a culture-shifting artist, but not privileging constant releases and sales as a measure of love? First, we need space to listen harder and have nuanced discussions. In this column, Tom Ewing argued that online forums may be the future of fandom, explaining that the behaviour of fans \u201cis guided by limits and defaults baked into the technology\u201d. Subreddits like r/popheads provide the format for stans to go deep in a way that Twitter and Instagram don\u2019t. On forums for individual artists, such as Kanyetothe, there\u2019s even more willingness to dive into an artist\u2019s back catalogue and explore what already exists. Podcasts such as Dissect and Song Exploder are bringing deep critical and technical readings of pop into the mainstream and making a case for subtlety. The pace of pop culture hardwires fans to constantly expect more. Up against waning attention spans and falling album sales, artists have learned how to hustle harder to avoid vanishing from view. As we move forward \u2013 with a deeper consciousness about the impact that a culture that\u2019s always asking \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d is having on both our planet and on our minds \u2013 let\u2019s ask for less. As the 2010s ended, sustainability became an urgent concern for the music industry, with artists such as the 1975 and Coldplay leading the discussion on how it can be made more eco-friendly. But sustainability is also a mindset: not demanding novelty, not prioritising economic growth, and not treating art as disposable. Fandom\u2019s next phase might be rooted in cherishing what we have. As Gen Z resist oversharing on socials and everyone is feeling overwhelmed by connectivity, perhaps in the 2020s, the performance of fandom will come to feel less important than the intimate connections we all form with music. As usual, Rihanna is way ahead, operating with the cool detachment of someone who knows where her best interests lie. Her last album, 2016\u2019s joyfully weird Anti, was her first after leaving the Def Jam label and purchasing her masters. She released it on her own label, in conjunction with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation. It\u2019s likely that R9 will arrive the same way. Last year, she told Interview magazine, \u201cit makes no sense to rush it\u201d. She\u2019s beholden to nobody\u2019s schedule but her own. For that reason, I truly stan for ever.",

      "bodyText": "A year of extreme weather events and mounting evidence of global heating have catapulted the climate emergency to the top of the list of issues worrying the world\u2019s elite. The World Economic Forum\u2019s annual risks report found that, for the first time in its 15-year history, the environment filled the top five places in the list of concerns likely to have a major impact over the next decade. B\u00f8rge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, said: \u201cThe political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning. This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.\u201d After a month in which bushfires have raged out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action. \u201cWe have only a very small window and if we don\u2019t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.\u201d The WEF report said the retreat from the multilateral approach that helped cope with the 2008 financial crisis made it more difficult to tackle shared global risks. It said the top five risks in terms of likelihood in the next 10 years were: Extreme weather events with major damage to property, infrastructure and loss of human life. Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation by governments and businesses. Human-made environmental damage and disasters, including environmental crime, such as oil spills and radioactive contamination. Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse with irreversible consequences for the environment, resulting in severely depleted resources for humankind as well as industries. Major natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and geomagnetic storms. The report was released ahead of the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos next week, which will be attended by the chief executives of some of the world\u2019s biggest and powerful companies. Despite the large number of participants flying in to Switzerland by private jet, the WEF said Davos would be a carbon-neutral event. But John Drzik, the chairman of Marsh &amp; McLennan insights, which helped to compile the report, said businesses had to step up their action on global heating. \u201cThere is mounting pressure on companies from investors, regulators, customers, and employees to demonstrate their resilience to rising climate volatility. Scientific advances mean that climate risks can now be modelled with greater accuracy and incorporated into risk management and business plans. High-profile events, like recent bushfires in Australia and California, are adding pressure on companies to take action on climate risk at a time when they also face greater geopolitical and cyber risk challenges.\u201d Peter Giger, group chief risk officer of Zurich Insurance Group, which also collaborates in the preparation of the risks report, said there was a pressing need to adapt faster to avoid the worst and irreversible impacts of the climate crisis and to do more to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cBiologically diverse ecosystems capture vast amounts of carbon and provide massive economic benefits that are estimated at $33tn (\u00a325tn) per year \u2013 the equivalent to the GDP of the US and China combined.

And their prayers were answered. Until late Wednesday afternoon, the tournament was a slam without a dunk, sweating in limbo and hoping all would be well before the curtain goes up on Monday. The tournament, the city, the nation needed a miracle of sorts \u2013 and a thunderstorm rolled through town to blow their cares away. There is more on the way, maybe enough to put a smile on this tournament after days of worry and doubt. To celebrate the arrival of a belting storm that rumbled on for hours, Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and a slew of stars fooled around in a lighthearted exhibition in Rally For Relief under the roof at the Rod Laver Arena to raise money for bushfire victims. If they had opened the roof and let them roll around in the rain, no one would have minded. But there was rancour still. Step forward for a rare moment in the spotlight Brayden Schnur, the world No 103 from Canada, who complained of \u201csuper dryness\u201d when defeating Austria\u2019s Sebastian Ofner and reckoned the game\u2019s elite players should have made serious noise about the heat and toxic air they had to endure. \u201cIt\u2019s got to come from the top guys,\u201d Schnur told Australian Associated Press. \u201cRoger and Rafa are a little bit selfish in thinking about themselves and their careers.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Simmering tensions as Steyer makes a mark in Des Moines The long detente between America\u2019s two leading progressives, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, appears to be over after the Democratic debate in Des Moines on Tuesday where Warren referenced Sanders\u2019 alleged assertion that a woman could not beat Trump \u2013 a claim Sanders denies \u2013 and then appeared to ignore his offered handshake. \u201cThe only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women,\u201d Warren said. Vanilla debate. The billionaire businessman Tom Steyer at last had a chance to make a mark on the debate stage, with his answer on climate change. That\u2019s one of five key takeaways from a largely vanilla debate. Biden benefits. Nathan Robinson says Joe Biden ought to be thrilled by the tensions between his two leading rivals, while Richard Wolffe says the dull debate showed the Democratic race desperately needs a shot in the arm. Democrats release Ukraine docs from Giuliani associate House Democrats have released a cache of documents obtained from the Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas, a close associate of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who is at the centre of the Ukraine scandal. Among the documents, which include phone records, texts and flash drives, is a note handwritten by Parnas, apparently reminding himself to get the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to \u201cannounce that the Biden case will be investigated\u201d. Conspiracy charges. Parnas and his business partner, Igor Fruman, also a US citizen from the former Soviet bloc, were indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records. Michael Flynn seeks to withdraw guilty plea Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, facing sentencing for lying to federal investigators amid the Trump-Russia investigation, is seeking to reverse his previous guilty plea after complaining of \u201cthe government\u2019s bad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement\u201d. Flynn was the first senior White House official to cut a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, providing extensive information to federal prosecutors in exchange for leniency. Uncooperative witness. In recent months, Flynn has reportedly grown less cooperative and started insisting he committed no crimes, leading prosecutors to recommend a six-month prison sentence. Meghan\u2019s father could be called to testify at UK high court Thomas Markle, the estranged father of the Duchess of Sussex, may be called upon to give evidence at the UK\u2019s high court amid his daughter\u2019s ongoing legal action against the Mail on Sunday. Meghan is suing the newspaper for breach of copyright and invasion of privacy after it published excerpts from a letter to her father, in which she complained about how he was treating her. The paper\u2019s defence appears to rely on Thomas Markle\u2019s account of the episode. Royal summit. It has emerged that Meghan did not take part in the summit of senior royals on the question of her and Prince Harry\u2019s future roles. The Sussexes decided her participation was not necessary in the meeting between the Queen, Harry, his father, Prince Charles, and brother, Prince William. Cheat sheet Some 2,000 Syrian opposition troops have travelled from Turkey to fight alongside government forces in Libya, threatening to further complicate the north African nation\u2019s intractable civil war. James Murdoch and his wife, Kathryn, have issued a statement criticising the climate coverage of Fox News and News Corp \u2013 particularly in relation to Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis \u2013 in a rare attack by a company director on his own firm\u2019s operations. A decade-long transatlantic study has found that being wealthy in the US or UK adds nine years to people\u2019s healthy life expectancy. Police in Peru have said they will deport five tourists and prosecute another after they allegedly snuck into the Incan citadel at Machu Picchu, damaged stonework and defecated on the site. Must-reads How the decade\u2019s bestselling books kickstarted a kink boom With well over 150m copies sold by the middle of the 2010s, the 50 Shades trilogy was by far the decades\u2019 biggest bestseller, heralding a boom in erotica \u2013 but did it have any lasting cultural influence between the covers, or between the sheets? Sian Cain investigates. Wisconsin\u2019s evangelicals stay loyal to Trump Many voters in rural Wisconsin flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016. In his latest report from a key midwest swing county, Chris McGreal finds one local pastor concerned that his congregation seems more devoted to Trump than to Jesus. Native Americans fight to be counted in US census The 2020 US census will determine election maps and federal spending for the next decade. Native Americans have historically been undercounted, and thus underrepresented. Tribal activists are fighting to ensure that will not happen again this year, as Rebecca Nagle reports. Vegetarianism goes back to its African roots Global meat consumption is growing, with the burgeoning middle classes across Africa, Asia and Latin America powering demand. But in Africa, where plant-based diets were once prevalent, some are following the western trend towards vegetarianism, finds Anna Pujol-Mazzini. Opinion Casper, the direct-to-consumer mattress company, is the latest trendy online company to make announce for an IPO, calling itself a \u201cpioneer of the sleep economy\u201d. But that economy, says Arwa Mahdawi, is built on an insidious lie. The reason most people aren\u2019t sleeping well isn\u2019t down to their mattress or their pyjamas; it\u2019s down to social issues such as precarious employment, long hours and noise pollution. Sport The Carolina Panthers\u2019 Luke Kuechly has announced his retirement from the NFL aged 28. One of the finest linebackers of his generation, Kuechly\u2019s career was also punctuated by two serious concussions. The Boston Red Sox have fired their manager Alex Cora after he was implicated in MLB\u2019s widening sign-stealing scandal. Cora was a coach with the Houston Astros when they illicitly stole signs on their way to winning the 2017 World Series.

And yet for all its fake idealism, the IOC has yet again this week revealed itself as much more concerned with micropolicing potential political statements of individual athletes in Tokyo later this year than looking to its own political statements. The most above-politics statement the IOC could possibly make would be to announce that henceforth the Olympics would always take place in, say, Greece, where they originated. Then instead of lying about benefits to the host nations, and ignoring the needless environmental damage, they could acknowledge that most people watch these things on telly and couldn\u2019t care less where they are held. If they really are committed to building a better world, as their goals specifically state, the Olympic movement could use the climate emergency to truly lead the way. F1, Saudi Arabia and \u2018societal norms\u2019 \u201cWe know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodic fits of morality,\u201d wrote Thomas Babington Macaulay, who fortunately died before he could behold Formula One in one of theirs. News that F1 is close to signing a deal for a Saudi Grand Prix is an enduring reminder that nothing the sport says about anything at all other than money should ever be taken remotely seriously. Do recall that it was not even two years ago that F1\u2019s owners, Liberty Media, were indulging in a bout of public self-congratulation for getting rid of the scantily clad grid girls in the wake of the #MeToo movement\u2019s explosion. \u201cWe feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values,\u201d sniffed F1\u2019s commercial managing director at the time, \u201cand is clearly at odds with modern\u2011day societal norms\u201d. To the society of Saudi Arabia then, one of the most brutally repressive on earth, where women were permitted to drive only 18 months ago, allowed to travel without permission from a male relative only six months ago, and where women\u2019s rights activists are imprisoned in solitary confinement and reportedly tortured. And so on, and so on, at great length. That said, the Saudi ruling tyrants are very rich. So of course Formula One is going to race here, and of course we must expect them to try and make further hay about how they\u2019re leading the way opening up a new modern era for the kingdom, or something. And yet \u2026 What a load of old bollocks. Indeed, all of a sudden, who can really say grid girls represent some retrograde force of oppression? Let\u2019s face it \u2013 bikini-clad women are very much against Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201csocietal norms\u201d, to quote a phrase. After all, the presence of a bikini-clad lovely would, on a Saudi circuit, be regarded as an act of vast political defiance, as opposed to something that lots of powerful businessmen are going to decide is shameful because it makes them look good for five minutes while Harvey Weinstein\u2019s in the news.",

In the latest signal of economic weakness at the end of last year, the ONS said high street discounting and lower hotel prices had dragged down inflation in December, amid steep reductions in the price of women\u2019s clothing. It said the biggest discounts were available on women\u2019s casual jackets and cardigans, while there was a notable increase in the number of items listed for sale in December compared with the same month a year ago. The sharp fall in inflation comes after a torrid Christmas trading period for retailers across the country, with major chain stores including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and Superdry reporting disappointing sales.

XR is far from the first environmental campaign to receive this kind of police attention. More than a decade ago the anti-aviation group Plane Stupid was targeted and it is nine years since Mark Kennedy was exposed as an undercover police officer who infiltrated annual climate camp gatherings.

It is clear that once the current controversy dies down, it will be only a matter of time before XR and other climate activists are again labelled as an \u201cextremist risk\u201d. The group has indicated it may bring legal action to have its name removed from any list but perhaps XR would be better served by putting its weight behind the call for the complete abolition of the \u201cdomestic extremist\u201d label for everyone. To protect freedom to protest, the government also needs to completely separate secretive counter-terrorism units from the policing of non-violent protests. They have no business involving themselves in legitimate political activity. Until this happens, it seems unlikely anyone will ever be held to account for \u201cerrors of judgment\u201d, no matter how potentially damaging the consequences are for those labelled a safeguarding risk. Officers will simply carry on, as they have for decades, trying to find imagined threats in any new and emerging protest movement and then spying on and disrupting their campaigns. It\u2019s time this finally stopped for good. \u2022 Kevin Blowe is coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring",

Tamu McPherson, a Jamaica-born, Milan-based blogger, should be on your mood board here: find her on Instagram (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alltheprettybirdsofficial/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@alltheprettybirdsofficial</a>). The fashion influencer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/camillecharriere/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Camille Charri\u00e8re</a> posted blazer-wearing selfies two days running over the Christmas break. In the first, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6id8CRhA0a/\" title=\"\">she wore a checked blazer with blue jeans</a>, cowboy boots, a white shirt and a scrunchie, tagging the Princess Diana fan feed @ladydirevengelooks in the caption.

But it is also to be found (on social media and in real life) worn over a printed mid-length dress or a feminist slogan T-shirt that has been tucked into a long-ish skirt. This is perhaps the most radical repositioning of the blazer: that it is being worn by women who work in publishing or the art world, women who enjoy outdoor swimming, women who belong to a book club. A decade ago, such women would have considered a blazer light years away from what they were not yet calling their personal brand. They would have seen the blazer as smart in an airless, institutionalised way that felt entirely alien. But, in 2020, worn with a tiered dark-floral skirt, loosely waved hair and mismatched earrings, the blazer adds immediate polish, a jazzy front-of-house finishing touch. In the age of wearing flat shoes to work, a sharp-shouldered blazer brings the stature we once got from our spike heels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"126ceae68b30f60b261a6b076b0c94127b542c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/126ceae68b30f60b261a6b076b0c94127b542c90/0_0_1024_1469/697.jpg\" alt=\"Camel blazer, \u00a389.99, Zara\" width=\"697\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bona fide fashion trend ... blazers, such as this \u00a389.99 camel number, now get their own section on Zara\u2019s website.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After dark, the blazer is at the centre of a slowburn eveningwear revolution that is putting tailoring, rather than the party dress, centre stage.

But a city grappling with a housing crisis that has priced out far too many cannot afford to allow houses like the one on Magnolia to sit vacant, Walker said. In Oakland, more than 15,500 units are vacant, according to the latest US census bureau data, while 4,071 people are homeless.</p> <p>\u201cThis is bigger than me, than this one house,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI never thought I would be in this position. But this is the new face of homelessness. It doesn\u2019t look like what people think homelessness would look like.\u201d</p> <p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, sheriff deputies rolled up to the white house on Magnolia Street, where hundreds of Walker\u2019s supporters had gathered, knowing that eviction was imminent. Two other homeless mothers staying in the house, as well as two supporters, were arrested. Walker planned to be there when the deputies arrived but was in an interview when they battered down the front door. She and other organizers had made sure beforehand that the children had somewhere else to stay during the chaos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea2e0457d4e0e751f2cfb1b6f3b538f919f2187d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2e0457d4e0e751f2cfb1b6f3b538f919f2187d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker, right, speaks for herself and on behalf of fellow Moms 4 Housing members Sharena Thomas, second from left, Misty Cross, and Tolani King, as the councilwoman Nikki Fortunato Bas, left, looks on during a press conference on 10 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walker, right, with fellow Moms 4 Housing members Sharena Thomas, second from left, Misty Cross, and Tolani King, as the councilwoman Nikki Fortunato Bas, left, looks on during a press conference on 10 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Chavez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the aftermath, Walker was teary and tired, but just as resolute as she has been throughout the process. Because when she and her family took possession of that house on Magnolia Street, they did so not just for themselves, not just for other homeless families like them, but to spark a movement \u2013 a movement that their supporters believe will be the next civil rights movement of our time: housing as a human right.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I should be standing with my sisters,\u201d she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackieKPIX/status/1217108628668207104?s=20\">told reporters</a> outside the house. \u201cBut I\u2019m standing right here for them right now. This movement is just beginning.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018This is not the Oakland I grew up in\u2019</h2> <p>Walker\u2019s story has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/07/the-oakland-women-who-took-over-a-vacant-lot-to-house-the-homeless\">far too common in the Bay Area</a>. She has deep roots in Oakland, with her grandparents moving from Arkansas and Mississippi to make the city their home. After growing up there, she left for Tougaloo College in Mississippi in 2004, where she earned a degree in sociology and met the father of her children.</p> <p>When their relationship fell apart, and she found herself having to flee domestic violence in April, she looked toward Oakland, toward home, only to find there was no one left.</p> <p>Like so many others in the community, her family had been priced out, leaving for places like Vallejo, Sacramento, Antioch and Stockton. She got a job in Oakland organizing for the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), but no place to stay.</p> <p>\u201cI was sleeping at a family member\u2019s house in Stockton, commuting from Stockton to Oakland every day, and bringing the kids to daycare in Berkeley,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried another family member in Antioch, and it didn\u2019t make much of a difference. The commute was even worse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F8f8c2d0587e8a26adc59a5764b5eac009df0166f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2001&amp;left-caption=Walker%20with%20her%20children%2C%20Amir%20Morrow%2C%20one%2C%20left%2C%20and%20Aja%20Morrow%2C%20five%2C%20on%205%20January.%20&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb87c951fa12a9b80ddc187519dd42dde8239279c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2001&amp;right-caption=Aja%20by%20the%20Christmas%20tree%20in%20the%20Magnolia%20Street%20house.%20Photographs%3A%20Sarahbeth%20Maney%2Fthe%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"walker with family in Magnolia Street house\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F8f8c2d0587e8a26adc59a5764b5eac009df0166f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2001&left-caption=Walker%20with%20her%20children%2C%20Amir%20Morrow%2C%20one%2C%20left%2C%20and%20Aja%20Morrow%2C%20five%2C%20on%205%20January.%20&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fb87c951fa12a9b80ddc187519dd42dde8239279c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3000_2001&right-caption=Aja%20by%20the%20Christmas%20tree%20in%20the%20Magnolia%20Street%20house.%20Photographs%3A%20Sarahbeth%20Maney%2Fthe%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">walker with family in Magnolia Street house</a> </figure>  <p>Walker tried some city programs that gave her vouchers for hotels and attempted to get into a rental assistance program that ended up having its funding cut. At the same time, she began to realize that the issue extended beyond her.</p> <p>Everywhere she turned, she felt like she saw homeless encampment after homeless encampment. In the work she did with ACCE, people kept handing her forms with the address section left blank, sometimes crossing it out to write \u201chomeless\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the Oakland that I left, the Oakland that I grew up in,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand the magnitude of what had happened since I left. My family would call and say, \u2018I\u2019m moving to Stockton,\u2019 and I\u2019d think, OK, it just got expensive. I didn\u2019t realize we were in the streets with encampments like that until I came back.\u201d</p> <p>She joined up with other homeless mothers to form Moms 4 Housing. And then they started looking for a vacant house.</p> <h2>How speculators fuel the crisis</h2> <p>California has a widespread vacant property problem. About 8% of all housing units in the state remain vacant, an estimated 1.2m, according to the US Census Bureau \u2013 though some of those units may be short-term rentals or market-rate apartments with no tenants.</p> <p>Some blame the vacancy problem in part on Proposition 13, a 1978 ballot initiative that capped property taxes at 1% of the home\u2019s value at the time of purchase, and reduced total property taxes by 57%. With such low property taxes, it\u2019s cheaper for some longtime owners and investors to let a property remain vacant while waiting for the market to come out in their favor.</p> <p>And following the foreclosure crisis, in which Oakland was struck particularly hard, more than 10,000 homes changed ownership in the city, many in low-income neighborhoods, according to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzpT2ZxllyQoWjV4dFo2ZG5ZTU0/view\">an Urban Strategies Council study</a>. Of those completed foreclosures, 42% fell into the possession not of individual property owners, but of investors.</p> <p>The house on Magnolia Street had sat vacant for more than two years, becoming an eyesore on the block, according to Moms 4 Housing. Wedgewood Properties, a Redondo Beach (Los Angeles county) real estate investment company, purchased it in July at a foreclosure auction for $501,078. The company specializes in house-flipping \u2013 buying oftentimes foreclosed-upon houses cheaply, renovating them and then putting them back on the market for profit. \u201cSpeculators\u201d is the term that Moms 4 Housing uses \u2013 under the hashtag \u201cevict the speculators\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a housing crisis that is being driven by speculators,\u201d Leah Simon-Weisberg, an ACCE attorney who represented Moms 4 Housing in court, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s created a fake market where people who have cash buy properties and then middle-class people can\u2019t buy them. They\u2019re cheating essentially because they\u2019re not buying for housing, they\u2019re buying to sell. Then all these government programs can\u2019t work. People can\u2019t use FHA [Federal Housing Administration] loans because you\u2019re always competing with people who will pay cash.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81fef04939b6ff9bb83180ab4219f585917e0c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81fef04939b6ff9bb83180ab4219f585917e0c51/0_38_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharena Thomas, left, Carroll Fife, center, Dominique Walker, second from right, and Tolani King, right, stand outside the home on 10 December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharena Thomas, left, Carroll Fife, center, Dominique Walker, second from right, and Tolani King, right, stand outside the home on 30 December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Wolffe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes the foreclosed properties these speculators purchase have tenants. These tenants have rights, but more often than not when it\u2019s a company behind the purchase, the process gets dirty. Wedgewood, for example, had <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/examining-wedgewood-a-look-at-the-home-flipping-giant-in-battle-with-homeless-mothers/2208119/\">three separate wrongful eviction lawsuits</a> filed against it in San Francisco.</p> <p>\u201cThey were a key player in the foreclosure crisis. We saw them over and over again harassing tenants, evicting tenants and doing it so they could make greater and greater profit,\u201d said Aimee Ingliss, the power-building program director of Tenants Together. \u201cI personally found it ironic seeing a serial evictor like Wedgewood turn around and say to Moms 4 Housing, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re taking our property,\u2019 when they were a key player in taking the property of black and brown people in Oakland and in other places.\u201d</p> <p>Wedgewood has maintained that while it was sympathetic to the mothers\u2019 plight, the house belongs to the company and this was \u201ca straightforward situation of illegal break-in and illegal occupation\u201d, said a company spokesman, Sam Singer.</p> <p>He disagreed with the assertions that Wedgewood played a role in the current housing crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a company that comes when other people have been foreclosed upon,\u201d he said. \u201cWedgewood has nothing to do with the financial issues of the people whose homes they purchase. They show up like any other individual or company at a public auction and they put a bid on a property. Then through their investment and through their knowledge, they improve the neighborhood.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is they\u2019re a housing creator,\u201d Singer continued. \u201cThese are homes that were previously occupied by people who could not make their payments. These were homes that were in bad states. Wedgewood rehabilitates them and puts them back on the market.\u201d</p> <p>But back on the market for whom, is the question. Throughout the neighborhood surrounding Magnolia Street, a smattering of houses stand out amid the Edwardians and craftsmans, not because of blight and disregard, but because of their overtly modern style. Local residents throughout the Bay Area have become familiar with this sight: homes renovated out of place with the rest of their neighborhoods, with towering \u201cgentri-fences\u201d, the calling card of speculation.</p> <h2>\u2018Shelter is a human right\u2019</h2> <p>Walker chuckled when asked about a neighboring house \u2013 the one with \u201cthe tall security gate\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t want to be a part of the community, but they want to be here.\u201d</p> <p>The housing crisis has robbed her of more than just shelter for her family.</p> <p>\u201cEverything has changed,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody on the street that I grew up on. There\u2019s just no sense of community. All of the friends I went to high school with, they\u2019re everywhere but nobody is here. The gentrification that happened, not only are the people coming into our community, they\u2019re also trying to change the culture. They\u2019re calling the police on churches, on drummers, and this is a part of the community. It\u2019s just not the same.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a1559612351df864d5fe6b2aca37d6c92512f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a1559612351df864d5fe6b2aca37d6c92512f1/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carroll Fife, regional director of Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, left, holds back Walker, distraught over the arrests of her former housemates on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carroll Fife, regional director of Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, left, holds back Walker, distraught over the arrests of her former housemates on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marisa Kendall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the movement, what Walker and Moms 4 Housing are fighting for. In Oakland, 78% of the homeless population reported that their last place of residence before becoming homeless was within county limits. Seventy per cent were black.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about people working, sometimes more than one job, and not being able to get into housing,\u201d Simon-Weisberg said. \u201cOr once they lose their rent-controlled housing, they just can\u2019t get back in. And they get to this place because we have an unregulated housing market that is being manipulated by speculators. It\u2019s like when you have a war going on and you have war speculators and you have people charging 10 times for meat. You don\u2019t get to profit because there\u2019s a war going on.\u201d</p> <p>Walker has been called a squatter, a thief, a criminal. She knows she broke the law in taking possession of the house on Magnolia Street. But they broke the law during the civil rights movement too.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me when people say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s criminal,\u2019 because I know what the true crime is,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe true crime lies in this society that we live in that can normalize people living in the street. Shelter is a human right. It\u2019s needed to protect yourself from the elements, and it shouldn\u2019t be commodified.\u201d</p> <p>After a judge ruled in favor of Wedgewood last Friday, Walker held court on the steps of the house, speaking to the media. \u201cWe are the blueprint for this movement and we are not going to stop fighting,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0400b8cc968ce96668cf6b3c526e47bb6e1dbc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0400b8cc968ce96668cf6b3c526e47bb6e1dbc1/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker\u2019s family in the living room of the house on Magnolia Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walker\u2019s family in the living room of the house on Magnolia Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarahbeth Maney/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a reporter asked if Moms 4 Housing was considering taking over other houses, she coolly responded: \u201cI would encourage folks to do whatever they need to provide shelter for their family.\u201d</p> <p>On the first day at the house, even though it required serious deep cleaning and a power-wash on the outside, Aja, Walker\u2019s five-year-old daughter, couldn\u2019t help but run around, excitedly exclaiming, \u201cThis is my house, this is my home,\u201d Walker said. Aja had plans to paint the outside gold, \u201cwith glitter\u201d, but the inside orange \u2013 \u201cMommy\u2019s favorite color\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Just days before the sheriff\u2019s deputies came, Aja jumped about, playing with Amir in the living room where Walker asked guests to take their shoes off because Amir still crawled at times. \u201cIt means a lot to the children, to have a house, to have a space to call their own,\u201d Walker said.</p> <p>\u201cI think that my children are going to be organizers too,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re not going to be fearful to make change, and to do what\u2019s absolutely necessary to make change.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For almost two months, an unassuming white house on Magnolia Street in Oakland was home for Dominique Walker and her family. Her one-year-old son, Amir, took his first steps in the living room. He said his first words there, too \u2013 \u201cthank you\u201d. Walker\u2019s daughter, Aja, celebrated her fifth birthday in the house. \u201cWe made it a home,\u201d Walker, 34, told the Guardian. They made it their home when they entered the vacant structure on 18 November with the intent to stay, knowing full well that they neither owned the house nor had an agreement to lease it. But a city grappling with a housing crisis that has priced out far too many cannot afford to allow houses like the one on Magnolia to sit vacant, Walker said. In Oakland, more than 15,500 units are vacant, according to the latest US census bureau data, while 4,071 people are homeless. \u201cThis is bigger than me, than this one house,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI never thought I would be in this position. But this is the new face of homelessness. It doesn\u2019t look like what people think homelessness would look like.\u201d In the early hours of Tuesday morning, sheriff deputies rolled up to the white house on Magnolia Street, where hundreds of Walker\u2019s supporters had gathered, knowing that eviction was imminent. Two other homeless mothers staying in the house, as well as two supporters, were arrested. Walker planned to be there when the deputies arrived but was in an interview when they battered down the front door. She and other organizers had made sure beforehand that the children had somewhere else to stay during the chaos. In the aftermath, Walker was teary and tired, but just as resolute as she has been throughout the process. Because when she and her family took possession of that house on Magnolia Street, they did so not just for themselves, not just for other homeless families like them, but to spark a movement \u2013 a movement that their supporters believe will be the next civil rights movement of our time: housing as a human right. \u201cI feel like I should be standing with my sisters,\u201d she told reporters outside the house. \u201cBut I\u2019m standing right here for them right now. This movement is just beginning.\u201d \u2018This is not the Oakland I grew up in\u2019 Walker\u2019s story has become far too common in the Bay Area. She has deep roots in Oakland, with her grandparents moving from Arkansas and Mississippi to make the city their home. After growing up there, she left for Tougaloo College in Mississippi in 2004, where she earned a degree in sociology and met the father of her children. When their relationship fell apart, and she found herself having to flee domestic violence in April, she looked toward Oakland, toward home, only to find there was no one left. Like so many others in the community, her family had been priced out, leaving for places like Vallejo, Sacramento, Antioch and Stockton. She got a job in Oakland organizing for the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), but no place to stay. \u201cI was sleeping at a family member\u2019s house in Stockton, commuting from Stockton to Oakland every day, and bringing the kids to daycare in Berkeley,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried another family member in Antioch, and it didn\u2019t make much of a difference. The commute was even worse.\u201d Walker tried some city programs that gave her vouchers for hotels and attempted to get into a rental assistance program that ended up having its funding cut. At the same time, she began to realize that the issue extended beyond her. Everywhere she turned, she felt like she saw homeless encampment after homeless encampment. In the work she did with ACCE, people kept handing her forms with the address section left blank, sometimes crossing it out to write \u201chomeless\u201d. \u201cThis is not the Oakland that I left, the Oakland that I grew up in,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand the magnitude of what had happened since I left. My family would call and say, \u2018I\u2019m moving to Stockton,\u2019 and I\u2019d think, OK, it just got expensive. I didn\u2019t realize we were in the streets with encampments like that until I came back.\u201d She joined up with other homeless mothers to form Moms 4 Housing. And then they started looking for a vacant house. How speculators fuel the crisis California has a widespread vacant property problem. About 8% of all housing units in the state remain vacant, an estimated 1.2m, according to the US Census Bureau \u2013 though some of those units may be short-term rentals or market-rate apartments with no tenants. Some blame the vacancy problem in part on Proposition 13, a 1978 ballot initiative that capped property taxes at 1% of the home\u2019s value at the time of purchase, and reduced total property taxes by 57%. With such low property taxes, it\u2019s cheaper for some longtime owners and investors to let a property remain vacant while waiting for the market to come out in their favor. And following the foreclosure crisis, in which Oakland was struck particularly hard, more than 10,000 homes changed ownership in the city, many in low-income neighborhoods, according to an Urban Strategies Council study. Of those completed foreclosures, 42% fell into the possession not of individual property owners, but of investors. The house on Magnolia Street had sat vacant for more than two years, becoming an eyesore on the block, according to Moms 4 Housing. Wedgewood Properties, a Redondo Beach (Los Angeles county) real estate investment company, purchased it in July at a foreclosure auction for $501,078. The company specializes in house-flipping \u2013 buying oftentimes foreclosed-upon houses cheaply, renovating them and then putting them back on the market for profit. \u201cSpeculators\u201d is the term that Moms 4 Housing uses \u2013 under the hashtag \u201cevict the speculators\u201d. \u201cWe have a housing crisis that is being driven by speculators,\u201d Leah Simon-Weisberg, an ACCE attorney who represented Moms 4 Housing in court, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s created a fake market where people who have cash buy properties and then middle-class people can\u2019t buy them. They\u2019re cheating essentially because they\u2019re not buying for housing, they\u2019re buying to sell. Then all these government programs can\u2019t work. People can\u2019t use FHA [Federal Housing Administration] loans because you\u2019re always competing with people who will pay cash.\u201d Sometimes the foreclosed properties these speculators purchase have tenants. These tenants have rights, but more often than not when it\u2019s a company behind the purchase, the process gets dirty. Wedgewood, for example, had three separate wrongful eviction lawsuits filed against it in San Francisco. \u201cThey were a key player in the foreclosure crisis. We saw them over and over again harassing tenants, evicting tenants and doing it so they could make greater and greater profit,\u201d said Aimee Ingliss, the power-building program director of Tenants Together. \u201cI personally found it ironic seeing a serial evictor like Wedgewood turn around and say to Moms 4 Housing, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re taking our property,\u2019 when they were a key player in taking the property of black and brown people in Oakland and in other places.\u201d Wedgewood has maintained that while it was sympathetic to the mothers\u2019 plight, the house belongs to the company and this was \u201ca straightforward situation of illegal break-in and illegal occupation\u201d, said a company spokesman, Sam Singer. He disagreed with the assertions that Wedgewood played a role in the current housing crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a company that comes when other people have been foreclosed upon,\u201d he said. \u201cWedgewood has nothing to do with the financial issues of the people whose homes they purchase. They show up like any other individual or company at a public auction and they put a bid on a property. Then through their investment and through their knowledge, they improve the neighborhood. \u201cThe reality is they\u2019re a housing creator,\u201d Singer continued. \u201cThese are homes that were previously occupied by people who could not make their payments. These were homes that were in bad states. Wedgewood rehabilitates them and puts them back on the market.\u201d But back on the market for whom, is the question. Throughout the neighborhood surrounding Magnolia Street, a smattering of houses stand out amid the Edwardians and craftsmans, not because of blight and disregard, but because of their overtly modern style. Local residents throughout the Bay Area have become familiar with this sight: homes renovated out of place with the rest of their neighborhoods, with towering \u201cgentri-fences\u201d, the calling card of speculation. \u2018Shelter is a human right\u2019 Walker chuckled when asked about a neighboring house \u2013 the one with \u201cthe tall security gate\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t want to be a part of the community, but they want to be here.\u201d The housing crisis has robbed her of more than just shelter for her family. \u201cEverything has changed,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody on the street that I grew up on. There\u2019s just no sense of community. All of the friends I went to high school with, they\u2019re everywhere but nobody is here. The gentrification that happened, not only are the people coming into our community, they\u2019re also trying to change the culture. They\u2019re calling the police on churches, on drummers, and this is a part of the community. It\u2019s just not the same.\u201d This is the movement, what Walker and Moms 4 Housing are fighting for. In Oakland, 78% of the homeless population reported that their last place of residence before becoming homeless was within county limits. Seventy per cent were black. \u201cThis is about people working, sometimes more than one job, and not being able to get into housing,\u201d Simon-Weisberg said. \u201cOr once they lose their rent-controlled housing, they just can\u2019t get back in. And they get to this place because we have an unregulated housing market that is being manipulated by speculators. It\u2019s like when you have a war going on and you have war speculators and you have people charging 10 times for meat. You don\u2019t get to profit because there\u2019s a war going on.\u201d Walker has been called a squatter, a thief, a criminal. She knows she broke the law in taking possession of the house on Magnolia Street. But they broke the law during the civil rights movement too. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me when people say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s criminal,\u2019 because I know what the true crime is,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe true crime lies in this society that we live in that can normalize people living in the street. Shelter is a human right. It\u2019s needed to protect yourself from the elements, and it shouldn\u2019t be commodified.\u201d After a judge ruled in favor of Wedgewood last Friday, Walker held court on the steps of the house, speaking to the media. \u201cWe are the blueprint for this movement and we are not going to stop fighting,\u201d she said. When a reporter asked if Moms 4 Housing was considering taking over other houses, she coolly responded: \u201cI would encourage folks to do whatever they need to provide shelter for their family.\u201d On the first day at the house, even though it required serious deep cleaning and a power-wash on the outside, Aja, Walker\u2019s five-year-old daughter, couldn\u2019t help but run around, excitedly exclaiming, \u201cThis is my house, this is my home,\u201d Walker said. Aja had plans to paint the outside gold, \u201cwith glitter\u201d, but the inside orange \u2013 \u201cMommy\u2019s favorite color\u201d, she said. Just days before the sheriff\u2019s deputies came, Aja jumped about, playing with Amir in the living room where Walker asked guests to take their shoes off because Amir still crawled at times. \u201cIt means a lot to the children, to have a house, to have a space to call their own,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think that my children are going to be organizers too,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re not going to be fearful to make change, and to do what\u2019s absolutely necessary to make change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Charities are being told they should invest the billions of pounds they hold in reserve into businesses that chime with their principles, even if they have to take a financial hit. The Charity Commission is moving to promote ethical investment by charities to ensure funds are not used to support businesses that conflict with their own aims or those of their supporters. The shift reflects a growing sensitivity around the climate crisis which extends far beyond environmental charities, and what the commission sees as a changing public mood towards the transparency of the voluntary sector. Risk of poorer returns from ethical investment may no longer be a valid excuse, it suggests. The biggest 5,000 UK charities have a combined investmment of an estimated \u00a3116bn. This includes very large organisations such as the Wellcome Trust or the Church Commissioners, each with billions invested, so many charities may have just a few thousand pounds on the markets. Nevertheless, they face growing scrutiny from supporters. Helen Stephenson, the commission\u2019s chief executive, said financial investments are about more than sums on a balance sheet. \u201cTrustees\u2019 decisions are increasingly seen as reflective of what a charity really stands for. And social attitudes on a range of issues, including around the environment, are shifting,\u201d she stated. However, the move will not head off an imminent legal challenge by a coalition of voluntary sector groups seeking a definitive ruling from the courts on trustees\u2019 duties in respect of ethical investment. The coalition haswelcomed the commission\u2019s initiative, but wants the law updated. Luke Fletcher, a partner at law firm Bates Wells, which is working with the coalition, said charity trustees need clearer guidance about investments, particularly in light of the climate and ecological emergency. \u201cCharities exist to benefit the public, not to advance their own financial interests,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we think a court needs to clarify what is expected of charity trustees in this new situation.\u201d Many donors do not realise that the charities they support hold substantial reserves for contingencies, including costs should the charity cease operations. The bigger investments are held by charitable foundations, which have a duty to make returns on endowments that enable them to make grants and sustain their own work without spending their capital. An inquiry initiated by charity leaders\u2019 group Acevo in 2014 called for greater transparency around investments and action to tackle barriers faced by charities wishing to align them more closely with their stated purpose. This followed a BBC Panorama investigation showing that Comic Relief had invested in arms, tobacco and alcohol companies. The charity has since tightened its rules on investment, including a ban on fossil fuel interests. The commission has previously declined to strengthen its guidance, but now says that while it cannot tell charity boards what conclusions to reach, it wants to put this issue at the forefront of trustees\u2019 minds and encourage and support them \u201cto ask the right questions\u201d. In a blog, the commission says trustees have a duty to maximise financial returns for their charities. But the law is clear that they may take ethical or other non-financial considerations into account. \u201cWe want trustees to feel empowered to respond to these expectations where they can and consider investments that chime with their charity\u2019s purpose, as the law allows,\u201d said Stephenson.

Negri takes up the story: \u201cHe was the wrong choice of playmate for squash because it should not have been a game in which winning became everything and yet with Sergio that was impossible \u2026 At a speed that felt like 100mph that sphere of hard, hot rubber cannoned off the concrete and straight into the centre of my eye.\u201d Arriving for training the next day, Negri \u201cturned up looking as if I had gone 15 rounds with Mike Tyson\u201d. In fact, the Italian had suffered a detached retina, which required laser surgery. Negri went on to score just three more goals that season as Celtic claimed glory on the final day. \u201cIt left a legacy no football player, certainly not a penalty box poacher like me, would ever have wanted,\u201d Negri would write in his autobiography. \u201cI\u2019d been left with difficulties with my peripheral vision, a terrible shortcoming for someone like me, who really only came alive in the 18-yard box and relied on razor-sharp reflexes.\u201d Rich Jones mails in to flag up Thibaut Courtois, who incurred the wrath of Antonio Conte in 2017 when hurting an ankle while playing basketball at a Chelsea promotional shoot. He also notes the dangers of golf in the cases of Swansea City\u2019s Alan Tate (2011) and Kasey Keller (1998): Tate was a passenger in a buggy when it \u201clost control\u201d, breaking his leg, while Keller knocked his front teeth out when taking a golf bag out of his car boot. Of course there is the old Knowledge favourite, Norway defender Svein Grondalen, who missed a World Cup qualifier in 1977 when his training run was abruptly ended by absentmindedly colliding with a moose. And reader David Carr notes that \u201cGary Lineker did a reverse Rory Burns: he missed a football match due to an injury suffered playing cricket\u201d. Lineker explains more in his book Behind Closed Doors with Danny Baker: When I was at Tottenham and living in St John\u2019s Wood, I turned out, occasionally, on days off, for the Cross Arrows, the team made up of employees of the MCC, who have the privilege of playing on the Nursery Ground at Lord\u2019s. I didn\u2019t keep wicket because it would have been a bit unprofessionally reckless of me to subject my leg muscles to all that crouching down. But I wasn\u2019t averse to having a bowl. What could possibly be the harm in it? I found out what the harm could be the afternoon I came in, released the ball and felt a muscle go, high up in my back. It was as though somebody had just lumped me with a baseball bat. The following day I had to wincing to Terry Venables\u2019 office and report what had happened. \u2018I\u2019m afraid I picked up an injury yesterday.\u2019 \u2018How?\u2019 \u2018Playing cricket.\u2019 \u2018Oh, for fuck\u2019s sake \u2026\u2019 Terry was furious and wanted me to swear I wouldn\u2019t play cricket again. I was reluctant to give it up entirely, though. After all, as I pointed out, my contract explicitly prohibited me from riding motorbikes and going skiing. But it didn\u2019t say anything specifically about cricket. \u2018OK then,\u2019 Terry said. \u2018But no bowling.\u2019 Longevity rangers \u201cOn 5 January 2020 Vince Carter became the first NBA player to play in four different decades,\u201d tweets Derek Brosnan. \u201cHave many footballers done this in English top-flight football?

      "body": "<p>Friendly tournaments do not generally warrant much attention. The sponsored mini cup competitions that clubs sign up for in pre-season are a prime example of games that have very little bearing on, well, anything. The US-hosted SheBelieves Cup, though, is seen a little differently generally, as national teams pit themselves against the world champions in their own back yard. This year, for the Lionesses, March\u2019s tournament is about more than bragging rights and the confidence boost of beating the best. Here\u2019s why ...</p> <h2><strong>Lack of competitive action</strong></h2> <p>Phil Neville has said a lack of competitive action is one of the reasons for the Lionesses\u2019 poor form. The team\u2019s World Cup semi-final defeat by the USA kickstarted a run of five games without a win and the team have struggled to shake off their World Cup hangover for meaningless friendlies. The SheBelieves Cup is the closest the team will get to games that matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/13/phil-neville-england-shebelieves-cup-football\">Phil Neville and England relishing tough task of SheBelieves Cup title defence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cup is a critical part of Phil Neville\u2019s plans this year because the manager has only seven months until the Olympics kick off in Japan. As Euro 2021 hosts England have skipped qualifying and there are no Uefa qualifiers for the Olympics \u2013 Team GB qualify because England finished in the top three European nations at the World Cup. By the time a ball is kicked in Tokyo many of Neville\u2019s players will have gone a year without competitive international football. It is not ideal.</p> <h2><strong>Size of Olympic squad</strong></h2> <p>It is vital Neville gets his team out of their slump. Two tight wins in eight games is not good enough for a side aiming to be the best in the world, nor good enough of players fighting for a place on the plane to Japan.</p> <p>Teams took 23 players to the World Cup but Neville can take only 18 to the Olympics. His pool of players is bigger too. In 2012 two Scots, Kim Little and Ifeoma Dieke, joined an overwhelmingly English squad. Now there are more Scottish players in the top Women\u2019s Super League teams than ever. Little is surely on Neville\u2019s shortlist, and her Arsenal teammates Lisa Evans and Jen Beattie, Chelsea\u2019s Erin Cuthbert and Sophie Ingle and Caroline Weir of Manchester City are a few of many whose inclusion would not be questioned. Wales\u2019s Jess Fishlock, should she have recovered from an ACL injury sustained during the NWSL season with Seattle Reign, could stake a late claim.</p> <p>With these players knocking on Neville\u2019s door England\u2019s stars cannot feel safe, particularly given recent results. The Lionesses have a point to prove to their manager, giving an added edge to these friendly ties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcfbb8d4c9d7c1c8c4d567b99c81487593bf8714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcfbb8d4c9d7c1c8c4d567b99c81487593bf8714/0_59_4542_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little and Jen Beattie are among the Scotland players pushing for an Olympic place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little and Jen Beattie are among the Scotland players pushing for an Olympic place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Revenge</strong></h2> <p>Few things should motivate the Lionesses more than the chance to avenge a defeat which rocked them, regardless of the relatively small weight of the tournament. Playing the USA for the first time since their World Cup semi-final exit should shake them into action and put a limp end to 2019 behind them. Though the majority of the USA squad are in the NWSL off-season, Concacaf Olympic qualifiers at the end of January give the world champions the chance to sharpen their claws for the visit of England, Japan and Spain. The majority of the Lionesses, meanwhile, will be close to the business end of a gruelling league campaign which could distract from the task at hand but also means they have top-level competitive football in their legs.</p> <h2><strong>Top test</strong></h2> <p>Sides from further down the Fifa rankings are often happy to stifle and frustrate England. Portugal, Belgium and the Czech Republic revelled in the role of underdog in recent friendlies and tested the still-bruised Lionesses\u2019 fight. Spain, Japan and USA are closer to the level of opposition Team GB hope to be competing with at the latter stages of the Olympics. Japan are the hosts in the summer and if USA do not qualify at the beginning of February then something has gone very wrong. These are teams that will get the ball down, dominate possession and put England under some real pressure but also give them the space to play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9e67229b48d9ccdcfb36ec9a422fc2a0aea004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9e67229b48d9ccdcfb36ec9a422fc2a0aea004/131_206_3241_1945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Neville and England reflect on their World Cup semi-final defeat by USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Neville and England reflect on their World Cup semi-final defeat by USA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Intense travel</strong></h2> <p>The schedule for the SheBelieves Cup is gruelling. The teams play in Orlando, then New Jersey and finally Dallas. That means flights of approximately seven hours and three matches in the space of seven days sandwiched by the long-haul return trip to the US for the three visiting teams.</p> <p>Travel from the hot south to the much cooler north and back adds to the testing environment. But what better way to prepare for the intensity of tournament football on the other side of the world in the summer?</p> <p>It also gives the new high performance coach Dawn Scott, who helped to mastermind the dominance of the US in her 10 years with US Soccer, the chance to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the players at close quarters and in extreme conditions.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 The former England international Eni Aluko has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/15/eni-aluko-retires-from-football-england-striker\">announced her retirement</a> from professional football. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eni-aluko\">The Guardian columnist</a> left Juventus in November after finishing last season as the club\u2019s top scorer and having won Serie A, the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana during her 18-month spell in Italy.

      "bodyText": "Friendly tournaments do not generally warrant much attention. The sponsored mini cup competitions that clubs sign up for in pre-season are a prime example of games that have very little bearing on, well, anything. The US-hosted SheBelieves Cup, though, is seen a little differently generally, as national teams pit themselves against the world champions in their own back yard. This year, for the Lionesses, March\u2019s tournament is about more than bragging rights and the confidence boost of beating the best. Here\u2019s why ... Lack of competitive action Phil Neville has said a lack of competitive action is one of the reasons for the Lionesses\u2019 poor form. The team\u2019s World Cup semi-final defeat by the USA kickstarted a run of five games without a win and the team have struggled to shake off their World Cup hangover for meaningless friendlies. The SheBelieves Cup is the closest the team will get to games that matter. The cup is a critical part of Phil Neville\u2019s plans this year because the manager has only seven months until the Olympics kick off in Japan. As Euro 2021 hosts England have skipped qualifying and there are no Uefa qualifiers for the Olympics \u2013 Team GB qualify because England finished in the top three European nations at the World Cup. By the time a ball is kicked in Tokyo many of Neville\u2019s players will have gone a year without competitive international football. It is not ideal. Size of Olympic squad It is vital Neville gets his team out of their slump. Two tight wins in eight games is not good enough for a side aiming to be the best in the world, nor good enough of players fighting for a place on the plane to Japan. Teams took 23 players to the World Cup but Neville can take only 18 to the Olympics. His pool of players is bigger too. In 2012 two Scots, Kim Little and Ifeoma Dieke, joined an overwhelmingly English squad. Now there are more Scottish players in the top Women\u2019s Super League teams than ever. Little is surely on Neville\u2019s shortlist, and her Arsenal teammates Lisa Evans and Jen Beattie, Chelsea\u2019s Erin Cuthbert and Sophie Ingle and Caroline Weir of Manchester City are a few of many whose inclusion would not be questioned. Wales\u2019s Jess Fishlock, should she have recovered from an ACL injury sustained during the NWSL season with Seattle Reign, could stake a late claim. With these players knocking on Neville\u2019s door England\u2019s stars cannot feel safe, particularly given recent results. The Lionesses have a point to prove to their manager, giving an added edge to these friendly ties. Revenge Few things should motivate the Lionesses more than the chance to avenge a defeat which rocked them, regardless of the relatively small weight of the tournament. Playing the USA for the first time since their World Cup semi-final exit should shake them into action and put a limp end to 2019 behind them. Though the majority of the USA squad are in the NWSL off-season, Concacaf Olympic qualifiers at the end of January give the world champions the chance to sharpen their claws for the visit of England, Japan and Spain. The majority of the Lionesses, meanwhile, will be close to the business end of a gruelling league campaign which could distract from the task at hand but also means they have top-level competitive football in their legs. Top test Sides from further down the Fifa rankings are often happy to stifle and frustrate England. Portugal, Belgium and the Czech Republic revelled in the role of underdog in recent friendlies and tested the still-bruised Lionesses\u2019 fight. Spain, Japan and USA are closer to the level of opposition Team GB hope to be competing with at the latter stages of the Olympics. Japan are the hosts in the summer and if USA do not qualify at the beginning of February then something has gone very wrong. These are teams that will get the ball down, dominate possession and put England under some real pressure but also give them the space to play. Intense travel The schedule for the SheBelieves Cup is gruelling. The teams play in Orlando, then New Jersey and finally Dallas. That means flights of approximately seven hours and three matches in the space of seven days sandwiched by the long-haul return trip to the US for the three visiting teams. Travel from the hot south to the much cooler north and back adds to the testing environment. But what better way to prepare for the intensity of tournament football on the other side of the world in the summer? It also gives the new high performance coach Dawn Scott, who helped to mastermind the dominance of the US in her 10 years with US Soccer, the chance to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the players at close quarters and in extreme conditions. Talking points \u2022 The former England international Eni Aluko has announced her retirement from professional football. The Guardian columnist left Juventus in November after finishing last season as the club\u2019s top scorer and having won Serie A, the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana during her 18-month spell in Italy. The 32-year-old was capped 102 times by the Lionesses and won five FA Cups and three league titles in England. \u2022 Arsenal\u2019s Tabea Kemme has also announced her retirement having struggled to come back from a knee injury which hugely limited her playing time. Before joining the Gunners the 28-year-old played 145 times for German club Turbine Potsdam and won the 2010 Champions League with them. \u2022 England most-capped player Fara Williams has signed a contract extension with Reading to the end of the 2020-21 season. Williams is their joint top scorer with six goals this season. \u2022 Celtic have announced the recruitment of Fran Alonso as their new manager following confirmation that the team would become fully professional and receive significant investment. Alonso, who worked as Ronald Koeman\u2019s first-team assistant at Everton and as Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s technical coach at Southampton, became manager of Lewes women a year ago. The team recorded two wins and two draws in their opening four Championship fixtures but have lost 11 games since and sit eighth in the table. \u2022 Lucy Bronze has been voted 2019 BT England player of the year alongside Jordan Henderson.

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock has signalled that four-hour waiting targets for A&amp;E are likely to be scrapped for the NHS in England after the worst figures on record this winter. The health secretary said it would be better if targets were \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d and the \u201cright targets\u201d, as he defended the NHS\u2019s failure to meet the standard that 95% of patients attending A&amp;E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. The target was put under review by Theresa May\u2019s government and the NHS unveiled plans last March to pilot changes that would prioritise patients with serious conditions while patients with minor problems could wait longer than four hours. A decision about the flagship four-hour target is due to be taken by NHS England in the coming months. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Hancock defended the NHS\u2019s performance even though waiting times in December were the worst since the target began in 2004. Asked if the target would stay, he said: \u201cWe will be judged by the right targets. Targets have to be clinically appropriate. The four-hour target in A&amp;E \u2013 which is often taken as the top way of measuring what\u2019s going on in hospitals \u2013 the problem with that target is that increasingly people are treated on the day and are able to go home.

That was the smallest proportion in any month since the target was created in 2004 and the first time performance has slipped below 70%. In all, 98,452 patients spent at least four hours on a trolley in A&amp;E as they waited for a bed. Hancock said waiting times had deteriorated because there were a million extra A&amp;E visits in 2019 and argued the best way of dealing with this was more money for the NHS. He said the government\u2019s new NHS bill promising an extra \u00a333.9bn a year by 2024 was the biggest cash increase ever. Hancock was challenged over his figures as it is nowhere near the biggest funding injection in real terms when inflation is taken into account. The idea of ending the waiting time target has raised fears it could lead to patients being left untreated for hours and concern that the move might be motivated by political expediency rather than patient safety. It also does not address the issue of thousands of patients forced to wait in corridors and on trolleys because beds cannot be found for them after assessment at A&amp;E. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cChanging the A&amp;E target won\u2019t magic away the problems in our overcrowded hospitals, with patients left on trolleys in corridors for hours and hours. \u201cAny review of targets must be transparent and based on watertight clinical evidence, otherwise patients will think Matt Hancock is trying to move the goalposts to avoid scrutiny of the government\u2019s record. \u201cAfter years of austerity under the Tories, the government\u2019s first priority must be to give the NHS the funding and staff it needs to end the waiting time crisis.\u201d Last year, Dr Taj Hassan, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \u201cIn our expert opinion scrapping the four-hour target will have a near-catastrophic impact on patient safety in many emergency departments that are already struggling to deliver safe patient care in a wider system that is failing badly.\u201d In his round of broadcast interviews, Hancock also claimed the government would solve the longstanding crisis in social care within the year. He told LBC it was \u201cextremely likely\u201d a solution would be found in the next 12 months. \u201cThe PM and I are absolutely determined to solve this problem that has bedevilled people for years. We\u2019ve got the majority. We\u2019ve got to make it happen.\u201d",

The film\u2019s nomination comes amid a growing clamour over police violence in France \u2013 from the injuries at anti-government gilets jaunes demonstrations to deaths after arrests. The president himself, Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday called for new measures to improve police ethics and controls. Ly deliberately set out not to make a film that simply portrayed banlieue versus police, but which explored the difficulties and contradictions of low-paid officers themselves.

      "body": "<p>Pastor Franz Gerber is worried that so many members of his congregation appear to idolise Donald Trump more than they worship Jesus.</p> <p>The preacher at the Praise Chapel Community church was among those who voted for Trump in rural Forest county, Wisconsin, which swung heavily from Barack Obama to the Republican in 2016 and so helped deliver a state that put the president in the White House.</p> <p>Gerber now has some regrets about his vote but what really disturbs him is an unquestioning and even aggressive adulation for Trump within his flock.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like there are many evangelical Christians that are willing to die on the hill of supporting the Republican president, supporting Donald J Trump. And to me, that hill is not worth dying on. No matter who the candidate is, no matter who the individual is,\u201d he said.<em><strong> </strong></em>\u201cTo put all your hope into that individual is a dangerous road. Scripture would warn us against that.\u201d</p> <p>Gerber\u2019s concern reflects a deepening political polarisation within sprawling Forest county, home to about 9,000 people and two Native American reservations across about 1,000 square miles, where friendships are strained over Trump and more than a few people shy from talking politics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fff618cbcd8aa05ff43a0d4370ac93f8da6407c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fff618cbcd8aa05ff43a0d4370ac93f8da6407c8/0_0_5789_3859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Crandon, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downtown Crandon, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Justice/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forest was one of 19 counties in Wisconsin that flipped from the US\u2019s first African American president to one of its most polarising in 2016. Obama took 56% of the votes in Forest county in 2008. Eight years later, Trump won 61%.</p> <p>The large swings across rural Wisconsin squeezed out a narrow victory for Trump in the state by fewer than 23,000 votes, a margin of just 0.77%. Alongside wins in other parts of the midwest, it delivered him the White House even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.</p> <p>This week, the Guardian returns to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-voters-who-swung-to-trump\">three midwest counties</a> in Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan that flipped from Obama to Trump to gauge whether the president can repeat victories he probably has to pull off again in November if he is to be re-elected.</p> <p>For Gerber, a gregarious preacher with a young family, the deciding issue in voting for Trump was abortion and the next president\u2019s nominations to the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had the opportunity again, I may vote differently. I would perhaps vote for someone who\u2019s not part of the major two parties. I would feel that my conscience would feel maybe a little bit cleaner had I gone that route,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s going to get a lot nastier before it gets better\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a23df404723f6a58fc2e57b6e91de6d9e6c029db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a23df404723f6a58fc2e57b6e91de6d9e6c029db/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A billboard referencing divisions in the community due to opioid abuse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A billboard referencing divisions in the community due to opioid abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Justice/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tightness of Trump\u2019s win in Wisconsin four years ago, and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/general_election/\">opinion polls</a> showing that all of the leading Democratic contenders would beat him in the state if the presidential election were held now, albeit it by a narrow margin, has given the president\u2019s opponents hope that in November they can deny him a key part of the puzzle that made up his electoral college victory four years ago.</p> <p>With the Democrats looking to pick up votes in Wisconsin\u2019s major cities, Trump faces the challenge of not only shoring up his existing support in rural areas like Forest county but of finding new votes to offset the loss of women like Jennifer Nery, the former deputy chair of the Republican party in Howard county.</p> <p>Nery backed the president in 2016, in part under pressure from her family, but it did not take her long to regret it. She now considers Trump, among other things, to be unstable and dangerous. Her change of heart led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/09/republicans-divided-at-grassroots-over-trump-we-dont-speak\">a falling-out with a friend</a>, the chair of the county GOP, Terri Burl, and the two stopped speaking.</p> <p>This year, Nery intends to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time no matter who it is, although she leans toward two very different options, Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg.</p> <p>After the Guardian spoke to Nery last year about her regret at voting for Trump in 2016 she was approached by a Democratic political action committee, LocalVoices, to make a television spot saying she lost faith in Trump. The ad is expected to run later this month.</p> <p>But Nery, a farmer who looks after rescue animals, is concerned at how it will be received in Forest county.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a4d81f4580d3efc3d6db6e8f8d37664d2bcabef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a4d81f4580d3efc3d6db6e8f8d37664d2bcabef/0_0_6793_4529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Nery at home on 2 January 2019 in Crandon, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Nery at home on 2 January 2019 in Crandon, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Justice/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about retribution.

Alarmed, she turned to Houston King, the campaign director for LocalVoices.</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018how nasty is this going to get?\u2019 And he says, \u2018it\u2019s going to get a lot nastier before it gets better,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>King offered to cancel the advert.</p> <p>\u201cI said, no, don\u2019t. I want to make sure I can tell my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, I did what I thought I had to do,\u201d said Nery.</p> <p>Nery thinks there are many more disillusioned Trump voters like her in Forest county but they are hiding their true feelings.</p> <p>\u201cI think that they\u2019re afraid of the repercussions of saying how they feel,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not voting for him to be my pastor, my father, my role model\u2019</h2> <p>Terri Burl, the local Republican chair who fell out with Nery, dismisses the notion that the president\u2019s support is in decline in northern Wisconsin. But as his re-election campaign kicks into gear she is focused on a GOP initiative to win over female voters who, polling shows, are more likely to be disillusioned with him and to support impeachment. Part of the initiative, Women for Trump, is targeted at female evangelicals, although Burl is not persuaded that they care about the president\u2019s morality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7b54bbbb96f86dc8a3845c3e233e7352690a573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b54bbbb96f86dc8a3845c3e233e7352690a573/0_0_4016_6016/668.jpg\" alt=\"Terri Burl at home on 2 January 2019 in Crandon, Wisconsin.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terri Burl at home on 2 January 2019 in Crandon, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Justice/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are a lot of church-going people who support him.

I\u2019m voting for him to get some things done in Washington DC that have never been done before.

      "bodyText": "Pastor Franz Gerber is worried that so many members of his congregation appear to idolise Donald Trump more than they worship Jesus. The preacher at the Praise Chapel Community church was among those who voted for Trump in rural Forest county, Wisconsin, which swung heavily from Barack Obama to the Republican in 2016 and so helped deliver a state that put the president in the White House. Gerber now has some regrets about his vote but what really disturbs him is an unquestioning and even aggressive adulation for Trump within his flock. \u201cIt seems like there are many evangelical Christians that are willing to die on the hill of supporting the Republican president, supporting Donald J Trump. And to me, that hill is not worth dying on. No matter who the candidate is, no matter who the individual is,\u201d he said. \u201cTo put all your hope into that individual is a dangerous road. Scripture would warn us against that.\u201d Gerber\u2019s concern reflects a deepening political polarisation within sprawling Forest county, home to about 9,000 people and two Native American reservations across about 1,000 square miles, where friendships are strained over Trump and more than a few people shy from talking politics. Forest was one of 19 counties in Wisconsin that flipped from the US\u2019s first African American president to one of its most polarising in 2016. Obama took 56% of the votes in Forest county in 2008. Eight years later, Trump won 61%. The large swings across rural Wisconsin squeezed out a narrow victory for Trump in the state by fewer than 23,000 votes, a margin of just 0.77%. Alongside wins in other parts of the midwest, it delivered him the White House even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. This week, the Guardian returns to three midwest counties in Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan that flipped from Obama to Trump to gauge whether the president can repeat victories he probably has to pull off again in November if he is to be re-elected. For Gerber, a gregarious preacher with a young family, the deciding issue in voting for Trump was abortion and the next president\u2019s nominations to the supreme court. \u201cIf I had the opportunity again, I may vote differently. I would perhaps vote for someone who\u2019s not part of the major two parties. I would feel that my conscience would feel maybe a little bit cleaner had I gone that route,\u201d he said. \u2018It\u2019s going to get a lot nastier before it gets better\u2019 The tightness of Trump\u2019s win in Wisconsin four years ago, and opinion polls showing that all of the leading Democratic contenders would beat him in the state if the presidential election were held now, albeit it by a narrow margin, has given the president\u2019s opponents hope that in November they can deny him a key part of the puzzle that made up his electoral college victory four years ago. With the Democrats looking to pick up votes in Wisconsin\u2019s major cities, Trump faces the challenge of not only shoring up his existing support in rural areas like Forest county but of finding new votes to offset the loss of women like Jennifer Nery, the former deputy chair of the Republican party in Howard county. Nery backed the president in 2016, in part under pressure from her family, but it did not take her long to regret it. She now considers Trump, among other things, to be unstable and dangerous. Her change of heart led to a falling-out with a friend, the chair of the county GOP, Terri Burl, and the two stopped speaking. This year, Nery intends to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time no matter who it is, although she leans toward two very different options, Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg. After the Guardian spoke to Nery last year about her regret at voting for Trump in 2016 she was approached by a Democratic political action committee, LocalVoices, to make a television spot saying she lost faith in Trump. The ad is expected to run later this month. But Nery, a farmer who looks after rescue animals, is concerned at how it will be received in Forest county. \u201cI\u2019m worried about retribution. My barn is made of wood. People have matches. Do two plus two,\u201d she said. Nery discovered that another disillusioned Trump voter who made a similar political advert in eastern Wisconsin was targeted with a social media smear campaign. Alarmed, she turned to Houston King, the campaign director for LocalVoices. \u201cI said, \u2018how nasty is this going to get?\u2019 And he says, \u2018it\u2019s going to get a lot nastier before it gets better,\u2019\u201d she said. King offered to cancel the advert. \u201cI said, no, don\u2019t. I want to make sure I can tell my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, I did what I thought I had to do,\u201d said Nery. Nery thinks there are many more disillusioned Trump voters like her in Forest county but they are hiding their true feelings. \u201cI think that they\u2019re afraid of the repercussions of saying how they feel,\u201d she said. \u2018I\u2019m not voting for him to be my pastor, my father, my role model\u2019 Terri Burl, the local Republican chair who fell out with Nery, dismisses the notion that the president\u2019s support is in decline in northern Wisconsin. But as his re-election campaign kicks into gear she is focused on a GOP initiative to win over female voters who, polling shows, are more likely to be disillusioned with him and to support impeachment. Part of the initiative, Women for Trump, is targeted at female evangelicals, although Burl is not persuaded that they care about the president\u2019s morality. \u201cThere are a lot of church-going people who support him. People always say, look at how he treats people, his affairs, how he cheated on his wife. People like me say I\u2019m not voting for him to be my pastor, my father, my role model. I\u2019m voting for him to get some things done in Washington DC that have never been done before. We forgive him because of other things,\u201d she said. Burl was for many years employed on a Native American reservation to work with abused women and people with disabilities. She also has had to rely on government assistance in the past. \u201cWhen I moved to Wisconsin and I had a 13-year-old son with me and I was in the middle of a divorce, I needed that helping hand. Food stamps and things for my child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then I got a job here and then I didn\u2019t need the government.\u201d Burl sees no contradiction between her own need for welfare programmes and the Trump administration\u2019s tightening of access to food stamps. She agrees with the move, she said, because the restrictions do not apply to families with children or those with disabilities. \u201cOf course, we want to make sure the children are taken care of,\u201d she said. \u201cBut single adults, you need to get out there and work. Life is hard. Sorry. Life was hard for me too.\u201d In the end though, Burl thinks the election will be decided by an economy that many of Trump\u2019s supporters say is doing well under his administration even if they do not feel prosperous. But there is one economic issue on which Burl acknowledges the president is vulnerable. Trump promised to scrap Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms after insurance premiums surged in some parts of the country, particularly for self-employed people such as farmers. Yet the president has failed to present a credible alternative. Terri Burl acknowledges that the Democrats\u2019 focus on various models for public health insurance \u2013 from Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer system to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s gradual expansion of the federal Medicare programme as an option for all Americans \u2013 puts Trump on the spot and that he needs to come up with a workable plan to reduce costs. Burl is not opposed to a version of public medical insurance. \u201cI think that\u2019s good. Who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d she said. But she describes Sanders\u2019 plan for a single government-run health plan, known as Medicare for All, as \u201cwacky\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to fly,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much more will taxes go up? I would like a real number. If somebody told me my taxes would go up $500 a year for Medicare for All, I might do it. That\u2019s pretty good. But if somebody told me my taxes would go up $10,000 a year, oh no.\u201d \u2018Ultimately, our allegiance is to God, not to a political party\u2019 For Pastor Gerber, it\u2019s not the differences over policy that so disturb him so much as the degree to which the divisive politics of the age has worked its way into his congregation, accentuated by the president\u2019s own confrontational response to disagreement. He sees people who are struggling economically in a county where wages are low and the median household income is about $43,000, not much more than two-thirds of the national average, putting almost religious hope in the president\u2019s promises to revive America\u2019s industries and middle class. Many evangelicals also see the president as a last line of a political defence against what they regard as encroaching liberalism on their religious values from abortion to LGBTQ+ rights. Gerber tries to use his sermons to steer congregants to a less trenchant view of politics by urging them to accept that others may disagree with them. \u201cMany evangelical Christians feel like they have to now fight for the way things used to be or they need to fight for what they feel is biblically true. My concern is that sometimes when we get so busy fighting for certain causes we get lost in spraying fire at other people with our words to the point we lose track of what we\u2019re called to do,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, our allegiance is to God, not to a political party, not to a figure within that political party.\u201d But that does not always go down well within a congregation Gerber describes as overwhelmingly Republican with a sprinkling of Democrats. \u201cThere is such a defence of the current president by many evangelical Christians to the point of, even as a pastor, if I were to criticise and say, boy, I just didn\u2019t like something, people would get very upset about that.\u201d One Sunday, Gerber tried to bring his congregants together with a biblical story about Jesus overcoming differences among his disciples.

      "bodyText": "The government minister who runs the NDIS has claimed no one has died waiting for the scheme, despite the agency saying more than 1,200 people have died before they received a scheme plan and the prime minister describing those same figures as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. In a response to a question on notice, the National Disability Insurance Agency told Senate estimates that between 2016 and 2019 1,279 people died \u201cbetween submitting an access request and receiving supports under the National Disability Insurance Scheme\u201d. But quizzed about the figures, which were first published by News Corp on Wednesday morning, Stuart Robert told 2GB they were \u201cnot even remotely correct\u201d and that \u201cno one has passed away waiting for the NDIS\u201d. \u201cThe reporting today that people have tragically passed away, the fact that they\u2019ve passed away of course is correct, but no one has passed away waiting for the NDIS,\u201d Robert said. \u201cThose figures are from July 2016 through to mid-2019. From three and half years old to six months old.\u201d Robert said that those who had died \u201cwere people who were getting support from the states and territories as they transitioned to the NDIS\u201d. The radio station 2GB subsequently reported that Robert had \u201cdenied reports more than a thousand people have died waiting for packages\u201d and quoted him saying \u201cno one has passed away waiting for the NDIS\u201d. Although those who received state-funded disability supports continued to benefit from them while the states and territories were transitioned onto the scheme, the individual-needs-based funding provided under the NDIS is praised by the government and disability groups as tailored and generally more generous. Guardian Australia asked Robert\u2019s office how it was true that \u201cno one had passed away waiting for the NDIS\u201d when the agency itself had said that 1,279 people died after making an access request and before receiving a plan. His spokesman said: \u201cThe Minister was referring to the fact that the NDIS was designed to ensure people with disability transitioning to the new Scheme from state or Commonwealth programs over the last three years continued to receive their existing disability-related supports until participants received an approved NDIS plan.\u201d Pressed if he had misspoken, and also whether he stood by the claim that the figures provided by the agency and published by News Corp were \u201cnot remotely correct\u201d, the spokesman added: \u201cThe Minister does not dispute the figures his own agency has provided, he disputes how they were framed in today\u2019s media.\u201d Of the 1,279 people who died waiting for an NDIS plan, 369 died in the first nine months of 2019. The full scheme was operational in all states in July 2019, according to the figures provided to Senate estimates. The 1,200 who died before they received an NDIS plan included 35 children aged under six and 30 children between the ages of seven and 18. Asked about the figures at a press conference on Wednesday morning, Scott Morrison did not dispute them, but said the government had adopted measures that were successfully reducing waiting times. But he added: \u201cMy answer to that is yes, I think that was unacceptable. \u201cI should stress that during that time it was also during a very significant ramp-up of the transition of people from state-based services to commonwealth services.\u201d The National Disability Insurance Agency declined to comment, referring inquiries to the minister\u2019s office.",

      "bodyText": "When a Canadian business magnate sent off a flurry of tweets blaming Donald Trump for provoking the crisis which eventually led to the accidental shooting-down of a Ukrainian passenger jet, the posts quickly went viral. Michael McCain, the billionaire CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, used the company\u2019s branded Twitter account to describe the US president as a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and described the 176 passengers and crew as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from Trump\u2019s \u201cirresponsible, dangerous, ill-conceived behaviour\u201d. It was a potentially risky move for a company employing 24,000 people and with operations in the United States, but the thread was liked more than 70,000 times on Twitter \u2013 suggesting that his comments had struck a nerve in Canada. Iran has admitted accidentally shooting down the plane, which was carrying 57 Canadian citizens. However, McCain\u2019s tweets highlight one strand of Canada\u2019s response to the disaster \u2013 the latest in a string of events in which the country has found itself caught up in feuds between the Trump administration and other countries. Justin Trudeau seemed to acknowledge such frustrations on Monday, when he said that the victims of the disaster would still be alive were it not for a recent crisis partly triggered by Trump\u2019s decision to kill Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. \u201cI think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families,\u201d he said. As a close ally of the US \u2013 and its largest trading partner \u2013 Canada has always been especially vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of policy decisions made in Washington DC. Such sensitivity has only heightened under the current administration. \u201cCanadians might not be holding Donald Trump directly responsible for this attack, but I believe there is increasing concern among Canadians that we are the collateral damage in erratic decisions made by the Trump administration,\u201d said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Carleton University. \u201cThere\u2019s no real forethought from this administration in how policy might affect allies. And really there\u2019s no afterthought to how they might ameliorate the damage that comes from these situations.\u201d Canada was one of the first victims of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy, when the US slapped tariffs on aluminum and steel imports on the grounds of national security. And since then, the pain has only escalated. In August 2018, Canada prompted a furious response from Saudi Arabia after it criticized the kingdom\u2019s stance on human rights. Saudi Arabia expelled Canadian diplomats, recalled medical students and cut off trade \u2013 but the US refrained from comment. \u201cThe fact that the Trump administration didn\u2019t defend us, was probably the first indication that this might be a serious challenge for Canada,\u201d said Carvin. In December 2018, Canada responded to a US arrest warrant and detained Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on suspicion of fraud. Bound by an extradition treaty between the two nations, Canada had no choice, but the consequences have been disastrous for the country. Shortly afterwards, two Canadian citizens \u2013 Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor \u2013 were arrested in China, a move widely viewed as retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest. Both men remain in custody. Relations between China and Canada remain in the deep freeze, and a free trade deal \u2013 worth billions of dollars \u2013 was shelved. While Trudeau has spoken with Trump about the pain Canada has suffered \u2013 especially around the two detained citizens \u2013 little progress has been made in freeing Spavor and Kovrig. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful if the president of the United States says he\u2019ll say something to China and then doesn\u2019t follow through because he\u2019s more interested in getting a trade deal than he is in freeing the two Canadians,\u201d said Carvin. \u201cChina knows this and can use this as leverage against us.\u201d With his seemingly freewheel approach to policy, Trump has often left Canada officials scrambling to assess the impacts of his decisions. \u201cWe can predict the coming consequences of many of his actions, massive and momentous and obvious,\u201d wrote former diplomat Scott Gilmore in a Maclean\u2019s magazine article linking the crash to US policy in the Middle East. \u201cBut, in our inherently chaotic and unstable world, the impact of others, like withdrawing from the Paris agreement, are less immediate and recognizable and it may take us decades to fully appreciate the tornadoes to come.\u201d With much of the focus within Canada dedicated to navigating US foreign policy and not on its own, Canada has sidelined its own priorities, including pursuing a security council seat at the UN. \u201cWe have benefited so much from the protection of the United States,\u201d said Carvin. \u201cBut we\u2019re starting to see what the world looks like when that protection isn\u2019t there.\u201d",

But, it warned, \u201cit would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal\u2019s impact\u201d.</p> <p>In Tuesday\u2019s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that \u201crecent extreme weather events\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/whitepaper/bii-physical-climate-risks-april-2019.pdf\">the implications for investment portfolios \u2013 stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events \u2013 have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp</a>\u201d.</p> <p>No longer. Now BlackRock\u2019s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable \u201cwhere we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues\u201d. He added that \u201cthe company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies\u201d last year.</p> <p>There are still worries for environmentalists. <a href=\"https://www.majorityaction.us/\">Majority Action</a>\u2019s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock\u2019s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on \u201cintegrating and reporting on sustainability\u201d is not the same as calling for immediate action.</p> <p>\u201cBlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: \u2018Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align your operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,\u2019\u201d Kasargod-Staub said.</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what BlackRock said \u2013 they said they\u2019re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Kasargod-Staub pointed to this quote from BlackRock, directed at companies it invests in:<em> </em>\u201cThis should include your plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures] guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Kasargod-Staub.</p> <p>Whether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against expecting a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I\u2019d like to be proved wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.\u201d</p> <p>Still, McKibben said: \u201cFor all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it\u2019s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, \u2018Huh, there\u2019s something to this climate stuff.

Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&amp;P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claimed. \u201cWe have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,\u201d BlackRock said in a statement to the Guardian at the time. But, it warned, \u201cit would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal\u2019s impact\u201d. In Tuesday\u2019s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that \u201crecent extreme weather events\u201d and \u201cthe implications for investment portfolios \u2013 stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events \u2013 have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp\u201d. No longer. Now BlackRock\u2019s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable \u201cwhere we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues\u201d. He added that \u201cthe company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies\u201d last year. There are still worries for environmentalists. Majority Action\u2019s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock\u2019s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on \u201cintegrating and reporting on sustainability\u201d is not the same as calling for immediate action. \u201cBlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: \u2018Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align your operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,\u2019\u201d Kasargod-Staub said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what BlackRock said \u2013 they said they\u2019re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,\u201d he added. Kasargod-Staub pointed to this quote from BlackRock, directed at companies it invests in: \u201cThis should include your plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures] guidelines.\u201d \u201cThink about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Kasargod-Staub. Whether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against expecting a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral. \u201cI don\u2019t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I\u2019d like to be proved wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.\u201d Still, McKibben said: \u201cFor all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it\u2019s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, \u2018Huh, there\u2019s something to this climate stuff. Better pay attention.\u2019\u201d",

When President Donald Trump signed a 2017 executive order that reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase\u2013Escalante national monuments by nearly 2m acres, he said the move was supported in the state of Utah and by the local county where the monuments were located. On the ground, however, that opposition didn\u2019t add up. San Juan county, Utah, is majority Native American and includes parts of the Navajo Nation\u2019s and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe\u2019s reservations \u2013 both tribes officially support the protection of Bears Ears. Through gerrymandering, the majority Native county maintained a majority white county commission, where Native views were outnumbered \u2013 until last year. The Navajo Nation brought a lawsuit against San Juan accusing the county of racial gerrymandering under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The tribe won. The county was forced to redraw its election maps and in the fall of 2018, for the first time ever, elected a majority Native commission. The county commission now, officially, supports the protection of Bears Ears. Today, the Navajo Nation is still fighting for political representation, but with a different tool: the US census, which will take place this year. Without census data that proved the county\u2019s election maps reduced the voting power of Native residents, the tribe would not have been able to win its suit. Today, census data also determines tribal citizens\u2019 representation in Congress, state and county elections, and even the Nation\u2019s own tribal council.

In a sculptural depiction of the US president\u2019s head by the Australian artist Callum Morton, which popped up in Ballarat on Wednesday, not much. Instead, the piece of public art \u2013 three metres high, made from fibreglass, resin and timber \u2013 is an empty space that viewers of the work can climb in and inhabit for themselves. A combination of sculpture and architecture, the outdoor work \u2013 titled Monument #32: Helter Shelter \u2013 emerges from the ground, and contains a shelter fitted with bench seating, and decorated by inferno flames. Since it debuted at the Barangaroo precinct in Sydney, it\u2019s been popular on Instagram and has travelled to Queensland. On Wednesday it debuted in Victoria, at Alfred Deakin Place behind the Art Gallery of Ballarat. Morton, a professor of art at Monash University who has been exhibited at Australia\u2019s major art institutions and around the world, made Monument #32 in response to our current political times. \u201cI am interested \u2013 actually I am appalled \u2013 by these hard-right, alt-right figures,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cI am aware that this is an ugly work, it is a vulgar work \u2013 a bit like him. The work is very confronting.\u201d Friends of Morton\u2019s have threatened to tip it into Sydney Harbour, he said. Morton spoke to the Guardian while driving through bushfire smoke haze on his way to Ballarat for the work\u2019s opening event. \u201c[The piece is] now going out in the context of the fires.

Fire grounds in the Snowy Mountains and south coast regions of NSW may get strong falls.</p> <p>Ash washed into rivers may lead to algal blooms that could cause fish kills.

      "bodyText": "Forecast heavy rains across bushfire-hit areas of Victoria and New South Wales may cause mass fish deaths as ash and sediment is washed into rivers, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has warned. Central parts of Victoria and and NSW are forecast to see falls up to 80mm between Thursday and Sunday, some of it in areas recovering from bushfires. Fire grounds in the Snowy Mountains and south coast regions of NSW may get strong falls. Ash washed into rivers may lead to algal blooms that could cause fish kills. Thousands of fish have already died in a northern NSW river when ash from firegrounds washed into the waterway. Experts say the ash is not likely to affect drinking water, except in some smaller catchments. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority described the forecast falls as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d. The authority\u2019s executive director of river operations, Andrew Reynolds, told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe would not be surprised to see fish deaths in streams that are picking up ash and sediments from the rainfall.\u201d He said the ash and sediments could reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, but the impacts would depend on where the rain fell, and the intensity of downpours. Bushfires had burned \u201capproaching half\u201d of the catchment of the Hume Dam, he said, which is a main water storage for the Murray-Darling system. \u201cThe fire map shows us the extent, but it doesn\u2019t mean everything has burned. But it\u2019s a large area and almost certainly we will see impacts on water quality following the rain forecast in coming days.\u201d He said while the rain was welcome in helping firefighters, having ash and sediment running into waterways was \u201cthe last thing our fire- and drought-ravaged communities need right now\u201d. Water running off the fire grounds could also have picked up contaminants from burned buildings. Reynolds said: \u201cThese catchments are very dry. Some of the rain will run off but we won\u2019t expect to see large inflows given how dry things have been.\u201d Anyone concerned about local water supplies should contact their water authority, he said. Dry, hot and windy conditions had meant water quality had continued to worsen, with nine \u201cred alerts\u201d for blue-green algae raised in the past two weeks, bringing the total across NSW and Victoria to 20. Prof Stuart Khan, an environmental engineer and water expert at the University of New South Wales, said the main Sydney water catchment was a concern, although he did not expect immediate problems. He said: \u201cWe are in a vulnerable position with all that ash sitting on a catchment that\u2019s unstable and prone to erosion that could include landslides and trees being dislodged. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting extreme rainfall, but if any places do and they\u2019re areas that have been burned, then we\u2019d expect ash and soil running into waterways.\u201d He said adding nutrients to the water would increase the risk of toxic blue-green algal blooms. Increased nutrients and ash could also cause problems for treatment plants, especially smaller ones, which would need to work harder, slowing down productivity. But he said Sydney should not expect impacts \u201cto the water coming out of customers\u2019 taps\u201d. WaterNSW said about 320,000 hectares had burned in the catchment for Sydney\u2019s main water supply, the Warragamba Dam, where inflows are at record-low levels. Devices to limit ash entering the dam had already been installed, but the WaterNSW CEO, David Harris, said the rainfall was not expected to be high enough to cause problems. \u201cTherefore we do not anticipate a water quality problem over the coming week, however we will need to carefully manage the catchment over the coming years in order to protect our water supply from these sorts of impacts. \u201cWe are taking a range of precautionary measures on site, including the deployment of silt curtains and floating booms at key water inflow points to the dam storage, additional monitoring and modelling, and planning with other agencies.\u201d Since November and December, the NSW Department of Primary Industries has been receiving reports of thousands of fish dying in the upper and middle reaches of the Macleay River near Kempsey in northern NSW. Australian bass, freshwater mullet and eel-tailed catfish have been among the species killed. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said the fisheries department was still receiving reports of fish deaths in the river. \u201cCurrent rainfall events are adding ash from the extensive bushfires throughout the region into local catchments, as well as other organic matter and sediment. This can cause rapid drops to oxygen levels in the water. \u201cDPI Fisheries holds concerns around the potential impact on fish and other aquatic organisms over the coming weeks, as predicted rainfall is likely to mobilise sediment and ash in coastal waterways.\u201d Residents were encouraged to report any fish deaths or observations to the Fishers Watch hotline on 1800 043 536.",

The facts of the case \u2013 a brutal execution-style murder of his fiancee\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend at a gravel pit down the street from his house \u2013 were irreconcilable with the image of an all-American sports figure. Hernandez, then 23, had just signed a $40m contract with one of the most successful sports organizations in the US, lived with his fiancee and baby daughter, and performed seamless feats of athleticism under the national spotlight every Sunday.</p> <p>But investigators soon uncovered a strange, violent shadow to the amiable football star: evidence he was responsible for an unsolved 2012 drive-by shooting in downtown Boston of two men, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, who allegedly spilled a drink on Hernandez at a club by accident; violent outbursts from his time on the national championship team at the University of Florida, swept under the rug; a former friend who testified Hernandez shot him in the face and left him for dead in a parking lot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kr8j2YNE3Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Kr8j2YNE3Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, now available on Netflix, attempts to sew together his double life into a single, coherent narrative, or at least a more contextualized one. The three-part docuseries offers the most comprehensive visual account yet of the Hernandez story, which has inspired by now a library of content, from day-by-day reports at his two trials (he was acquitted of the drive-by in 2017 with the help of the celebrity attorney Jose Baez), to the Boston Globe\u2019s critically acclaimed podcast Gladiator, which, like the series, examines Hernandez\u2019s larger environment and personal history \u2013 his sexuality, abusive upbringing, massive celebrity and postmortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head injuries. (Hernandez killed himself in prison in April 2017.)</p> <p>Director Geno McDermott began working on what at the time was a documentary feature on Hernandez in January 2017, before the start of his second trial. His partners on the project, journalists Kevin Armstrong and Dan Wetzel, both executive producers, had been developing a book on Hernandez since his first trial in 2015; Armstrong had been covering Hernandez since his high school days in Bristol, Connecticut. Their initial film, My Perfect World: The Aaron Hernandez Story, premiered at Doc NYC in 2018. But as fascination with the Hernandez case continued and more information emerged \u2013 specifically, confirmation of Hernandez\u2019s closeted sexuality (he publicly dated women and privately, according to several participants in the series, had sex with men) and of CTE \u2013 McDermott and his team realized the story demanded a longer series. \u201cI always expected this to end,\u201d he said of the Hernandez saga. \u201cAnd it just never ends. There\u2019s constantly new developments, new books coming out, new people talking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5041b1eea853e7bfe63239f2ed575adc3beb15ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5041b1eea853e7bfe63239f2ed575adc3beb15ae/0_0_3456_2556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Hernandez listens during his double murder trial in Suffolk Superior Court, in Boston, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Hernandez listens during his double murder trial in Suffolk superior court, in Boston, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elise Amendola/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Killer Inside attempts, over the course of three hour-long episodes, to untangle the many supercharged cultural threads undergirding Hernandez\u2019s life, among them: the death of his domineering and allegedly abusive father when he was 16, the pressure to conform to a hypermasculine sports ideal, the double life of closeted sexuality, the allure of guns as an assertion of masculinity, the unwavering fanaticism of college football, the impunity permitted by fame, the prioritization of winning football games over literally anything else. Perhaps, it hopes, there\u2019s clear \u201cwhy\u201d at the center of all this.</p> <p>It\u2019s a futile project, as the production team acknowledges both in and outside the series; Hernandez is no longer around to offer insight. His closest confidante, cousin Tanya Singleton, died of breast cancer in 2015. The production team reached out to \u201chundreds\u201d of people who could speak to Hernandez\u2019s life, according to McDermott, but his mother (with whom Hernandez was mostly estranged), brother and fiancee all declined to participate in the series.</p> <p>Instead, the series relies on testimony from \u201ca tapestry of perspectives \u2026 from every walk of life in which Aaron was involved\u201d, said McDermott, including: Dennis SanSoucie, Hernandez\u2019s high school quarterback and secret lover for much of his adolescence, and his father, who was unaware of his son\u2019s relationship with the star tight end until after Hernandez\u2019s death; former Patriots offensive tackle Ryan O\u2019Callaghan, who speaks to the pressure to stay silent as a gay man in football; Wetzel, Armstrong and other journalists covering the case; and friends of Lloyd, who provide a much-needed portrait of the lives Hernandez ended and the loved ones they left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"123540367f42f176e0f9c9b2132c766c724a1707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/123540367f42f176e0f9c9b2132c766c724a1707/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Hernandez in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Hernandez in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In lieu of Hernandez\u2019s own explanation, the series also works in long excerpts of his phone calls from prison to his mother, old teammates, Singleton, his fiancee and others.

      "bodyText": "Even by the standards of America\u2019s obsession with stories of spectacular falls from grace, the trajectory of Aaron Hernandez, a star New England Patriots football player turned convicted murderer, was particularly steep and unusually compelling \u2013 a senseless, horrific collapse unfolding in real time. Three years before \u201cfake news\u201d became an ominous catch-all, Hernandez\u2019s summer 2013 arrest for the murder of Odin Lloyd at his mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts \u2013 a news frenzy scene replayed in the first minutes of Netflix\u2019s new series Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez \u2013 seemed to be just that: unreal. The facts of the case \u2013 a brutal execution-style murder of his fiancee\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend at a gravel pit down the street from his house \u2013 were irreconcilable with the image of an all-American sports figure. Hernandez, then 23, had just signed a $40m contract with one of the most successful sports organizations in the US, lived with his fiancee and baby daughter, and performed seamless feats of athleticism under the national spotlight every Sunday. But investigators soon uncovered a strange, violent shadow to the amiable football star: evidence he was responsible for an unsolved 2012 drive-by shooting in downtown Boston of two men, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, who allegedly spilled a drink on Hernandez at a club by accident; violent outbursts from his time on the national championship team at the University of Florida, swept under the rug; a former friend who testified Hernandez shot him in the face and left him for dead in a parking lot. Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, now available on Netflix, attempts to sew together his double life into a single, coherent narrative, or at least a more contextualized one. The three-part docuseries offers the most comprehensive visual account yet of the Hernandez story, which has inspired by now a library of content, from day-by-day reports at his two trials (he was acquitted of the drive-by in 2017 with the help of the celebrity attorney Jose Baez), to the Boston Globe\u2019s critically acclaimed podcast Gladiator, which, like the series, examines Hernandez\u2019s larger environment and personal history \u2013 his sexuality, abusive upbringing, massive celebrity and postmortem diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head injuries. (Hernandez killed himself in prison in April 2017.) Director Geno McDermott began working on what at the time was a documentary feature on Hernandez in January 2017, before the start of his second trial. His partners on the project, journalists Kevin Armstrong and Dan Wetzel, both executive producers, had been developing a book on Hernandez since his first trial in 2015; Armstrong had been covering Hernandez since his high school days in Bristol, Connecticut. Their initial film, My Perfect World: The Aaron Hernandez Story, premiered at Doc NYC in 2018. But as fascination with the Hernandez case continued and more information emerged \u2013 specifically, confirmation of Hernandez\u2019s closeted sexuality (he publicly dated women and privately, according to several participants in the series, had sex with men) and of CTE \u2013 McDermott and his team realized the story demanded a longer series. \u201cI always expected this to end,\u201d he said of the Hernandez saga. \u201cAnd it just never ends. There\u2019s constantly new developments, new books coming out, new people talking.\u201d Killer Inside attempts, over the course of three hour-long episodes, to untangle the many supercharged cultural threads undergirding Hernandez\u2019s life, among them: the death of his domineering and allegedly abusive father when he was 16, the pressure to conform to a hypermasculine sports ideal, the double life of closeted sexuality, the allure of guns as an assertion of masculinity, the unwavering fanaticism of college football, the impunity permitted by fame, the prioritization of winning football games over literally anything else. Perhaps, it hopes, there\u2019s clear \u201cwhy\u201d at the center of all this. It\u2019s a futile project, as the production team acknowledges both in and outside the series; Hernandez is no longer around to offer insight. His closest confidante, cousin Tanya Singleton, died of breast cancer in 2015. The production team reached out to \u201chundreds\u201d of people who could speak to Hernandez\u2019s life, according to McDermott, but his mother (with whom Hernandez was mostly estranged), brother and fiancee all declined to participate in the series. Instead, the series relies on testimony from \u201ca tapestry of perspectives \u2026 from every walk of life in which Aaron was involved\u201d, said McDermott, including: Dennis SanSoucie, Hernandez\u2019s high school quarterback and secret lover for much of his adolescence, and his father, who was unaware of his son\u2019s relationship with the star tight end until after Hernandez\u2019s death; former Patriots offensive tackle Ryan O\u2019Callaghan, who speaks to the pressure to stay silent as a gay man in football; Wetzel, Armstrong and other journalists covering the case; and friends of Lloyd, who provide a much-needed portrait of the lives Hernandez ended and the loved ones they left behind. In lieu of Hernandez\u2019s own explanation, the series also works in long excerpts of his phone calls from prison to his mother, old teammates, Singleton, his fiancee and others. The audio clips, culled from hundreds of calls the production team obtained through Foia (Freedom of Information Act) requests, \u201cgive everyone a look at who Aaron was\u201d, said McDermott. Hernandez is at turns despairing and jovial, weirdly at ease in his jail life, seemingly unconcerned with his crimes. Wetzel doesn\u2019t have a single answer as to what went horribly wrong with Hernandez. \u201cI think it was a perfect cocktail of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were many, many times when this could have gotten a walk back or he could\u2019ve gotten off the rails. He just never had the help or just made terrible decisions.\u201d Over six-plus years of covering Hernandez, however, \u201cyou certainly saw a guy who throughout his life projected outwardly what he thought people wanted to see, whether it\u2019s buying the big house or having a daughter, having a fiancee, the tattoos, whatever it was\u201d, said Wetzel. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he spent his whole life searching for where he belonged and never found it.\u201d McDermott said he hopes people walk away from the series, first and foremost, with a deeper understanding of the context around Hernandez\u2019s descent into violence, as well as perspective to continue conversations about sexuality in sports-dominated settings and the damage of CTE. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting what\u2019s there, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re offering an opinion,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do want people to have conversations about it.\u201d The series is ultimately unsuccessful in explaining what is probably unexplainable: what turned Hernandez from a popular jock into a cold-blooded killer.

A study in <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7575\">Madison, Wisconsin</a> found that urban temperatures can be 5% cooler with 40% tree cover. Green roofs with high vegetation density <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150327090753.htm\">can cool buildings by up to 60%</a>.

Watson calls for a focus on permaculture: self-sustaining ecosystems. \u201cIf it\u2019s an urban forest,\u201d she says, \u201cperhaps it\u2019s in the centre of the city, perhaps it\u2019s on the periphery, or it could be an interior environment \u2013 an atrium designed to have a complex ecosystem that\u2019s also agriculturally productive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"196271896aeaf80116516e5b020a3c3ab06cea91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/196271896aeaf80116516e5b020a3c3ab06cea91/0_230_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Could living root bridges similar to those used by the Khasi hill tribe be grown in urban settings?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could living root bridges similar to those used by the Khasi hill tribe be grown in urban settings?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amos Chapple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are hundreds of nature-based technologies that have never been explored. For example, Watson envisions stunning urban uses for the living root bridges of the Khasi hill tribe: \u201cThey could be grown to reduce the urban heat island effect by increasing canopy cover along streets, with roots trained into trusses that integrate with the architecture of the street \u2013 in essence, removing the distinction between tree and building.\u201d They could even retain their original use during seasonal floods \u2013 living, physical bridges over the water. </p> <p>In April, Greta Thunberg and Guardian columnist George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/sep/19/greta-thunberg-and-george-monbiot-make-short-film-on-solutions-to-the-climate-crisis-video\">made a rallying video</a> calling for more trees and wetlands and plant cover to tackle the climate crisis. Cities can be part of this push. </p> <p>The idea of smart cities is born of what Watson describes as \u201cthe same human superiority-complex that thinks nature should be controlled\u201d. What\u2019s missing is symbiosis. \u201cLife on Earth is based upon symbiosis,\u201d Watson says. She suggests we replace the saying \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d with \u201csurvival of the most symbiotic\u201d. Not as catchy, perhaps.

Rotterdam has already introduced a floating forest and farm, and is developing plans for a sustainable floating city. As for dumb transport, there can be no doubt that walking or cycling are superior to car travel over short urban distances: zero pollution, zero carbon emissions, free exercise. And there\u2019s a dumb solution to the spread of air conditioning, one of the greatest urban energy guzzlers: more plants. A study in Madison, Wisconsin found that urban temperatures can be 5% cooler with 40% tree cover. Green roofs with high vegetation density can cool buildings by up to 60%. Or you could just think like a bug: architects are mimicking the natural cooling airflows of termite burrows. Mick Pearce\u2019s 350,000 sq ft Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, completed in the 1990s, is still held up as a paragon of dumb air conditioning: all it needs are fans, and uses a tenth of the energy of the buildings next door. A few token green walls and trees won\u2019t do it. Watson calls for a focus on permaculture: self-sustaining ecosystems. \u201cIf it\u2019s an urban forest,\u201d she says, \u201cperhaps it\u2019s in the centre of the city, perhaps it\u2019s on the periphery, or it could be an interior environment \u2013 an atrium designed to have a complex ecosystem that\u2019s also agriculturally productive.\u201d There are hundreds of nature-based technologies that have never been explored. For example, Watson envisions stunning urban uses for the living root bridges of the Khasi hill tribe: \u201cThey could be grown to reduce the urban heat island effect by increasing canopy cover along streets, with roots trained into trusses that integrate with the architecture of the street \u2013 in essence, removing the distinction between tree and building.\u201d They could even retain their original use during seasonal floods \u2013 living, physical bridges over the water. In April, Greta Thunberg and Guardian columnist George Monbiot made a rallying video calling for more trees and wetlands and plant cover to tackle the climate crisis. Cities can be part of this push. The idea of smart cities is born of what Watson describes as \u201cthe same human superiority-complex that thinks nature should be controlled\u201d. What\u2019s missing is symbiosis. \u201cLife on Earth is based upon symbiosis,\u201d Watson says. She suggests we replace the saying \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d with \u201csurvival of the most symbiotic\u201d. Not as catchy, perhaps. But smarter.

His tie, as awful as it was, was the most interesting thing up there on that stage. It\u2019s almost fascinating how boring it all was, given how we almost went to war with Iran just a week ago, and how close we are to procedurally removing a president from office.</p> \n<p>Look. We\u2019re all tired of this. Every time they broadcast one of these debates <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/20/latest-democratic-debate-had-lowest-viewership-yet/\">the viewership drops</a> by a lot. The candidates are tired of this, of being asked to explain within 40 seconds complicated policy and ideology. The viewership is clearly tired of being asked to decide the future of our country based on 40 seconds of information. The only people who are excited are the moderators, who get to have their big moment on cable television. What fun it must be for them to talk over someone explaining how we might lower insulin prices enough so that people don\u2019t have to ration lifesaving treatment to ask how they feel about the latest Trump tweet.</p> \n<p>The only real energy of the night was unfortunate. Once CNN moderator Abby Phillip got the opportunity to ask Bernie Sanders whether or not he said, as dubiously reported this week, a woman could not be elected president \u2013 which he strongly denied \u2013 she immediately turned to Elizabeth Warren to ask how it felt to be told by Bernie Sanders that a woman could not be president.</p> \n<p>It was gross, like something from a new West Wing script. All that was missing were the stringed instruments bringing a sentimental surge to Warren\u2019s answer. It was also the only part of the evening where anyone felt present. Biden might as well have been wandering the stage aimlessly, Buttigieg was vacant and hesitant, and Sanders never does well when asked to pander with diversity language. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the moment landed with the electorate, or if it played as cheap to voters as it did in my living room.</p> \n<p>We all thought that with fewer candidates on a smaller stage, we might be able to hash out some real topics with some real seriousness.

      "bodyText": "\u2018So boring \u2013 save for a gross exchange between Sanders and Warren\u2019 This was a debate where people talked about \u201cliteral tornadoes made of fire\u201d and it was so utterly lacking in charisma that billionaire Tom Steyer was able to add a little flair to the proceedings by dressing like a human tape dispenser. His tie, as awful as it was, was the most interesting thing up there on that stage. It\u2019s almost fascinating how boring it all was, given how we almost went to war with Iran just a week ago, and how close we are to procedurally removing a president from office. Look. We\u2019re all tired of this. Every time they broadcast one of these debates the viewership drops by a lot. The candidates are tired of this, of being asked to explain within 40 seconds complicated policy and ideology. The viewership is clearly tired of being asked to decide the future of our country based on 40 seconds of information. The only people who are excited are the moderators, who get to have their big moment on cable television. What fun it must be for them to talk over someone explaining how we might lower insulin prices enough so that people don\u2019t have to ration lifesaving treatment to ask how they feel about the latest Trump tweet. The only real energy of the night was unfortunate. Once CNN moderator Abby Phillip got the opportunity to ask Bernie Sanders whether or not he said, as dubiously reported this week, a woman could not be elected president \u2013 which he strongly denied \u2013 she immediately turned to Elizabeth Warren to ask how it felt to be told by Bernie Sanders that a woman could not be president. It was gross, like something from a new West Wing script. All that was missing were the stringed instruments bringing a sentimental surge to Warren\u2019s answer. It was also the only part of the evening where anyone felt present. Biden might as well have been wandering the stage aimlessly, Buttigieg was vacant and hesitant, and Sanders never does well when asked to pander with diversity language. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the moment landed with the electorate, or if it played as cheap to voters as it did in my living room. We all thought that with fewer candidates on a smaller stage, we might be able to hash out some real topics with some real seriousness. Tonight proved it\u2019s just electioneering all the way down. Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast \u2018Joe Biden has reason to smile\u2019 The Democrats\u2019 seventh debate won\u2019t likely move the needle but Joe Biden has reason to smile.

Amy Klobuchar\u2019s discussion of education and the job market was illuminating. Her take showed a concern for realities larger than political orthodoxies, and was a reminder of why she is one of the Senate\u2019s most popular members.

The moderator\u2019s question presumed that Sanders wasn\u2019t telling the truth (\u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewBevan/status/1217291632015368193\">What did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?</a>\u201d) Warren accepted the characterization, saying she disagreed with Sanders\u2019 opinion, but did not elaborate on what she was alleging Sanders to have said to her.

Bizarrely, even though Biden is the frontrunner, neither Warren nor Sanders launched a major attack on him. It has been strange to see how lightly the candidates have treated Biden given his <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-presidential-campaign-record\">appalling record</a> and electoral weaknesses. He was the clear beneficiary of the tension between the two progressives, and the fallout from Warren\u2019s attack on Sanders might well lead to Biden winning Iowa.</p> <p>Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer will probably both be praised for their performances. Both were composed and articulate, though they mostly benefit from being given equal time to the race\u2019s actual frontrunners. Klobuchar, as usual, attacked single-payer healthcare and free college as pipe dreams. Steyer gave an unexpectedly forceful attack on the private health insurance industry, backing up Warren and Sanders in making the case that corporate profiteers in healthcare are the problem.</p> <p>But the prominence of Steyer and Klobuchar was a reminder of the absence of Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard. Both Yang and Gabbard have livened up these debates and provided useful alternative perspectives \u2013 Yang with his pitch for a universal basic income and Gabbard with a critique of militarism. It seems unjust that Steyer, a billionaire, can fund his way into these debates while the others are kept out. (Cory Booker, who just suspended his campaign, is also missed.)</p> <p>The CNN moderators were vicious, far beyond ordinary criticism. Sanders came in for the worst of it \u2013 he was asked how voters knew he wouldn\u2019t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LEBassett/status/1217281511428448256\">bankrupt</a> the country (the US <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2012/10/19/no-the-united-states-will-not-go-into-a-debt-crisis-not-now-not-ever/#3c3c1da22a86\">can\u2019t go bankrupt</a>) and about whether he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/1217280623167053826\">owed</a> the American people an explanation on Medicare for All\u2019s costs. But the moderators aggressively questioned others, too \u2013 Klobuchar over her uninspiring \u201cpragmatism\u201d and Pete Buttigieg over his inability to generate support among black voters.</p> <p>Much of the debate was turned over to uneventful discussions about troop levels, impeachment and trade deals. Biden said he would not meet with Kim Jong-un without preconditions, putting him to the right of Trump on North Korean diplomacy. Klobuchar pitched impeachment as a \u201cdecency check\u201d for the country \u2013 which, in a proudly indecent country, is unlikely to excite too many voters. The healthcare section relitigated the tedious \u201chow will you pay for it\u201d debate, even though we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/medicare-for-all-taxes-saez-zucman\">obvious answers</a> to this question. Buttigieg was asked why he didn\u2019t believe in \u201cfree college\u201d if he believed in free public high school, and replied that everyone is expected to finish high school. This didn\u2019t make much sense \u2013 we don\u2019t expect everyone to use the public library, but we give it to everyone equally. Unfortunately, the discussion didn\u2019t get much further.</p> <p>Ultimate takeaway: Biden didn\u2019t do well, but I guarantee he is smiling tonight.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the editor of <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/\">Current Affairs</a> and a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

But the prominence of Steyer and Klobuchar was a reminder of the absence of Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard. Both Yang and Gabbard have livened up these debates and provided useful alternative perspectives \u2013 Yang with his pitch for a universal basic income and Gabbard with a critique of militarism. It seems unjust that Steyer, a billionaire, can fund his way into these debates while the others are kept out. (Cory Booker, who just suspended his campaign, is also missed.) The CNN moderators were vicious, far beyond ordinary criticism. Sanders came in for the worst of it \u2013 he was asked how voters knew he wouldn\u2019t bankrupt the country (the US can\u2019t go bankrupt) and about whether he owed the American people an explanation on Medicare for All\u2019s costs. But the moderators aggressively questioned others, too \u2013 Klobuchar over her uninspiring \u201cpragmatism\u201d and Pete Buttigieg over his inability to generate support among black voters. Much of the debate was turned over to uneventful discussions about troop levels, impeachment and trade deals. Biden said he would not meet with Kim Jong-un without preconditions, putting him to the right of Trump on North Korean diplomacy. Klobuchar pitched impeachment as a \u201cdecency check\u201d for the country \u2013 which, in a proudly indecent country, is unlikely to excite too many voters. The healthcare section relitigated the tedious \u201chow will you pay for it\u201d debate, even though we have obvious answers to this question. Buttigieg was asked why he didn\u2019t believe in \u201cfree college\u201d if he believed in free public high school, and replied that everyone is expected to finish high school. This didn\u2019t make much sense \u2013 we don\u2019t expect everyone to use the public library, but we give it to everyone equally. Unfortunately, the discussion didn\u2019t get much further. Ultimate takeaway: Biden didn\u2019t do well, but I guarantee he is smiling tonight. Nathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs and a Guardian US columnist",

Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf created one of four on-site gardens: a waterside oasis that looks good even in winter with intricate seed heads, golden grasses and a Monet-style bridge. The gardens and sculptures integrated into the park intensify the natural shapes and colours in the wider, wildlife-rich landscape, whether it\u2019s a mossy willow by the Wensum or a weeping silver birch by Moon Water (Pensthorpe\u2019s main lake).

Two years later, a visitor centre was opened to help share the vision and today the engaging mix of renewable tech, green buildings, ponds, woods and organic gardens attracts thousands of visitors each year.

The new Fox Tap bar is open Tuesday to Saturday afternoons, keswickbrewery.co.uk Get there Buses X4 or X5 from outside Penrith railway station on the mainline from Euston to Glasgow and Edinburgh (three hours from London by train, now with Avanti West Coast, who took over from Virgin in December 2019). Bus 555 from Windermere takes an even more spectacular route through the heart of the Lake District. Eat Abraham\u2019s Caf\u00e9 on the top floor of the George Fisher outdoor shop \u2013 great views and sustaining homemade food. Soup of the day with organic bread (\u00a35.30) or Cumberland rarebit (\u00a38.75). St Nicks nature reserve and environment centre, York Walking through the tree tunnels and grassy paths of St Nicholas Fields, catch the odd glimpse of York Minster or a waft of chocolate from the Nestl\u00e9 Rowntree factory. It\u2019s startling to remember the city centre is just a mile away. These nine hectares of urban nature reserve, now alive with birdsong and wildflowers, were once York\u2019s rubbish tip; people say the numerous apple trees grew from Rowntree waste. There\u2019s a mini-Stonehenge in the middle, made from stones dumped here when the area was a landfill site. The little environment centre opened in 2000 with what were then cutting-edge features: living roof, passive solar design, renewable energy and compost loos. It still has a utopian feel, with its enthusiastic volunteers and jars of homemade chutney. The centre runs conservation afternoons, ecotherapy sessions and a kerbside recycling scheme using trikes. Open The reserve is open all the time, the environment centre, generally, Monday to Friday, 9am-4pm, both free, stnicks.org.uk Get there By bike or on foot along partially traffic-free Sustrans route 658. Bikes, if you need them, from Cycle Heaven at York station (from \u00a310 for 2 hours). Alternatively, bus 6 from Rougier Street stops near Rawdon Avenue, very close to the environment centre. Eat Lots of options in the city centre, such as cosy Goji on Goodramgate, 10 minutes away by bike. This veteran veggie cafe has been open 10 years, serving dishes including butternut squash and cashew rarebit with roast peppers and mushrooms (\u00a35.95). Findhorn Foundation, Moray The original, ultimate green destination, describing itself as \u201ca living model for the future\u201d, the Findhorn Foundation has been blazing a trail since the 1960s; founder Dorothy Maclean celebrated her 100th birthday on 7 January. It continues to offer spiritual, practical and environmental courses, from sustainable living to celebrating Celtic festivals. This is an international community and eco-village with a bakery, publishers, pottery, arts centre; there are also gigs, films, comedy and theatre on offer in the Universal Hall. Trees for Life, which enlist volunteers to help rewild the Scottish Highlands and restore the Caledonian Forest, also has its offices nearby. Open Weekdays in winter 11am-3pm for self-guided visits (guidebook \u00a37) with tours (\u00a38) on Wednesdays at 11am (more often in summer). Join a week-long course, or be a guest for the day (\u00a325 with lunch and dinner, from 21 January), findhorn.org. Get there Take a train to Forres from Inverness and then hourly bus 31 (ask the driver to stop at the Findhorn Foundation \u2013 not to be confused with the village, which is a mile further on). Findhorn also runs a shuttle bus to collect people taking part in workshops from some trains. Eat At the veggie Phoenix cafe in the eco-village itself, serving homemade soups (\u00a34.25) or mains such as spanakopita (spinach pie, \u00a37.50).

In just 30 minutes, 44mm of rain fell at Avalon on Wednesday afternoon, and wind gusts reached 110km/h as wild weather hit the state\u2019s south and moved north. At St Albans, 54mm fell in 30 minutes between 4.15pm and 4.45pm as the bureau of meteorology updated its forecast to include the possibility of giant hail. Across the country, the bureau has forecast up to 10mm of rain could fall over active fire regions in NSW and Victoria on Wednesday, with more expected on Thursday and Friday. Up to 50mm of rain could fall across the NSW south coast from Wednesday to Saturday, and up to 25mm in the Snowy Valley and northern Victoria, where cross-border fires continue to burn through hundreds of thousands of hectares. Earlier in the week, the NSW Rural Fire Service described the bureau\u2019s rainfall projections as \u201call of our Christmas, birthday, engagement, anniversary, wedding and graduation presents rolled into one\u201d. Australia\u2019s horror bushfire season has so far burnt through more than 10m hectares of land, killed 28 people, and destroyed thousands of homes nationwide. On Wednesday, the bureau issued severe thunderstorm warnings for the Riverina and lower and upper western regions of NSW, and for Melbourne and Geelong,, Northern Country, and West, South and parts of East Gippsland in Victoria. As of 4pm, multiple incidents of flash flooding had already been reported at Flemington, Pascoe Vale, Ringwood, Sunshine West and Altona North in Melbourne, and Lara and Portarlington near Geelong, according to VicEmergency. Lightning strikes also started at least two fires in the Great Otway National Park as the storm swept northeast. On Tuesday, the bureau of meteorology warned that the sudden heavy rain had the potential to cause damage \u2013 especially in fire-hit and burnt-out areas. Bureau meteorologist Sarah Scully said the rain was \u201ca bit of a double-edged sword\u201d. \u201cHeavy rainfall and gusty thunderstorms bring the potential for flash flooding, particularly in the burnt-out areas of NSW and Victoria which are now vulnerable to landslips and trees coming down,\u201d she said.

HS2 would destroy or irreparably damage five internationally protected wildlife sites, 693 local wildlife sites, 108 ancient woodlands and 33 legally protected sites of special scientific interest, according to the most comprehensive survey of its impact on wildlife. Other irreplaceable natural habitat would be lost to the new high-speed line, with endangered wildlife such as the willow tit, white-clawed crayfish and dingy skipper butterfly at risk of local extinction. The study is drawn from data provided by 14 local Wildlife Trusts and other charities and landowners along the route, including the National Trust and the Woodland Trust. HS2 has proposed a green corridor along the route but the Wildlife Trusts say it is inadequate. The HS2 project disputes the figures, saying the project will include \u201can unprecedented programme of tree planting and habitat creation\u201d and help the environment by cutting road journeys. * * * Democratic but not diplomatic \u2013 Elizabeth Warren has rejected a handshake from Bernie Sanders after the last Democratic clash before the party starts voting on who should be its presidential candidate.

      "body": "<p>Nevermind the Oscars or the Baftas. There are few stages that look so white as a Democratic debate in Iowa in early 2020.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the recent departures of every leading candidate of color in this contest to unseat our orange president.</p> <p>Somehow the makeup caked on the faces of the surviving contenders made them look even more white than the frozen cornfields they watch through the windows of their campaign buses all day.</p> <p>Until one moment, after an hour of earnest discussion about national security, when the blood suddenly rushed into Bernie Sanders\u2019 cheeks.</p> <p>On the face of it, Bernie\u2019s face was burning from the much-anticipated discussion of a pre-election conversation with his former friend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/14/democrats-iowa-debate-2020-warren-sanders-biden-buttigieg\">current rival Elizabeth Warren</a>. Did he really say a woman couldn\u2019t win an election? Did she really fib about what he\u2019d said behind closed doors?</p> <p>For two candidates who like to talk about structural, radical change, this sounded like a good old-fashioned dispute about spilling beer in a crowded bar. The beverage was just an excuse for a beating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/14/theres-only-one-winner-in-the-sanders-warren-fight-joe-biden\">There\u2019s only one winner in the Sanders-Warren \u2018fight\u2019: Joe Biden | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only Sanders got suckered into a different dispute \u2013 not about women, but about winning. Specifically, whether he could beat an incumbent Republican. And more specifically, whether he could add up.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the men on this stage,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCollectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women. Amy and me. And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me.\u201d</p> <p>Until this point, Sanders had given a fine account of himself, denying any sexist sentiment, pledging his support for the ultimate nominee, and even praising Hillary Clinton for winning the popular vote. Which hasn\u2019t exactly been his most popular talking point for the last three years.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t enough for Sanders, who decided to dispute Warren\u2019s real attack: that none of them had beaten a Republican for 30 years. Sanders insisted he had, back in 1990, done just that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df2f75cb7b6ba17587e87ad79c6307de06445cab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2f75cb7b6ba17587e87ad79c6307de06445cab/0_20_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren speaks with Bernie Sanders as billionaire activist Tom Steyer listens after the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren speaks with Bernie Sanders as billionaire activist Tom Steyer listens after the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warren smiled and pretended to do the math. Sanders grew flustered as it dawned on everyone that he thought 1990 must be more recent than three long decades. His cheeks flushed brightly and he spluttered his way through an emphatically delivered diatribe about nothing in particular.</p> <p>So much of Tuesday\u2019s debate was a matter of time travel. In the contest to fire a 73-year-old president, a 78-year-old socialist senator spent the first half-hour of a TV debate arguing with a 77-year-old former vice-president about their respective decisions to vote on the war in Iraq 17 years ago.</p> <p>There are voters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/27/iowa-caucus-2020-election-democrats-critical-choice\">preparing to caucus in Iowa</a> who were not born when these old men were first arguing about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>The ghosts of that time stalked the stage in Des Moines at the final debate before the fateful first votes in this election year.</p> <p>The last time Democratic voters picked a nominee to run against a gun-slinging Republican president, they faced a stark choice between a leftist populist and a centrist snoozebag. After dating Howard Dean, they married John Kerry. Almost two decades later, the Democratic voters of Iowa face a similar choice between the rabble-rousers and the comfy pair of slippers.</p> <p>Just three weeks from the first votes of the 2020 cycle, the final debate revolved around four candidates vying for two slots: Elizabeth Warren versus Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg versus Joe Biden.</p> <p>It\u2019s good manners to point out that there were two other candidates on stage: an entirely respectable senator, Amy Klobuchar, and an entirely forgettable rich white guy, Tom Steyer. Klobuchar had some fine moments urging the lefties to face up to reality. Steyer weirded out the nation by turning dramatically to look into the camera every time he piped up.</p> <p>But with so little time left for Iowa to enjoy its brief moment of global importance, let\u2019s not waste this blip in the historical record. For the Iowa polls suggest we\u2019re looking at a four-way race, bunched up in the high teens or early 20s, depending on how many new voters the pollsters think will show up to caucus.</p> <p>For most of the night, the steady establishment hands were only too happy to look down on the chaos and lament the lack of credibility at a time when Tehran looks more restrained than Trump. They didn\u2019t even bother to point out when Sanders confused George W Bush and Donald Trump when he was talking about support for the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen.</p> <p>Back in the 2004 campaign, it was the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003 that marked the moment when Dean began his collapse and Kerry rose up from the depths of his dismal polling to take the nomination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Judging from this final pre-Iowa debate, it sorely needs the defibrillator that Donald Trump represents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back then, Joe Biden was a surrogate for Kerry, testifying to his friend\u2019s national security experience and leadership skills. Today, Biden\u2019s strongest moments on stage were when he was silent. His defense for his vote on the war in Iraq was that Barack Obama hired him. His best argument for the boldness of his healthcare plan was that Obamacare was a big effing deal.</p> <p>It is still true that the idea of Joe Biden is rather more impressive than the reality. And much of that notional Biden is built around his old friend Barack.</p> <p>This is a big moment for the tiny state of Iowa (population: 3.2 million), so the final Iowa debate was held in a room that appeared no bigger than your average display of butter sculpture. As the candidates scribbled their pre-debate notes in the minutes before the debate began, CNN\u2019s pundits were close enough to the stage that they hushed themselves for fear of disturbing the candidate\u2019s brainwaves.</p> <p>But in just a few weeks, Iowans will do something very big: award winning tickets to no more than two of the Democrats on stage this week.</p> <p>In the meantime, they and the rest of the nation will be consumed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/14/trump-impeachment-pelosi-refer-articles-to-senate\">impeachment of a very stable genius</a>.</p> <p>Even more than an Elizabeth Warren debate trap, the trial will bring a rush of blood to this contest. Judging from this final pre-Iowa debate, it sorely needs the defibrillator that Donald Trump represents. Democrats are looking for a candidate to beat Trump even more than a candidate with the best plans for healthcare reform.</p> <p>As the impeachment trial sinks into an Iraq-style quagmire, Iowa\u2019s Democrats may start to look at this race anew. The winner may well be the candidate who knows how to turn that moment of Trumpian triumph into a rallying cry for disappointed Democrats.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nevermind the Oscars or the Baftas. There are few stages that look so white as a Democratic debate in Iowa in early 2020. It wasn\u2019t just the recent departures of every leading candidate of color in this contest to unseat our orange president. Somehow the makeup caked on the faces of the surviving contenders made them look even more white than the frozen cornfields they watch through the windows of their campaign buses all day. Until one moment, after an hour of earnest discussion about national security, when the blood suddenly rushed into Bernie Sanders\u2019 cheeks. On the face of it, Bernie\u2019s face was burning from the much-anticipated discussion of a pre-election conversation with his former friend and current rival Elizabeth Warren. Did he really say a woman couldn\u2019t win an election? Did she really fib about what he\u2019d said behind closed doors? For two candidates who like to talk about structural, radical change, this sounded like a good old-fashioned dispute about spilling beer in a crowded bar. The beverage was just an excuse for a beating. Only Sanders got suckered into a different dispute \u2013 not about women, but about winning. Specifically, whether he could beat an incumbent Republican. And more specifically, whether he could add up. \u201cLook at the men on this stage,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCollectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women. Amy and me. And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me.\u201d Until this point, Sanders had given a fine account of himself, denying any sexist sentiment, pledging his support for the ultimate nominee, and even praising Hillary Clinton for winning the popular vote. Which hasn\u2019t exactly been his most popular talking point for the last three years. But that wasn\u2019t enough for Sanders, who decided to dispute Warren\u2019s real attack: that none of them had beaten a Republican for 30 years. Sanders insisted he had, back in 1990, done just that. Warren smiled and pretended to do the math. Sanders grew flustered as it dawned on everyone that he thought 1990 must be more recent than three long decades. His cheeks flushed brightly and he spluttered his way through an emphatically delivered diatribe about nothing in particular. So much of Tuesday\u2019s debate was a matter of time travel. In the contest to fire a 73-year-old president, a 78-year-old socialist senator spent the first half-hour of a TV debate arguing with a 77-year-old former vice-president about their respective decisions to vote on the war in Iraq 17 years ago. There are voters preparing to caucus in Iowa who were not born when these old men were first arguing about weapons of mass destruction. The ghosts of that time stalked the stage in Des Moines at the final debate before the fateful first votes in this election year. The last time Democratic voters picked a nominee to run against a gun-slinging Republican president, they faced a stark choice between a leftist populist and a centrist snoozebag. After dating Howard Dean, they married John Kerry. Almost two decades later, the Democratic voters of Iowa face a similar choice between the rabble-rousers and the comfy pair of slippers. Just three weeks from the first votes of the 2020 cycle, the final debate revolved around four candidates vying for two slots: Elizabeth Warren versus Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg versus Joe Biden. It\u2019s good manners to point out that there were two other candidates on stage: an entirely respectable senator, Amy Klobuchar, and an entirely forgettable rich white guy, Tom Steyer. Klobuchar had some fine moments urging the lefties to face up to reality. Steyer weirded out the nation by turning dramatically to look into the camera every time he piped up. But with so little time left for Iowa to enjoy its brief moment of global importance, let\u2019s not waste this blip in the historical record. For the Iowa polls suggest we\u2019re looking at a four-way race, bunched up in the high teens or early 20s, depending on how many new voters the pollsters think will show up to caucus. For most of the night, the steady establishment hands were only too happy to look down on the chaos and lament the lack of credibility at a time when Tehran looks more restrained than Trump. They didn\u2019t even bother to point out when Sanders confused George W Bush and Donald Trump when he was talking about support for the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen. Back in the 2004 campaign, it was the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003 that marked the moment when Dean began his collapse and Kerry rose up from the depths of his dismal polling to take the nomination. Back then, Joe Biden was a surrogate for Kerry, testifying to his friend\u2019s national security experience and leadership skills. Today, Biden\u2019s strongest moments on stage were when he was silent. His defense for his vote on the war in Iraq was that Barack Obama hired him. His best argument for the boldness of his healthcare plan was that Obamacare was a big effing deal. It is still true that the idea of Joe Biden is rather more impressive than the reality. And much of that notional Biden is built around his old friend Barack. This is a big moment for the tiny state of Iowa (population: 3.2 million), so the final Iowa debate was held in a room that appeared no bigger than your average display of butter sculpture. As the candidates scribbled their pre-debate notes in the minutes before the debate began, CNN\u2019s pundits were close enough to the stage that they hushed themselves for fear of disturbing the candidate\u2019s brainwaves. But in just a few weeks, Iowans will do something very big: award winning tickets to no more than two of the Democrats on stage this week. In the meantime, they and the rest of the nation will be consumed by the impeachment of a very stable genius. Even more than an Elizabeth Warren debate trap, the trial will bring a rush of blood to this contest. Judging from this final pre-Iowa debate, it sorely needs the defibrillator that Donald Trump represents. Democrats are looking for a candidate to beat Trump even more than a candidate with the best plans for healthcare reform. As the impeachment trial sinks into an Iraq-style quagmire, Iowa\u2019s Democrats may start to look at this race anew. The winner may well be the candidate who knows how to turn that moment of Trumpian triumph into a rallying cry for disappointed Democrats.",

While the Resolution Foundation dismissed fears of a debt crisis as overblown, it said the increasing use of credit cards, store cards and overdrafts by those struggling to make ends meet should concern policymakers. The thinktank said consumer debt excluding mortgages amounted to 15% of total income in 2019 \u2013 well down on the 19% recorded in 2008, the last time the UK economy entered a recession. Mortgages were also cheaper to service as a result of historically-low interest rates. However, it added that the proportion of low-income households using some form of consumer debt rose by 9% (from 53% to 62%) between the three-year periods of 2006-08 and 2016-19 \u2013 a far steeper increase than the one-point rise (to 64%) among high-income households. Rising use of consumer debt had been concentrated in products with high interest rates that \u2013 unlike mortgage debt \u2013 had not got cheaper over the past decade. Credit card use (with an average quoted interest rate of 20%, up from 15% in 2008) among low-income households grew by 13 percentage points from 2006-08 and 2016-19, while the use of overdrafts (with an average quoted interest rate of 15-20%) grew by 4 percentage points.

Still, the trend is slow to take hold. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to spread the vegan practice around Africa because Africans love their meat,\u201d says Kagoro, who is known as Chef Cola. \u201cThe challenge is because Africans think meat is a form of showing wealth.\u201d With Nasa, Tapsoba helps the few Burkinabe vegetarians of Ouagadougou navigate an often difficult path to a meat-free life. \u201cWhen a vegetarian is here and I am told they struggle to find something to eat, immediately I rise up to help them,\u201d she says. And with patience, free tofu, and a growing awareness of the consequences of meaty diets, she hopes to convince others to join her.",

Without any shadow of doubt.\u201d</p> <p>St Andrew\u2019s was originally the Northampton asylum, one of four charitable mental health hospitals that opted not to join the NHS on its creation in 1948. But it still provides a lot of NHS-funded services. Almost all the inpatients treated by St Andrew\u2019s are detained under the Mental Health Act because they pose a risk of harm to themselves or others and 90% are NHS-funded, with the remainder mainly sent by state health services in Ireland, Gibraltar and Bermuda. The charity\u2019s most recent accounts, for 2018-19, show an annual income of \u00a3205m, up from less than \u00a3175m in 2012-13 as it expanded into services for adolescents and people with brain injury, and learning disability.</p> <p>She aims to return the organisation to its core purpose of short-term specialist inpatient care, which will involve shedding or sharing many of these services and, potentially, some of the longer-standing adult mental health provision once other non-profit providers have been found. But 18 months since her arrival, progress is slow. <a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/new_reports/AAAJ7777.pdf\" title=\"\">Last week\u2019s CQC report</a> acknowledged that her leadership team, almost entirely new, had \u201cclear vision and values\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive knowledge of challenges faced\u201d, but found it was taking time for this to translate into practice.</p> <p>Talks with a variety of charities are under way. She says the charity has tried to develop models of longer-term support of its own. \u201cWhat we have learned through that process is we are just not very good at it,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cWe can deliver the clinical model, but our expertise isn\u2019t around finding appropriate houses, making them fit for purpose, making sure that the social model of care is integrated within the local community infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>St Andrew\u2019s will not, she insists, walk away from services until other arrangements are in place, tailored to the needs of individual patients. But she says she is confident of being able to close \u201cat least 100\u201d beds in 2020. She is wary of setting further hard targets, lest it alarm the charity\u2019s NHS commissioners, but says that \u201cwe could be half the size in three years\u2013 that\u2019s absolutely the direction we want to go in\u201d.</p> <p>With workforce turnover running at 13% \u2013 though less than that in the NHS, she points out \u2013 and current reliance on 1,000 non-core \u201cbank\u201d staff, she thinks that even such dramatic change would not involve significant redundancies.

      "body": "<p>Any actor in regular paid employment could be described as having a charmed life, but it\u2019s a particular kind of good luck to look exactly like Christine Keeler when the world is ready to have the Profumo affair retold from the perspective of Keeler herself. In fact, in the BBC\u2019s flagship show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/29/the-trial-of-christine-keeler-review-another-very-english-scandal\">The Trial of Christine Keeler</a>, Sophie Cookson looks so like the protagonist that Keeler\u2019s son said that, in one shot of her in the back of a car, it was as if he was seeing his mother. In real life, drinking mint tea in a cafe in London\u2019s Gloucester Road, Cookson looks more like a friendly version of Keira Knightley. In other words, she could probably look like just about anybody.</p> <p>What now seems fascinating about the Profumo affair is the realisation that we have been looking at this well-worn moment in British public life from such a strange angle: always from the point of view of the establishment. What mattered was what it meant for the secretary of state for war John Profumo, whose career ended when it was revealed that the teenager he had been \u201cinvolved\u201d with, Keeler, had also been \u201cinvolved\u201d with a Soviet naval attache. It was a political story with a cold war spying angle. Rarely, if ever, has it been seen for what it was: a sex scandal in which predatory men in late middle age procured teenage girls, then derided them as sex-crazed liars and schemers.</p> <p>The freight of sheer contempt in this story, based on class as well as gender, is remarkable \u2013 and it took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/23/meet-the-author-amanda-coe-getting-colder-confident-about-exploring-class\">Amanda Coe</a>\u2019s screenplay, along with Cookson\u2019s spare, evocative performance, to see what was staring us in the face. \u201cTo give it a narrative through the female gaze does feel like reclaiming her story,\u201d Cookson says. \u201cThere was a sense of solidarity on set \u2013 having a female director and female producers, as well as Amanda\u2019s script. But there\u2019s also a sense of solidarity in the story, the sense that it isn\u2019t just Christine Keeler\u2019s story, it\u2019s also Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019s and Valerie\u2019s.\u201d Valerie was Profumo\u2019s wife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2012ca6872dedff4766f07a866bcb5ce40f9d2f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2012ca6872dedff4766f07a866bcb5ce40f9d2f3/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hounded \u2026 Cookson, centre, in The Trial of Christine Keeler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hounded \u2026 Cookson, centre, in The Trial of Christine Keeler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/Ecosse Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s as if every aspect of misogyny going has been brought together in a great big ensemble piece. Some have queried the casting, though, Cookson being 29. Had Keeler been played by a 19-year-old, the argument goes, it would have rammed home the age difference and implicit exploitation far more forcefully. I don\u2019t agree. Because Cookson\u2019s performance is so young, there is nothing knowing or calculating in her Keeler. \u201cIt was such a beautiful role,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause she\u2019s so fresh, and that\u2019s what led to her downfall. It\u2019s so much fun playing someone so immediate and present. She can\u2019t keep a lid on anything. She doesn\u2019t think forward. Everything in her mind, you can see immediately in her face.\u201d</p> <p>The affair, she agrees, is a fascinating lens through which to consider how much has changed socially. \u201cIt\u2019s early 60s, so the morality is actually quite 50s. A woman out on her own in a bar would be assumed to be a working girl. And the vilification of Keeler is incredible. When we were filming the scene of her going in to the courtroom \u2013 women of all ages, men of all ages, screaming at her, so much rage and nobody really there to protect her \u2013 to consider what that must have been like. Even hearing an egg being thrown at a car window, it\u2019s like a gunshot.\u201d</p> <p>When Scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/scandal-keeler-profumo\">a film about the story</a>, was released in 1989, it was still routine to see Profumo as the main victim, a tragic hero undone by a floozie. Cookson talks of being inspired by an interview Keeler gave at the time with Sue Lawley. \u201cThat interview,\u201d Cookson says, \u201cwas one of my main fires, I think. Lawley placed so much shame on Christine Keeler, who was desperately trying to defend her situation, with such poise and integrity\u201d against allegations that she was a \u201cshameless person who was completely manipulative, out for whatever she could get\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90ea892754da36785731818a556fe296db7b74be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ea892754da36785731818a556fe296db7b74be/0_0_3629_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sixties shocker \u2026 Christine Keeler, right, and Mandy Rice-Davies leave the Old Bailey in 1963.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sixties shocker \u2026 Christine Keeler, right, and Mandy Rice-Davies leave the Old Bailey in 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s interesting, too, that there are elements of the story you can easily imagine happening today: the establishment closing ranks, a tabloid chewing someone\u2019s life up for a front page and an envelope full of not-that-much money. \u201cMany of the themes could be right now,\u201d the actor says which \u2013 politically \u2013 I think is true. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a current Tory grandee with such a secret, though perhaps that says more about our parlous situation than it does about Profumo.</p> <p>Cookson speaks with intense care, as if in constant fear of giving offence. She obviously has strong views about the patriarchy, but always stops short of giving them. \u201cIt\u2019s been really interesting doing press, as well, the way in which male journalists \u2026\u201d She never concludes the point, saying instead: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a nicer set when it\u2019s 50:50 male-female. As women, we all felt that sometimes we didn\u2019t have the power we needed, we weren\u2019t accorded the voice we would have liked. I remember, when I started, on Kingsman \u2026\u201d Again, she drifts off.</p> <p>This reticence could be because Cookson had no wilderness years, no time when she could say whatever she liked because nobody was listening. She landed the part in 2014\u2019s Kingsman \u2013 a small role in a big-budget and well-liked spy caper \u2013 while she was still at drama school in Oxford. \u201cI never did get a degree,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>I was working as a bookseller when Fifty Shades of Grey was published and spent weeks stacking shelves with the glossy tomes, only for them to be whisked away as soon as they arrived. I soon amassed a range of excuses from customers who so often seemed to be embarrassed to be buying what everyone else was buying. \u201cI\u2019m getting it for my wife,\u201d men announced, unprompted, while women \u2013 often younger than the label \u201cmummy porn\u201d suggested \u2013 would recount whole conversations with unnamed friends who had deemed the erotic thriller \u201cquite good\u201d.</p> <p>The trilogy by EL James, the writing moniker of the British author Erika Leonard, was published between 2011 and 2012. Late last year it was announced that they had been the runaway bestselling books of the decade. In the UK alone, Fifty Shades of Grey sold 4.7m print copies, Fifty Shades Darker sold 3.3m and Fifty Shades Freed sold 3.1m. (The fourth biggest-selling book, Jamie\u2019s 30-Minute Meals, sold 1.8m.) At its peak, two copies of the first book sold every second; for a time, the UK ran out of silver ink, thanks to its use on the books\u2019 covers. Worldwide, by 2015, more than 150m copies had sold, with millions more ebooks on top. But alongside the huge number of copies sold, was there a lasting cultural influence?</p> <p>For the uninitiated, here\u2019s the story: Anastasia Steele, a 22-year-old college student and virgin, meets 27-year-old billionaire and BDSM fan Christian Grey. She wants to date him, but he wants to employ her as his newest submissive. Slap and tickle ensues (read: a lot of slapping and not much tickling). They dance an uneasy line between kink and domesticity in penthouses, fancy restaurants and expensive cars. There are helicopter crashes, crazed exes and a kidnapping. He opens up about his childhood trauma and becomes more loving. They get married and Grey decides he no longer wants to inflict pain on his wife. They have two kids. The end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9d979722901b451c17631afe4e864f6d4fc1462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9d979722901b451c17631afe4e864f6d4fc1462/0_0_937_562/500.png\" alt=\"A still from Fifty Shades Darker.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Fifty Shades Darker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world was fascinated by its success, as it often is when something enjoyed by women and girls breaks through. Much was made of the power imbalance between Grey and Steele: after years of fighting for equality, did modern women secretly want to be tied up and forced to submit? Was it a feminist win or deeply regressive? The critics guffawed at lines such as: \u201cHis voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel ... or something.\u201d The New York Times said it was \u201clike a Bront\u00eb devoid of talent\u201d, while Salman Rushdie said: \u201cI\u2019ve never read anything so badly written that got published.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately, attempts were made to measure its impact. Science was involved. Experts variously claimed that Fifty Shades was <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33470-001/\" title=\"\">a sexual turn-off</a> (among college-age women); <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2731694/Reading-Fifty-Shades-Of-Grey-puts-women-higher-risk-eating-disorders-binge-drinking-abusive-relationships-study-finds.html\" title=\"\">a measure of women\u2019s self-esteem</a> (fans aged between 18 and 24 were more likely to binge drink, have eating disorders and end up in abusive relationships); responsible for increasing STDs among the over-50s (anecdotal); and covered in herpes and cocaine (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/18/fifty-shades-of-grey-viral-library-herpes\" title=\"\">according to two Belgian professors</a> who studied the surfaces of library copies). Sociologists predicted a boom in babies that could never be causally linked. Anecdotally, women on mum forums talked about their incumbent \u201cFifty Shades baby\u201d, while retailers cashed in on knockoff \u201cGeneration Grey\u201d onesies.</p> <p>These days, with fourth-wave feminism, the ubiquity of hardcore pornography and the politics of the #MeToo movement, when millennials cheerfully joke about <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/eating-ass\" title=\"\">\u201ceating ass\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/25/fatal-hateful-rise-of-choking-during-sex\" title=\"\">choking has been normalised</a>, Fifty Shades has been left looking a little naff. Yes, there are butt plugs and handcuffs, but the books feel very conservative now, with many of Grey and Steele\u2019s simultaneous orgasms achieved in missionary as they gaze into each other\u2019s eyes. Reading all 1,500 pages of the trilogy left me thinking, more than once: \u201cI\u2019ve had weirder sex than this on a Tuesday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each book in the trilogy sold more than 3m print copies. The fourth bestseller, Jamie\u2019s 30-Minute Meals, sold 1.8m</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Charity shops began refusing donations of second-hand copies; one Oxfam in Swansea received so many that staff built a fort out of them. A hotel owner in France told me of the season they were saddled with 150 discarded copies in different languages, while a sex-shop worker said that, when told the vibrator or clitoral chain they are holding is Fifty Shades-branded, most customers put them down. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, because they\u2019re really good products,\u201d the shop assistant said. \u201cVery good anal beads.\u201d</p> <p>The sex educator Evie Fehilly had experienced abusive sex; when Fifty Shades became a hit, she read all three. \u201cA lot of survivors have this, where you were put in a situation where you have no control and come to fantasise about it afterwards. Fifty Shades tapped into that very interestingly,\u201d she says. \u201cI began engaging with those feelings in a very formalised way with kink, where it is all about consent, best practice and safety. Playing with those roles of the dominant and the submissive was so cathartic for me and really helped me love sex again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7882f6504a02a664f9d7456e7643cfe796f750ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7882f6504a02a664f9d7456e7643cfe796f750ad/1390_1015_4066_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sex toy company Lovehoney increased its sales tenfold to \u00a3100m since Fifty Shades was published.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sex toy company Lovehoney increased its sales tenfold to \u00a3100m since Fifty Shades was published.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: edwardolive/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years, BDSM practitioners and domestic abuse campaigners have accused the series of normalising abusive behaviour, arguing Grey\u2019s posessiveness, jealousy and obsession with Steele had been unhelpfully conflated with BDSM. Natalie Collins set up the Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse campaign in 2014 because she was concerned about \u201chow many women and girls might think abuse is normal or sexy, and how the series might add to that\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cFifty Shades brought a niche sexual practice with its own rules, nuances and safety mechanisms into mainstream consciousness, without bringing any of the rules, nuances or safety mechanisms with it. It led to a shift in cultural consciousness which now presumes that, rather than this being a niche thing, large swathes of women are turned on by pain and powerlessness.\u201d</p> <p>BDSM practitioners also hated the connection between Grey\u2019s childhood and his sexuality. (\u201cI like to whip little brown-haired girls like you because you all look like the crack whore \u2013 my birth mother,\u201d Grey tells Steele.) At the height of its popularity, the US sex-advice columnist Dan Savage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fakedansavage/status/204957359909502976\" title=\"\">issued a plea to Fifty Shades fans</a>: \u201cBDSM is cops and robbers for grownups with your pants off \u2026 it\u2019s not a cry for help.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, students in Fehilly\u2019s kink classes would cite the books as their reason for being there. Now, no one mentions them at all, although Fehilly does credit them for bringing BDSM into the mainstream \u2013 despite the caveats about Grey. \u201cIt is OK to be damaged and enjoy kink, as long as you do it with a lot of communication and enthusiastic consent. For that reason, the kink community would kick Christian Grey out in a heartbeat,\u201d Fehilly says. \u201cThere are four pillars in BDSM \u2013 trust, communication, respect, and honesty \u2013 and they are not always there in Fifty Shades.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty Shades even, and the subsequent ubiquity of kink on morning television and in women\u2019s magazines, had an impact on people who hadn\u2019t read the books. Adele (not her real name), a 23-year-old dominatrix, only skimmed the first as a teenager, but believes they allowed her to explore kink without shame. \u201cMy mum and aunties were reading them, and everyone was talking about BDSM,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I realised I wanted to try being domme at 19, there was no confusion about it. I knew what it meant just because it was always part of the conversation about ways to have sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time ever, kink is cool and we have to credit Fifty Shades for starting that conversation,\u201d Fehilly says. \u201cFor James to introduce people who have P-in-V [penis in vagina] sex a couple of times a month to things like spreader bars and butt plugs, that\u2019s pretty outrageous and exciting.\u201d</p> <p>The companies that made the spreader bars and butt plugs found it pretty exciting, too. In 2011, Bonny Hall, a product developer at the sex toy company Lovehoney, was watching the industry go through a gloomy patch. Then Fifty Shades of Grey was published. The Bath-based company proposed an official line of toys to James; they had a deal by July 2012 and within a week Hall was in China starting development. \u201cIt was the perfect relationship. Both Erika and I wanted customers to be able to re-enact what they liked in the book exactly as she wrote them,\u201d Hall says.</p> <p>The first products sold out in two weeks and Hall says they were \u201cworking around the clock\u201d for six months straight. In 2012, there was a worldwide shortage of kegel balls due to Grey\u2019s fondness for inserting them into Steele; overnight, Lovehoney went from selling 300 a month to 3,000. A decade on, Lovehoney\u2019s annual sales have increased tenfold to \u00a3100m a year; its biggest growth area has been bondage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed21722ab37a78058523d9df12709e9c6162ce04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed21722ab37a78058523d9df12709e9c6162ce04/0_203_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The series changed the conversation about women\u2019s sexual desire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The series changed the conversation about women\u2019s sexual desire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Alexander/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was amazing what a boost it gave us,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThere are businesses that would not exist today without Fifty Shades,\u201d says Hall. \u201cPeople who had never been inside a sex shop started going in, particularly women, as it didn\u2019t feel seedy any more.

One was Maxim Jakubowski, who had spent decades writing fantasy, thrillers and some literary erotica. \u201cFifty Shades is an insult to what good erotica can be, but I am eternally grateful to it; it changed my life,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 2011, before Fifty Shades had even been published, Jakubowski was asked to write a novel to compete with it.

Multiple authors who had made a living from writing erotica during the Fifty Shades boom told me that within two years they were unable to pitch it. The only author to stand out after James was Sylvia Day, whose 2012 novel Bared to You \u2013 about a damaged billionaire and a young woman \u2013 was also a huge hit. \u201cThe industry was flooded with Fifty Shades rip-offs, some by hacks, and it spoiled the market. These days, no UK or US publisher will touch it with a bargepole,\u201d says Jakubowski, who has gone back to writing thrillers.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the same as the appetite for writing and reading it going away, says Monique Roffey, the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/21/the-tryst-monique-roffey-review-erotic-novel\" title=\"\">the acclaimed 2017 novel The Tryst</a>. \u201cThere are masses writing erotica online. It is thriving. It just isn\u2019t in the mainstream any more because the book elite \u2013 publishing and media \u2013 see Fifty Shades as low and wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Roffey praises James for her bravery. \u201cI\u2019m 54, and it took me until I was 40 to put my foot down and say: \u2018I\u2019m not having the sex I want,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt is very hard for women to have good sex because we all find it hard to talk about. P-in-V is the dominant portrayal of sex in our culture, but a bad way to bring a woman to orgasm. Top marks to James for starting that conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Yet in a society where our public discourse about sex lacks nuance, perhaps it is not surprising that Fifty Shades became a lazy shorthand for rough and non-consensual sex. Most recently, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-peter-pan-phd-student-who-raped-scores-of-men\" title=\"\">Reynhard Sinaga, a serial rapist in Manchester,</a> dismissed his crimes as \u201cFifty Shades of Grey-type stuff\u201d. The books have been cited in cases of men who kill their partners during sex, most often by strangulation, cases that have rocketed in number by 90% over the decade. In court, lawyers have used what has been dubbed \u201cthe Fifty Shades defence\u201d \u2013 blaming the defendant\u2019s partner\u2019s supposed appetite for sexual violence for their assault and death.</p> <p>There have been terrible stories. In 2013, a man in Ipswich claimed an attack on his girlfriend was inspired by Fifty Shades. He was found not guilty of actual bodily harm; the next year, <a href=\"https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/ipswich-fifty-shades-of-grey-case-jeweller-is-jailed-after-throwing-his-latest-partner-around-like-a-rag-doll-1-3639799#\" title=\"\">he was jailed for assaulting his new partner</a>. It was his seventh conviction for domestic violence.</p> <p>Fiona Mackenzie, from the campaign group We Can\u2019t Consent to This, says her group avoids the term \u201cFifty Shades defence\u201d, as it puts the responsibility on the mainly female readers of the books, instead of the male perpetrators. (It is perhaps important \u2013 and interesting \u2013 to note that Grey specifically rules out erotic asphyxiation with Steele.) \u201cBut Fifty Shades is so frequently used in news reports of violent sexual assault of women that it\u2019s one of the search terms that we monitor to find new rough-sex defence cases,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Women, of course, don\u2019t die from butt plugs and handcuffs, but from violence. As the MP Harriet Harman said recently in parliament: \u201cWhat an irony it is that the narrative of women\u2019s sexual empowerment is being used by men who inflict fatal injuries.\u201d Ironic? Or useful to keep the rather conservative, female-driven Fifty Shades in the spotlight, instead of misogyny and the violent pornography mostly made by men? Yet campaigners such as Collins argue that Fifty Shades led to a dangerous escalation in sexual play, to <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19938109/choking-during-sex/\" title=\"\">a culture where magazines such as Women\u2019s Health now make suggestions </a><a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19938109/choking-during-sex/\" title=\"\">such as</a>: \u201cIf blindfolds and role play have veered into vanilla territory, there are still plenty of sex moves \u2026 like choking.\u201d</p> <p>So was Fifty Shades instrumental in the sexual education and unshackling of millions of women? Or has it been ruinous for female empowerment and contributed to a terrible misunderstanding of violence and sex? Did it help erotic publishing or create a bubble that quickly burst? Perhaps all of these things are, to a degree, true. The series is long past its peak: in 2019, the first book sold 3,700 copies, down from 4.5m in 2012, with the sequels selling fewer than 2,000 each.</p> <p>Influence is a hard thing to measure, but what stays with me from my time selling Fifty Shades, even more than the creative excuses, was what so many people said when they returned for the sequels. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d never been in a bookshop before,\u201d they told me, clutching their haul. \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was working as a bookseller when Fifty Shades of Grey was published and spent weeks stacking shelves with the glossy tomes, only for them to be whisked away as soon as they arrived. I soon amassed a range of excuses from customers who so often seemed to be embarrassed to be buying what everyone else was buying. \u201cI\u2019m getting it for my wife,\u201d men announced, unprompted, while women \u2013 often younger than the label \u201cmummy porn\u201d suggested \u2013 would recount whole conversations with unnamed friends who had deemed the erotic thriller \u201cquite good\u201d. The trilogy by EL James, the writing moniker of the British author Erika Leonard, was published between 2011 and 2012. Late last year it was announced that they had been the runaway bestselling books of the decade. In the UK alone, Fifty Shades of Grey sold 4.7m print copies, Fifty Shades Darker sold 3.3m and Fifty Shades Freed sold 3.1m. (The fourth biggest-selling book, Jamie\u2019s 30-Minute Meals, sold 1.8m.) At its peak, two copies of the first book sold every second; for a time, the UK ran out of silver ink, thanks to its use on the books\u2019 covers. Worldwide, by 2015, more than 150m copies had sold, with millions more ebooks on top. But alongside the huge number of copies sold, was there a lasting cultural influence? For the uninitiated, here\u2019s the story: Anastasia Steele, a 22-year-old college student and virgin, meets 27-year-old billionaire and BDSM fan Christian Grey. She wants to date him, but he wants to employ her as his newest submissive. Slap and tickle ensues (read: a lot of slapping and not much tickling). They dance an uneasy line between kink and domesticity in penthouses, fancy restaurants and expensive cars. There are helicopter crashes, crazed exes and a kidnapping. He opens up about his childhood trauma and becomes more loving. They get married and Grey decides he no longer wants to inflict pain on his wife. They have two kids. The end. The world was fascinated by its success, as it often is when something enjoyed by women and girls breaks through. Much was made of the power imbalance between Grey and Steele: after years of fighting for equality, did modern women secretly want to be tied up and forced to submit? Was it a feminist win or deeply regressive? The critics guffawed at lines such as: \u201cHis voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel ... or something.\u201d The New York Times said it was \u201clike a Bront\u00eb devoid of talent\u201d, while Salman Rushdie said: \u201cI\u2019ve never read anything so badly written that got published.\u201d Immediately, attempts were made to measure its impact. Science was involved. Experts variously claimed that Fifty Shades was a sexual turn-off (among college-age women); a measure of women\u2019s self-esteem (fans aged between 18 and 24 were more likely to binge drink, have eating disorders and end up in abusive relationships); responsible for increasing STDs among the over-50s (anecdotal); and covered in herpes and cocaine (according to two Belgian professors who studied the surfaces of library copies). Sociologists predicted a boom in babies that could never be causally linked. Anecdotally, women on mum forums talked about their incumbent \u201cFifty Shades baby\u201d, while retailers cashed in on knockoff \u201cGeneration Grey\u201d onesies. These days, with fourth-wave feminism, the ubiquity of hardcore pornography and the politics of the #MeToo movement, when millennials cheerfully joke about \u201ceating ass\u201d and choking has been normalised, Fifty Shades has been left looking a little naff. Yes, there are butt plugs and handcuffs, but the books feel very conservative now, with many of Grey and Steele\u2019s simultaneous orgasms achieved in missionary as they gaze into each other\u2019s eyes. Reading all 1,500 pages of the trilogy left me thinking, more than once: \u201cI\u2019ve had weirder sex than this on a Tuesday.\u201d Charity shops began refusing donations of second-hand copies; one Oxfam in Swansea received so many that staff built a fort out of them. A hotel owner in France told me of the season they were saddled with 150 discarded copies in different languages, while a sex-shop worker said that, when told the vibrator or clitoral chain they are holding is Fifty Shades-branded, most customers put them down. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, because they\u2019re really good products,\u201d the shop assistant said. \u201cVery good anal beads.\u201d The sex educator Evie Fehilly had experienced abusive sex; when Fifty Shades became a hit, she read all three. \u201cA lot of survivors have this, where you were put in a situation where you have no control and come to fantasise about it afterwards. Fifty Shades tapped into that very interestingly,\u201d she says. \u201cI began engaging with those feelings in a very formalised way with kink, where it is all about consent, best practice and safety. Playing with those roles of the dominant and the submissive was so cathartic for me and really helped me love sex again.\u201d For years, BDSM practitioners and domestic abuse campaigners have accused the series of normalising abusive behaviour, arguing Grey\u2019s posessiveness, jealousy and obsession with Steele had been unhelpfully conflated with BDSM. Natalie Collins set up the Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse campaign in 2014 because she was concerned about \u201chow many women and girls might think abuse is normal or sexy, and how the series might add to that\u201d. She adds: \u201cFifty Shades brought a niche sexual practice with its own rules, nuances and safety mechanisms into mainstream consciousness, without bringing any of the rules, nuances or safety mechanisms with it. It led to a shift in cultural consciousness which now presumes that, rather than this being a niche thing, large swathes of women are turned on by pain and powerlessness.\u201d BDSM practitioners also hated the connection between Grey\u2019s childhood and his sexuality. (\u201cI like to whip little brown-haired girls like you because you all look like the crack whore \u2013 my birth mother,\u201d Grey tells Steele.) At the height of its popularity, the US sex-advice columnist Dan Savage issued a plea to Fifty Shades fans: \u201cBDSM is cops and robbers for grownups with your pants off \u2026 it\u2019s not a cry for help.\u201d A few years ago, students in Fehilly\u2019s kink classes would cite the books as their reason for being there. Now, no one mentions them at all, although Fehilly does credit them for bringing BDSM into the mainstream \u2013 despite the caveats about Grey. \u201cIt is OK to be damaged and enjoy kink, as long as you do it with a lot of communication and enthusiastic consent. For that reason, the kink community would kick Christian Grey out in a heartbeat,\u201d Fehilly says. \u201cThere are four pillars in BDSM \u2013 trust, communication, respect, and honesty \u2013 and they are not always there in Fifty Shades.\u201d Fifty Shades even, and the subsequent ubiquity of kink on morning television and in women\u2019s magazines, had an impact on people who hadn\u2019t read the books. Adele (not her real name), a 23-year-old dominatrix, only skimmed the first as a teenager, but believes they allowed her to explore kink without shame. \u201cMy mum and aunties were reading them, and everyone was talking about BDSM,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I realised I wanted to try being domme at 19, there was no confusion about it. I knew what it meant just because it was always part of the conversation about ways to have sex.\u201d \u201cFor the first time ever, kink is cool and we have to credit Fifty Shades for starting that conversation,\u201d Fehilly says. \u201cFor James to introduce people who have P-in-V [penis in vagina] sex a couple of times a month to things like spreader bars and butt plugs, that\u2019s pretty outrageous and exciting.\u201d The companies that made the spreader bars and butt plugs found it pretty exciting, too. In 2011, Bonny Hall, a product developer at the sex toy company Lovehoney, was watching the industry go through a gloomy patch. Then Fifty Shades of Grey was published. The Bath-based company proposed an official line of toys to James; they had a deal by July 2012 and within a week Hall was in China starting development. \u201cIt was the perfect relationship. Both Erika and I wanted customers to be able to re-enact what they liked in the book exactly as she wrote them,\u201d Hall says. The first products sold out in two weeks and Hall says they were \u201cworking around the clock\u201d for six months straight. In 2012, there was a worldwide shortage of kegel balls due to Grey\u2019s fondness for inserting them into Steele; overnight, Lovehoney went from selling 300 a month to 3,000. A decade on, Lovehoney\u2019s annual sales have increased tenfold to \u00a3100m a year; its biggest growth area has been bondage. \u201cIt was amazing what a boost it gave us,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThere are businesses that would not exist today without Fifty Shades,\u201d says Hall. \u201cPeople who had never been inside a sex shop started going in, particularly women, as it didn\u2019t feel seedy any more. These days, 45% of our customers are new.

The \u00a3165m Woodhouse colliery in Cumbria was given cross party-backing in March 2019, leading to protests from climate campaigners who said the mine would harm the UK\u2019s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Now a report by the independent thinktank the Green Alliance has found the colliery, along the coast from Whitehaven, will hold back the development of low-carbon steelmaking. The report, authored by two university professors who specialise in environmental issues, claims that opening a new coalmine would hinder this strategy by ensuring the continued availability of cheap coal. It also refutes Cumbria county council\u2019s claim that the mine, which aims to process 2.5m tonnes of coking coal a year for the UK and European steel industry, replacing imports from the US, Canada, Russia and Colombia, will be carbon neutral. Prof Rebecca Willis and Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University, say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than 1 million households.

      "body": "<p>The final Democratic debate before voting begins in the Iowa caucus early next month ended in a testy confrontation between progressive senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/14/democrats-iowa-debate-2020-warren-sanders-biden-buttigieg\">Elizabeth Warren's confrontation with Bernie Sanders caps testy debate night</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it also had numerous other moments of tension, argument and policy to and fro. Here are some of they key takeaways:</p> \n<h2>Sanders v Warren: the fight goes on</h2> \n<p>In past debates Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been like a married couple who catch each other\u2019s eye at a party full of annoying guests. But on Tuesday they were more like divorcees with old slights and recriminations boiling to the surface.</p> \n<p>Sanders denied telling Warren during a private meeting in December 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Sanders said. </p> \n<p>Warren said: \u201cBernie is my friend and I\u2019m not here to fight with Bernie.\u201d But then she delivered a killer line: \u201cLook at the men on this stage: collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women: Amy [Klobuchar] and me. And the only person who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most observers felt that Warren won the exchange and Sanders had somehow alienated the Hillary Clinton wing of the party even more.</p> \n<p>At the end of the debate, Sanders tried to shake Warren\u2019s hand but was rebuffed. Warren clasped her hands together and uttered some strong words. Sanders seemed momentarily taken aback, then talked some and walked grumpily away so fast that he almost missed Tom Steyer\u2019s handshake.</p> \n<p>If that\u2019s the mood of the candidates, imagine their fervent fanbases.</p> \n<h2>The vanilla debate</h2> \n<p>The candidates were cautious, less aggressive than might be expected and likely did little to change voters\u2019 minds.</p> \n<p>For the first time, there were no candidates of color and it showed. Diverse candidates bring diverse viewpoints. They were missed.</p> \n<p>Deval Patrick, the only African American left in the race, said: \u201cTonight, six Democrats were on the debate stage for over two hours. There were many good ideas from strong candidates, but there was not one question about racism in tonight\u2019s debate. Not one.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were also no candidates of colorfulness. No Tulsi Gabbard, no Marianne Williamson, no Andrew Yang. This could matter because, come the general election, the nominee will be up against Trump, reality TV star, circus master and greatest showman.

      "bodyText": "The final Democratic debate before voting begins in the Iowa caucus early next month ended in a testy confrontation between progressive senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But it also had numerous other moments of tension, argument and policy to and fro. Here are some of they key takeaways: Sanders v Warren: the fight goes on In past debates Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been like a married couple who catch each other\u2019s eye at a party full of annoying guests. But on Tuesday they were more like divorcees with old slights and recriminations boiling to the surface. Sanders denied telling Warren during a private meeting in December 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Sanders said. Warren said: \u201cBernie is my friend and I\u2019m not here to fight with Bernie.\u201d But then she delivered a killer line: \u201cLook at the men on this stage: collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women: Amy [Klobuchar] and me. And the only person who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.\u201d Most observers felt that Warren won the exchange and Sanders had somehow alienated the Hillary Clinton wing of the party even more. At the end of the debate, Sanders tried to shake Warren\u2019s hand but was rebuffed. Warren clasped her hands together and uttered some strong words. Sanders seemed momentarily taken aback, then talked some and walked grumpily away so fast that he almost missed Tom Steyer\u2019s handshake. If that\u2019s the mood of the candidates, imagine their fervent fanbases. The vanilla debate The candidates were cautious, less aggressive than might be expected and likely did little to change voters\u2019 minds. For the first time, there were no candidates of color and it showed. Diverse candidates bring diverse viewpoints. They were missed. Deval Patrick, the only African American left in the race, said: \u201cTonight, six Democrats were on the debate stage for over two hours. There were many good ideas from strong candidates, but there was not one question about racism in tonight\u2019s debate. Not one.\u201d There were also no candidates of colorfulness. No Tulsi Gabbard, no Marianne Williamson, no Andrew Yang. This could matter because, come the general election, the nominee will be up against Trump, reality TV star, circus master and greatest showman. In the media age, some star quality is required. Biden is still the frontrunner Such is the soft bigotry of low expectations, Biden can be relieved that he avoided any major pre-caucus gaffes. The days when Kamala Harris went for his jugular now seem a long time ago. But he was, once again, questioned over his vote in favor of the Iraq war, newly pertinent in the light of Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to kill the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a drone strike. \u201cI said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn\u2019t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what \u2013 thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt was a mistake, and I acknowledged that.\u201d Biden loyalists were happy. \u201cJoe Biden looked like a president tonight \u2013 he was strong and steady,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, former secretary of agriculture and governor of Iowa. But not for the first time, Biden\u2019s main gain came by default. The debate was largely inconsequential. Media oxygen will be consumed by the Sanders v Warren clash, then the impeachment trial.

Here are some of the biggest takeaways from the seventh Democratic debate, the final debate before the Iowa caucuses:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Elizbaeth Warren </strong>and <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>clashed over reports that Sanders told Warren a woman could not be elected president, which the Vermont senator denied. After the debate ended, Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Sanders, and the pair engaged in a seemingly contentious exchange that was not picked up by a microphone.</li> \n   <li>Despite the post-debate drama, the night was largely notable for the lack of explosive moments. The candidates were mostly civil toward each other as they laid out their policy differences. </li> \n   <li>The beginning of the debate was dominated by a foreign-policy discussion, as US-Iranian tensions escalate. The candidates outlined their visions for America\u2019s future in the Middle East while largely warning against engaging in \u201cendless wars\u201d, but Sanders made a point to criticize <strong>Joe Biden </strong>for his 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war.</li> \n   <li>The debate was notable for who was not on stage. Tonight\u2019s event featured the smallest and whitest stage yet, a trend that has sparked criticism against the Democratic National Committee.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The US politics live blog will be back tomorrow to cover the latest on the Senate impeachment trial.

the Suleimani strike was carried out to prevent an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans, but the White House declined to provide specifics on the threat.</p> \n  <p>Then, Trump said that the

(The Democratic National Committee was prepared to move the debate if a Senate trial was already underway.) </p> \n  <p>Still, according to the timeline offered by Pelosi and the Senate majority leader, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Mitch McConnell</strong>, on Tuesday, the ensuing impeachment trial is likely to play out at a critical moment as the candidates make their closing arguments before voting begins on 3 February.</p> \n  <p>The upcoming Senate trial, expected to begin next Tuesday, creates uncertainty for the senators running for president. Three of the candidates on stage \u2013 senators <strong>Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren</strong> and <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong> \u2013 will be pulled off the campaign trail for days or possibly weeks to sit for the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial. They are not allowed to speak during the trial, eliminating the chance for a courtroom showdown between a presidential hopeful and the president\u2019s team. </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the field\u2019s frontrunner, has been a central figure in the impeachment scandal. The charges against Trump stem from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, <strong>Hunter</strong>, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice-president. Despite no evidence of wrongdoing, Republicans are demanding Hunter Biden testify before the Senate. </p> \n  <p>Compounding the situation, the New York Times reported that the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, was \u201csuccessfully\u201d hacked by Russia, an effort that mirrors the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Biden has said these efforts are an indication that not only Trump but Russia, too, is afraid to run against him. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T01:01:11.475Z\">at 1.01am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1e59ae8f08d66fcfaa4180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-15T00:18:38.060Z\">12.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Even though six Democratic presidential candidates failed to meet the polling requirement for tonight\u2019s debate, one candidate who did manage to cross that threshold will not be onstage tonight: <strong>Michael Bloomberg.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eba9723ffa8bb8fe98f00593bc467d4bda7076ce\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba9723ffa8bb8fe98f00593bc467d4bda7076ce/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Bloomberg visits San Marcos, Texas, while on a five-stop presidential campaign tour the state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Bloomberg visits San Marcos, Texas, while on a five-stop presidential campaign tour the state.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Daemmrich/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The former New York mayor has surged into fifth place in national polls.

Earlier this month, <strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro</strong>, the only Latino candidate to run in 2020, ended his campaign. Businessman <strong>Andrew Yang</strong> was the sole candidate of color on stage during the last debate in Los Angeles but did not qualify for this round. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo one on that stage has ever been questioned about their citizenship or if they\u2019re a \u2018real\u2019 American or been followed by store security when shopping,\u201d said former Massachusetts governor <strong>Deval Patrick</strong>, who is the only black candidate still in the race. \u201cNo one has ever asked themselves whether a rejection for a job or an apartment or a loan was because of their race \u2014 though millions of Americans still do. Racism is the most consequential unfinished business of America. An election without those issues addressed by all the candidates is not consequential enough.\u201d </p> \n  <p>In an interview on CBS, Booker <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cory-booker-on-lack-of-debate-diversity-i-am-very-concerned/\">said</a> the party has to \u201cdo a better job\u201d of addressing the structural barriers that still exist for candidates of color and women running for office. </p> \n  <p>Part of that problem is that Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, play an outsized role in selecting the presidential nominee. Polling in these early states helps qualify candidates for the debates. </p> \n  <p>But there is also a heightened focus on \u201celectability\u201d this cycle among a Democratic electorate that still carries scar tissue from losing to <strong>Trump</strong> in 2016. Electability is an ill-defined concept that often works against candidates of color and women. </p> \n  <p>To be sure, there is still opportunities to break barriers: senators <strong>Elizabeth Warren </strong>and <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong> would be the first female president; <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> would be the first Jewish president and <strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong> would be the first openly gay president and the youngest. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1e52178f088d80a182b0be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T23:45:23.059Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Democratic presidential candidates debate for final time before voting starts</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Greetings from Iowa, live blog readers! </p> \n  <p>The seventh Democratic debate is set to kick off in about two hours, as presidential candidates face off for one last time before Iowa holds the first caucuses in 20 days.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20bc72f307e2dc071e29afd299e771be9fbce72\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20bc72f307e2dc071e29afd299e771be9fbce72/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The CNN logo is seen on the stage before the seventh Democratic debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CNN logo is seen on the stage before the seventh Democratic debate.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Tonight\u2019s debate is taking place at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and it will feature the smallest (and whitest) field yet.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from the seventh Democratic debate, the final debate before the Iowa caucuses: Elizbaeth Warren and Bernie Sanders clashed over reports that Sanders told Warren a woman could not be elected president, which the Vermont senator denied. After the debate ended, Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Sanders, and the pair engaged in a seemingly contentious exchange that was not picked up by a microphone. Despite the post-debate drama, the night was largely notable for the lack of explosive moments. The candidates were mostly civil toward each other as they laid out their policy differences. The beginning of the debate was dominated by a foreign-policy discussion, as US-Iranian tensions escalate. The candidates outlined their visions for America\u2019s future in the Middle East while largely warning against engaging in \u201cendless wars\u201d, but Sanders made a point to criticize Joe Biden for his 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war. The debate was notable for who was not on stage. Tonight\u2019s event featured the smallest and whitest stage yet, a trend that has sparked criticism against the Democratic National Committee. The US politics live blog will be back tomorrow to cover the latest on the Senate impeachment trial. Thanks for following our live debate coverage from Iowa. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign said the Vermont senator brought in $1.7m tonight, marking his strongest fundraising performance during a presidential debate yet. Sanders has outpaced his rivals in terms of fundraising, bringing in $34.5m during the final quarter of 2019 thanks to the strength of his grassroots support. The second-largest Democratic haul during that quarter belonged to Pete Buttigieg, who raised $24.7m. But Trump outraised all of the Democratic candidates with his $46m total for the quarter. Speaking to CBS News after the debate, Amy Klobuchar said she was opposed to proposed press limitations on Capitol Hill as the Senate advances toward an impeachment trial. Roll Call reported earlier today: The Senate sergeant-at-arms and Capitol Police are launching an unprecedented crackdown on the Capitol press corps for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, following a standoff between the Capitol\u2019s chief security officials, Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt and the standing committees of correspondents. Capitol Police Chief Steven A Sund and Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael C. Stenger will enact a plan that intends to protect senators and the chamber, but it also suggests that credentialed reporters and photographers whom senators interact with on a daily basis are considered a threat. Additional security screening and limited movement within the Capitol for reporters are two issues that are drawing criticism from Capitol Hill media. The Standing Committee of Correspondents, which represents journalists credentialed in the daily press galleries in the House and Senate, has come out forcefully against the planned restrictions that it says rejected every suggestion made by the correspondents \u2018without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.\u2019 Pressed again about what he overheard between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders after the debate, Tom Steyer said he tried to quickly move away from the contentious-looking exchange. \u201cI felt like, OK, there\u2019s something going on here. Goodnight, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d the billinoaire activist said. \u201cIt was one of those awkward moments where I felt like, OK, I need to move on as fast as possible.\u201d The two progressive senators appeared to share tense words after Warren rejected Sanders\u2019 handshake. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss in Des Moines, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders, pleaded ignorance on the words the Vermont senator exchanged with Elizabeth Warren after the debate concluded. Daniel Strauss: You don\u2019t know what the two said? Because it looked like a heated exchange. Jeff Weaver: I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. I saw what you saw. DS: I\u2019ve watched a lot of debates, man. I\u2019ve never seen that. JW: I watched what you watched. DS: What are you going to ask Senator Sanders about that? JW: \u201cHey Bernie, what was going on in that moment?\u201d Weaver, who served as Sanders\u2019 campagin manager in 2016, added, \u201cLook, they\u2019re friends, they respect each other. They\u2019ve obviously had \u2013 it\u2019s a political campaign and when you run in a political campaign, there\u2019s disagreements, so that\u2019s it.\u201d For some, Warren\u2019s refusal to shake hands with Sanders has delivered the most compelling moment of the night. It\u2019s now one of the biggest topics of conversation around the debate happening online, with many calling on experts to decode the exchange: And already the jokes have started to roll in: After the conclusion of the seventh Democratic debate, Trump took to Twitter to criticize (perhaps surprisingly) Tom Steyer. The president reshared a tweet from the Republican National Committee highlighting the billionaire activist\u2019s past financial ties to the fossil-fuel industry, echoing a question moderators posed earlier tonight about whether Steyer was the right messenger for combatting climate change. Steyer has spent nearly $20m on campaign ads so far, an investment that has helped catapult him into the top tier of candidates in the early-voting states of Nevada and South Carolina. But it\u2019s perplexing why Trump lashed out against Steyer, when he spoke the least out of all the Democratic candidates on stage tonight. An AP photographer captured the awkward moment as Tom Steyer appeared to walk into a tense conversation between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The moment when Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders at the end of the debate may have been the most contentious moment of the night. Depsite many commentators\u2019 predictions that the candidates were headed for the most tense debate yet as they vied for Iowa voters\u2019 affections, the night was generally calm as candidates laid out their policy differences. Amy Klobuchar, whose campaign rests on her performance in Iowa, attributed the candidates\u2019 civility to the kind disposition of the state\u2019s residents. After Elizabeth Warren was seen rejecting Bernie Sanders\u2019 handshake after the debate, much of Twitter erupted with the same question: what did Tom Steyer hear? As the two progressive senators were seemingly engaged in a tense conversation, Steyer walked over to shake their hands and likely overheard some of their exchange. But it appears the billionaire activist is not going to be very forthcoming with any details on what he heard. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, the only African-American candidate left in the Democratic presidential primary, criticized the debate\u2019s moderators for not asking the six white participants on stage tonight about racism. \u201cTonight, six Democrats were on the debate stage for over two hours,\u201d Patrick said in a statement. \u201cThere were many good ideas from strong candidates, but there was not one question about racism in tonight\u2019s debate. Not one. \u201cLet\u2019s face reality. Racism is not all there is to talk about, but when millions of Americans deal with it daily, encouraged by our president, when do we face their truths?\u201d Despite his tension with Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders had the best hour of fundraising during any debate so far, according to the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign. Here\u2019s how long each candidate spoke for during tonight\u2019s debate, according to the Washington Post: Here is the moment when Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders after the debate concluded: As the candidates moved off stage following the conclusion of the debate, Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders. The two then engaged in conversation before exiting the stage. The most tense moment of the night came when Sanders denied he told Warren a women could not be elected president, even though Warren substantiated reports indicating he had. Warren addressed the controversy by pointing out that she and the only other woman on stage, Amy Klobuchar, have a better record of electoral success than the male candidates participating tonight. Running about 10 minutes over, the seventh Democratic presidential debate has concluded in Des Moines, Iowa. The Guardian team will have more analysis and updates coming, so stay tuned. Pete Buttigieg said this election represented a unique opportunity to change the direction of the country and ensure average families can enjoy in the country\u2019s economic success. Elizabeth Warren began her closing statement by listing some of the issues that were not discussed tonight, such as student-loan forgiveness and disability rights. But the Massachusetts senator said she came to the stage with \u201ca heart filled with hope\u201d for the future of the country. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats that this was their moment to \u201cthink big, not small\u201d and \u201chave the courage to take on the 1%\u201d. Joe Biden began his closing statement by saying, \u201cCharacter is on the ballot.\u201d The former vice-president also warned another four years of Trump\u2019s presidency would cause irreversible damage to the country. The debate has now moved on to closing statements, with each candidate getting one minute to deliver a final pitch for their campaign. Senator Amy Klobuchar went first, arguing her moderate message would help to bring the country together and end \u201cthe noise and the nonsense\u201d. \u201cIt is easy to hurl insults,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cWhat is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth.\u201d Tom Steyer asked Iowa caucusgoers to support his candidacy in order to \u201ctake back the country\u201d and \u201csave the world\u201d. What\u2019s happening over on Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Twitter account at the moment? It\u2019s been posting dozens of tweets over the last few hours, including gems such as this: Has his account been hacked? Is his team trying to get attention? Alarmingly, the answer seems to be that it\u2019s all intentional, and that Bloomberg\u2019s team are the ones behind it all: And shockingly, not everyone is into it: The debate was scheduled to end about two minutes ago, but CNN has now gone to a commercial break, guaranteeing the event will run long. Asked about how he would fare in a debate against Trump, Joe Biden said he was prepared to go toe-to-toe with the president. \u201cI\u2019ve been the object of his affection now more than anyone else on this stage,\u201d the former vice-president said, prompting laughs from the debate audience. Biden argued average families were struggling under Trump\u2019s administration while the wealthiest Americans flourished, and he pledged to press the president on those issues. Who\u2019s winning the debate so far? Here\u2019s a take from the New York Times\u2019 Farhad Manjoo that\u2019s hard to argue with: The debate moderators have repeatedly pressed billionaire activist Tom Steyer on his background, citing his past financial connections to fossil fuels and lack of government experience. After the moderators noted Steyer made his fortune in part thanks to fossil fuels, the presidential candidate responded by pointing out he has since become a harsh critic of the industry and made bold promises on the climate. On the issue of his lack of government experience, Steyer insisted his decades of international business experience had prepared him for the Oval Office. Pete Buttigieg was pressed on his lack of support among black voters, as the former Indiana mayor languishes near 0% in polls of African-Americans. Buttigieg has argued his support among black voters is low because they are not familiar with him, but CNN moderator Abby Phillip pushed back against that, noting Buttigieg has been running for president for a year now. Buttigieg insisted African-American leaders who know him best have backed him, citing his recent endorsement from congressman Anthony Brown. However, Brown is currently the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Buttigieg. Over on Twitter some commentators aren\u2019t happy with how uninspired the debate has been so far. The author and Guardian US contributor Matt Stoller has suggested the candidates take matters into their own hands: Meanwhile, others are keen to move on to the really key questions... As the Democratic debate continues in Iowa, revelations are still emerging from the new impeachment evidence that House Democrats released hours ago. The Washington Post reports: New materials released by House Democrats appear to show Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor offering an associate of President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W Giuliani, damaging information related to former vice president Joe Biden if the Trump administration recalled the US ambassador to Ukraine. The text messages and documents provided to Congress by former Giuliani associate Lev Parnas also show that before the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was removed from her post, a Parnas associate now running for Congress sent menacing text messages suggesting that he had Yovanovitch under surveillance in Ukraine. A lawyer for Yovanovitch said Tuesday that the episode should be investigated. The cache of materials released by House investigators late Tuesday exposed a number of previously unknown details about efforts by Giuliani and his associates to obtain material in Ukraine that would undermine Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who will serve as a juror in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, was asked about how the trial would affect her ability to campaign in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses. \u201cSome things are more important than politics,\u201d Warren said, adding that it was her \u201cresponsibility\u201d to serve as a juror in the trial. The impeachment trial will likely keep Warren, as well as her Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, off the campaign trial during a key phase of the primary. The debate has turned to impeachment, with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asking Joe Biden whether he is worried Trump will be able to claim \u201cvindication\u201d if he is acquitted by the Senate. Biden asserted House speaker Nancy Pelosi had \u201cno choice\u201d but to transmit the articles of impeachment because Trump committed impeachable offenses, adding it was up to the Senate to decide whether to remove the president from office. Biden then slammed Trump for the \u201clies\u201d he has told about his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine, while conceding it would be more difficult to unite the country in the wake of the impeachment trial. Amy Klobuchar, who will serve as a juror in the Senate trial, said Trump\u2019s impeachment was serving as a \u201cdecency check\u201d on the president. Laura Kelly, the governor of Kansas, has reacted to Amy Klobuchar\u2019s shoutout from the debate stage. Earlier tonight, Klobuchar cited Kelly as an example of how women can win in traditionally red states. But there was an awkward moment when Klobuchar cited Kelly\u2019s 2018 victory, as the Minnesota senator appeared to briefly blank on the Kansas governor\u2019s name. Similar to previous debates, the questions from the moderators have been coming under heavy criticism. One of the most common complaints has been about the approach CNN has taken to questions about the cost of healthcare v the cost of war: Asked about the costs of childcare, Joe Biden recounted caring for his two sons after the deaths of his wife and daughter shortly after he was first elected as a senator in 1972. Biden said he understood the pain of not being able to afford childcare, and the former vice president vowed his administration would vastly increase funds for early education. Biden concluded his answer by lightly mocking his opponents: \u201cMy time is up, I know, but I\u2019m not going to go over like everybody.\u201d The debate has turned to the issue of childcare, as moderators took a question from an Iowa resident who was forced to exit the workforce because of high childcare costs. Pete Buttigieg said the costs of childcare pushing Americans out of the workforce made \u201cno sense.\u201d The former Indiana mayor pledged that, under his administration, childcare would not cost more than 7% of a family\u2019s income. Meanwhile the Washington Post has been tracking who has talked the most so far in the debate: Joe Biden got in a jab against Pete Buttigieg after the former Indiana mayor claimed his healthcare plan represented \u201cbiggest thing we\u2019ve achieved on healthcare in the last half century\u201d. Biden argued the largest healthcare achievement in recent decades was the passage of the Affordable Care Act, again drawing attention back to his service as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. Here\u2019s the moment when all the tensions that have been building between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week came to a head. Warren was asked about media reports that Sanders had told her that a woman candidate couldn\u2019t defeat Trump. Her reply? She pointed out a key difference between the men and women on stage: So far, so mild \u2013 but Warren then directly challenged Bernie in this awkward exchange: Echoing past debates, a divide developed on stage between those candidates supporting Medicare for All and those advocating for only an expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Amy Klobuchar criticized her Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders, for allegedly being evasive about how much his Medicare for All plan will cost the country. \u201cI think you should show how you\u2019re going to pay for something, Bernie,\u201d Klobuchar said. Elizabeth Warren, who supports Medicare for All, then ackowledged that the healthcare plans proposed by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg were \u201can improvement over where we are right now,\u201d but she said their plans were only a \u201csmall improvement\u201d. Buttigieg shot back, \u201cIt\u2019s just not true that the plan I\u2019m proposing is small.\u201d The former Indiana mayor argued a proposal\u2019s boldness should not be measured by its pricetag. After the first commercial break of the debate, Bernie Sanders had spoken more than any other candidate, taking up about twice as much time as Tom Steyer. Steyer was the last candidate to qualify for the debate with a pair of impressive polls from the early-voting states of Nevada and South Carolina, but the billionaire activist has largely drifted into the background so far. The Democratic debate has returned from a commercial break, and the conversation has turned to healthcare. Bernie Sanders defended his Medicare for All proposal, which he has centered his presidential campaign around. The moderators then turned to Joe Biden, who argued that Sanders and other candidates in favor of Medicare for All were underestimating the costs of switching to a single-payer system. \u201cI think we need to be candid with voters,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think we need to tell them what we\u2019re going to do and what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d Just before the Democratic debate went to a commercial break, Joe Biden echoed other candidates\u2019 belief that a woman can win a presidential race. However, earlier this month, the former vice-president seemed to indicate he would outperform Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 results because he would not be subjected to sexism. Biden said Clinton had been the victim of \u201cunfair\u201d sexist attacks before adding, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen with me.\u201d After Bernie Sanders denied he ever said that a woman cannot be elected president, CNN moderator Abby Phillip then cheekily asked Elizabeth Warren what she thought when Sanders expressed that view. \u201cI disagreed,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBernie is my friend, and I\u2019m not here to fight with Bernie.\u201d But the Massachusetts senator then noted she was the only person on stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years. \u201cLook at the men on this stage,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCollectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women. Amy and me,\u201d referring to senator Amy Klobuchar. Responding to a report that he said a woman could not win the White House, Bernie Sanders denied ever expressing that view. \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Sanders said. According to a CNN report, the Vermont senator told Elizabeth Warren that a woman could not win a presidential race during a private 2018 meeting. Sanders said it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d that he would hold such a view, referring the debate audience to 30-year-old YouTube videos contradicting that opinion. Bernie Sanders stood by his opposition to the renegotiated North American trade deal, even though the agreement has been endorsed by the union federation AFL-CIO. Sanders argued the deal was opposed by many other labor groups and a number of environmental groups, indicating the agreement was still not good enough to support. Another senator on stage who supports the deal, Amy Klobuchar, then jumped in to say, \u201cI want to hit reality here.\u201d The Minnesota senator argued real Americans had been hurt by Trump\u2019s trade wars and that they would be helped by this deal. Tonight\u2019s debate kicked off with a wide-ranging discussion on foreign policy, amid rising tensions between the US and Iran. Here\u2019s what some notable viewers have made of it so far, starting with the Guardian US columnist and former labor secretary Robert Reich: And here\u2019s Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, with a jibe at Biden\u2019s record during the Obama years: Although not everyone has been taking everything so seriously; here\u2019s the Financial Times\u2019 chief US commentator: Democrats expected this debate to be a bare-knuckle brawl centered on the newly tense rivalry between the senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Healthcare and whether a woman could beat Donald Trump seemed like the most likely debate topics. Instead the first half an hour of the debate was a fairly civil discussion on foreign policy and the Middle East. At times Sanders tried to contrast his opposition to the war in Iraq with Biden\u2019s past support, but neither candidate engaged in the kind of heated exchanges that marked major moments in previous debates. Senator Amy Klobuchar refrained from bashing the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg on his foreign policy credentials. And Warren didn\u2019t try to bash Sanders. The candidates seemed more willing to articulate their positions than really bicker with each other. Joe Biden and Tom Steyer have both said they would not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un without preconditions, criticizing Trump\u2019s approach to Pyongyang. Biden noted that Kim once called him a \u201crabid dog\u201d who should be \u201cbeaten to death\u201d. That prompted Bernie Sanders to jump in with a joke: \u201cBut other than that, you like him?\u201d Asked about preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, Pete Buttigieg said his administration would make that goal \u201ca priority\u201d in order to keep Americans safe. \u201cOur security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear,\u201d the Afghanistan war veteran said. Buttigieg accused the Trump administration of increasing the likelihood that Iran becomes a nuclear power by abanding the 2015 nuclear deal. Pete Buttigieg said the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that has allowed presidential administrations to carry out military actions in the Middle East needs to be replaced. Joe Biden quickly echoed Buttigieg\u2019s argument, but prominent Democrats \u2013 including the House speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 have warned that passing a new AUMF will require extensive debate on the timing, geography and scope of the measure. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would pull \u201ccombat\u201d troops out of the Middle East, but that distinction could leave her some wiggle room to keep some US forces in the region. Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, addressed the issue of leaving troops in the region by recounting the sacrifices made by his fellow service members. Asked about America\u2019s continued presence in the Middle East, Joe Biden said he would keep \u201csmall numbers of troops\u201d in the region with the goal of \u201cpatrolling the Gulf\u201d and confronting the Islamic State. The former vice-president then said he believed that Trump had \u201cflat-out lied\u201d about the threat posed by the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The president has claimed Iranians were planning attacks on four US embassies when he ordered the drone strike that killed Suleimani, but he has provided no evidence to support that. Addressing how he was prepared to serve as commander-in-chief, Pete Buttigieg, who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, argued his generation was suffering the consequences of votes cast more than 15 years ago. \u201cThere are enlisted people I served with barely old enough to remember those votes,\u201d Buttigieg said. Bernie Sanders, who has criticized Joe Biden for voting in favor of the Iraq war in 2002, was pressed by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on his initial support for the war in Afghanistan. But the Vermont senator dismissed that question, arguing the war in Iraq was a much more significant blunder than the conflict in Afghanistan. Addressing why he was best prepared to serve as commander-in-chief, Joe Biden said his oft-repeated line about coming to oppose the Iraq war, even though the former senator originally voted in favor of the war. Biden defended his foreign-policy record by pointing to his service as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. \u201cThe man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice-president,\u201d Biden said. Biden ultimately said he was overall the most experienced candidate when it came to foreign policy. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to compare [my record] to anybody\u2019s on this stage,\u201d Biden said. CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer posed the first question of the debate, unsurprisingly asking the candidates why they were best prepared to serve as commander-in-chief while US-Iranian tensions escalate. \u201cI think my record speaks to that,\u201d Bernie Sanders said, pivoting to his 2002 vote as a House member against the Iraq war, saying he predicted the war would lead to \u201cunprecedented levels of chaos in the region\u201d. \u201cI not only voted against the war; I helped lead the effort against that war,\u201d the Vermont senator said. The seventh Democratic presidential debate, the final debate before the first caucuses take place in Iowa on 3 February, has begun. The six Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight\u2019s debate \u2013 former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire activist Tom Steyer \u2013 have taken the stage. The candidates\u2019 podium order on stage was determined by polling in recent weeks, giving Biden and Sanders center-stage placement for tonight\u2019s event. Meanwhile, Klobuchar and Steyer\u2019s podiums are on the ends of the debate stage because of their lower polling numbers. The six Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight\u2019s debate have taken the stage, and the event will begin in just a few moments. The seventh Democratic debate is set to begin in less than 10 minutes here in Des Moines, Iowa. The event is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. local time and should wrap up around 10 p.m. Tonight\u2019s debate will be hosted by CNN, in partnership with the Des Moines Register, and it will be held at Drake University. It can be streamed on CNN, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol and CNN International, as well as the Des Moines Register\u2019s homepage. The three moderators for tonight\u2019s event are CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and Abby Phillip and the Des Moines Register\u2019s Brianne Pfannenstiel. The live blog will be providing updates and analysis from the debate site, so stay tuned. Six candidates will soon take the debate stage at Drake University here in Iowa, making it the smallest debate yet of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Those six candidates represent half of the field. The requirements for the debate were the highest yet of this cycle, preventing six contenders from making the debate stage. The debate is also the least diverse so far, with no people of color on the stage and only two women. That\u2019s a point that hasn\u2019t been lost on some of the candidates who didn\u2019t make the stage. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is the only African-American remaining in the race, released a lengthy statement earlier in the day urging candidates who qualified for the debate to address topics germane to people of color. \u201cThe remaining candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president, and in particular, those who have the privilege of being on the debate stage tonight must keep the issues facing people of color in the forefront as we address the future of our country,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cRacism, environmental justice, economic opportunity, gun safety, health disparities, and mass incarceration cannot be issues reserved for politically comfortable places. We cannot win in November without voters of color, nor should we. More importantly, America cannot win without fully and fairly addressing the unfinished business of race.\u201d The campaign for Tulsi Gabbard, another candidate who didn\u2019t make the debate, sent an email to supporters from Cody Two Bears, who has backed the Hawaii congresswoman, saying none of the candidates represent her base. \u201cNot one of those candidates on the stage tonight speak for me. Most don\u2019t speak for you,\u201d Two Bears wrote in the email. \u201cBillionaires and millionaires, people who bought their way onto the stage, establishment mouthpieces, a candidate who appropriated my culture \u2014 they don\u2019t represent our diverse American voices.\u201d The debate is set to begin in about 30 minutes, so here is a refresher on the candidates who will be on stage tonight. Joe Biden, the former vice-president who has proven to be a very durable frontrunner as he continues to lead in national polls, despite a number of gaffes on the campaign trail and the debate stage. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has surged into second place and attracted the support of a number of progressive groups in recent weeks. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has seen her polling numbers slump recently, while Sanders has overtaken her as the top-polling progressive candidate. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who continues to poll well in the first caucus state of Iowa but has had trouble recreating that success elsewhere as he struggles to win over voters of color. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to winning over Midwestern voters but has languished in single digits in polls. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who has spent nearly $20m on ads and become one of the top-polling candidates in the early voting states of Nevada and South Carolina. Those six candidates will soon face off in Des Moines, Iowa, so stay tuned to the blog. As the Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump has taken the stage at his campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The president defended ordering the drone strike against the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, again repeating his unfounded claim that Iranians were planning an attack on several US embassies. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t kill him, and let\u2019s say we lost three, four, five embassies,\u201d Trump said, calling Suleimani a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d. The president also weighed in on reports that Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Bernie said that, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. One question certain to come up tonight will be what America\u2019s future in the Middle East looks like, as tensions between Washington and Tehran escalate. After the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed in a US drone strike approved by Trump, several Democratic presidential candidates rushed to warn against America becoming involved in another \u201cendless war\u201d. The president and a number of senior administration officials initially claimed the Suleimani strike was carried out to prevent an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans, but the White House declined to provide specifics on the threat. Then, Trump said that the Iranians were planning attacks on four US embassies, a claim that the Washington Post called \u201cat best an unfounded theory and at worst a falsehood\u201d. The Democratic presidential candidates will likely be quick to criticize Trump for his handling of the Suleimani strike, but it will be interesting to see how they differ on their visions for America\u2019s future in the Middle East. Each of the six Democratic presidential candidates participating tonight will have guests cheering them on at the debate, but it\u2019s safe to say that only one of them will have a television star in their corner. Actor Mandy Moore, one of the stars of This Is Us, is attending the Des Moines debate as a guest of former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg. Moore also attended a town hall alongisde the predential candidate in Ames, Iowa, yesterday, drawing a crowd of about 800. \u201cHe\u2019s truly an original, and that\u2019s what this country need right now,\u201d Moore said in Ames. \u201cThis is not a TV show, this is reality, this country needs a leader right now, a leader who knows how to bring people together.\u201d The yearlong truce between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 the field\u2019s leading progressives \u2013 appears to be broken after an escalating war of words leaves both of them politically vulnerable. On Monday, Warren confirmed a CNN report that Sanders told Warren he believed a woman could not win the presidency during a private meeting in 2018. Sanders vehemently denies this account. \u201cI thought a woman could win; he disagreed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn\u2019t win,\u201d Sanders said in an earlier statement. Tensions have been simmering between the two campaigns for weeks as Sanders began to consolidate support in the early states. Over the weekend, Politico reported that the Sanders campaign had urged volunteers to describe Warren as the preferred candidate of affluent voters. Sanders distanced himself from the talking points, saying that his campaign employs hundreds of people who \u201csometimes say things that they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cI have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine.\u201d Still Warren told reporters that she was \u201cdisappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me.\u201d Both candidates seem eager to avoid an epic clash during the debate, but they will surely be asked to clarify their different recollections of the 2018 discussion. The political repercussions of this breach are still unknown but many progressive activists are starting to worry this internecine fight will undermine their cause and take the pressure off of Biden, the frontrunner and leading moderate in the race. As the Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate in Iowa, the most recent polling shows a close, four-way race in the first caucus state. According to the latest poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the two outlets hosting tonight\u2019s debate, Bernie Sanders narrowly leads in Iowa. The Vermont senator hit 20% in the widely respected survey \u2013 putting him 3 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren, 4 points ahead of Pete Buttigieg and 5 points ahead of Joe Biden. But another poll from the Hawkeye State, released by Monmouth University yesterday, showed Biden leading the pack with 24%. According to that survey, the former vice-president leads Sanders by 6 points, Buttigieg by 7 points and Warren by 9 points. There are still almost three weeks left before the 3 February caucuses, leaving plenty of time for those numbers to shift. Many Iowans attending campaign events in recent days have also said they could change their minds up until the day of the caucuses, so tonight\u2019s debate could go a long way in convincing the state\u2019s undecided voters. The final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses is about an hour away, but the biggest news is currently coming from Capitol Hill, where House Democrats just released new information to be used in the Senate impeachment trial. The new information includes documents from Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who has been indicted on campaign-finance charges. According to one document, Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, sent a letter to Ukrainian president-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy in May 2019. In the letter, Giuliani requests a meeting with Zelenskiy, claiming he was acting with Trump\u2019s \u201cknowledge and consent.\u201d \u201cIn my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you ... I will need no more than a half-hour of your time,\u201d Guiliani\u2019s wrote in the letter. Trump has previously claimed that he did not direct Giuliani to try to pressure Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. Hours before the debate on Tuesday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House would vote to send its impeachment charges against Donald Trump to the Senate the following day. This clash of news cycles was inevitable albeit less disruptive than initially feared. (The Democratic National Committee was prepared to move the debate if a Senate trial was already underway.) Still, according to the timeline offered by Pelosi and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday, the ensuing impeachment trial is likely to play out at a critical moment as the candidates make their closing arguments before voting begins on 3 February. The upcoming Senate trial, expected to begin next Tuesday, creates uncertainty for the senators running for president. Three of the candidates on stage \u2013 senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 will be pulled off the campaign trail for days or possibly weeks to sit for the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial. They are not allowed to speak during the trial, eliminating the chance for a courtroom showdown between a presidential hopeful and the president\u2019s team. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the field\u2019s frontrunner, has been a central figure in the impeachment scandal. The charges against Trump stem from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice-president. Despite no evidence of wrongdoing, Republicans are demanding Hunter Biden testify before the Senate. Compounding the situation, the New York Times reported that the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, was \u201csuccessfully\u201d hacked by Russia, an effort that mirrors the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Biden has said these efforts are an indication that not only Trump but Russia, too, is afraid to run against him. Even though six Democratic presidential candidates failed to meet the polling requirement for tonight\u2019s debate, one candidate who did manage to cross that threshold will not be onstage tonight: Michael Bloomberg. The former New York mayor has surged into fifth place in national polls. According to the RealClearPolitics average, Bloomberg is polling at 6.2% nationally, putting him only one point behind Pete Buttigieg. But Bloomberg did not qualify for tonight\u2019s debate stage because the self-funded billionaire candidate has pledged to not accept supporter contributions, leaving him unable to meet the Democratic National Committee\u2019s donor requirement. Despite his absence from the debate stage, Bloomberg is building a formidable campaign operation. The candidate, who only jumped into the race in late November, has already spent more than $200m on ads and has hired more than 1,000 staffers spread out across 33 states. Campaigning in the Super Tuesday state of Texas this past weekend, Bloomberg did not rule out the possibility of spending up to $1bn on the election. He added that he would make the most of his time spent off the debate stage. \u201cIf I wanted to complain, I could make a good case that it wasn\u2019t fair,\u201d Bloomberg said of being excluded from tonight\u2019s event. \u201cIn the meantime, while they\u2019re debating, I\u2019m out visiting a whole lot of people. I\u2019m not wasting the time.\u201d Six Democrats qualified for the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday. All are white. What began as the largest and most diverse presidential primary field in history has winnowed to an all-white top-tier that does not reflect the demographic diversity of the Democratic party. Now the party\u2019s candidates and voters are grappling with their lack of diversity, which was underscored on Monday by the departure of senator Cory Booker, who is black. Earlier this month, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino candidate to run in 2020, ended his campaign. Businessman Andrew Yang was the sole candidate of color on stage during the last debate in Los Angeles but did not qualify for this round. \u201cNo one on that stage has ever been questioned about their citizenship or if they\u2019re a \u2018real\u2019 American or been followed by store security when shopping,\u201d said former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is the only black candidate still in the race. \u201cNo one has ever asked themselves whether a rejection for a job or an apartment or a loan was because of their race \u2014 though millions of Americans still do. Racism is the most consequential unfinished business of America. An election without those issues addressed by all the candidates is not consequential enough.\u201d In an interview on CBS, Booker said the party has to \u201cdo a better job\u201d of addressing the structural barriers that still exist for candidates of color and women running for office. Part of that problem is that Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, play an outsized role in selecting the presidential nominee. Polling in these early states helps qualify candidates for the debates. But there is also a heightened focus on \u201celectability\u201d this cycle among a Democratic electorate that still carries scar tissue from losing to Trump in 2016. Electability is an ill-defined concept that often works against candidates of color and women. To be sure, there is still opportunities to break barriers: senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar would be the first female president; Bernie Sanders would be the first Jewish president and Pete Buttigieg would be the first openly gay president and the youngest. Greetings from Iowa, live blog readers! The seventh Democratic debate is set to kick off in about two hours, as presidential candidates face off for one last time before Iowa holds the first caucuses in 20 days. Tonight\u2019s debate is taking place at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and it will feature the smallest (and whitest) field yet. Only six candidates qualified for tonight\u2019s event: the former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. With less than three weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, tonight\u2019s debate could quickly turn contentious quickly as candidates seek to win over still-undecided voters. We\u2019ll soon find out. The blog will have more updates and analysis as we prepare for the debate to begin, so stay tuned.",

Some have since been deployed to Libya with others still undergoing training at camps in southern Turkey. More men from the Islamist Sham Legion are also considering travelling to Libya.</p> <p>The figures are significantly higher than most previous estimates.</p> <p>Once source said the Syrian men are expected to coalesce into a division named after Libyan resistance leader Omar al-Mukhtar, who was executed by Italy in 1931 and became popular in Syria during the 2011 Arab spring.</p> <p>The fighters have signed six-month contracts directly with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), rather than with the Turkish military, SNA sources said, for $2,000 (\u00a31,500) a month \u2013 a vast sum compared with the 450-550 Turkish lira (\u00a352-\u00a372) a month they earn in Syria. All have been promised Turkish nationality, a carrot Ankara has used to cajole fighters in brigades on its payroll for several years.</p> <p>Turkey is also paying medical bills for injured soldiers and is responsible for repatriating the dead to Syria. At least four<strong> </strong>Syrians have died in Libya already, the Guardian can confirm, although their units said they died while stationed on front lines against Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria.</p> <p>Last month phone footage of men with Syrian accents claiming to be in Tripoli surfaced on social media, in which one man said: \u201cThe Free Syrian Army is in Libya to defend Islam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe liberated this entire military camp from Haftar\u2019s forces,\u201d said another, before turning to a colleague to ask: \u201cWhat is his name? Haftar? Hantar?\u201d</p> <p>The footage was questioned by many who wondered how and why Syrian men \u2013 nominally still fighting in the nine-year-old war against Assad \u2013 had ended up so far from home.</p> <p>Both Ankara and Tripoli have repeatedly denied the presence of Syrian fighters in Libya, as has the SNA. The Guardian understands that Syrian fighters in the country have since been banned from posting any evidence of their whereabouts to social media.</p> <p>Turkey itself has so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/turbulence-for-turkey-as-breakaway-parties-make-gains-on-erdogan\">sent just 35 soldiers to Tripoli</a> in an advisory capacity, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said last week. Unlike last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/09/turkey-syria-attack-latest-news-kurds-trump\">October\u2019s incursion into Kurdish-held parts of Syria</a>, intervention in Libya has little support among the Turkish public.</p> <p>Speaking on Tuesday, however, after Haftar walked away from talks in Moscow without agreeing to a ceasefire, Erdo\u011fan said Turkey would not refrain from \u201cteaching a lesson he deserves\u201d to the Libyan warlord.</p> <p>Haftar is supported by Egypt, France, Jordan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, while Sarraj is backed by Italy, Qatar and Turkey. Officials from Sarraj\u2019s internationally recognised government have expressed anger that their allies, other than Turkey, have effectively abandoned them since Haftar declared his intention to capture Tripoli last April.</p> <p>The GNA was reportedly initially reluctant to accept Syrian fighters instead of Turkish troops but accepted the idea when Haftar\u2019s forces drew closer to the capital.</p> <p>Last month, the Guardian reported that an influx of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/24/mercenaries-flock-to-libya-raising-fears-of-prolonged-war\"> 3,000 Sudanese had been sent to Benghazi</a> to fight for Haftar, joining around 600 Russian mercenaries, in another sign the conflict\u2019s parameters are growing.</p> <p>\u201cLetting Syrian proxies do the fighting means that Ankara can avoid its own troops potentially clashing with Russian mercenaries,\u201d said Gazzini. \u201cThe next question is \u2013 will [Russian President Vladimir] Putin continue to greenlight this? Or will Libya take a backseat if Russia and Turkey decide to prioritise their other overlapping strategic interests?\u201d</p>",

The deployment came after Turkey agreed last month to come to the aid of the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, who is backed by the UN, in the face of a months-long campaign by his rival, the warlord Khalifa Haftar. Ankara has supported the Syrian opposition since the early days of the battle against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, even as the original Free Syrian Army umbrella group grew weak and splintered because of infighting and the growth of Islamist elements within rebel ranks. Turkey now uses some rebel fighters as proxies against Kurdish-led forces despite allegations of human rights abuses from watchdogs. \u201cThis is a very different situation to Syria,\u201d said Claudia Gazzini, a senior Libya analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cAnti-Turkish sentiment is already strong because of Ankara\u2019s intervention and could grow as a result of this, playing in Haftar\u2019s favour.\u201d An initial deployment of 300 men from the second division of the Syrian National Army (SNA), an umbrella of Syrian rebel groups funded by Turkey, left Syria through the Hawar Kilis military border crossing on 24 December, followed by 350 more on 29 December. They were then flown to Tripoli, the Libyan capital, where they have been posted to frontline positions in the east of the city. Another 1,350 men crossed into Turkey on 5 January. Some have since been deployed to Libya with others still undergoing training at camps in southern Turkey. More men from the Islamist Sham Legion are also considering travelling to Libya. The figures are significantly higher than most previous estimates. Once source said the Syrian men are expected to coalesce into a division named after Libyan resistance leader Omar al-Mukhtar, who was executed by Italy in 1931 and became popular in Syria during the 2011 Arab spring. The fighters have signed six-month contracts directly with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), rather than with the Turkish military, SNA sources said, for $2,000 (\u00a31,500) a month \u2013 a vast sum compared with the 450-550 Turkish lira (\u00a352-\u00a372) a month they earn in Syria. All have been promised Turkish nationality, a carrot Ankara has used to cajole fighters in brigades on its payroll for several years. Turkey is also paying medical bills for injured soldiers and is responsible for repatriating the dead to Syria. At least four Syrians have died in Libya already, the Guardian can confirm, although their units said they died while stationed on front lines against Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria. Last month phone footage of men with Syrian accents claiming to be in Tripoli surfaced on social media, in which one man said: \u201cThe Free Syrian Army is in Libya to defend Islam.\u201d \u201cWe liberated this entire military camp from Haftar\u2019s forces,\u201d said another, before turning to a colleague to ask: \u201cWhat is his name? Haftar? Hantar?\u201d The footage was questioned by many who wondered how and why Syrian men \u2013 nominally still fighting in the nine-year-old war against Assad \u2013 had ended up so far from home. Both Ankara and Tripoli have repeatedly denied the presence of Syrian fighters in Libya, as has the SNA. The Guardian understands that Syrian fighters in the country have since been banned from posting any evidence of their whereabouts to social media. Turkey itself has so far sent just 35 soldiers to Tripoli in an advisory capacity, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said last week. Unlike last October\u2019s incursion into Kurdish-held parts of Syria, intervention in Libya has little support among the Turkish public. Speaking on Tuesday, however, after Haftar walked away from talks in Moscow without agreeing to a ceasefire, Erdo\u011fan said Turkey would not refrain from \u201cteaching a lesson he deserves\u201d to the Libyan warlord. Haftar is supported by Egypt, France, Jordan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, while Sarraj is backed by Italy, Qatar and Turkey. Officials from Sarraj\u2019s internationally recognised government have expressed anger that their allies, other than Turkey, have effectively abandoned them since Haftar declared his intention to capture Tripoli last April. The GNA was reportedly initially reluctant to accept Syrian fighters instead of Turkish troops but accepted the idea when Haftar\u2019s forces drew closer to the capital. Last month, the Guardian reported that an influx of 3,000 Sudanese had been sent to Benghazi to fight for Haftar, joining around 600 Russian mercenaries, in another sign the conflict\u2019s parameters are growing. \u201cLetting Syrian proxies do the fighting means that Ankara can avoid its own troops potentially clashing with Russian mercenaries,\u201d said Gazzini. \u201cThe next question is \u2013 will [Russian President Vladimir] Putin continue to greenlight this? Or will Libya take a backseat if Russia and Turkey decide to prioritise their other overlapping strategic interests?\u201d",

The shooting, by a Saudi air force cadet who was training with US forces, is now considered an act of terrorism, Barr said.

Apple is one of many tech companies that have limited the amount of user data they store on their own servers in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations, in part in order to avoid being subject to government requests.

      "bodyText": "The Coalition awarded $100m in sport grants that were not assessed on their merits in order to favour \u201ctargeted\u201d Coalition seats at the May 2019 election, according to a scathing report from the Australian National Audit Office released on Wednesday. The report, by auditor general Grant Hehir, slammed the handling of the program by the then sports minister, Nationals deputy leader Bridget McKenzie, finding she ignored the merit-based assessment undertaken by Sports Australia for almost half the successful projects. The audit office found the successful applications were \u201cnot those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines\u201d, finding McKenzie\u2019s office had run a \u201cparallel\u201d assessment process in deciding how to hand out the funds. Its report found there was a distributional bias in the award of grants. \u201cThe award of funding reflected the approach documented by the Minister\u2019s Office of focusing on \u2018marginal\u2019 electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be \u2018targeted\u2019 by the Coalition at the 2019 Election,\u201d the audit said. \u201cApplications from projects located in those electorates were more successful in being awarded funding than if funding was allocated on the basis of merit assessed against the published program guidelines.\u201d The $100m program was administered by the Australian Sports Commission, known as Sport Australia, with the guidelines saying eligible applications would be assessed competitively against the three weighted merit criteria. However, Hehir found that the separate process undertaken by McKenzie\u2019s office \u201cdrew upon considerations other than those identified in the program guidelines, such as the location of projects\u201d. Her office \u201calso applied considerations that were inconsistent with the published guidelines\u201d, the auditor said. \u201cIt was this assessment process that predominantly informed the Minister\u2019s funding decisions, rather than Sport Australia\u2019s process,\u201d the audit said. Sports Australia had ranked the projects after assessing each application for eligibility and against the three merit criteria to arrive at an overall assessment score. The ANAO was tasked with examining the program after Labor questioned how the Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, was able to present a giant taxpayer-funded $127,373 cheque to the Yankalilla Bowling Club in February 2019. The program, called the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program, was announced in 2018 to ensure more Australians had access to quality sporting facilities, encouraging greater community participation in sport and physical activity. During a short application timeframe of just six weeks, Sport Australia received 2,056 project proposals seeking more than $396.6m. Funding totalling $100m was awarded to 684 projects across three rounds in the months before the election, with the final round announced in April. Hehir said that had a merit based process been followed, the cut-off score would have been 74 out of a possible 100. More than 400 projects received funding that were below this score, in defiance of recommendations made by Sports Australia. The audit found that in each of the three rounds of funding, Sports Australia\u2019s recommendations were not followed or even considered. In the first round, 91 of the projects (41%) approved were not endorsed by the Sport Australia board. In the second round, 162 (70%) of the approved projects were not recommended, and in the final round 167 (73%) of the approved projects had not been recommended by Sport Australia. The auditor found the design of the program was deficient in a number of areas. There was potentially no legal basis for the minister to approve successful projects, and \u201cit is not evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was\u201d, which it said was a \u201csignificant shortcoming\u201d. He found the guidelines were \u201cwell structured and included clear assessment criteria with transparent weightings\u201d, even if these were ultimately ignored. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for sport, Don Farrell said McKenzie needed to explain the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the sports community that had been exposed in the audit. \u201cThe Morrison government\u2019s shameless politicisation of taxpayers\u2019 money meant for community sports clubs is appalling, unacceptable and cannot go unpunished,\u201d Farrell said. A spokeswoman for McKenzie said it \u201cwas a very popular program that funded 684 projects right across the country to help get people up and moving.\u201d \u201cAll projects selected for funding were eligible to receive it.\u201d The explosive report comes just weeks after a separate audit of the government\u2019s $220m regional jobs and investment packages program tabled on Melbourne Cup day found ministers knocked back almost 30% of recommended projects and supported 17% of those not recommended by the department.",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government has said it will take new steps to tackle sly grogging \u2013 smuggling alcohol into \u201cdry\u201d Aboriginal communities \u2013 in the wake of violence that erupted in the troubled Cape York community of Aurukun after the stabbing death of a 37-year-old man on New Year\u2019s Day. More than 100 people fled the violence, in which at least six buildings burned to the ground and two more were \u201crendered uninhabitable\u201d in a \u201cvengeance-seeking exercise\u201d, according to a police superintendent, Geoff Sheldon. A 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man have been charged with murder and 23 others with 79 offences in relation to the violence. Twelve people have been charged with arson. Police allege that the man was stabbed in the stomach, and died a short time later at the Aurukun medical clinic. A large group of people took to the streets with makeshift weapons when the news spread. More than 150 men, women and children fled into the bush and to neighbouring communities including Coen, 130km away on the eastern side of the Cape, to escape the clashes. Many have not yet returned. In the days after the violence, army veterans from Kapani Warrior, which runs personal development programs for young people in Aurukun, set up a bush camp for displaced families and ferried people to other communities. The camp was closed at the weekend. \u201cThose who have fled are still in a high state of agitation and are fearful for their safety,\u201d said Kapani\u2019s managing director, Ant Blumer. \u201cA more strategic view is needed of the issues at Aurukun, which are symptomatic of a larger problem which needs attention. It\u2019s a tragedy, really, in a highly divided and traumatised community. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there for two years trying to help the community get more positive outcomes. They are fantastic, wonderful people. \u201cIf people have meaning, respect, jobs \u2013 that sparks enthusiasm for life. Our objective is to help people find respect, walk the path of regeneration, and meet halfway for meaningful life activity and employment. That makes a positive contribution. What we have now is a community in distress.\u201d Aurukun shire council said on Tuesday that all services were operating as normal, from the airport to aged care and sanitation, and people should feel safe to return. The mayor, Dereck Walpo, has said he wants people to come home. \u201cAfter community calm has been restored in the short-term, the focus will shift to maintaining community calm in the longer term,\u201d a Queensland government spokesperson said. The state government said it was working with the council and community leaders to support locally led solutions, \u201cincluding a renewed approach to alcohol management through a community safety plan that incorporate actions to address sly grog and home brew\u201d. It has appointed a mediator, the former Aurukun shire council chief executive Gary Kleinen, to manage community tensions while Bruce Martin, a Wik Mungkan man and former member of the prime minister\u2019s Indigenous Advisory Council, will work with elders and coordinate government agencies. The state government spokesperson said: \u201cAurukun is an extremely remote community that faces complex issues including the legacy of historical impacts of alcohol, ongoing impacts of historic government policies and practices on culture and community functioning, including the forced removal of families into the former mission at Archer River, inter-clan conflicts and fighting, and high crime and incarceration rates. \u201cThe individual needs of those who have been displaced continue to be assessed, with priority being given to those urgently requiring accommodation.\u201d The spokesperson said a number of Aurukun families who \u201cself-evacuated\u201d to Coen and other Cape communities had signalled they were ready to return. \u201cWork has already started to rectify damaged homes in Aurukun with community and government agencies working to identify longer-term housing options for those whose homes require more significant work.\u201d Additional police would remain in the small community \u201cto improve safety and security in the town\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Luke Kuechly, one of the finest linebackers of his generation, has announced his retirement at the age of 28. The Carolina Panthers star made the announcement in a video posted to the team\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cNow is the right time for me [retire],\u201d said a visibly emotional Kuechly, who had to fight back tears several times. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot and now is the right chance for me to move on. \u201cIt makes me sad because I love playing this game. I\u2019ve been playing it since I was a little kid and it\u2019s my favorite thing in the world to do. The memories I have from this place and this organization and playing on the field with these guys will never go away.\u201d Kuechly did not give a specific reason for his decision in the video, but indicated that injuries meant he was no longer able to play to the best of his abilities. Kuechly suffered two serious concussions during his career, the second of which forced him to miss the final six games of the 2016 campaign. He also sat out a week the following season after apparently being concussed during a game with the Philadelphia Eagles. In total, he missed seven games due to concussions, although he did not mention brain injuries or head trauma during his retirement video. Several of his current and former teammates paid tribute to Kuechly on Tuesday night. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud to call you my brother! Congrats on a heck of a career! The game will miss you as much as you miss the game bro! I love you my brother!\u201d wrote Thomas Davis, who played alongside Kuechly at linebacker for several seasons. Panthers tight end Greg Olsen spoke highly of Kuechly\u2019s character. \u201cWords can\u2019t describe who Luke Kuechly is as a person, friend and teammate. We have shared countless memories together both on the field and away from it. I feel honored to be his friend and I\u2019ll always appreciate the impact he has had on my life. Love you buddy,\u201d he wrote. Kuechly was known for his superb football instincts and led the league in tackles in 2012 and 2014. He was voted to the Pro Bowl in seven of his eight seasons, named an All-Pro five times, and is all but guaranteed to be a member of the Hall of Fame. He was a key part of the Panthers team that reached the Super Bowl in the 2015 season, and it was later revealed he had played through a shoulder injury during the team\u2019s playoff run.",

The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that the Australian government had approved the export of weapons to the Democratic Republic of Congo four times in 2018-19. It has also issued more than 80 weapons export permits to Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The DRC has been gripped by successive waves of violence, rebellions, protests and political turmoil for decades.

Save the Children estimates more than five million people have been forced to flee their homes in the DRC alone, and says millions of children are \u201cdesperately in need of humanitarian assistance\u201d. The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Paul Ronalds, said the public would be shocked to learn their government was approving weapons sales in such an environment. \u201cThe fact we weren\u2019t previously aware that Australia was exporting weapons to the DRC says it all really,\u201d Ronalds told the Guardian. \u201cIt is unthinkable that Australian arms could potentially be fuelling these conflicts, and it\u2019s kept a secret from the public. \u201cThe public has a right to know where Australian-made arms are going, especially when taxpayers\u2019 money is being used to market the industry to the world.\u201d Arms sales to the DRC are strictly controlled by sanctions, first imposed during the country\u2019s brutal civil war, which killed five million people between 1997 and 2003.

The extent of and extreme secrecy surrounding Australia\u2019s foreign weapons sales are revealed by documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information.

Previously, it produced an annual report about foreign weapons sales, but stopped declaring the information in 2004. Unlike major defence exporters the UK, the US and France, Australia does not provide information on the country of destination of defence exports. Australian exports are publicly reported only by region, making a freedom of information request the only way to reveal which individual countries are buying Australian-built weapons. Democracies similar to to Australia \u2013 such as the Netherlands, the UK, the US, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Spain and France \u2013 all provide public, detailed annual reports, covering information such as destination countries, value of exports, trends and reasons for permit denials. Some exporting countries provide information on permit approvals on a monthly or even real-time basis.",

This isn\u2019t just black history people are forgetting. It\u2019s white history, <em>our </em>history.\u201d</p> <p>This war summit is a product of Harrison\u2019s imagination. \u201cThere are no first-person accounts of January 26, 1788 from an Indigenous perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cThe closest we\u2019ve got is the William Dawes\u2019 account in his diaries of talking to Patyegarang, learning her language. But I\u2019ve read a lot of first contact history, from the Dawes diaries to Tim Flannery. And incidents referenced in the play actually happened.</p> <p>\u201cCook had come and gone 18 years earlier, so the mobs had stories of what had happened, and they weren\u2019t great.

Bennelong was happy to go to England with Governor Phillip, wearing fancy clothes and dining in the halls of the British aristocracy. But when he came back he took off his clothes and walked down the streets of Sydney as part of his community again. Some of the first contact Aborigines were diplomats while others were warriors \u2013 as reflected in the play.\u201d</p> <p>There had been times during the long gestation of The Visitors when Harrison was tempted to scrap it and rewrite it from the perspective of women instead. Bennelong\u2019s wife, Barangaroo, for example, was much less ready to compromise with Phillip and the other visitors during those crucial early years of the colony. While Harrison eventually decided not to take that creative route, the script retains marks of that deliberation. </p> <p>What the seven will decide is in doubt until the last few pages of Harrison\u2019s script. Does their unanimous vote stand the scrutiny of history? Unlike 12 Angry Men, this jury is still out.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/the-visitors\">The Visitors is showing at Carriageworks, Sydney, as part of Sydney festival from 22 January to 26 January</a></em></p>",

Harrison describes herself as \u201ca black of all trades\u201d: lecturer, author, artistic director and playwright. Until now her most celebrated work was her 1998 play Stolen. But the film rights of The Visitors have already been optioned, and she\u2019s currently 20,000 words into a novel based on the play\u2019s essential conceit. \u201cThe Visitors is inspired by the film 12 Angry Men,\u201d Harrison tells Guardian Australia. Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1957 McCarthy-era classic, set in a New York jury room, sees Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) hold out against his fellow jurors. \u201cEach of the seven Aboriginal elders in The Visitors has his own distinct point of view,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cOne is a philosopher, another a warrior and a third is a younger man who hasn\u2019t finished being initiated yet. They\u2019re flawed, like we all are.\u201d Moogahlin Performing Arts, the Indigenous theatre company producing The Visitors, wanted to use New South Wales-based actors. Only one, Glenn Shea (involved in the project from the first reading in 2011), is from Victoria. Harrison\u2019s groups are given generic names \u2013 \u201cBay people\u201d, \u201cEel mob\u201d, \u201cSpear clan\u201d \u2013 rather than their historically correct titles, like Gadigal and Camerigal, because she has no wish to offend descendants of those Indigenous people actually there when the first fleet sailed into Sydney Harbour. \u201cLots of Australians still don\u2019t know what Australia Day represents,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cSome think it\u2019s when Cook arrived in Botany Bay, not the day the first fleet settled in Sydney Cove. This isn\u2019t just black history people are forgetting. It\u2019s white history, our history.\u201d This war summit is a product of Harrison\u2019s imagination. \u201cThere are no first-person accounts of January 26, 1788 from an Indigenous perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cThe closest we\u2019ve got is the William Dawes\u2019 account in his diaries of talking to Patyegarang, learning her language. But I\u2019ve read a lot of first contact history, from the Dawes diaries to Tim Flannery. And incidents referenced in the play actually happened. \u201cCook had come and gone 18 years earlier, so the mobs had stories of what had happened, and they weren\u2019t great. There\u2019s a reference in the play to the waters of Botany Bay turning the colour of sunset after Cook\u2019s men slaughtered stingrays, some of which were 100 years old. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ve taken artistic licence.\u201d At one point, the seven elders watch in horror as one of the visitors is hanged. \u201cThe hanging actually happened, but some weeks after the first fleet had arrived,\u201d Harrison explains. Despite the sombre soul of the play, it\u2019s also very funny as the men tease and compete with each other \u2013 like blokes at a typical Australian barbecue \u2013 trying to deal with a genuine crisis though unable to avoid the normal joshing. But the \u201cJuror 8\u201d of Harrison\u2019s play is the deep thinker from the \u201cEel mob\u201d from way out west. \u201cHe\u2019s a philosopher who can see both sides of the dilemma,\u201d Harrison explains. \u201cLike the real-life Bennelong, he has ambiguities. Bennelong was happy to go to England with Governor Phillip, wearing fancy clothes and dining in the halls of the British aristocracy. But when he came back he took off his clothes and walked down the streets of Sydney as part of his community again. Some of the first contact Aborigines were diplomats while others were warriors \u2013 as reflected in the play.\u201d There had been times during the long gestation of The Visitors when Harrison was tempted to scrap it and rewrite it from the perspective of women instead. Bennelong\u2019s wife, Barangaroo, for example, was much less ready to compromise with Phillip and the other visitors during those crucial early years of the colony. While Harrison eventually decided not to take that creative route, the script retains marks of that deliberation. What the seven will decide is in doubt until the last few pages of Harrison\u2019s script. Does their unanimous vote stand the scrutiny of history? Unlike 12 Angry Men, this jury is still out. \u2022 The Visitors is showing at Carriageworks, Sydney, as part of Sydney festival from 22 January to 26 January",

Among the 15 cast members revealed on Tuesday were British actors Robert Aramayo, who portrayed a young Ned Stark, and Joseph Mawle, who played Benjen Stark on HBO\u2019s fantasy series. Others coming to the Lord of the Rings include British theatre actor Owain Arthur, British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, Australian actor Tom Budge, British actress Morfydd Clark, and Slovak-American actress Ema Horvath, the company said. Producers and showrunners behind the scenes include veterans from The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and Stranger Things. New Zealander Sir Peter Jackson adapted Lord of the Rings into a highly acclaimed film trilogy, which garnered 11 Oscars in the early 2000s. There is scepticism in New Zealand that the success of the movie trilogy can be topped, and concern that filming will place even more pressure on scenic hot-spots already buckling under tourist pressure. The Lord of the Rings remains a perennial favourite the world over, however. It was named Amazon customers\u2019 favourite book of the millennium in 1999 and Britain\u2019s best-loved novel of all time in BBC\u2019s the Big Read in 2003. In New Zealand \u2013 which many tourists still refer to as Middle-earth \u2013 the government made a vigorous effort to secure the Amazon series, with the studio raising concerns about the safety of filming in the country following the Christchurch terror attack last March. Phil Twyford, New Zealand\u2019s economic development minister, described the \u201cambitious production\u201d as fantastic for the country, and said it would create jobs and significant overseas investment. Last month, the producers started casting for extras from a pool of nearly 5 million people, advertising for people to come forward with \u201cwonderful noses\u201d, and \u201ccharacter faces\u201d. Locals who were less than 1.5 metres tall, or over 1.95 metres, were also in demand, as well as those with heavily wrinkled skin and a lack of teeth \u2013 namely, orcs. \u201cHAIR HAIR HAIR \u2014 if you have natural red hair, white hair, or lots and lots of freckles,\u201d the advertisement read. \u201cAfter undertaking an extensive global search, we are delighted finally to reveal the first group of brilliant performers who will take part in Amazon\u2019s The Lord of the Rings series,\u201d showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay said in a statement. \u201cThese exceptionally talented women and men are more than just our actors, they are the newest members of an ever-expanding creative family that is now working tirelessly to bring Middle-earth to life anew for fans and audiences worldwide,\u201d they added. The TV adaptation will explore new storylines preceding JRR Tolkien\u2019s the Fellowship of the Ring, the first instalment in the famed trilogy. Amazon announced the cast at a Television Critics Association event where TV networks preview upcoming shows. The series still has a \u201cfew key roles left to cast,\u201d said Vernon Sanders, Amazon\u2019s co-head of television. The company did not reveal details about the roles the actors would play or the storyline. The series is slated to cost NZ$1.3bn \u2013 making it the most expensive television show ever made.",

We\u2019re ending the politics liveblog here tonight. Follow our special debate liveblog, with updates from my colleague Joan E Greve in Des Moines. An attorney for Lev Parnas said \u201cMr. Parnas remains committed to testifying as to all the actions he took in Ukraine\u201d on behalf of Donald Trump. Bondy said hand-delivered the contents of Parnas\u2019 WhatsApp messages, text messages &amp; images to Democratic staff on the House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to a series of his tweets. Setting up Parnas as a valuable witness could earn him some leniency after federal prosecutors said they are likely to file additional criminal charges against him. Released messages between Lev Parnas and his associate appear to show them tracking the whereabouts of Marie Yovanovich, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch, who testified in the House impeachment hearing, was removed from her post in Ukraine by Donald Trump, even though the state department had asked her to stay on for another year. Even as Yovanovitch testified, Trump attacked her on Twitter. Asked how it felt to be singled out by the president, Yovanovitch said, \u201cthe effect is intimidating.\u201d Another bit of evidence is a letter that Rudy Giuliani sent to Ukrainian president-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy in May 2019. \u201cIn my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you ... I will need no more than a half-hour of your time,\u201d Guiliani\u2019s writes, under his personal letterhead. The letter makes clear that Guiliani planned a trip to Ukraine, \u201cwhich he publicly described at the time as an effort to \u2018meddle in an investigation,\u2019 was undertaken with the knowledge and support of President Trump,\u201d the Intelligence Committee said. Amongst the documents that the Intelligence Committee provided are hand-written notes that Lev Parnas provided House investigators, scribbled on stationary from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Vienna: \u201cGet Zalensky (sic) to annonce (sic) that the Biden case will Be Investigated\u201d it says. The Intelligence Committee also publicly released text messages and letters. The House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees just announced that they have provided additional evidence in the impeachment process based on documents yielded up by Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. They mention a \u201ctrove of documents\u201d from Parnas \u201cthat provide more information about the effort to coerce Ukraine into helping the president\u2019s re-election campaign\u201d. The committees point out they have provided the additional evidence to the House judiciary committee \u201cto be included as part of the record that will be transmitted to the Senate with the articles of impeachment\u201d. Lev Parnas That\u2019s it from the east coast, we\u2019re handing over to the west coast now, where Maanvi Singh will take you through until 7pm ET, at which point Joan E Greve will launch our special debate live blog, ready to prepare for and cover the Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, at 9pm ET tonight. Most recent key events: Of course a woman can be elected to be the US president, duh. National Security Agency (NSA) officials announced that they discovered a major flaw in Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system \u2013 one that could leave users vulnerable to significant breaches, surveillance or disruption. Opening arguments in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump are expected to begin next Tuesday. The security at the US Capitol is telling journalists that only one video camera, no photographers or audio recording, will be allowed when the articles of impeachment are delivered to the Senate, according to CQ Roll Call. Reporters will be confined to a single press pen and won\u2019t be able to move with senators when asking questions (a common tactic when reporting at the Capitol). The rule will heavily restrict journalists\u2019 ability to speak to Senators throughout the impeachment trial. The Standing Committee of Correspondents, the group of journalists who represent credentialed reporters of the House and Senate, have said the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms and Capitol Police have rejected their suggestions in compromising. Sarah Wire, a reporter for the LA Times and the Standing Committee chair, said on Twitter that the committee has not been provided with \u201can explanation of how the restrictions contribute to the safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.\u201d Reporters have been asking a few women in politics on their thoughts about the viral story that Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren in a 2018 meeting that a woman can\u2019t win the presidency. Sanders has issued a scathing denial saying he did not make that comment. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said she wouldn\u2019t comment on whether she believes the account, but said that \u201cHillary won 3 million more votes than Trump and Nancy Pelosi eats his lunch daily\u201d. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that she \u201cdefer[s] to both of their campaigns,\u201d but added \u201cI think it\u2019s also important to say that of course women can win\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez, who officially endorsed Sanders in October, said that electing women is part of a \u201cprogressive ideology\u201d and \u201cI know that the senator believes that as well.\u201d Kamala Harris\u2019 reaction got the most traction today. She told reporters with a laugh, \u201cOh, a woman can be president. Of that, I am sure. National Security Agency (NSA) officials announced today that they discovered a major flaw in Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system \u2013 one that could leave users vulnerable to significant breaches, surveillance or disruption. Here\u2019s more from the Washington Post: The public disclosure represents a major shift in the NSA\u2019s approach, choosing to put computer security ahead of building up its arsenal of hacking tools that allow the agency to spy on adversaries\u2019 networks. \u201cThis is ... a change in approach ... by NSA of working to share, working to lean forward, and then working to really share the data as part of building trust,\u201d said Anne Neuberger, director of the NSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Directorate, which was launched in October. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell just indicated that the main business of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump in the Senate will begin next Tuesday. That will follow some procedural steps later this week, after the articles of impeachment are transferred from the House to the Senate, such as the swearing in of those Senate members expected to be directly involved. Next week there could be a vote on the rules but McConnell expects that opening arguments will begin on Tuesday. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Rounds said that McConnell\u2019s trial plan will guarantee votes on calling witnesses hearing new evidence, Reuters reports, and that\u2019s expected to happen after the opening arguments are presented. Democratic 2020 candidate Andrew Yang may not have made the debate stage in Des Moines tonight but he now appears to have comedian and actor Dave Chapelle in his corner. As someone just said: Go get him Liz! We\u2019ve added Elizabeth Warren\u2019s letter to our original post now, if you want to see what she told the SEC financial watchdogs, in relation to accusations that Trump tipped off pals while at Mar-a-Lago about a planned US hit on Iran, which just maybe prompted some allegedly illegal share manipulation......... US Senate leader and Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell has laid out the next steps in the impeachment process. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts will oversee the trial of Donald Trump in the US Senate (where most observers think there is zero chance of the president being removed from office but there is a growing chance that witnesses will be called in a trial laying out the details of Trump\u2019s conduct in relation to Ukraine and alleged abuse of office). McConnell said \u201cin all likelihood\u201d the trial proper will begin next Tuesday (after this week\u2019s procedural steps)...although maybe with a debate on the rules (scream emoji). The Democratic debate in Des Moines tonight and the impeachment trial of Donald Trump beckon, but there is no shortage of drama in US politics as these key events loom. There\u2019s plenty more action to come but here are the main happenings so far: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just weighed in on the report that Russian operatives have hacked into Ukrainian gas company Burisma, an entity at the heart of the Trump impeachment inquiry. Hillary Clinton is questioning whether reports of the Burisma hack mean American democracy is being set up once again for the kind of election interference that tarnished 2016, and again in Donald Trump\u2019s favor... Democratic 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren is calling for an official insider trading probe into whether stocks were manipulated by people acting on tip-offs from Donald Trump while they were at Mar-a-Lago over the winter holiday period that a key US military action was planned against Iran. There will be a vote tomorrow in the House on plans to send the articles of impeachment (aka congressional charges) against Donald Trump to the US Senate, ready for his trial there, which is then likely to begin in short order. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is weighing in on the reports that Russian operatives have hacked into Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter used to work, seeking dirt to throw into the US 2020 presidential election. The Guardian\u2019s senior political reporter Lauren Gambino reports. Hillary Clinton spoke out on the issue a little earlier. Pelosi went on to say: \u201cWe only learned of this hacking through the press. Congress must be briefed on what the Administration knows about this attack and why the President doesn\u2019t have a plan to protect our elections.\u201d Democratic 2020 candidate and financial regulation champion Elizabeth Warren has written to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for an investigation into whether Donald Trump tipped off associates that some sort of US hit on Iran was planned, which may have led to some nefarious trading in defense company shares based on insider information. The hit turned out to be the assassination of senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani earlier this month, after he disembarked from a plane in Iraq. There were some unusual movements in US stock and commodities prices thereafter, which drew suspicion, the Daily Beast reported. You can read the letter from Warren and Chris Van Hollen below: Clinton concern echoes other top Dems This is what House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff (key player in the Trump-Russia investigation and now the impeachment inquiry) had to say earlier about the NYT story on Russia and Burisma: Russia interfered to assist Trump in 2016 - Mueller Following Hillary Clinton\u2019s tweet just now, here\u2019s a reminder of a key finding from last year\u2019s report by special counsel Robert Mueller into allegations that Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign colluded with Russian operatives linked to the Kremlin, and that Trump obstructed justice during that investigation. Mueller found that Russia was keen for Trump to win the 2016 election, beating Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.\u201d Our succinct summary story on all this, when the Mueller report was made public in April of 2019, with key extracts from the report is here and below. Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton has posted a warning about the dangers of the US allowing Russian entities to hack systems that will lead to material that again could be used to disrupt the US election. The former US secretary of state and presidential candidate memorably and, to the shock of many, beaten by Donald Trump in 2016 in an election that was tarnished by Russian interference, has just taken to Twitter. She\u2019s reacting to a New York Times story that Russian operatives have hacked into Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry, potentially seeking damaging information about Hunter Biden\u2019s stint as a director of that company, which could damage his father, Joe Biden. Democratic 2020 candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden is Trump\u2019s main competition, currently, for the White House in this November\u2019s US presidential election. \u201cRussians appear to be re-running their 2016 hacking playbook, once again to benefit Donald Trump. Will the media play along again? Will the GOP open the door again?\u201d Clinton just pondered. The other billionaire in the Democratic race, Tom Steyer, released today an ad that takes a direct hit at Trump where it hurts the most. \u201cWhen he calls himself a billionaire businessman who\u2019s good for the economy, I\u2019ll remind him I\u2019m an actual billionaire with a \u2018B\u2019, and he\u2019s a fake billionaire with a capitol \u2018C\u2019, for \u2018con man\u2019, \u2018crook\u2019 and \u2018criminal\u2019.\u201d The president and his net worth is a sensitive subject for the president. Trump and his lawyers have been fighting the release of his tax returns for years, the case for which was agreed to be heard by the Supreme Court. Trump has repeatedly thrown hits at Steyer, tweeting in April that \u201cweirdo Tom Steyer\u2026 didn\u2019t have the \u2018gut\u2019 or money to run for president\u201d months before Steyer launched his presidential campaign. Steyer and fellow billionaire candidate Michael Bloomberg have spent $106m and $211m in advertising for their campaigns, respectively. While Bloomberg has not qualified for tonight\u2019s debate, Steyer narrowly qualified after polls in early voting states Nevada and South Carolina showed a surge of support. Though he won\u2019t be on the debate stage in Iowa tonight, billionaire and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has over 1,000 staffers across the country. Over 700 are based in 33 states while hundreds more work out of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign headquarters in Manhattan, Politico reported this morning. Since his late entry into the Democratic pool in November, Bloomberg is running an unconventional campaign that focuses on the states whose primaries fall on Super Tuesday, March 3. To attract staffers to his campaign, Bloomberg has been offering salaries that \u201cfar exceed typical wages paid by his opponents,\u201d Politico reported. The campaign has also agreed to pay the staffers through the November election, regardless of whether he wins the primary. As the House Democrats move to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a reckoning in the Republican party is slowly taking place. Moderate Republicans have been indicating they would be open to letting witnesses testify in a trial, rather than speedily dismissing the articles of impeachment, as Trump has indicated he would like to see. Roy Blunt, a Republican senator from Missouri, told the Washington Post \u201ccertainly, there aren\u2019t 51 votes for a motion to dismiss\u201d the articles of impeachment without a trial. Other moderate Republicans like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also indicated they are inclined to see if they would need more information that would merit a trial. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who has proved himself an ally rather than foe of Trump during the impeachment process, will have to parse out how quickly he can dismiss the articles of impeachment while getting enough votes to do so. \u201cIf the existing case is strong, there\u2019s no need for the judge and the jury to reopen the investigation. If the existing case is weak, House Democrats should not have impeached,\u201d McConnell told reporters this morning. Here\u2019s a bit more on how those impeachment managers will be selected. These managers will be the ones to present the Senate with the case to remove Donald Trump from office. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not said when she will announce who the managers are. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Pelosi told CNN earlier today. \u201cI\u2019ll announce them when I do.\u201d (This is a joke, by the way.) And the debate tomorrow on whether to send the articles to the Senate will likely be short since House Democrats have the majority on their side of Congress. (This is not a joke.) Multiple reporters on Capitol Hill are reporting that Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will be voting tomorrow to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate tomorrow. Though the House will be deciding whether to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the timing of when the articles of impeachment will be sent is still unclear. Though she was expected to do so today, Pelosi did not name the impeachment managers, the House Democrats who would serve as prosecutors for the caucus in making the case to the Senate to remove President Donald Trump from office. House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler just told CNN that he \u201cwould expect\u201d to be named as one of the impeachment managers, but said he doesn\u2019t know who Speaker Nancy Pelosi will name. Happy Tuesday and welcome to the politics live blog! This morning is the calm before the storm for what\u2019s gearing up to be the next stage in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. House Democrats are holding a meeting this morning where they are expected to discuss sending over the articles of impeachment to the Senate. The caucus is expected to vote on impeachment managers, the lawmakers who will serve as prosecutors for the House Democrats as they make the case to the Senate for why Trump should be removed from office. House majority leader Steny Hoyer said a House vote on these managers could happen as early as Wednesday. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Attorney general William Barr has escalated pressure on Apple to help the justice department unlock a pair of iPhones the gunman in the December shooting of the Florida Navy base, who killed three people, used to provide more information on the shooting. Yesterday, Barr said that the attack was an act of terrorism. Trump is preparing to divert an additional $7.2bn of defense funding to support his border wall construction, the Washington Post reported last night. The Pentagon funding would be taken from military construction projects and counternarcotics funding and would help construct 885 miles of the wall by 2022. Tonight is anticipated to be the biggest night of the 2020 presidential campaign so far. Six candidates will be on the debate stage in Iowa tonight: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren. We\u2019ll be covering all that\u2019s happening in the land of 2020 all day \u2013 stay tuned!",

      "bodyText": "Leatherback turtles are making exhausting journeys, in some cases nearly twice as long as usual, from nesting to feeding grounds, because of rising ocean temperatures and changing sea currents. After nesting, turtles must move to cooler waters to feed, but higher temperatures mean some are having to swim further to reach suitable areas, according to research from Greenpeace and the French Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, part of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. The researchers tagged 10 nesting female leatherback turtles last year on the Yalimapo and Remire-Montjoly beaches of French Guiana, and then tracked their migration through the north Atlantic. Some of the turtles were found to have swum as far as Nova Scotia in north-east Canada and to France to find new feeding grounds for the jellyfish which form their main diet. Though small in scale, the research provides an insight into how some marine species are being forced to adapt to the warming oceans. This week scientists warned that ocean temperatures had reached record levels with the last five years, which were the five hottest on record. Warming oceans pose clear dangers to human life as they lead to more intense storms and rising sea levels, but the impact of the increasing frequency of heatwaves at sea on marine species is much less studied. There is evidence that some species, including commercially important fish such as cod, are migrating towards the poles in search of cooler waters, but more research is needed for a fuller picture. In another stark example of the dangers to marine life from human actions, one turtle followed was found dead on a beach in Suriname only 120km (74 miles) from the starting point, drowned after having become enmeshed in a discarded fishing net. Estimates say more than half of all sea turtles have ingested plastic. The animals also face threats from overfishing, though they are mainly bycatch rather than targets. The beaches of French Guiana were once abundant turtle nesting grounds, but now the eggs laid there are only a small fraction of those laid 30 years ago. Last year, the complete absence of leatherback turtles from a beach in a nature reserve in Nicaragua also raised alarm. \u201cSea turtles survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, but they might not survive us,\u201d said Will McCallum, a campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cHuman activity has put such severe pressure on sea turtle populations around the world that six out of the seven species are threatened with extinction.

      "body": "<p>Fifty years since his England debut, and 30 years since his final appearance as one of the great World Cup goalkeepers at Italia 90, Peter Shilton is in a reflective mood. Having played more times for England than anyone, Shilton retains an even more impressive world record for the most appearances made by an individual in professional football. From 1966 to 1997 he played 1,390 professional games \u2013 with his closest rivals being Brazil\u2019s Rog\u00e9rio Ceni, who played in goal 1,234 times, and the midfield maestro Xavi who made 1,135 appearances \u2013 mostly for Barcelona and Spain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/26/small-talk-peter-shilton-interview\">Peter Shilton | Small Talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shilton played in three World Cups, where he shares the record for clean sheets after keeping out the opposition in 10 games. He also won the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest. Shilton\u2019s mastery of the lonely art of goalkeeping has been largely jettisoned since his retirement, but he offers insights into the technical flaws of some current Premier League keepers. It still seems right for the amiable 70-year-old to start by looking back.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 30 years in the game there are a few things I\u2019m really proud of,\u201d Shilton says in a quiet Colchester hotel. \u201cThe three that really matter are the most competitive games in professional football because it shows my longevity. Winning 125 caps for England sits alongside it and the other one is the joint record of least World Cup goals conceded [most clean sheets] with Fabien Barthez. That obviously would have been the record if it hadn\u2019t been for a certain Mr Maradona.\u201d</p> <p>Shilton sighs at the reality that, for all his records and successes, he is often remembered most for being the victim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god\" title=\"\">Diego Maradona\u2019s infamous Hand of God goal</a> in a 1986 World Cup quarter-final in Mexico City. \u201cFor me,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s remembered for the wrong reasons. I did everything I could and the famous photo shows that I\u2019m closer to the ball than his head. That\u2019s why he punched it in with this hand. You always have people saying: \u2018Oh, he out-jumped you.\u2019 He didn\u2019t out-jump me. He cheated. So to be associated with that moment \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>His voice trails away. Would a simple apology from Maradona have eased Shilton\u2019s hurt? \u201cIt would have done for the England team,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me. The whole England team suffered because he cheated. People are moaning about VAR these days but it would have been brilliant for us in that instance. He admitted to it in a roundabout way, saying it was the Hand of God. But he didn\u2019t apologise, or show any remorse.\u201d</p> <p>Shilton turned down a request from Maradona a few years ago to appear alongside him on a television programme. \u201cI always took that stance because I was brought up to respect the game. I\u2019ve seen other players cheat, admit to it and apologise. But his attitude explains why there\u2019s animosity. We\u2019ve been offered a number of times to put it to bed. But he won\u2019t apologise, and I won\u2019t shake hands with him or acknowledge him. I always say he\u2019s the greatest player in history but I don\u2019t respect him as a sportsman and I never will. Same as Terry Butcher won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/08/joy-of-six-solo-goals\" title=\"\">Maradona\u2019s second goal</a> in that game was both legal and brilliantly sumptuous in the way he dribbled past five England players before ghosting away from Shilton. He followed the Hand of God with the Goal of the Century. \u201cIt was typical of what he could do,\u201d Shilton admits. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t in the right frame of mind after what happened. When you know someone\u2019s cheating, in a big match like that, your stomach drops. So we weren\u2019t quite tuned in to our defending after that but I have to say, before the ball broke to Maradona, Glenn Hoddle was fouled. But you can\u2019t take anything away from him. Maradona did what he\u2019s capable of doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c9d959071323e6bde8e61586f62700184f04d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9d959071323e6bde8e61586f62700184f04d29/0_0_2814_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diego Maradona beats Peter Shilton to score his brilliant second goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego Maradona beats Peter Shilton to score his brilliant second goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L'Equipe/Offside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his very different way, Shilton did what he could, year after year, and transformed goalkeeping. The Premier League was established three years before Shilton played his final game, for Leyton Orient in 1997, and it seems astonishing he had made his debut in the old First Division in May 1966. He was 16 when, with Gordon Banks preparing to win the World Cup for England that summer, he played for Leicester City against Everton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/08/world-cup-moments-maradona-hand-god\">World Cup stunning moments: Diego Maradona's Hand of God | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI made my debut in front of 30,000 and I was already quite well-known to the Leicester fans because I was a local lad. They were right behind me and I never had any problem with nerves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/gordon-banks-remembered-by-peter-shilton\" title=\"\">Me and Gordon were friends</a> and, in a way, rivals. I watched Gordon over the years and learnt a lot \u2013 just as I watched Peter Bonetti and Lev Yashin. But I was always looking to develop my own game. It didn\u2019t matter that there were no goalkeeping coaches then or that I didn\u2019t even have proper goalkeeping gloves. I used string gloves. It was very basic and the goalmouths were heavy and muddy. But my mentality and work ethic were very strong. Even as a kid I would draw up training exercises to improve my footwork, one-on-ones and punching.</p> <p>\u201cI always felt there was more to the training and technical side of goalkeeping. It wasn\u2019t just about shooting and crossing. I developed my mentality, concentration and command of the defence. Obviously it\u2019s not just about screaming and shouting. It\u2019s the way you give defenders confidence \u2013 while keeping them on their toes. The goalkeeper can see everything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97c6b4ec9d203dfc0cb0397fbd994f37b7f03428\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c6b4ec9d203dfc0cb0397fbd994f37b7f03428/0_0_6685_4457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shilton pictured at Colchester Castle Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shilton pictured at Colchester Castle Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems strange that Shilton\u2019s goalkeeping expertise was largely ignored after his retirement. \u201cGraham Taylor took over [as England manager after Italia 90]. He wanted me to carry on but I wanted to get out at the top. He then asked me to become goalkeeping coach. So in September 1990, I started coaching Chris Woods and David Seaman for seven months. But it was too soon for me. I was playing for Derby County in what is now the Premier League and still felt as if I was the No 1 keeper.</p> <p>\u201cNear the end of my career I was player-manager at Plymouth. I was there for three and a half years and I thought I did a good job. But Plymouth is a long way away from anywhere. If I had done that job in the Midlands, I probably would have got another chance in management or coaching. I got a couple of inquiries for jobs. They said: \u2018Can you send your CV in?\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019ll have a chat with you, but I\u2019m not sending in a bit of paper.\u2019 I moved away from it but I\u2019ve felt frustration watching goalkeepers the last 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I made this film, called Shilton\u2019s Secrets, because the art of goalkeeping is my obsession. The techniques of it and most of all the consistency \u2013 which is the basis of success in any sport. If you\u2019ve got the right technique not only are you going to do great things, you\u2019re going to avoid doing many bad things. And that\u2019s the secret. Goalkeepers are not necessarily judged on saves. They\u2019re judged on the amount of mistakes they make.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peter_Shilton/status/1217141976052785152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Read tomorrows <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guardian</a> when I talk about my art of goalkeeping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/shiltonssecrets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#shiltonssecrets</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Bxb6P0oFxR\">pic.twitter.com/Bxb6P0oFxR</a></p>&mdash; Peter Shilton (@Peter_Shilton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peter_Shilton/status/1217141976052785152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Shilton is hoping to get a sponsorship deal for his 43-minute coaching video because, as he says, \u201cover the last five years I\u2019ve been thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not quite sure what the goalkeeper\u2019s doing there from a technique point of view.\u2019 It\u2019s getting worse so I\u2019ve started to put out a few feelers for advisory work. I don\u2019t want a full-time goalkeeping job. But to talk to keepers about some of their body movements and footwork would be interesting. If you look at Arsenal I liked the way that Jens Lehmann, their old German keeper, accepted responsibility. He didn\u2019t hide. They\u2019ve now got a new German keeper, [Bernd] Leno, who has done quite well. But the two goals he let in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Chelsea</a> after Christmas summed up the technique goalkeeping has lost.</p> <p>\u201cTheir training today develops quick reactions. But coaches are not telling younger Premiership goalkeepers the best way to develop their technique. The first goal Leno let in against Chelsea was a pure misjudgment. He couldn\u2019t adjust his position at the last minute because it was all big strides. The second goal went through his legs. How many times, these days, do we see goalkeepers getting beat through their legs? It all comes down to technique. I\u2019ve made a few overtures but I get the feeling a lot of modern-day coaches don\u2019t want my advice.</p> <p>\u201cBut the fundamentals don\u2019t change. If keepers started doing some of the basics right they would have far better consistency. Some of their techniques now produce great reaction saves. But when there\u2019s a shot from distance, a lot of times the keeper watches the ball. His first movement is one big stride, then dive. It\u2019s all about split seconds now. But the first movement should be to get your feet across as quickly as you can. With quick feet you make a yard before you actually dive. Then you\u2019re in a better position because your feet are not so wide apart. These days we have keepers diving full-length and they\u2019re still nowhere near the ball.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96e9e65daf97d84ad9f05429102d28d2df2d4835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96e9e65daf97d84ad9f05429102d28d2df2d4835/0_0_3398_3824/889.jpg\" alt=\"Shilton celebrates with the trophy after Forest\u2019s 1980 European Cup win at the Bernab\u00e9u.\" width=\"889\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shilton celebrates with the trophy after Forest\u2019s 1980 European Cup win at the Bernab\u00e9u.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which modern keepers impress Shilton? \u201cI always liked Gigi Buffon. I think Alisson looks very good for Liverpool. In my day goalkeepers were the weak point in Brazil. Now we\u2019ve got Alisson and Ederson as the top keepers in the Premier League. Alisson, for a big man, is very compact. He doesn\u2019t get stretched all the time. Ederson is good but he lets in goals he could avoid. As I say in the film, you should be dancing on your feet, not jumping up and down. There are small changes many modern keepers could make that would add 15% difference to their performance.\u201d</p> <p>What does he think of England\u2019s current No 1, Jordan Pickford? \u201cJordan has done well for England. He\u2019s made some vital saves and has a really good attitude. He\u2019s commanding and one of the most brilliant kickers of a ball I\u2019ve ever seen. But he does things he could improve upon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shilton does not want to talk about his ardent support of Brexit, or the way in which he overcame his gambling addiction. \u201cThe gambling would need an interview on its own but, right now, I want to leave a legacy that inspires a new generation of keepers. Even today we see the importance of the keeper. Look at Liverpool. Since they\u2019ve brought in Alisson and Virgil van Dijk they\u2019ve gone to another level.</p> <p>\u201cJ\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s not that different to Brian Clough. When you\u2019re winning games, you don\u2019t make many changes. Klopp\u2019s done all the hard work and he\u2019s bought the right goalkeeper and a really good centre-half. He\u2019s got good midfield players and strikers who are quick, sharp and score goals. In a way it\u2019s similar to us at Forest. You keep your clean sheets and that helps the glory boys up front. If you\u2019re letting goals in stupidly, it destroys the team. Alisson and Van Dijk are two colossuses \u2013 big, confident people. They have had a massive effect and got the best out of the other players as well. They\u2019ve proved that football is still, fundamentally, the same. It all starts at the back. The goalkeeper is still the foundation of all your success.\u201d</p>",

I did everything I could and the famous photo shows that I\u2019m closer to the ball than his head. That\u2019s why he punched it in with this hand. You always have people saying: \u2018Oh, he out-jumped you.\u2019 He didn\u2019t out-jump me. He cheated. So to be associated with that moment \u2026\u201d His voice trails away. Would a simple apology from Maradona have eased Shilton\u2019s hurt? \u201cIt would have done for the England team,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me. The whole England team suffered because he cheated. People are moaning about VAR these days but it would have been brilliant for us in that instance. He admitted to it in a roundabout way, saying it was the Hand of God. But he didn\u2019t apologise, or show any remorse.\u201d Shilton turned down a request from Maradona a few years ago to appear alongside him on a television programme. \u201cI always took that stance because I was brought up to respect the game. I\u2019ve seen other players cheat, admit to it and apologise. But his attitude explains why there\u2019s animosity. We\u2019ve been offered a number of times to put it to bed. But he won\u2019t apologise, and I won\u2019t shake hands with him or acknowledge him. I always say he\u2019s the greatest player in history but I don\u2019t respect him as a sportsman and I never will. Same as Terry Butcher won\u2019t.\u201d Maradona\u2019s second goal in that game was both legal and brilliantly sumptuous in the way he dribbled past five England players before ghosting away from Shilton. He followed the Hand of God with the Goal of the Century. \u201cIt was typical of what he could do,\u201d Shilton admits. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t in the right frame of mind after what happened. When you know someone\u2019s cheating, in a big match like that, your stomach drops. So we weren\u2019t quite tuned in to our defending after that but I have to say, before the ball broke to Maradona, Glenn Hoddle was fouled. But you can\u2019t take anything away from him. Maradona did what he\u2019s capable of doing.\u201d In his very different way, Shilton did what he could, year after year, and transformed goalkeeping. The Premier League was established three years before Shilton played his final game, for Leyton Orient in 1997, and it seems astonishing he had made his debut in the old First Division in May 1966. He was 16 when, with Gordon Banks preparing to win the World Cup for England that summer, he played for Leicester City against Everton. \u201cI made my debut in front of 30,000 and I was already quite well-known to the Leicester fans because I was a local lad. They were right behind me and I never had any problem with nerves. Me and Gordon were friends and, in a way, rivals. I watched Gordon over the years and learnt a lot \u2013 just as I watched Peter Bonetti and Lev Yashin. But I was always looking to develop my own game. It didn\u2019t matter that there were no goalkeeping coaches then or that I didn\u2019t even have proper goalkeeping gloves. I used string gloves. It was very basic and the goalmouths were heavy and muddy. But my mentality and work ethic were very strong. Even as a kid I would draw up training exercises to improve my footwork, one-on-ones and punching. \u201cI always felt there was more to the training and technical side of goalkeeping. It wasn\u2019t just about shooting and crossing. I developed my mentality, concentration and command of the defence. Obviously it\u2019s not just about screaming and shouting. It\u2019s the way you give defenders confidence \u2013 while keeping them on their toes. The goalkeeper can see everything.\u201d It seems strange that Shilton\u2019s goalkeeping expertise was largely ignored after his retirement. \u201cGraham Taylor took over [as England manager after Italia 90]. He wanted me to carry on but I wanted to get out at the top. He then asked me to become goalkeeping coach. So in September 1990, I started coaching Chris Woods and David Seaman for seven months. But it was too soon for me. I was playing for Derby County in what is now the Premier League and still felt as if I was the No 1 keeper. \u201cNear the end of my career I was player-manager at Plymouth. I was there for three and a half years and I thought I did a good job. But Plymouth is a long way away from anywhere. If I had done that job in the Midlands, I probably would have got another chance in management or coaching. I got a couple of inquiries for jobs. They said: \u2018Can you send your CV in?\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019ll have a chat with you, but I\u2019m not sending in a bit of paper.\u2019 I moved away from it but I\u2019ve felt frustration watching goalkeepers the last 10 years. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made this film, called Shilton\u2019s Secrets, because the art of goalkeeping is my obsession. The techniques of it and most of all the consistency \u2013 which is the basis of success in any sport. If you\u2019ve got the right technique not only are you going to do great things, you\u2019re going to avoid doing many bad things. And that\u2019s the secret. Goalkeepers are not necessarily judged on saves. They\u2019re judged on the amount of mistakes they make.\u201d Shilton is hoping to get a sponsorship deal for his 43-minute coaching video because, as he says, \u201cover the last five years I\u2019ve been thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not quite sure what the goalkeeper\u2019s doing there from a technique point of view.\u2019 It\u2019s getting worse so I\u2019ve started to put out a few feelers for advisory work. I don\u2019t want a full-time goalkeeping job. But to talk to keepers about some of their body movements and footwork would be interesting. If you look at Arsenal I liked the way that Jens Lehmann, their old German keeper, accepted responsibility. He didn\u2019t hide. They\u2019ve now got a new German keeper, [Bernd] Leno, who has done quite well. But the two goals he let in against Chelsea after Christmas summed up the technique goalkeeping has lost. \u201cTheir training today develops quick reactions. But coaches are not telling younger Premiership goalkeepers the best way to develop their technique. The first goal Leno let in against Chelsea was a pure misjudgment. He couldn\u2019t adjust his position at the last minute because it was all big strides. The second goal went through his legs. How many times, these days, do we see goalkeepers getting beat through their legs? It all comes down to technique. I\u2019ve made a few overtures but I get the feeling a lot of modern-day coaches don\u2019t want my advice. \u201cBut the fundamentals don\u2019t change. If keepers started doing some of the basics right they would have far better consistency. Some of their techniques now produce great reaction saves. But when there\u2019s a shot from distance, a lot of times the keeper watches the ball. His first movement is one big stride, then dive. It\u2019s all about split seconds now. But the first movement should be to get your feet across as quickly as you can. With quick feet you make a yard before you actually dive. Then you\u2019re in a better position because your feet are not so wide apart. These days we have keepers diving full-length and they\u2019re still nowhere near the ball.\u201d Which modern keepers impress Shilton? \u201cI always liked Gigi Buffon. I think Alisson looks very good for Liverpool. In my day goalkeepers were the weak point in Brazil. Now we\u2019ve got Alisson and Ederson as the top keepers in the Premier League. Alisson, for a big man, is very compact. He doesn\u2019t get stretched all the time. Ederson is good but he lets in goals he could avoid. As I say in the film, you should be dancing on your feet, not jumping up and down. There are small changes many modern keepers could make that would add 15% difference to their performance.\u201d What does he think of England\u2019s current No 1, Jordan Pickford? \u201cJordan has done well for England. He\u2019s made some vital saves and has a really good attitude. He\u2019s commanding and one of the most brilliant kickers of a ball I\u2019ve ever seen. But he does things he could improve upon.\u201d Shilton does not want to talk about his ardent support of Brexit, or the way in which he overcame his gambling addiction. \u201cThe gambling would need an interview on its own but, right now, I want to leave a legacy that inspires a new generation of keepers. Even today we see the importance of the keeper. Look at Liverpool. Since they\u2019ve brought in Alisson and Virgil van Dijk they\u2019ve gone to another level. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s not that different to Brian Clough. When you\u2019re winning games, you don\u2019t make many changes. Klopp\u2019s done all the hard work and he\u2019s bought the right goalkeeper and a really good centre-half. He\u2019s got good midfield players and strikers who are quick, sharp and score goals. In a way it\u2019s similar to us at Forest. You keep your clean sheets and that helps the glory boys up front. If you\u2019re letting goals in stupidly, it destroys the team. Alisson and Van Dijk are two colossuses \u2013 big, confident people. They have had a massive effect and got the best out of the other players as well. They\u2019ve proved that football is still, fundamentally, the same. It all starts at the back. The goalkeeper is still the foundation of all your success.\u201d",
