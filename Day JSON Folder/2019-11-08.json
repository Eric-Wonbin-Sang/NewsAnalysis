There\u2019s concern he may be uncompetitive with his Labour rival. She\u2019s Jacinda Ardern. People don\u2019t know much about Bridges. Some people might remember that as a minister in John Key\u2019s National government, he signed off on oil and gas exploration in a \u201cpristine and untouched\u201d national conservation area, and then excused himself by announcing he didn\u2019t realise it was there. A rarefied few might remember that he is one of only a few New Zealanders who\u2019s ever had a personal superannuation fund. But everyone does seem to know he\u2019s stratospherically unpopular. How unpopular? He\u2019s polling as preferred prime minister at 9%. Yes. Mind you, Ardern has suffered a recent local 11% \u201ccrash\u201d in popularity \u2013 down to 38.4%. But when your total popularity isn\u2019t as large a margin than that by which your competitor\u2019s has dropped, you have something of an electoral problem.

The NZ papers are reporting that Bridges has been \u201cmeeting with key members of the Liberal party\u2019s team\u201d, hoping to repeat the strategy that returned Australia\u2019s conservative government to power despite years of public and media opinion predicting a Labor win. To date Bridges\u2019 imitation campaign has been on point. Attacks on a Labour government \u201cyou can\u2019t afford\u201d are the precise wording of Morrison\u2019s campaign. Stop me if you heard this one before: Bridges is calling himself a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d but announcing anti-welfare policies, with rhetoric to target \u201cgangs\u201d. National\u2019s negative attack ads on Ardern have already started. Surely it is only a matter of time before Bridges is sporting a cap and making sure to spill beer on his balls at a sporting event. \u201cHow good\u201d is Bridges feeling? \u201cVery upbeat\u201d, apparently. Watching the polls, New Zealand commentators are right to suggest that Ardern\u2019s government cannot afford to be complacent \u2013 especially with National retaining a lead over Labour in its party-wide vote. But to suggest a repetition of the heavily spruiked Morrison miracle is likely to deliver Bridges victory is to ignore the fundamental truths that underpin trans-Tasman relations: almost identical flag, similar settler-colonial past, some English spoken \u2026 but different cultures. Different countries. New Zealand, for one, has no Clive Palmer, spending $60m on an omnipresent, all-media vanity campaign that turned out not to succeed in getting elected as much it helped keep Labor out of power. The primary vote of the Liberal/National Coalition actually decreased in the last Australian election; the local preferential voting system means it\u2019s not so much that the most popular candidate wins, but the least unpopular prevails. Assistance from billionaires to reinforce conservative messaging while running candidates that deliver the conservatives preferences isn\u2019t so easy in New Zealand. For a start, New Zealand has had a \u201cmixed member proportional\u201d (MMP) representation system since 1996 where preferences do not factor.

And while New Zealanders may not believe their truth-in-advertising standards are so strictly enforced in political campaigning, unlike Australia, it actually has them. It\u2019s not quite as easy to spread false rumours of a made-up death tax in a place where already National\u2019s attack ads are provoking a flurry of consumer complaints. What seems to be Bridges\u2019 gambit is that the niche social media targeting that the Liberals, Australia\u2019s hard right One Nation party and Palmer used to such effect might assist undercutting the vote of Ardern\u2019s coalition partner, Winston Peters\u2019 populist New Zealand First.

In Australia Labor may have consistently polled a higher two-party-preferred vote but Shorten\u2019s polling as preferred prime minister always struggled, although was higher than Bridges. There\u2019s an additional factor that may, indeed, negate the effect of Bridge\u2019s borrowed thinking. While there was a campaign on Facebook about a death tax that didn\u2019t exist, Morrison promised tax cuts to revive a flailing economy. Those cuts were passed, the treasury\u2019s taken a hit, the Australian economy has not revived, retail spending is at its lowest rate since the last recession, wages remain stagnant.

I don\u2019t know because, if he is available in his mind to continue helping us and continue defending the Arsenal shirt, I think time is giving us that solution. Then, if I decide he is in the group with us, if he is ready and 100% in his mind with the decision to help us \u2013 we have a solution.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Emery was emphatic in stating Xhaka\u2019s absence is \u201cmy decision, 100%\u201d, he has had little option but to make that call given the Switzerland international has made his own feelings clear. \u201cHe said to me that he is not available yet to play; not Wednesday [the 1-1 draw at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es], not tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Even if the wider ramifications are yet to become entirely clear, losing Xhaka deals Emery a significant short-term problem. Dani Ceballos, who limped off in Guimar\u00e3es, will miss the Leicester game and Arsenal are running out of recognised first-team midfielders.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter Ceballos\u2019s injury we have one less player to use in midfield and we now don\u2019t really have a lot of players in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important now to [continue] without Granit Xhaka but I don\u2019t know; maybe he can play in the future, maybe he can\u2019t play.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arsenal are already making plans for the latter scenario and, when asked whether he had spoken to the club about the eventuality of Xhaka moving on in January and requiring a replacement, Emery said: \u201cYes, I asked that question. The club knows the player\u2019s decision at any moment, and my decision or idea about that situation and the circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is hardly outlandish to think Xhaka will seek a transfer as soon as the window opens but the head coach would not say whether the player had asked to leave. \u201cI am not thinking about that because we are going to play a lot of matches in November and December,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot change him in that two months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Emery was reflective on the subject of Arsenal\u2019s season, which feels on a knife-edge going into a meeting with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 third-placed side. A defeat would put them nine points behind Leicester and recent performances have offered little encouragement the gap will be narrowed. But Emery pointed out a pile-up of what, in his eyes, are mitigating off-field factors that have weighed Arsenal down beyond Xhaka\u2019s spat with the fanbase, including the August departure of the former captain Laurent Koscielny and the carjacking incident that beset Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac shortly before the campaign began.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really disappointed with our work,\u201d he said. \u201cI am being realistic because some circumstances did not help us to achieve the best emotional balance. \u00d6zil\u2019s circumstances, Kolasinac, Laurent Koscielny\u2019s circumstance. Remember also that, if he was here, the captain would be Koscielny and that would give us no problem. Then also, Xhaka\u2019s circumstance.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/08/jose-mourinho-arsenal-premier-league-diesel-destroyer\">Arsenal can offer a last surge through the gears for Mourinho\u2019s diesel destroyer | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He accepted Arsenal \u201cdidn\u2019t impose as I want\u201d his plans in recent games, though, and cited the Leicester game as an ideal opportunity to put things right.

Then, if I decide he is in the group with us, if he is ready and 100% in his mind with the decision to help us \u2013 we have a solution.\u201d While Emery was emphatic in stating Xhaka\u2019s absence is \u201cmy decision, 100%\u201d, he has had little option but to make that call given the Switzerland international has made his own feelings clear. \u201cHe said to me that he is not available yet to play; not Wednesday [the 1-1 draw at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es], not tomorrow,\u201d he said. Even if the wider ramifications are yet to become entirely clear, losing Xhaka deals Emery a significant short-term problem. Dani Ceballos, who limped off in Guimar\u00e3es, will miss the Leicester game and Arsenal are running out of recognised first-team midfielders. \u201cAfter Ceballos\u2019s injury we have one less player to use in midfield and we now don\u2019t really have a lot of players in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important now to [continue] without Granit Xhaka but I don\u2019t know; maybe he can play in the future, maybe he can\u2019t play.\u201d Arsenal are already making plans for the latter scenario and, when asked whether he had spoken to the club about the eventuality of Xhaka moving on in January and requiring a replacement, Emery said: \u201cYes, I asked that question. The club knows the player\u2019s decision at any moment, and my decision or idea about that situation and the circumstances.\u201d It is hardly outlandish to think Xhaka will seek a transfer as soon as the window opens but the head coach would not say whether the player had asked to leave. \u201cI am not thinking about that because we are going to play a lot of matches in November and December,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot change him in that two months.\u201d Emery was reflective on the subject of Arsenal\u2019s season, which feels on a knife-edge going into a meeting with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 third-placed side. A defeat would put them nine points behind Leicester and recent performances have offered little encouragement the gap will be narrowed. But Emery pointed out a pile-up of what, in his eyes, are mitigating off-field factors that have weighed Arsenal down beyond Xhaka\u2019s spat with the fanbase, including the August departure of the former captain Laurent Koscielny and the carjacking incident that beset Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac shortly before the campaign began. \u201cI\u2019m not really disappointed with our work,\u201d he said. \u201cI am being realistic because some circumstances did not help us to achieve the best emotional balance. \u00d6zil\u2019s circumstances, Kolasinac, Laurent Koscielny\u2019s circumstance. Remember also that, if he was here, the captain would be Koscielny and that would give us no problem. Then also, Xhaka\u2019s circumstance.\u201d He accepted Arsenal \u201cdidn\u2019t impose as I want\u201d his plans in recent games, though, and cited the Leicester game as an ideal opportunity to put things right. David Luiz and the new captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will both return to the starting lineup after being rested in midweek and there may well be a second consecutive league appearance for \u00d6zil, who was one of the better performers in the draw with Wolves last Saturday. \u201cThe most important thing is our mentality and going there thinking \u2018We are Arsenal\u2019\u201d he said, and such an attitude will be crucial given that his team have been cast as outsiders to win the game. \u201cWe will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together and go to work against them.\u201d",

The top flight\u2019s Friday live slate rarely captures the imagination, but this clash between the league\u2019s bottom two looks the most unappealing prospect on paper since [insert your own Brexit joke here].</p> <p>That said, nobody expected a nine-goal thriller when Southampton hosted Leicester, and this early six-pointer does have the potential to be eminently watchable. Despite both being odds-on for the drop, these two teams are still capable of playing fluid, intelligent attacking football when everything clicks.</p> <p>Unfortunately, both are also waist-deep in existential crises, weeks spent in the bottom three eroding their sense of identity. Watford brought in Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores to tighten up their defence, and have scored two goals in their last six league games. As for Norwich, well, they\u2019ll always have Manchester City.</p> <p>Since that statement win, Daniel Farke\u2019s side have lost to a host of mid-table teams (Brighton, Burnley, Palace, Villa, United) without putting up much of a fight. Like his opposite number, Farke is caught between sticking to his team\u2019s attacking ideals and buckling down for a dogfight, and is currently doing neither well.</p> <p>As a result, all bets are off tonight. We might get a feast of attacking flair, or a buffet of defensive howlers. Either team could conceivably do what Leicester did, and turn what looks a tight contest into a shooting gallery. Who knows, maybe Elton or Delia will feel compelled to intervene \u2013 and maybe the Man know\u2019s what he\u2019s doing after all.</p> <p>Kick-off: <strong>8pm GMT</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, so here\u2019s Paul MacInnes\u2019 report from Carrow Road. Thanks for joining me. It was better than expected. Enjoy your weekends. Bye! And there\u2019s the final whistle. Well played Watford. They took their chances, and picked up a clean sheet to boot. This was a must-win game, and they won it. 94 mins: Drmic floats a cross into Foster\u2019s arms. Watford are about to earn their first league win of the season. 92 mins: Godfrey sends a decent low effort a foot wide of Foster\u2019s far post. Catherine Marriott-Brown completes the circle! \u201cI\u2019m a disappointed Watford fan, gutted to be missing this game, because I am working ... at Champion Hill.\u201d 90 mins: Five added minutes. Norwich don\u2019t look like scoring if they had five hours \u2013 particularly with Drmic, a second-half substitute, clearly injured and struggling to move. Carlisle have won 4-1 at Dulwich Hamlet, claiming a place in the FA Cup second round, and bragging rights in the John Little Derby. 88 mins: Adam Masina comes on for Jos\u00e9 Holebas. 86 mins: Holebas avoids going in the book after bringing down Aarons on the edge of the area. Norwich again fail to make the most of the set piece, and Vrancic commits a needless foul, sapping Carrow Road of any last traces of optimism. 82 mins: Andre Gray has the piping bag in hand, but can\u2019t apply the icing to the cake. From a corner, Watford break away and with Krul off his line, the striker tries to chip him \u2013 and sends his effort over the bar. 80 mins: A third change for Watford, with Mario Vrancic replacing Jamal Lewis. Cantwell has the chance to hook in a free kick from wide on the left \u2013 but sends it into the stands. He looks pretty disgusted with himself. Up in Scotland, Dundee United have won 2-0 at Dundee \u2013 but does anyone out there have a personal connection to both ... ah. Never mind. 78 mins: A rare foray upfield leads to a free-kick, which Holebas sends skidding across the six-yard box with nobody anticipating at the far post. Doucoure forces a corner, and Holebas\u2019 looping delivery causes Krul some problems \u2013 but Norwich clear. 76 mins: Cantwell\u2019s cross is turned behind by Janmaat, a little close to Foster\u2019s near post for his liking. From the corner, Lewis fires a speculator miles wide, as desperation begins to set in. 74 mins: Holebas concedes a free kick, and Cantwell can whip it in again. Nope, this time he plays it short, and Norwich keep probing, side to side, in front of the Watford defence ... 72 mins: Cantwell\u2019s delivery from a free kick is excellent, forcing Dawson to nudge away with a lunging header. The ball is played back to McLean, whose shot stings Foster\u2019s palms from 30 yards! Norwich have a corner ... which Cantwell sends floating out of play. Gah! 70 mins: Deulofeu trots off, taking the scenic route across the turf, to be replaced by Adrian Mariappa. Shop very much shut up by Quique Sanchez Flores. Hughes goes in the book for a scrappy foul. 68 mins: Norwich pile forward but Watford repel any balls into the box. Just over 20 minutes for them to find two goals ... \u201cRest assured, there is plenty more regarding that particular uncle of mine,\u201d writes Mac Millings. \u201cHe left his second wife by leaving \u00a35 on the kitchen table, and a note that said, \u2018Here\u2019s five pounds. Take the kids to the pictures. I\u2019m leaving you.\u2019 It was Christmas.\u201d Is this a lifeline for Norwich? Kabasele, who has been abject, hauls Drmic down and earns an inevitable second yellow card. What was he thinking? 62 mins: Left-back Jamal Lewis gets forward, and with a lack of options in the middle, belts a shot at goal. It\u2019s heading for the top corner, but Ben Foster makes a fine diving save! 61 mins: A double change for Norwich, with Todd Cantwell and forward Josip Drmic replacing Stiepermann and Buendia, who stomps straight down the tunnel. 59 mins: Norwich need a goal so very badly. Buendia\u2019s dipping cross is cleared behind by Janmaat, and from the corner, Pukki fires an ambitious effort over the bar. Over in the John Little Derby, Mike Jones has scored an absolute belter to put Carlisle 3-1 up. 57 mins: Capoue goes down under a challenge from Trybull, after both players chase down Kabasele\u2019s weak clearance. Worrying for Watford given his recent injury woes, but Capoue looks OK to carry on. \u201cI\u2019m a former Watford season ticket holder but now live in Brussels,\u201d writes Aled Walker. \u201cThe Irish pub is showing the game with no sound, so I\u2019m now just following the MBM. My girlfriend is from Norwich and doesn\u2019t care about football, but at the moment we\u2019re 1-0 up and that\u2019s all that counts right?\u201d Make that two, Aled. Make that two. 55 mins: Lewis gives Janmaat a shove as Norwich\u2019s frustrations threaten to boil over. They were so passive in the buildup to Gray\u2019s goal. What happened? 52 mins: A clinic in being, well, clinical from the visitors, with Hughes sliding a pass out left to Deulofeu, who slips past Tettey, then lifts in a cross towards Gray at the second time of asking. It\u2019s slightly behind the striker, who spins and catches the ball sweetly with his heel, and it deflects in off the unfortunate Jamal Lewis. Watford make them pay, Andre Gray\u2019s outrageous heel-flick doubling their lead! 51 mins: Watford are pinging it around midfield, with Norwich lacking the intensity they showed in the first half ... 49 mins: A first booking of the game, and no prizes for guessing it\u2019s gone to Christian Kabasele, for a foul on Onel Hernandez. 47 mins: Doucoure ambles forward and has a shot that never looks like troubling Tim Krul. We\u2019re back under way at Carrow Road. At Champion Hill, Dulwich have pulled one back through Christian Smith. \u201cWe\u2019re Norwich fans by geography, but when my nan moved to Stevenage she suggested we pick up Watford as the Hertfordshire team,\u201d writes Stephen Rainbird. \u201cWhen it comes to Norwich v Watford we\u2019re all too emotionally attached to the Canaries \u2013 although I have a soft spot for Stevenage. At the rate things are going, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Stevenage and Watford end up playing the Hertfordshire derby every season.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Watford supporter, and I was taken to my first match at Vicarage Road by my uncle,\u201d writes Mac Millings. \u201cThe Norwich connection is that my uncle\u2019s third wife tried (unsuccessfully) to poison him, and she was from that fine and ancient city. They stayed together, mind.\u201d Your big half-time read After an absolutely dreadful start, Norwich were the better side for much of that first 45 minutes. They\u2019ve shown plenty of attacking verve and invention, but can\u2019t kind the breakthrough. Watford have looked cagey as they try to defend their lead, but could have gone 2-0 up through Andre Gray. More soon. 47 mins: Pukki and Buendia link up well, but the latter can\u2019t prod the ball through to McLean. From the throw-in, Pukki has another go with an awkward volley which Foster claims. 46 mins: There\u2019ll be three added minutes. Pukki shoots low through a crowd of bodies, but it\u2019s easy for Foster. 45 mins: It just won\u2019t quite happen for Norwich in front of goal. Buendia surges into the area and pulls back for Pukki, but the striker is on his heels and Kabasele makes a terrific tackle. In August, those were going in. 44 mins: Deulofeu also takes a moment to clear his head after taking a ball to the face. He\u2019s fine to carry on. 42 mins: Pukki is down holding his face after a challenge from Doucoure. Replays show the Watford midfielder used his arm to hold him off, but nothing more sinister than that. 41 mins: A lull in the intensity with half-time approaching. Can Norwich (or, indeed, Watford) make something happen? 39 mins: Norwich go close again! Hernandez finds Pukki, who has drifted away from his central position. The Finn\u2019s sharp cutback finds Buendia, who fires over under pressure. 37 mins: Kabasele manages to deal with Hernandez this time, digging the ball out and winning a free kick. In the John Little Derby, it\u2019s now 2-0 to Carlisle. Those outrageously overpriced coffees will taste all the sweeter if they can hold on. 35 mins: Watford inch upfield, and Holebas lays the ball inside to Capoue. 25 yards, he sends a daisy-cutter roughly 40 feet wide. 34 mins: And again! Hernandez whips a cross in from the byline, and McLean connects with an angled header that Foster saves. 33 mins: Janmaat and Kabasele have been chatting about how to stop Hernandez rinsing them so relentlessly. It doesn\u2019t work, the Cuban powering away again and cutting back to Stiepermann, whose control lets him down. 32 mins: Oooof, that\u2019s so nearly 2-0 to Watford! From Deulofeu\u2019s pull-back, substitute Gray turns his man neatly and looks to fire into the bottom corner \u2013 but Godfrey makes a terrific block and it squirms wide! Holebas heads over at the near post from the corner. \u201cThis is a bonkers game already,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cIt\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 89th minute and somehow both teams are losing.\u201d 30 mins: McLean\u2019s sweeping diagonal almost sets Hernandez away, but he\u2019s a fraction offside. Pereyra is unable to continue \u2013 perhaps there are worries over a concussion \u2013 and Andre Gray replaces him. 28 mins: A welcome breather for both sides as Roberto Pereyra requires some treatment. By the way, does anyone have a personal connection with Watford and Norwich? Get in touch. Over in the John Little derby, Carlisle still lead 1-0 through Olufela Olomola\u2019s early goal. And no, I won\u2019t be fielding questions over whether East Dulwich is really part of Peckham. 26 mins: The pace of this game is ridiculous. Now Watford charge downfield, but Pereyra is isolated \u2013 and well held up by Aarons. Doucour\u00e9 then gets involved, charging in from the right as Norwich defenders skitter around him. His deflected shot loops into Krul\u2019s clutches. 24 mins: Norwich\u2019s midfield movement is causing Watford all sorts of problems. This time, Hernandez jinks inside from the left, and his shot so nearly deflects into the path of Pukki! 23 mins: Watford break, and Hughes fires over from a narrow angle. This has been cracking so far. 22 mins: Another opening for the hosts, as Hernandez races onto a pinpoint through ball. Foster is off his line and makes a crucial intervention, and even though the ball rebounds to Pukki, he is crowded out and can\u2019t lift the ball back towards the empty net. 20 mins: Penalty shout for Norwich, as McLean muscles into the box, then goes down under a challenge from Holebas. Andre Marriner waves it away ... \u201cI used to live in East Dulwich (or Peckham as it was then) and my parents are from Carlisle, so I would agree that is the biggest game of the night. References to the John Little derby much appreciated\u201d writes John Little. 18 mins: Buendia opts to cross from the right-hand corner of the area, and Cathcart is there again to get a useful touch. 17 mins: Cuba\u2019s Onel Hernandez is proving effective on the left wing, surging into space and almost picking out the lurking Pukki. Catchcart hoiks it clear, and although Watford deal with the corner, they concede a free-kick seconds later ... 15 mins: McLean and Stiepermann link up nicely, causing Kabasele to slip on the edge of the box. A big shout for handball, but nothing doing. 14 mins: Norwich\u2019s last win after going behind in the Premier League was against \u2026 Watford, in 2016. The hosts are trying, but have done nothing to trouble the visiting defence so far. 12 mins: Deulofeu slices Norwich open with an outside-of-the-foot pass out wide to Janmaat, whose tempting cross eventually falls to the Spaniard. His shot from a tight angle rolls wide, but that was a warning. 10 mins: Watford wing-back Holebas has a go from 25 yards out, but his shot is charged down by Aarons, who asks Buendia for a little help in defending that right side. \u201cNorwich have a goal-poaching option among their substitutes,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cBut he Cantwell score from the bench, can he?\u201d Now we\u2019ve started! 8 mins: While I imagine what \u2018Dulwich Hamlet\u2019 sounds like in an American accent, Norwich try to get a foothold in the game, with Hernandez trying to make inroads down the left. He fails, but Watford have been happy to sit back since going ahead. 5 mins: Norwich win a corner, but can\u2019t do anything with it. What a rough start that was \u2013 the crowd are understandably a little subdued. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even the only massive game going on right now!\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cDulwich Hamlet are hosting Carlisle United in hot FA Cup first round action. For some reason they are showing that game here in the US, so I\u2019m going to keep an eye on that as well as this one.\u201d Indeed, JR. Carlisle have taken an early, atmosphere-sapping lead at Champion Hill. 2 mins: Emi Buendia has to take some of the blame, attempting a daft stepover in midfield and losing the ball. There\u2019s still plenty for Gerard Deulofeu to do, but the Norwich defence refuse to close him down and he just keeps going, sashaying into the area and slotting the ball beyond Krul! Watford take the lead after 76 seconds! After a minute\u2019s remembrance, the game gets under way. Norwich are in green and gold, Watford in a navy/purple change kit. The teams are heading out of the tunnel. Right on cue, the rain has started falling at Carrow Road. This isn\u2019t the only massive game on this weekend \u2013 Liverpool are playing Manchester City on Sunday, in case you hadn\u2019t heard. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, the charismatic detective to Farke\u2019s rugged supervillain, has made three changes to his Watford team, with Jos\u00e9 Holebas, \u00c9tienne Capoue and Will Hughes replacing Adam Masina, Nathan Chalobah and Andre Gray. Troy Deeney joins Gray on the bench, with Gerard Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra forming an unusual strike duo. Here\u2019s Martin Laurence on what Flores needs to do to get Watford out of trouble: This fixture has regularly delivered goals in recent years, as Simon Burnton notes in this week\u2019s 10 things to look out for: \u201cThis could be a barnstorming 10-10 draw, fit to make Liverpool and Arsenal blush,\u201d writes Bill Jones, \u201cbut only if their inability to score succumbs to their failure to keep goals out.\u201d Who\u2019s this beautiful man with a lovely voice? It\u2019s Annie Lennox Daniel Farke, who is positively chipper despite his team\u2019s recent struggles. \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s an important game, but it\u2019s not all over whether we win or lose,\u201d he says. \u201cEven after Man City, we knew there would be difficult times, and we\u2019ve had an injury crisis.\u201d \u201cIn football, all topics are connected. We\u2019ve had to be more solid in defence, but now we\u2019re not so fluent as before, so we\u2019ve got to find that balance. To play football with the knife between your teeth, but with a smile on your face, it\u2019s difficult.\u201d Norwich (4-2-3-1): Krul; Aarons, Tettey, Godfrey, Lewis; Trybull, McLean; Buend\u00eda, Stiepermann, Hern\u00e1ndez; Pukki. Subs: F\u00e4hrmann, Byram, Vrancic, Cantwell, Drmic, Amadou, Srbeny. Watford (3-4-1-2): Foster; Kabasele, Dawson, Cathcart; Janmaat, Capoue, Doucour\u00e9, Holebas; Hughes; Deulofeu, Pereyra. Subs: Gomes, Mariappa, Deeney, Masina, Chalobah, Gray, Femen\u00eda. Referee: Andre Marriner. It\u2019s nights like these that make you wonder how the Premier League gets away with it. The top flight\u2019s Friday live slate rarely captures the imagination, but this clash between the league\u2019s bottom two looks the most unappealing prospect on paper since [insert your own Brexit joke here]. That said, nobody expected a nine-goal thriller when Southampton hosted Leicester, and this early six-pointer does have the potential to be eminently watchable. Despite both being odds-on for the drop, these two teams are still capable of playing fluid, intelligent attacking football when everything clicks. Unfortunately, both are also waist-deep in existential crises, weeks spent in the bottom three eroding their sense of identity. Watford brought in Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores to tighten up their defence, and have scored two goals in their last six league games. As for Norwich, well, they\u2019ll always have Manchester City. Since that statement win, Daniel Farke\u2019s side have lost to a host of mid-table teams (Brighton, Burnley, Palace, Villa, United) without putting up much of a fight. Like his opposite number, Farke is caught between sticking to his team\u2019s attacking ideals and buckling down for a dogfight, and is currently doing neither well. As a result, all bets are off tonight. We might get a feast of attacking flair, or a buffet of defensive howlers. Either team could conceivably do what Leicester did, and turn what looks a tight contest into a shooting gallery. Who knows, maybe Elton or Delia will feel compelled to intervene \u2013 and maybe the Man know\u2019s what he\u2019s doing after all. Kick-off: 8pm GMT. Team news and buildup to follow \u2026",

The positive phase, when it is warmer in the west, sees more rain in the west and greater chance of drought in the east. These are reversed in a negative phase.</p> <p>According to Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology, the current positive dipole is the strongest since measurements began in 2001, although there may have been a similar pattern in 1997. The latest dipole may have contributed to record-breaking monsoon rainfall in India.</p> <p>The warm ocean around east Africa is bringing torrential rain. Flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Somalia and submerged towns in South Sudan, while flash floods have caused landslides in Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania.</p> <p>The dipole is also suspected of having produced hot weather and drought in south-eastern Australia, a region previously thought to be influenced mainly by the Pacific El Ni\u00f1o.</p> <p>The current dipole is expected to peak later in November, with extreme weather continuing until it passes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9215e12ef99e59f02706c61012ecefcbdf23cb08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9215e12ef99e59f02706c61012ecefcbdf23cb08/0_312_6576_3946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image showing fire and smoke in southern Western Australia.

      "bodyText": "Twenty years ago in 1999 a new weather pattern was described for the first time. Now it has shifted up a gear and is causing devastation across east Africa. The Indian Ocean dipole, sometimes called the Indian El Ni\u00f1o, is an irregular oscillation in which the surface temperature of the sea is alternatively greater in the ocean\u2019s west and its east. The positive phase, when it is warmer in the west, sees more rain in the west and greater chance of drought in the east. These are reversed in a negative phase. According to Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology, the current positive dipole is the strongest since measurements began in 2001, although there may have been a similar pattern in 1997. The latest dipole may have contributed to record-breaking monsoon rainfall in India. The warm ocean around east Africa is bringing torrential rain. Flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Somalia and submerged towns in South Sudan, while flash floods have caused landslides in Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania. The dipole is also suspected of having produced hot weather and drought in south-eastern Australia, a region previously thought to be influenced mainly by the Pacific El Ni\u00f1o. The current dipole is expected to peak later in November, with extreme weather continuing until it passes.",

He has always proclaimed his innocence and argued the case against him was politically motivated.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Brazil\u2019s supreme court ruled defendants could only be imprisoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/lula-former-brazil-president-could-be-freed-from-jail-after-court-ruling\">after all appeals to higher courts had been exhausted</a>, paving the way for Lula and another 5,000 prisoners to be freed.</p> \n<p>The decision followed revelations on investigative website the Intercept Brasil that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/brazil-lula-sergio-moro-judge-collaborated-with-prosecutors\">Moro had colluded with prosecutors </a>leading the sweeping corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, into bribes and kickbacks at the state oil company Petrobras that imprisoned Lula, powerful business leaders, middlemen and politicians from his Workers\u2019 party and its political allies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/07/crowds-in-sao-paulo-block-lula-from-handing-himself-in\">Lula begins prison sentence in Brazil after giving himself up to police</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Polls had showed Lula was leading in last year\u2019s presidential election, but the conviction removed him from the race, giving Bolsonaro a clear run.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption\">named Moro his justice minister</a>, heightening the sense of injustice. The president appeared to recognize the former judge\u2019s contribution in a speech on Friday. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t accomplished his mission, I wouldn\u2019t be here either,\u201d Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/11/08/bolsonaro-diz-que-trabalho-de-moro-como-juiz-o-levou-a-presidencia.htm?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social-media&amp;utm_content=geral&amp;utm_campaign=noticias\">said</a>.</p> \n<p>As president from 2003 to 2010, Lula presided over an extraordinary period of economic growth and reduction of inequality as innovative cash transfer schemes took tens of millions out of poverty. Even in prison he has cast a long shadow over Brazilian politics \u2013 and his release is only likely to widen bitter political divides.</p> \n<p>\u201cA free Lula increases polarisation, which could increase Bolsonaro\u2019s support,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a professor of international relations at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cOn the other hand, his charisma and political ability will make the opposition more effective against Bolsonaro. As leader of the opposition, Lula has more international prestige than the president.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro did not immediately react to Lula\u2019s release, but Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president\u2019s congressman son, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BolsonaroSP/status/1192892201291960327?s=20\">tweeted</a> that leftists celebrating the news were \u201cshitting on society\u2019s head\u201d.</p> \n<p>Controversy swirled around the supreme court decision \u2013 the third time it had changed its mind on the issue in 10 years. Richer Brazilians have traditionally dragged out legal processes to remain at liberty until their crimes became erased by the statute of limitations.</p> \n<p>Others <a href=\"https://veja.abril.com.br/politica/dirceu-e-mais-sete-da-lava-jato-pedem-soltura-eduardo-azeredo-sera-solto/\">imprisoned</a> in the same corruption investigation have also requested release \u2013 including Lula\u2019s former chief of staff, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, the party\u2019s former treasurer, and Renato Duque, a Petrobras executive embroiled in the scandal.</p> \n<p>Nor are Lula\u2019s legal problems over \u2013 he faces eight other cases, according to the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. His lawyers have called this legal blitzkrieg \u201clawfare\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been released from prison after a supreme court ruling that delighted his supporters and infuriated followers of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. Lula, who was serving a 12-year corruption sentence, was greeted by hundreds of supporters wearing red vests emblazoned with his face outside the federal police headquarters in the city of Curitiba, where he had been imprisoned for 580 days. In a speech to the crowd, Lula thanked party militants who had camped outside throughout his imprisonment, and attacked the \u201crotten side\u201d of the police, prosecutors, tax office and justice system for jailing him. \u201cThey did not imprison a man. They tried to kill an idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBrazil did not improve, Brazil got worse. The people are going hungry. The people are unemployed. The people do not have formal jobs. People are working for Uber \u2013 they\u2019re riding bikes to deliver pizzas.\u201d Lula was imprisoned in April 2018 after a sentence for corruption and money laundering handed down by the controversial judge Sergio Moro was upheld by an appeal court. He has always proclaimed his innocence and argued the case against him was politically motivated. On Thursday, Brazil\u2019s supreme court ruled defendants could only be imprisoned after all appeals to higher courts had been exhausted, paving the way for Lula and another 5,000 prisoners to be freed. The decision followed revelations on investigative website the Intercept Brasil that Moro had colluded with prosecutors leading the sweeping corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, into bribes and kickbacks at the state oil company Petrobras that imprisoned Lula, powerful business leaders, middlemen and politicians from his Workers\u2019 party and its political allies. Polls had showed Lula was leading in last year\u2019s presidential election, but the conviction removed him from the race, giving Bolsonaro a clear run. Bolsonaro then named Moro his justice minister, heightening the sense of injustice. The president appeared to recognize the former judge\u2019s contribution in a speech on Friday. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t accomplished his mission, I wouldn\u2019t be here either,\u201d Bolsonaro said. As president from 2003 to 2010, Lula presided over an extraordinary period of economic growth and reduction of inequality as innovative cash transfer schemes took tens of millions out of poverty. Even in prison he has cast a long shadow over Brazilian politics \u2013 and his release is only likely to widen bitter political divides. \u201cA free Lula increases polarisation, which could increase Bolsonaro\u2019s support,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a professor of international relations at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cOn the other hand, his charisma and political ability will make the opposition more effective against Bolsonaro. As leader of the opposition, Lula has more international prestige than the president.\u201d Bolsonaro did not immediately react to Lula\u2019s release, but Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president\u2019s congressman son, tweeted that leftists celebrating the news were \u201cshitting on society\u2019s head\u201d. Controversy swirled around the supreme court decision \u2013 the third time it had changed its mind on the issue in 10 years. Richer Brazilians have traditionally dragged out legal processes to remain at liberty until their crimes became erased by the statute of limitations. Others imprisoned in the same corruption investigation have also requested release \u2013 including Lula\u2019s former chief of staff, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, the party\u2019s former treasurer, and Renato Duque, a Petrobras executive embroiled in the scandal. Nor are Lula\u2019s legal problems over \u2013 he faces eight other cases, according to the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. His lawyers have called this legal blitzkrieg \u201clawfare\u201d. In one case, he was handed a 12-year, 11-month sentence over his alleged ownership of a country house \u2013 a decision the appeal court will consider next week. Brazil\u2019s Congress is also considering measures that could effectively revert the supreme court\u2019s decision. But Lula was keen to show he had lost none of his fighting spirit. Earlier on Friday, his official Twitter account posted a video of him working out to the soundtrack from Rocky.",

His deputy, Adri\u00e1n, delivered instead and Alisson believes the painful experience could prove a blessing.</p> <p>\u201cThe first three days it was really difficult to assimilate what had happened,\u201d he says. \u201cStraight after the injury the doctor told me it could be four to six weeks. Then when we did the scan we saw it was a big injury and it became more. In the beginning it was difficult to deal with that but I always have faith in God and I believe things happen for a reason.</p> <p>\u201cI could see the good side of the injury. It meant I could spend more time with my family but also prepare myself better for the whole season because I had four weeks of just treating the calf and then, when I could start to train again and work harder, I had four or five weeks of hard training. It meant I could do a pre-season, something I hadn\u2019t been able to do, and now I am 100% fit in my mind and my body. This will help me for the rest of the season \u2013 and it is a season when we have to give everything.\u201d</p>",

They are important moments for us to be together as a family, my daughter [Helena] also. \u201cMy wife went to every away game with us in the Champions League last season but could not come to the final so I FaceTimed her after the game to bring her inside the stadium and to celebrate with me on the pitch. I wanted her to see and experience everything. It was a special moment. \u201cI said to her: \u2018We are the champions, we got it!\u2019 She worked hard with me for this. I have my teammates working together with me but the most important part of my career is the support I receive from my family \u2013 my wife and my parents. My parents were at the stadium fortunately and it was important for me to speak with my wife and my daughter after we\u2019d won. My daughter misses me when I\u2019m away from home and I told her: \u2018Daddy got it, Daddy got it!\u2019 Everything that happened in the final was really special for me. I lived that final intensely and every moment will be in my mind forever.\u201d Matteo Becker was born the day before Brazil opened their Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign with a win over Bolivia. Alisson\u2019s and Natalia\u2019s plan came to fruition. \u201cI was there for the birth fortunately,\u201d he says. The successful tournament strengthened his position as Brazil\u2019s first choice over Ederson who, despite the growing rivalry between their respective clubs and competition at international level, is a close friend. The City keeper is out of Sunday\u2019s game because of a muscle injury suffered against Atalanta in midweek, according to Pep Guardiola. Alisson had hoped they would face one another. \u201cI speak with him pretty often really because he is a friend. The rivalry between us only starts when we arrive for the game and on the pitch. I see him socially too. Our daughters are the same age and I\u2019ve been to his son\u2019s birthday party. We have a good relationship, our wives have a good relationship and our daughters like to play together. We don\u2019t see each other often \u2013 I would like to see him more often \u2013 but we have our football lives, our jobs to do and our families. It is a busy life.\u201d This has been the most rewarding year of Alisson\u2019s career but also a reminder of how precarious life at the top can be. A calf injury against Norwich on the opening night of the Premier League season sidelined the Liverpool keeper for 10 weeks and cost him the chance of another winner\u2019s medal in the Uefa Super Cup. His deputy, Adri\u00e1n, delivered instead and Alisson believes the painful experience could prove a blessing. \u201cThe first three days it was really difficult to assimilate what had happened,\u201d he says. \u201cStraight after the injury the doctor told me it could be four to six weeks. Then when we did the scan we saw it was a big injury and it became more. In the beginning it was difficult to deal with that but I always have faith in God and I believe things happen for a reason. \u201cI could see the good side of the injury. It meant I could spend more time with my family but also prepare myself better for the whole season because I had four weeks of just treating the calf and then, when I could start to train again and work harder, I had four or five weeks of hard training. It meant I could do a pre-season, something I hadn\u2019t been able to do, and now I am 100% fit in my mind and my body. This will help me for the rest of the season \u2013 and it is a season when we have to give everything.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney approved a White House meeting with the president for the Ukrainian president on condition Ukraine announced investigations tied to Trump\u2019s political rival Joe Biden, according to testimony released on Friday. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, \u201cblurted out\u201d that Mulvaney had approved the meeting if the Ukrainians announced an investigation of Burisma, a gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, said Fiona Hill, a national security council member who was deposed last month by the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Hill\u2019s account was corroborated by simultaneously released testimony by another firsthand witness to the conversation, Lt Col Alexander Vindman. Previously released testimony has indicated a central role for Mulvaney in brokering an agreement in which Ukraine would intervene in the 2020 US election by announcing the Burisma investigation, but the Hill testimony released on Friday was the first to describe direct involvement in the plot by the acting chief of staff. Mulvaney himself said in a televised October press conference that the White House had conditioned military aid on investigations in Ukraine, but he later denied he had said that. Hill told investigators of a 10 July meeting attended by herself, Sondland, nationals security adviser John Bolton, Ukrainian officials and others. Hill testified: \u201cThen Ambassador Sondland blurted out: \u2018Well, we have an agreement with the chief of staff for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start.\u2019 And Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened and ended the meeting.\u201d Vindman gave a similar account of the meeting. \u201cI heard him say that this had been coordinated with White House chief of staff, Mr Mick Mulvaney,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cHe just said that he had had a conversation with Mr Mulvaney, and this is what was required in order to get a meeting.\u201d Mulvaney was further responsible for ordering a hold on almost $400m in military aid for Ukraine, Vindman testified. He explained the reason was \u201cto ensure that the assistance aligned with administration priorities\u201d. With eight transcript releases over the past week, the impeachment committees have revealed a lot of mutually reinforcing evidence that the Trump administration tried to force Ukraine into domestic US politics, while taking steps to stop the plot from becoming public, alarming dozens of top-level US officials, who are defying a White House gag order to explain what happened. While Trump himself made the most direct known ask of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a 25 July phone call previously summarized by the White House, the day-to-day management of the plot largely fell to Mulvaney and to Rudy Giuliani, according to testimony. Testimony released Friday also shed new light on White House efforts to cover up its negotiations with Ukraine; on the destructive impact the plot had on the morale of career public servants; and on the borderline slapstick role of Sondland, a hotelier and Trump mega-donor with no previous diplomatic experience. Sondman pursued a Ukrainian delegation visiting the White House in July out of the meeting that Bolton ended into a second meeting in the downstairs Ward Room, attended by Vindman. \u201cWhat did you hear Sondland say?\u201d Vindman was asked during his testimony. \u201cThat the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Vindman replied. \u201cInto the Bidens. So in the Ward Room he mentioned the word \u2018Bidens\u2019?\u201d \u201cTo the best of my recollection, yes.\u201d On Friday, Trump distanced himself from Sondland, who gave his inauguration committee $1m, telling reporters: \u201cI hardly know the gentleman.\u201d Hill and Vindman were startled by the nakedness of the deal Trump was chasing in the July phone call with Zelenskiy, which both listened in on, they testified. \u201cIt was pretty blatant,\u201d Hill said. Askedif there was \u201cany doubt in your mind as to what the president, our president, was asking for as a deliverable\u201d, Vindman replied: \u201cThere was no doubt.\u201d When he raised his concerns about the call with national security council lawyers afterward, Vindman said, he never heard any follow up. And the call was placed, abnormally, in a separate, highly restricted classification system, which became an issue when Vindman went to add his edits to the summary, per normal operating procedure. The call summary released by the White House included unusual omissions and corrections, including the deletion of a mention by Zelenskiy of \u201cBurisma\u201d, which was replaced in the summary with \u201cthe company\u201d. The change was significant, Vindman said, because it hides the fact that when Zelenskiy heard Trump say \u201cBiden\u201d, he knew exactly what he was talking about \u2013 an investigation of Burisma. \u201cIt would be significant,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cBecause \u2013 because, frankly, the President of Ukraine would not necessarily know anything about this company Burisma.

In answer to a question from an exporter about whether his business would have to complete extra forms, Johnson said: \u201cYou will absolutely not.\u201d He recommended that if any business is asked to fill in such paperwork, they should telephone the prime minister \u201cand I will direct them to throw that form in the bin\u201d.

The UK\u2019s biggest listed fund manager, which controls assets worth more than \u00a3550bn, also defended the role of environmental groups including Market Forces, which has been accused by the attorney general, Christian Porter, of pressuring companies through \u201cwidespread, co-ordinated harassment and threats of boycotts\u201d. Aberdeen\u2019s intervention in Australian politics comes after bank bosses on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environmental groups and rejected the need for changes to the law foreshadowed by the Morrison government. In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council last Friday, Morrison attacked \u201can escalating trend towards a new form of secondary boycotts in this country\u201d in which environmental groups \u201care targeting businesses and firms who provide goods or services to firms they don\u2019t like, especially in the resources sector\u201d. \u201cSome of Australia\u2019s largest businesses are now refusing to provide banking, insurance and consulting services to an increasing number of firms who just support through contracted services to the mining sector and the coal sector in particular, which is the nation\u2019s second-largest export sector,\u201d Morrison said \u201cI think some of our largest corporations should listen and engage with their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones.\u201d An Aberdeen spokeswoman said the company had a \u201ccritical role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the adaptation to climate change impacts through our products and investment decision\u201d. \u201cWe see environmental, and particularly climate, risks as financially material to the businesses that we invest our clients\u2019 money in and that is why it is a strong focus of our analysis,\u201d she said. The company is among shareholders in BHP who delivered large votes in favour of a resolution proposed by activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that, if passed, would have forced the mining giant to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and other lobby groups with a track record inconsistent with the company\u2019s position on the climate crisis. \u201cLike many large asset owners and asset managers, we actively engage with companies and much of this engagement is done \u2018quietly\u2019, in that it is conducted privately between ASI and the company,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe believe this is generally the most effective way to influence change.

Leigh took Hartzer to Westpac\u2019s climate commitments, asking: \u201cIs it fair to say you made these decisions in your own business interests rather than being bullied into it?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Hartzer replied. He said Westpac made its decisions after taking into consideration its role in society. \u201cWe do that independently,\u201d he said. Asked if the law needed to be changed as foreshadowed by Morrison, he said: \u2018No, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s specifically proposed there.\u201d Bandt put it to Comyn that it didn\u2019t sound like the CBA was being \u201cbullied\u201d. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Comyn said. He said that to his knowledge the bank had never asked the government to change the law because of campaigns people ran that affected its business. The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s deputy chief executive, David Cohen, said that the bank\u2019s \u201cexperience has been that engaging with some of the environmental groups has been to our benefit\u201d. He said it had helped shape the bank\u2019s thinking on environmental, social and governance issues. \u201cI think that\u2019s enriched our own thinking over time,\u201d he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski asked Comyn if the bank had been subjected to shareholder activism by groups that bought small parcels of shares in order to put motions or be disruptive. \u201cOne of the unique and positive features of the AGM is that people, regardless of their shareholding, are able to get up and ask questions of the chairman,\u201d Comyn said. He said the number of questions on the environment had increased recently, mirroring wider debate in the community. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable and as I said in many ways positive that small shareholders are able to stand and ask questions of the board and management of their company,\u201d he said.",

As artists, they understand each other. \u201c[Artists] worry about all sorts of things [while] the rest of the world doesn\u2019t understand why that matters,\u201d Bell says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t worry about things that other people seem to think are important. And so there\u2019s no need to sit down and explain to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Their creative lives are constant so they have each other to lean on: \u201cWhat we do is what we love and it\u2019s interesting to us, and sometimes of course, it\u2019s problematic.

Now, it\u2019s kind of funny and it\u2019s even more surprising if we both liked the same thing.\u201d Johnston agrees: \u201cWhen we find something [and] we think, \u2018The other person might like this one thing,\u2019 we present it that way, very gingerly. \u2018I think this is actually something that I like that you might like\u2019 \u2013 but it usually isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>They also have quite separate social lives too, with only a few mutual friends. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s strange. Like when it was Phillip\u2019s 60th birthday, I put together this book of tributes from his friends and I didn\u2019t know a lot of them,\u201d Bell says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have their phone numbers or addresses and so I had to go on this undercover research to get to them.\u201d </p> <p>Johnston adds: \u201cAnd some of them said quite insulting things about me, which is one of the ways you could distinguish my friends with Hilary\u2019s friends.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/26/how-we-stay-together-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view-weve-got-to-make-it-work\">How we stay together: 'From a pragmatic point of view, we\u2019ve got to make it work'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having different artistic tastes isn\u2019t that important, Johnston says. \u201cThe issue of whether you feel the same way or differently is not as important as how you deal with that difference [with] tolerance and you can generalise it to what\u2019s going on in the world in a big way. The important thing is not how people think about things, but how they deal with the differences.

Now, it\u2019s kind of funny and it\u2019s even more surprising if we both liked the same thing.\u201d Johnston agrees: \u201cWhen we find something [and] we think, \u2018The other person might like this one thing,\u2019 we present it that way, very gingerly. \u2018I think this is actually something that I like that you might like\u2019 \u2013 but it usually isn\u2019t.\u201d They also have quite separate social lives too, with only a few mutual friends. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s strange. Like when it was Phillip\u2019s 60th birthday, I put together this book of tributes from his friends and I didn\u2019t know a lot of them,\u201d Bell says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have their phone numbers or addresses and so I had to go on this undercover research to get to them.\u201d Johnston adds: \u201cAnd some of them said quite insulting things about me, which is one of the ways you could distinguish my friends with Hilary\u2019s friends.\u201d Having different artistic tastes isn\u2019t that important, Johnston says. \u201cThe issue of whether you feel the same way or differently is not as important as how you deal with that difference [with] tolerance and you can generalise it to what\u2019s going on in the world in a big way. The important thing is not how people think about things, but how they deal with the differences. If you look around the world, it seems like people are having a harder time tolerating people who are different from them.\u201d Considering their differences taught him an important lesson about relationships, Johnston says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make the other person be just like you.\u201d Bell agrees: \u201cThe flipside of that is loving the fact that they\u2019re not just like you and that they can open your eyes to things that you would never come across on your own ... Not just books or art or whatever, but ways of looking at things or people that you wouldn\u2019t normally think about talking to.\u201d Even when they disagree, Bell says, they keep their cool. \u201cWe never shout. We\u2019ve never called each other a name and even if you\u2019re really upset about something, you never forget that that\u2019s the person you love, and you never seek to undermine their dignity.\u201d She often looks to her parents who have been together for 54 years and considers what they would do in a similar situation. \u201cJust coming from a background where the assumption is love, respect, dignity, listening, that makes it much easier to perpetuate that way of treating a person.\u201d Their commitment to each other has remained unshakeable. \u201cOnce you do commit to somebody, you don\u2019t wake up each day going, \u201cAm I still committed?\u201d You just don\u2019t even question it.\u201d As Johnston puts it: \u201c If you\u2019re committed, you don\u2019t let minor things get in the way of your commitment.\u201d And Johnston\u2019s is the final word of advice on how to stay together: \u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.

The research, revealed in Guardian Australia, showed people on Newstart were six times more likely to report negative health outcomes, including the finding that nearly half reported mental or behavioural problems. Alex Collie, the lead author, said he was contacted by the parents of a Newstart recipient asking him if he supported the trial. They had written to Falinksi asking that he reconsider his support for the trial, saying it would stigmatise people like their son, who has battled mental illness but did not have a drug problem. The parents, who did not want to be identified, received a reply citing the Monash research paper to back the policy. \u201cEvidence released by the School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine at Monash University, shows that Newstart recipients have four times the relative risk of reporting alcohol and drug problems than people who are working,\u201d the correspondence from Falinksi said.

If we lose our jobs, we are screwed.\u201d</p> <p>Since then Miller has cycled between casual employment, job losses and homelessness \u2013 trapped at the intersection of physical injuries, mental health issues and a welfare system designed to ignore people like him.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to determine the exact number of New Zealanders unable to access welfare. At the end of 2016 there were nearly 650,000 people on the SCV, but this includes those in Australia for a holiday or short stay.</p> <p>The 2016 census showed that New Zealanders have a higher labour force participation rate in Australia and lower rates of unemployment.

Under the rules, an applicant must show they have a condition that will last more than two years, is fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised, and one that will stop them working for at least 15 hours a week.</p> <p>Despite having medical certificates saying this is the case, Hana was knocked back for the DSP. She has now applied a second time and is living off just over $50 a week while cycling between temporary accommodation and homelessness.</p> <p>Nerang Neighbourhood Centre, a Gold Coast community organisation, has come to her aid, providing enough money for 17 nights\u2019 accommodation for Hana and her son.</p> <p>The centre\u2019s coordinator, Vicky Rose, says that of some 25 inquiries the organisations receives each day, about half are from New Zealanders.</p> <p>\u201cThese are people that have been living here for many years and have found themselves in a normal life crisis \u2013 like unemployment, a relationship breakdown or sickness,\u201d Rose says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working hard and living here, but it\u2019s not until they get into a crisis that they find out what their residency status means.\u201d</p> <p>Hana has encountered many families like hers.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many people from New Zealand in the parks with their children, with their families,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to Australia to be homeless, we came here for an opportunity for a better life for our children.\u201d</p> <p>Miller moved to Melbourne after about a month on the streets of Brisbane.

      "bodyText": "It was more than a decade after Hana* moved to Australia from New Zealand that she discovered there wasn\u2019t a social safety net to catch her. The single mother moved to Queensland in 2008 for work, and has worked multiple jobs over the last 11 years to support her two children. \u201cLife looked great,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d go out for meals and buy clothes and lived a great life. But that was all taken away unexpectedly.\u201d Just over a year ago Hana witnessed a suicide while working as a social worker. She has been diagnosed with severe PTSD, depression and anxiety by psychiatrists and doctors, and has medical certificates confirming she will be unable to work in the near future. But when she turned to Centrelink for support while waiting for an application for the disability support pension, Hana discovered that she was ineligible for virtually all forms of welfare, including sickness allowance, because she is in Australia on a special category visa (SCV), which allows New Zealand citizens to live in Australia indefinitely without obtaining permanent residency or citizenship. For 14 months she Hana has been supporting herself and her 14-year-old son on just $109 a fortnight from the family tax benefit. She has been relying on friends, community groups and her church for support, and at times has been living on the streets. \u201cYou cannot move, you cannot live, you cannot sleep when you\u2019re on this journey to try to find help from Australia,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand how heartbreaking it is.\u201d Hana is one of thousands of New Zealanders living in Australia who have fallen through the cracks left open by law changes in 2001 which stopped those on the SCV from accessing most forms of welfare. These people have been left in poverty and at risk of homelessness by two governments, each saying that the other is responsible for them. Under the Howard government changes, only New Zealanders with permanent residency or citizenship can receive the full range of welfare payments. Those on an SCV can only receive a small handful, including the family tax benefit and the single income family supplement. Reginald Miller moved to Brisbane from Christchurch just months after the laws came into effect to take up a senior wine stewardship role. Just a week later, the company went bust, and within a month Miller was homeless. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go home because I didn\u2019t have the money for it and I couldn\u2019t afford the rent \u2013 there wasn\u2019t anything I could do at the time,\u201d Miller says. \u201cSo I was on the streets. For those of us that don\u2019t have access to Centrelink, we are screwed. If we lose our jobs, we are screwed.\u201d Since then Miller has cycled between casual employment, job losses and homelessness \u2013 trapped at the intersection of physical injuries, mental health issues and a welfare system designed to ignore people like him. It\u2019s difficult to determine the exact number of New Zealanders unable to access welfare. At the end of 2016 there were nearly 650,000 people on the SCV, but this includes those in Australia for a holiday or short stay. The 2016 census showed that New Zealanders have a higher labour force participation rate in Australia and lower rates of unemployment. But the majority of these jobs are in lower-skilled industries, and many are casualised. New Zealanders can apply for the disability support pension, with both governments contributing to it. Under the rules, an applicant must show they have a condition that will last more than two years, is fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised, and one that will stop them working for at least 15 hours a week. Despite having medical certificates saying this is the case, Hana was knocked back for the DSP. She has now applied a second time and is living off just over $50 a week while cycling between temporary accommodation and homelessness. Nerang Neighbourhood Centre, a Gold Coast community organisation, has come to her aid, providing enough money for 17 nights\u2019 accommodation for Hana and her son. The centre\u2019s coordinator, Vicky Rose, says that of some 25 inquiries the organisations receives each day, about half are from New Zealanders. \u201cThese are people that have been living here for many years and have found themselves in a normal life crisis \u2013 like unemployment, a relationship breakdown or sickness,\u201d Rose says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working hard and living here, but it\u2019s not until they get into a crisis that they find out what their residency status means.\u201d Hana has encountered many families like hers. \u201cThere are so many people from New Zealand in the parks with their children, with their families,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to Australia to be homeless, we came here for an opportunity for a better life for our children.\u201d Miller moved to Melbourne after about a month on the streets of Brisbane. He got a security licence and worked in that industry for nearly nine years, helping to raise two children. But after his relationship broke down and a back injury made him unable to work, he was again facing living in his car. \u201cI feel like I have no country,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no roots \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere I belong. I feel like I\u2019ve been abandoned by the New Zealand government and I\u2019ve been abandoned by the Australian government.\u201d A number of groups offer community-led welfare. In Melbourne there is a volunteer-run food pantry for New Zealanders in need, along with an unofficial network to find housing. Maria Kumar, a social worker, helps to run a number of these initiative, including a Facebook group aiming to find safe housing for people who are ineligible for housing assistance in Australia. \u201cHousing services are actually sending families to us that are in crisis,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cWe then have to reach out to families in the community to see if they can offer a bed for a night or more.\u201d Kumar founded the Melbourne Tautoko Whanau, a pantry that offers food supplied by OzHarvest. \u201cWe do often get the question, why Kiwis only?\u201d Kumar says. \u201cWell, it\u2019s because nobody else is providing the service for them. They can\u2019t access the Salvation Army, they don\u2019t have a concession card and they\u2019re not able to access the Foodbank.\u201d New Zealanders like Miller and Hana would only be able to access most forms of welfare if they obtained permanent residency or returned to New Zealand. For many living in poverty, neither is a realistic option. The Melbourne community legal centre WestJustice is preparing to launch a campaign aiming to lobby politicians to change the laws. \u201cBeing ineligible to access one support has a flow-on effect to every other aspect of your life,\u201d says a WestJustice lawyer, Semisi Kailahi. \u201cYou end up trying to plug the hole with money that would have been used for other important needs for everyday living. \u201cThat\u2019s how financial hardship arises. That\u2019s how mental illness arises. That\u2019s how family violence starts. That\u2019s how criminal offending starts. They all contribute to each other.

By the government\u2019s estimates, less than half the New Zealanders on the SCV will be eligible. \u201cThe Australia government is more interested in being discriminatory against the poor,\u201d Miller says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got money then you\u2019re good.\u201d Returning to New Zealand isn\u2019t an option, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got children here in Australia and I\u2019ve got friends here in Australia who actually care.

That experience left her on the outer with members of the \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d, she said. On one occasion in 2017, an assistant commissioner told Jones there were \u201cplenty prepared to stick a knife in you\u201d. The presiding member of the tribunal, Susan Gardiner, said during the 2018 hearing she hoped Jones would not be victimised for her involvement. The testimony was integral to a case where police were found to have breached the state\u2019s information privacy principles because their practices lacked systematic auditing and other protections. A single complaint of \u201cunprofessional personal conduct\u201d had been made against Jones in 2017 \u2013 before the tribunal process \u2013 with little supporting evidence provided. After Jones made her statement to the tribunal, her superior officer, who was involved in the initial disciplinary matter, made an application to view the tribunal file \u2013 something she said was \u201cdisappointing and surprising because it was so blatant\u201d. In August this year she was given formal particulars of allegations against her and was stunned at how it included details about minor incidents dating back to December 2013, which were not the subject of any complaint or action at the time. \u201cI believe they dredged up as much dribble as they can. They use the disciplinary system because that\u2019s the best way to take reprisal,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey put out documents saying we encourage you to speak up about misconduct, we support you, but what they really want is for you not to do anything that embarrasses them.\u201d Jones says the way petty personal complaints against her are being aggressively pursued highlights a pattern from police Ethical Standards Command, which is \u201cknown to police as the \u2018double standards command\u2019.\u201d Sergeant Rick Flori leaked footage of four police officers brutally bashing an unarmed man in a Gold Coast police station carpark. None of the officers involved in the attack were ever charged. Flori was prosecuted for official misconduct and later cleared by a jury. In Julie\u2019s case, police declined to charge or sack the officer who leaked her details, Neil Punchard, for several years. After consistent public pressure to reexamine the case, Punchard pleaded guilty to nine counts of computer hacking. Police are now facing calls to sack him. Jones says the situation points to a broader cultural problem within the police; that supporting a domestic violence victim should be more important than workplace issues between officers or protecting the reputation of the service. \u201cThey want this image to be presented to the public, and when you\u2019re the person who is criticising them you\u2019re the bad guy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t sweep things under the carpet because you\u2019re embarrassing them, bringing things into the public forum, then you\u2019re public enemy number one. \u201c(My intent was) just simply to help a victim and tell the truth. I know the system is flawed, I know the Queensland police service use ethical standards command and they use the disciplinary system to bastardise cops who embarrass them. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m speaking up now is that the victim in that case, Julie, doesn\u2019t now know who to turn to. She\u2019s spoken to police who disclosed her information, who treated her as a nuisance. I want to reassure the public there are good coppers out there, most of us are. \u201cIf I speak up maybe more good coppers can band together and make a change. The good old boys are slowly being weeded out. But if that culture is maintained then the new ones coming through will be no better. We need to have a culture where the good coppers band together.\u201d The Queensland police service said it would not comment because the matters were subject to an open investigation.",

The company that runs the trust then handed the money over in return for 16.67% of \u201can operating company\u201d.

The structure described closely matches that used by Catalano and Waislitz to acquire ACM. Asic records show that when the pair first bought the media group, they used a company called 19 Cashews as a vehicle to hold the shareholdings of investors. 19 Cashews was half owned by Tiga Trading, a Waislitz family vehicle, a third owned by Kirant Media Investments, which is controlled by Catalano and his third wife Stefanie, and one sixth \u2013 or 16.67% \u2013 owned by a company called Kirant Regional Media Investments. Kirant Regional Media Investments has just one director, Antony Catalano. However, what\u2019s not clear is why Keybridge would be entitled to so much of ACM, given that the purchase price was $115m. But the other factor that has market observers pointing to the ACM deal as the likely destination for Keybridge\u2019s $5m is that Catalano and Bolton have worked together in the past. Back in November, Bolton backed Catalano in an ill-fated last-minute attempt to derail Nine\u2019s takeover of Fairfax Media. Catalano and the ACM managing director, Allen Williams, a former Fairfax executive, did not respond to calls and text messages, while Craig Smith, a longtime Waislitz employee who serves as contact point for the rich lister\u2019s investment company, Thorney Investments, and is also the company secretary of 19 Cashews, could not be reached. Back at Keybridge, the boardroom war tearing the company apart led its auditor, Deloitte, to take the rare step of refusing to sign off on the company\u2019s accounts. The Deloitte partner Ian Skelton said he and his team were \u201cunable to satisfy ourselves as to the integrity of the group\u2019s books and records and, in particular, whether certain transactions recorded in the group\u2019s accounting records were appropriately authorised and undertaken for the group\u2019s benefit\u201d. As for the $5m? \u201cWe have been unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence or the underlying agreements in respect of this advance to enable us to determine whether it will be recoverable by the group,\u201d Skelton said in his audit report.",

      "bodyText": "Some in the disability community have been waiting years for this week to come, yet it still arrived too soon. As the disability royal commission landed in Townsville for its first public hearings, it was trailed by some advocates who argue the process is, if not set up to fail, at least not exactly equipped to succeed. Those critics, such as the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, say people with disabilities have not been given enough time and support to safely and effectively engage with the commission. Steele-John was in Townsville when the commission chair, Ronald Sackville, appeared to return serve as he officially opened the hearings: \u201cUnfortunately there are one or two commentators whose contributions often appear calculated to discourage people from telling their stories to the commission and to increase their levels of anxiety.\u201d It was against this tense backdrop that the three-year, $527m inquiry began. Its first four days were dedicated to education and learning in Queensland, which last year became the first state to embrace an \u201cinclusive education\u201d policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of happenstance that education and learning has been selected as the first topic for hearing in public hearings,\u201d said counsel assisting the commission Kerri Mellifont. \u201cEducation is a key enabler of other rights including those related to work, housing, political participation and access to justice. Education sets the scene.\u201d And set the scene it did. Across four days the commissioners heard harrowing stories from two parents of students with disabilities. They also heard from experts and teachers in Queensland\u2019s system and the state\u2019s education department. The Queensland mother of a 13-year-old girl with Down\u2019s syndrome was the first witness.

Witness AAA became emotional as she told how her daughter became \u201cpetrified\u201d of her teacher. The teacher regularly yelled at the child, forced her to sit on a bathmat, and once dragged her down a flight of stairs. After three years the family was left with no choice but to withdraw her from the school. It was not a unique story. Mellifont read from submissions that spoke to the horror inflicted on some children who had faced bullying, harassment and exclusion in mainstream schools. One 10-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome was hit over the head, pushed from a pier and began hiding in a garbage bin to avoid bullying. But it was not always about abuse.

Some parents have described them as segregation, but others say they support their existence. \u201cWhat if there are parents who want to have a separate school for their children?\u201d Sackville asked Bridle.

In case this feels a bit bracing, they didn\u2019t mean like its opponents in tone, or substance, or values, or ideology. The challenge was to learn to walk all sides of the street.</p> <p>Let\u2019s linger here for a minute so I can be clear. The Coalition is a diverse and highly regionalised political movement. Internally there\u2019s a significant spread of sensibility. Just think George Christensen and Simon Birmingham playing on the same team and you\u2019ll get my point. The coexistence isn\u2019t always comfortable, but there is coexistence.</p> <p>Because world views clash internally, the Coalition can look messy in Canberra reasonably frequently, and the scrappiness persists even in the \u201cshut up and eat your peas, dad is talking\u201d era of Scott Morrison, miracle prime minister.</p> <p>But the diversity allows the government to empathise with a bunch of constituencies at once, and that can be helpful at a time when various interests in society are inclined to be grossly intolerant of one another, fuelled by the shots-fired culture of social media and egged on by the Balkanised cheer squads of the mainstream media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/its-time-the-alp-are-doing-some-soul-searching-to-figure-out-how-they-so-completely-screwed-up\">It\u2019s time!

Lest I appear gratuitous, let me step you through some recent examples.</p> <p>Readers will likely remember the hectoring and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/01/as-he-rails-against-activism-morrison-turns-a-bit-sinister-a-little-bit-threatening\">slightly sinister outburst</a> last Friday about environmental boycotts. The prime minister took himself off to a resources industry lunch in Brisbane and flagged the government\u2019s intention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/01/scott-morrison-threatens-crackdown-on-secondary-boycotts-of-mining-companies\">disrupt the activism of people deeply concerned about the Coalition\u2019s lack of action on climate change</a>. While railing heartily against the illiberalism of woke progressivism, Morrison went full illiberal himself, presumably hoping no one would notice.</p> <p>The message he wanted to convey to the resources sector (and more pertinently the people who rely on mining jobs to pay the bills, who swung to the Coalition or Pauline or Clive in May) was the government would shield carbon-intensive industries from the zealotry of ferals, be they litigation funders, activist shareholders or citizens with Keep Cups and homemade placards.</p> <p>Heartwarming stuff.</p> <p>But just a few days earlier, the same prime minister \u2013 intent on projecting to the blue-collar workers in Queensland that nothing has to change \u2013 handed an extra $1bn to the organisation Tony Abbott was fond of deriding as \u201cBob Brown\u2019s bank\u201d, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</p> <p>This injection was for new transmission infrastructure, which will smooth the inevitable transition to firmed renewables. If you think about this for, I don\u2019t know, about 60 seconds, you\u2019ll tumble to the fact the \u201cnothing must stop coal\u201d government is the same government that is also preparing for the inevitability of carbon constraint in the economy.</p> <p>Preparing for carbon constraint makes perfect sense, given it was the Coalition that signed Australia up to the Paris agreement. It wasn\u2019t the alleged ferals with the placards, or the litigation funders, or the activist shareholders who took that decision. That was Abbott and his then cabinet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/07/labors-election-review-reads-like-a-disaster-movie-with-a-few-clues-for-the-stunned-survivors\">Labor\u2019s election review reads like a disaster movie \u2013 with a few clues for the stunned survivors | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison boosting the corporation wasn\u2019t the only hint that the future is a teensy bit more complex than the apocalyptic parable articulated by him at the podium in Brisbane. As well as arming the corporation for the future, Morrison also promised to help underwrite the main interconnector between New South Wales and Queensland.</p> <p>In case you aren\u2019t fortunate enough to be fluent in the fiendish dialect of national electricity market, what Morrison is doing with that underwriting is preparing for an energy future minus the clapped out Liddell coal-fired power plant in NSW \u2013 behaviour Abbott and Craig Kelly once would have categorised as a thought crime.</p> <p>Just to round out The Adventures of Eddie Everywhere, the government also quietly pushed out a quickie consultation process to try to make its deeply suboptimal emissions reduction fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\">actually reduce emissions</a>. It is hard to keep up with these plot twists but a reminder: this is the same government telegraphing it wants to limit the capacity of civil society to exert pressure for emissions reduction.</p> <p>Given all this, it\u2019s passing strange that Morrison rarely cops thunderous commentary about being all over the shop, flaky, or just that bit shifty \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is the kind of feedback Labor gets routinely when it attempts to empathise with the interests of coal communities while at the same time trying to fulfil the expectations of metropolitan voters deeply concerned that the world is hurtling towards a reckoning too terrible to contemplate.</p> <p>Sometimes I do ask myself this question: why is Morrison permitted to shape-shift, and be deemed a genius for it, pretty much every day of the week, while a Labor leader trying to straddle constituencies is a sell-out?</p> <p>Rather than pondering the imponderable, let me return to briefly to Morrison and his contradictions. But let me say this first: THANK YOU Stephen Day, who is the Morrison government\u2019s drought coordinator. I\u2019ve never met him, but do feel free to thank your deity of choice that he exists because this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/07/drought-to-become-more-frequent-severe-and-longer-due-to-climate-change-government-reports\">he delivered a long overdue statement of the obvious</a>.</p> <p>Day\u2019s report (handed to the Coalition in April, but released only this week) says drought is not a natural disaster but the new normal. Climate change, he says, means more droughts, more frequently, across more of an already arid country: \u201cUltimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and unproductive.\u201d</p> <p>But despite the coordinator stating that basic fact clearly, and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation saying tentatively now might be the time to have a conversation about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/23/drought-hit-farmers-ask-government-to-help-pay-council-rates-and-offer-exit-packages\">exit packages for people whose farms aren\u2019t viable</a>, the Coalition won\u2019t hear it. The drought response needs to be about keeping people on their properties. The end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/08/anthony-albanese-to-try-and-turn-page-on-election-loss-amid-unrest-from-shorten-camp\">Anthony Albanese to try and turn page on election loss amid unrest from Shorten camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as not wanting to hear the advice that rationalisation may need to happen, there is also that central circularity: droughts are getting worse because of climate change, and the Coalition has spent two terms either being destructive or dragging their heels. When the community responds to policy failure by getting active, the government says #StopTheActivism.</p> <p>I want to track back now to where I started: with walking all sides of the street in the way that Weatherill and Emerson suggested. This next bit is very important.</p> <p>Weatherill and Emerson were not suggesting Labor get shifty, or bluster through contradictions until the questions stop coming. The walking everywhere, hearing everything credo was presented to Labor\u2019s class of 2019 as the core challenge of political leadership: bringing the country together.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s oft-repeated talking point is the Coalition has the same message for the baristas in inner-city Melbourne as the high vis folks in Gladstone. But it doesn\u2019t really. Even though he\u2019s continuing to hedge all bets, trying to do all things, Morrison has been escalating post-election.</p> <p>During the election, Morrison presented to voters as a leader who would keep everything nice and calm. Post election he looks like a political leader who has caught the populism virus, like a leader on the hunt for profitable division rather than synthesis.</p> <p>You can win this way.

      "bodyText": "This week Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson challenged Labor to be a bit more like its opponents. In case this feels a bit bracing, they didn\u2019t mean like its opponents in tone, or substance, or values, or ideology. The challenge was to learn to walk all sides of the street. Let\u2019s linger here for a minute so I can be clear. The Coalition is a diverse and highly regionalised political movement. Internally there\u2019s a significant spread of sensibility. Just think George Christensen and Simon Birmingham playing on the same team and you\u2019ll get my point. The coexistence isn\u2019t always comfortable, but there is coexistence. Because world views clash internally, the Coalition can look messy in Canberra reasonably frequently, and the scrappiness persists even in the \u201cshut up and eat your peas, dad is talking\u201d era of Scott Morrison, miracle prime minister. But the diversity allows the government to empathise with a bunch of constituencies at once, and that can be helpful at a time when various interests in society are inclined to be grossly intolerant of one another, fuelled by the shots-fired culture of social media and egged on by the Balkanised cheer squads of the mainstream media. Viewed in Labor terms, being able to bundle up the competing points of view and craft a message that speaks to the post-material, values-driven progressive and the worker deeply anxious about wages stagnation and their job security is the central challenge in Weatherill and Emerson\u2019s campaign review. They suggest Labor needs to empathise and connect with more people, validate more concerns \u2013 which is harder than it sounds. You\u2019d venture it\u2019s even impossible, given how fractious and unforgiving everything is, until you look at Morrison, who manages to walk every side of every street simultaneously and talk out of both sides of his mouth and suffer no apparent penalty. Lest I appear gratuitous, let me step you through some recent examples. Readers will likely remember the hectoring and slightly sinister outburst last Friday about environmental boycotts. The prime minister took himself off to a resources industry lunch in Brisbane and flagged the government\u2019s intention to disrupt the activism of people deeply concerned about the Coalition\u2019s lack of action on climate change. While railing heartily against the illiberalism of woke progressivism, Morrison went full illiberal himself, presumably hoping no one would notice. The message he wanted to convey to the resources sector (and more pertinently the people who rely on mining jobs to pay the bills, who swung to the Coalition or Pauline or Clive in May) was the government would shield carbon-intensive industries from the zealotry of ferals, be they litigation funders, activist shareholders or citizens with Keep Cups and homemade placards. Heartwarming stuff. But just a few days earlier, the same prime minister \u2013 intent on projecting to the blue-collar workers in Queensland that nothing has to change \u2013 handed an extra $1bn to the organisation Tony Abbott was fond of deriding as \u201cBob Brown\u2019s bank\u201d, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This injection was for new transmission infrastructure, which will smooth the inevitable transition to firmed renewables. If you think about this for, I don\u2019t know, about 60 seconds, you\u2019ll tumble to the fact the \u201cnothing must stop coal\u201d government is the same government that is also preparing for the inevitability of carbon constraint in the economy. Preparing for carbon constraint makes perfect sense, given it was the Coalition that signed Australia up to the Paris agreement. It wasn\u2019t the alleged ferals with the placards, or the litigation funders, or the activist shareholders who took that decision. That was Abbott and his then cabinet. Morrison boosting the corporation wasn\u2019t the only hint that the future is a teensy bit more complex than the apocalyptic parable articulated by him at the podium in Brisbane. As well as arming the corporation for the future, Morrison also promised to help underwrite the main interconnector between New South Wales and Queensland. In case you aren\u2019t fortunate enough to be fluent in the fiendish dialect of national electricity market, what Morrison is doing with that underwriting is preparing for an energy future minus the clapped out Liddell coal-fired power plant in NSW \u2013 behaviour Abbott and Craig Kelly once would have categorised as a thought crime. Just to round out The Adventures of Eddie Everywhere, the government also quietly pushed out a quickie consultation process to try to make its deeply suboptimal emissions reduction fund actually reduce emissions. It is hard to keep up with these plot twists but a reminder: this is the same government telegraphing it wants to limit the capacity of civil society to exert pressure for emissions reduction. Given all this, it\u2019s passing strange that Morrison rarely cops thunderous commentary about being all over the shop, flaky, or just that bit shifty \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is the kind of feedback Labor gets routinely when it attempts to empathise with the interests of coal communities while at the same time trying to fulfil the expectations of metropolitan voters deeply concerned that the world is hurtling towards a reckoning too terrible to contemplate. Sometimes I do ask myself this question: why is Morrison permitted to shape-shift, and be deemed a genius for it, pretty much every day of the week, while a Labor leader trying to straddle constituencies is a sell-out? Rather than pondering the imponderable, let me return to briefly to Morrison and his contradictions. But let me say this first: THANK YOU Stephen Day, who is the Morrison government\u2019s drought coordinator. I\u2019ve never met him, but do feel free to thank your deity of choice that he exists because this week he delivered a long overdue statement of the obvious. Day\u2019s report (handed to the Coalition in April, but released only this week) says drought is not a natural disaster but the new normal. Climate change, he says, means more droughts, more frequently, across more of an already arid country: \u201cUltimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and unproductive.\u201d But despite the coordinator stating that basic fact clearly, and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation saying tentatively now might be the time to have a conversation about exit packages for people whose farms aren\u2019t viable, the Coalition won\u2019t hear it. The drought response needs to be about keeping people on their properties. The end. As well as not wanting to hear the advice that rationalisation may need to happen, there is also that central circularity: droughts are getting worse because of climate change, and the Coalition has spent two terms either being destructive or dragging their heels. When the community responds to policy failure by getting active, the government says #StopTheActivism. I want to track back now to where I started: with walking all sides of the street in the way that Weatherill and Emerson suggested. This next bit is very important. Weatherill and Emerson were not suggesting Labor get shifty, or bluster through contradictions until the questions stop coming. The walking everywhere, hearing everything credo was presented to Labor\u2019s class of 2019 as the core challenge of political leadership: bringing the country together. Morrison\u2019s oft-repeated talking point is the Coalition has the same message for the baristas in inner-city Melbourne as the high vis folks in Gladstone. But it doesn\u2019t really. Even though he\u2019s continuing to hedge all bets, trying to do all things, Morrison has been escalating post-election. During the election, Morrison presented to voters as a leader who would keep everything nice and calm. Post election he looks like a political leader who has caught the populism virus, like a leader on the hunt for profitable division rather than synthesis. You can win this way. Of course you can. But I remain hopeful he\u2019ll grow into leadership and see it as an opportunity to try to bring people together, rather than carve the country into electorally advantageous enclaves and set them up in mortal conflict with one another. The country really does need someone to be a grown-up. Anthony Albanese, meanwhile, is experimenting with some fusion language. Climate change means jobs and opportunity in the traditional industries and the new ones. Nobody has to feel like their interests are irreconcilable. Can the Labor leader pull this pivot off and not be pounded to death by all sides? Honestly, I have no idea. But it will be interesting to watch him try.",

      "body": "<h2>Are Manchester City going backwards?</h2> <p>At this juncture the answer has to be yes as the champions\u2019 points return is the lowest since Pep Guardiola\u2019s first season when they finished third and trophyless. As they head to Liverpool, City have 25 points from 11 games, one more than in 2016-17. Then Guardiola\u2019s side had lost once \u2013 at Tottenham \u2013 and scored 25 goals while conceding 10. This season City have scored more (34) and conceded one fewer but they have lost twice.</p> <p>Compare these numbers with those of their two championship-winning seasons. In the record-breaking 100-point campaign of 2017-18 there were 31 points, no defeats, 38 goals scored and seven conceded after 11 matches. Last year\u2019s campaign shows 29 points, 33 goals and four let in. If City have been unable to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool, who are six points ahead and still to lose, mitigation can be found. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is yet to have a key outfield player injured as Guardiola has, with Aymeric Laporte ruled out by a knee injury until next year. The Frenchman is the defensive lynchpin, as Virgil van Dijk is for Liverpool, so here is a key factor why City are already two victories behind their rivals.</p> <h2>How can City put eight past Watford but lose to Norwich and Wolves?</h2> <p>A clue to the conundrum might be found in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Southampton.

      "bodyText": "Are Manchester City going backwards? At this juncture the answer has to be yes as the champions\u2019 points return is the lowest since Pep Guardiola\u2019s first season when they finished third and trophyless. As they head to Liverpool, City have 25 points from 11 games, one more than in 2016-17. Then Guardiola\u2019s side had lost once \u2013 at Tottenham \u2013 and scored 25 goals while conceding 10. This season City have scored more (34) and conceded one fewer but they have lost twice. Compare these numbers with those of their two championship-winning seasons. In the record-breaking 100-point campaign of 2017-18 there were 31 points, no defeats, 38 goals scored and seven conceded after 11 matches. Last year\u2019s campaign shows 29 points, 33 goals and four let in. If City have been unable to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool, who are six points ahead and still to lose, mitigation can be found. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is yet to have a key outfield player injured as Guardiola has, with Aymeric Laporte ruled out by a knee injury until next year. The Frenchman is the defensive lynchpin, as Virgil van Dijk is for Liverpool, so here is a key factor why City are already two victories behind their rivals. How can City put eight past Watford but lose to Norwich and Wolves? A clue to the conundrum might be found in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Southampton. Saints scored early \u2013 after 12 minutes \u2013 and then hung on for nearly an hour as City lacked ideas beyond bombarding the visitors\u2019 area aerially. After raining in countless crosses Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kyle Walker finally scored to secure a victory that was tighter than expected against a side hammered 9-0 by Leicester City in their previous league outing. Southampton\u2019s plan was to defend deep and hit City on the counter \u2013 James Ward-Prowse\u2019s goal came this way \u2013 and it nearly worked as successfully as Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 similar blueprint when beating City a month before.

In each of these matches Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was a further weakness, Guardiola forced to start him at centre-back because of Laporte\u2019s injury.

After the Wolves reverse City won the next three outings, Otamendi featuring for only 60 seconds in total, before they again struggled with him in the side during Wednesday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Atalanta. Expect Otamendi to be a replacement at Anfield. But, if the match becomes cagey, City may struggle to break Liverpool down, as they did when playing Wolves and Southampton.

Jover\u2019s work at Brentford had attracted the England coach Steve Holland to study it before the World Cup in Russia, and Gareth Southgate\u2019s side utilised dead balls successfully at the tournament. Jover\u2019s addition is working: six strikes have come from 56 set-piece efforts (half as many as in 2018-19), which is one more than Liverpool, though their five have come from 47 attempts.

The announcement comes as the shock of Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as deputy leader continues to ripple through the party. Watson\u2019s allies have called his decision a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the centre, with one saying \u201cit leaves some of us feeling abandoned. Tom was our shield.\u201d The race to replace him has already begun, with Dawn Butler, the women\u2019s and equalities shadow minister, the first to announce she will be throwing her hat in the ring for the job.

      "bodyText": "Three Labour candidates have been embroiled in controversies around antisemitism. It was announced that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in a live BBC debate in Southampton on 6 December, six days before the election. Boris Johnson told Northern Ireland businesses they can put customs declarations forms \u201cin the bin\u201d because there will be \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d to trade crossing the Irish Sea. Dawn Butler said Labour would \u201cdismantle the structural barriers\u201d women face in the workplace with new policies of flexible working and increased maternity leave. Nicola Sturgeon launched the SNP campaign with a pledge to support revoking article 50. And the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jo Swinson travelled to Scotland where she vowed that her party would never support another Scottish independence referendum. The Liberal Democrats would never allow another Scottish independence referendum, Jo Swinson has said, as she pledged to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU. On a campaign visit to North East Fife, the most-marginal constituency at the last election, Swinson said another referendum is \u201cthe last thing we need\u201d, warning it would just create further \u201cchaos\u201d, PA Media reports. Following the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to voters about never allowing another referendum on Scotland\u2019s future, Swinson also said her party would try to block any attempts by the SNP to hold another vote. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely clear, Liberal Democrats will not be allowing another independence referendum,\u201d Swinson told reporters on her visit to a Crafty Maltsters, a farm in Auchtermuchty. The SNP should be learning the lessons of Brexit, not repeating the mistakes. This is about stopping chaos. If you have an independence referendum, that\u2019s about adding more chaos, more uncertainty, more cost and difficulties for families across Scotland and it\u2019s the last thing we need. We are in a situation here in Scotland where we\u2019ve had this constitutional obsession for eight years now. People actually just want government to get on with making their lives better. They are worried about the experience their children are having in schools, they are worried about the fact that their loved ones might struggle to get mental health treatment in anything like a reasonable timeframe, they\u201dre worried about the future of our planet. These are the thing governments should be getting on with, frankly, whether that\u2019s the government in Holyrood or whether that\u2019s the government in Westminster. So stop Brexit, stop this obsession with independence and get on with making people\u2019s lives better. A Labour government would \u201cdismantle the structural barriers\u201d women face in the workplace with new policies of flexible working and increased maternity leave, shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler has said. According to a report from PA Media, Butler said that Labour\u2019s proposed workplace reforms are \u201cthe common sense approach to the modern way of life\u201d. She added that a Labour government would aim to implement all of the policies within the first 100 days of being in office. Labour\u2019s proposals include creating a new workers\u2019 protection agency with powers to fine employers who fail to report or take action to deal with their \u201cgender pay gap\u201d, increasing statutory maternity pay from nine to 12 months, and a \u201cpresumption\u201d in favour of flexible working from the first day an employee joins an organisation. Butler said that white, straight men have \u201ca privilege code to the lift\u201d, fast tracking them into managerial positions, and that a Labour government would \u201clay the grounds for an elevator\u201d for women, to help them secure a level playing field in the world of work. Speaking to a group of businesswomen at the Business and Technology Centre in Stevenage, Butler said: \u201cI have announced today some policies around flexible working in the workplace to ensure flexible working is available from day one. \u201cMy whole thing is flipping the script from employees always having to push an agenda to the employer, making it their responsibility.\u201d Ms Butler added: \u201cBasically, my whole thing is just about respecting women, our bodies, what we go through, and making workplaces more acceptable and friendly so everybody can contribute to the economy. \u201cAll these policies are saying women matter.\u201d Labour says the Conservative party has taken nearly half a million pounds so far this year from just three wealthy individuals with close ties to Moscow, in the latest on the ongoing saga of Russian influence in UK politics. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said that the Tories had an \u201congoing relationship with Russian money\u201d. Describing the Conservatives as the party of the \u201csuper-rich\u201d, Trickett said political donations in Britain needed urgent reform and \u201ccleaning up\u201d. His comments come amid a row over Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to publish an explosive parliamentary report on Kremlin attempts to subvert British democracy. Downing Street has effectively shelved the long-awaited report by the intelligence and security committee. It is now unlikely to be published before the election. The dossier is understood to examine the flow of Russian money into UK politics in general and the Conservative party in particular. It looks at the assaults carried out by Russian spies on British soil, including last year\u2019s novichok attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, and at attacks on the UK\u2019s allies. Boris Johnson has told Northern Ireland businesses they can put customs declarations forms \u201cin the bin\u201d because there will be \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d to trade crossing the Irish Sea, PA Media reports. The Prime Minister has suggested Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had been wrong to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the Brexit deal struck with the European Union. Barclay previously told MPs that \u201csome information\u201d and \u201cminimal targeted interventions\u201d would be required on goods travelling between the two areas of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels\u2019 trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items as part of the exit terms. Labour activists know that their success in this election will rely to a large extent on mobilising younger voters who support Jeremy Corbyn. To try to encourage young voters to register, activists from the grime inflected #FckBoris campaign, who organised mass protests on the PM\u2019s first day in power, are publicising more than two dozen \u201cDIY register &amp; Rave parties\u201d in towns and cities across the UK. Rosa Caradonna, activist in the #FckBoris campaign, said: Boris has the backing of millionaires and climate change deniers. He has already tried to block students, young and BAME people voting - and we are saying NAH. We are building a grassroots network of thousands of pissed-off young people who are going to kick Boris out. It\u2019s our generation that have to deal with the worst effects of the climate crisis, rising racism and xenophobia, the destruction of the NHS and years of Tory cuts to our basic services. Not to mention that most of us have thousands of pounds of debt just for trying to get an education. The first register and rave party Glasgow this Saturday, 9 November, while campaigners say they have a register to vote stalls in Barnet and Hendon, north London, today. Next Saturday they plan to take the fight to Boris in his Uxbridge constituency with a \u201cregister to vote parade\u201d, complete with a carnival-style soundsystem on an open top bus. Hello, Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now. Jonathan Freedland\u2019s report of a fourth Labour potential parliamentary candidate being identified as having made antisemitic comments has proven false. We earlier shared on the blog a tweet from the Guardian columnist which claimed to have identified a shortlisted candidate from Birmingham Hall Green as having been fined over comments made on Facebook. Freedland has since deleted his tweets and replaced it with this correction. He later followed up with this apology. BBC Scotland is to stage a general election leaders debate less than 48 hours before the polls open, which could exclude the Scottish Greens or the Brexit party if they fail to stand enough candidates. The broadcaster announced that the live debate would be staged at its Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow at 8pm on Tuesday 10 December, but the full line-up of party leaders has not yet been confirmed. The BBC will make an invitation conditional on how many Westminster candidates a party puts up for the election \u2013 risking another bitter row with any parties excluded from taking part. Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP, and Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems, have already protested at decisions by broadcasters to exclude them from some UK-level debates. The Scottish Greens are holding talks later on Friday with the BBC about the threshold it will expect parties to meet. Scotland has 59 Westminster constituencies and the Scottish Greens, which is separate from the Green party of England and Wales, only have candidates for 21 contests at present, with only three or four of its branches still to decide on whether to stand or not. The rest have opted not to put up candidates. Nominations close on 14 November. The BBC expects to have Sturgeon, Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, Jackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems. Their parties are contesting all 59 seats. The Brexit party has still to declare how many candidates it will stand in Scotland, but may struggle to contest all 59 seats. YouGov has published a thread with predicted voting intentions in the general election by region. This just in from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: Several commentators wonder why the shortlist of Conservative candidates for Bassetlaw, a potential swing seat the Tories will need to target, has only been announced today. Bassetlaw was held by Labour MP John Mann from 2001 to 2019, before he stepped down to become a member of the House of Lords. The constituency has not been won by the Conservatives since 1924, but had a 67 per cent vote for leave in the 2016 referendum. Bassetlaw is making headlines with the deselection of Labour candidate Sally Gimson who was barred from standing by the NEC after internal complaints were made against her. Mann called the removal of Gimson a Momentum \u201cstitch-up\u201d. This from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman: My colleague Rajeev Syal has written about the former Labour candidate Gideon Bull, who pulled out of the election race for the Clacton seat after accusations that he used the insulting term \u201cShylock\u201d in a meeting attended by a Jewish councillor. Here\u2019s an excerpt: Bull told the Guardian he made the comment in a clumsy attempt to describe a person who relentlessly tries to get what they want. \u201cI\u2019m standing down because I don\u2019t want anything to deflect from the fact that Clacton has had years of neglect under the Tories. It was an honest mistake. The fact that there was a Jewish councillor in the room had no bearing on me saying it.\u201d Bull claims he did not realise the character from The Merchant of Venice was Jewish and said he would have known if his schooling had been better. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger has criticised he BBC for excluding Jo Swinson from the standoff debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, arguing the decision granted an exclusive platform to two pro-Brexit leaders. A third Labour candidate in one day has been been embroiled in controversy surrounding allegations of antisemitism. Jewish News reported that Laura McAlpine, the party\u2019s candidate for Harlow, defended her chief campaigner after he wrote about a \u201cJewish final solution\u201d to the Israel and Palestine conflict. McAlpine, who is aiming to unseat the Tory MP Robert Halfon, refused to condemn the remarks of Brett Hawksbee, despite a party official having warned that Hawksbee had \u201cbreached IHRA (the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism) in almost every single way possible\u201d, the article stated. Hawksbee blogged in September 2018: \u201cThe fear of many on the left is that the ideological successors of the bombers of the King David hotel, the mass murderers who decimated Deir Yassin, would be quite happy to see a pogrom in Gaza and the West Bank, a Jewish final solution to the Palestine problem.\u201d According to the article, one email circulated to Labour staffers stated that McAlpine \u201cisn\u2019t happy with the first line (of the apology) because she doesn\u2019t want to be disloyal to someone who \u2018organises so much for her and who she is on the phone with three times a day\u2019\u201d. Boris Johnson has turned his failed \u201cBrexit - do or die\u201d pledge into a \u201cdo or dry\u201d, claiming he has given up alcohol until after Brexit is sorted, PA Media reports. But according to the report, the prime minister was \u201cwatched sipping whisky during a distillery visit in Scotland on Thursday, casting doubt on his commitment to the alcohol ban\u201d. His [\u201cdo or dry\u201d] remark came while chatting about health matters with nurses at the King\u2019s Mill hospital in Nottinghamshire. Johnson asked them to tell him more about the local Ashfield area, noting: \u201cSomeone said there\u2019s a lot of first-time mums who are smoking or something like that. Is that right?\u201d The PM was told a lot of people smoke in Ashfield, before he switched his attention to vaping, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not certain about it. It might just encourage them to get into nicotine.\u201d He then asked: \u201cWhat about alcohol?\u201d before adding: \u201cI\u2019ve had to give it up until we get Brexit done.\u201d Johnson did not clarify whether he meant the first phase of Brexit \u2013 until the end of January 2020 \u2013 or the end of the transition period \u2013 in December next year \u2013 or what would happen if the UK remained in the EU. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in a live BBC debate in Southampton on 6 December just six days before Britons head to the polls. The BBC will also present a live seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK\u2019s major political parties on 29 November in Cardiff. The Today presenter and former BBC political editor Nick Robinson, who will present the two debates, said he hoped they would \u201cilluminate the choice we all face between competing parties, leaders, policies and visions for the country\u201d. This from Kamal Ahmed, the BBC\u2019s editorial director: Nicola Sturgeon had previously described the decision by Sky to only invite Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson for a live debate as \u201coutrageous\u201d: A good point made by the Sun\u2019s Kate Ferguson: This from my colleague Kate Proctor, reporting from Nigel Farage\u2019s rally in Pontypool, south Wales. Pontypool is in the Torfaen constituency, which has been held by the Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds since 2015. As predicted by some, the official Twitter account of the Conservative party just shared a meme featuring Nicola Sturgeon with a miniature Jeremy Corbyn in her pocket. Many of you, dear readers, will remember the original, a billboard showing Ed Miliband stuffed into the pocket of Alex Salmond, with some believing it was this poster that forced Miliband to rule out an SNP coalition during the 2015 general election campaign. While Nicola Sturgeon used her election campaign launch speech to declare war on Boris Johnson, he was given a tour of a school and tried to make a clay figure inspired by British sculptor Sir Antony Gormley, PA Media reports: Speaking at the George Spencer Academy, near Nottingham, the prime minister remarked he had \u201cgunk\u201d on him before declaring the task would be \u201ca piece of cake\u201d. But seconds later, Johnson paused before joking: \u201cIt\u2019s all going horribly wrong\u201d as he had not followed the guide, and noted he was creating a figure similar to \u201cTerminator\u201d. He also told pupils: \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting chap Antony Gormley \u2013 all his sculptures are modelled on himself and then he persuades people to pay colossal sums for his own image around the world. It\u2019s amazing success he\u2019s had.\u201d Political commentators widely consider Sturgeon\u2019s hints that Labour might support a second Scottish referendum a boost for the Tory campaign. This from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: And this from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield: This from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on Sturgeon\u2019s speech, making a point others have previously made about the Catalonia independence referendum: Here are Sturgeon\u2019s comments on the possibility of a hung parliament, courtesy of the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: Will Nicola Sturgeon also demand that the Trident missile system be moved from Scottish waters before she will support a Corbyn government? This from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith: Sturgeon said her party would not lend support to any party that would stand in the way of a new Scottish independence referendum. It will be interesting to see how this pledge will be compatible with her statement that the SNP MPs \u201cwould seek to form a progressive alliance to lock the Tories out of government\u201d. This is the take of Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: This from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen: Sturgeon wraps up and says she looks forward to the campaign trail. My colleague Severin Carrell asks: One of the key challenges for Corbyn would be getting a budget passed. Would the SNP not pass that budget if Labour wouldn\u2019t support another Scottish referendum? Sturgeon says it can\u2019t be expected of the SNP to support anybody who doesn\u2019t recognise the Scottish right to self-determination. Sturgeon adds that Corbyn is someone who supports self-determination \u201cfor literally every other country in the world\u201d. It would be \u201cmighty strange\u201d if he didn\u2019t support it for Scotland. We don\u2019t even know whether Jeremy Corbyn would campaign for remain or leave, Sturgeon says. That\u2019s why voting SNP is the best way for the Scottish to avoid Brexit, she adds. Any party that doesn\u2019t offer another Scottish independence referendum would not be supported, Sturgeon says. But there are many other significant issues facing Scotland, such as devolution and climate change. Sturgeon says the PM is not a man whose word can be taken seriously. When asked whether she would seek to prevent a Tory government by putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10, she says she\u2019s no fan of Jeremy Corbyn and that she would never support a Conservative government. Nicola Sturgeon just delivered her campaign launch speech. She said Scotland had world-class institutions and should be entering a \u201cgolden era\u201d. \u201cIf you are sick of the chaos ... vote SNP to escape Brexit,\u201d she said. People who despair over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lack of leadership should also vote SNP. The SNP would support revoking article 50, she tells a reporter but reiterates that Scotland needs to take its fate into its own hands. My colleague Kate Proctor will be reporting from a Nigel Farage rally in Wales this morning. My colleague Severin Carrell, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, will be at the SNP\u2019s election campaign launch with Nicola Sturgeon near Holyrood, and will keep us updated on the campaign of the Scottish Greens, which is set to launch at 11.30. There is no love lost between the two parties, he says. The Greens are refusing to stand down candidates in key marginals, on a pro-indy pro-remain alliance basis. My colleague Jonathan Freedland is talking about the shambolic start to the general election campaign on the latest episode of the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. Boris Johnson told broadcast reporters today that suggesting the NHS could be up for grabs under his deal was \u201cpure Loch Ness monster\u201d territory, the Press Association reports. Asked whether he would legislate to protect the NHS from US intervention, the PM said: We can do free trade deals with countries around the world but under us the NHS is not for sale. It\u2019s not going to be on any kind of international trade negotiation. This is pure Loch Ness monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff. The NHS, free at the point of use, is a fantastic service and we not only believe in it, but are investing more in it than at any time in recent memory and we\u2019ll continue to do so. And back to election fever. Rumours say the former Labour MP Roger Godsiff, who was axed by the Labour party as its candidate for Birmingham Hall Green over comments on LGBT teaching, is to be replaced with Ibrahim Dogus, the mayor of Lambeth, who is backed by the Labour leadership and trade unions. Dogus was previously in the running to stand in Labour-held Vauxhall to replace Kate Hoey, but lost to Florence Eshalomi. In other news: The 30% Club, which campaigns for better gender balance through voluntary action from businesses, has launched its The Missing Millions report at the London Stock Exchange Group this morning. According to the report, companies that fail to prioritise gender equality are missing out on millions of pounds. The report quotes a US study of 350 start-ups founded and co-founded by women, which reveals they generated 10% more in cumulative revenue over a five-year period and delivered twice as much for every dollar invested as those set up by men. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives are off to a good start today, with a video of Boris Johnson stating falsehoods about post-Brexit trade with Northern Ireland circulating widely, and the fall of two Labour candidates for the upcoming general election because of anti-Semitism allegations. There is much anger and scorn on the wires about both situations. This from Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer: And this from MailOnline\u2019s Jack Maidment: And here we have the same point made by the Lib Dem\u2019s Tom Brake: This from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges on the two disgraced Labour candidates: This from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield: According to LBC, the Labour candidate Ian Byrne, who is running in the safe seat of Liverpool West Derby, is responsible for a number of misogynist social media comments against female politicians. In a post on Facebook in 2015 about Michelle Mone, the founder of underwear brand Ultimo, he called on his supporters to \u201chit the c**t where it hurts\u201d. It emerged yesterday that the Tory candidate Nick Conrad will not stand in the Broadland seat in Norfolk, due to controversial comments about rape in 2014. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has written a story on how thousands of children in care whose immigration status will be affected by Brexit could face homelessness, immigration detention or deportation. This from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner: Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of NatCen Social Research, has written an interesting comment about the voting age for the Times Red Box, stating that the majority of the public (60 per cent) think we should leave things as they are, while 19 per cent think 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed to vote, and 16 per cent say the voting age should be raised to 21. \u201cNearly a quarter of those aged 65 or over think older is better when it comes to voting in general elections,\u201d she writes. Quick reminder that\u2019s it worth refreshing this blog every once in a while, as sometimes posts get amended, but especially if you dislike typos. The SNP parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, told the Today programme that his partywas \u201cdetermined\u201d to pass legislation that would allow it to hold another referendum on Scottish independence. He added that the referendum needed to happen in 2020, so that Scotland could inform the EU of its wish to remain and then move into independent EU membership. Asked whether the SNP would be prepared to support Jeremy Corbyn if he offered a referendum, Blackford said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of supporting Jeremy Corbyn, because it\u2019s a question that we would put to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, that they must respect the votes of the people of Scotland. \u201cWe\u2019ve won every election over the course of the last few years in Scotland, but crucially we won a mandate to have a referendum on Scottish independence.\u201d A second Scottish Labour election candidate has been dropped after she posted an image on Twitter which appeared to threaten the Scottish National party candidate Joanna Cherry, who is defending her seat of Edinburgh South West. Frances Hoole was selected to stand against Cherry, who won Edinburgh South West in 2015 and held it in 2017. She was brought before Scottish Labour national executive on Wednesday after posting a composite image of Cherry\u2019s face being sprayed from a Cillit Bang household cleaner bottle with the caption \u201cBang. And the terf is gone.\u201d \u201cTerf\u201d is the term used by trans-rights activists to describe women who are critics as \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminists\u201d. Cherry has been a leading figure in the campaign by women parliamentarians and activists in the SNP challenging some gender-recognition plans, including altering census questions. Hoole apologised on Twitter and told the Edinburgh Evening News she accepted her tweet was unacceptable and apologised. \u201cI am genuinely really sorry I posted it. I\u2019m sorry about the violent content. \u201cI apologised about the actual content of the meme. It was silly, I posted it without looking very hard at it.\u201d Her removal came on the same day another Scottish Labour candidate, Kate Ramsden, stood down in Gordon in north east Scotland after a blog emerged where she described Israel as \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. According to the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson, an alliance of 51 Labour MPs has signed a letter pledging \u201cto campaign to Remain in any confirmatory referendum\u201d. Signatories include Wes Streeting, David Lammy, Margaret Beckett, Rosie Duffield and Helen Hayes. The letter states: Nothing in politics is inevitable. Brexit can be stopped, but only through the Labour Party. Remain Labour is pleased to announce that 51 Labour Parliamentary Candidates have signed an election pledge which states: \u201cLabour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.\u201d Below is the current list of signatories to the pledge, which we fully expect to grow during the campaign. If you are a candidate who would like to sign our pledge, please contact laura@remain-labour.co.uk. Tonia Antoniazzi, Gower Margaret Beckett, Derby South Ben Bradshaw, Exeter Ruth Cadbury, Brentford and Isleworth Janet Daby, Lewisham East Geraint Davies, Swansea West Thangam Debbonaire, Bristol West Stephen Doughty, Cardiff South and Penarth Rosie Duffield, Canterbury Maria Eagle, South Liverpool and Halewood Paul Farrelly, Newcastle-under-Lyme Vicky Foxcroft, Lewisham Deptford Helen Hayes, Dulwich and West Norwood Darren Jones, Bristol North Susan Jones, Clwyd South Ged Killen, Rutherglen and Hamilton West Peter Kyle, Hove David Lammy, Tottenham Kerry McCarthy, Bristol East Siobhain McDonagh, Mitcham and Morden Alison McGovern, Wirral South Catherine McKinnell, Newcastle upon Tyne Anna McMorrin, Cardiff North Ian Murray, Edinburgh South Madeleine Moon, Bridgend Stephen Morgan, Portsmouth South Mathew Pennycook, Greenwich and Woolwich Steve Reed, Croydon North Ellie Reeves, Lewisham West and Penge Andy Slaughter, Hammersmith and Fulham Wes Streeting, Ilford North Paul Sweeney, Glasgow North East Jo Stevens, Cardiff Central Gareth Thomas, Harrow West Anna Turley, Redcar Daniel Zeichner, Cambridge Marina Ahmad, Beckenham Callum Anderson, South West Bedfordshire Fleur Anderson, Putney Karen Davies, Norwich North Pam Duncan-Glancy, Glasgow North Rachel Eden, Reading West Flo Eshalomi, Vauxhall Dan Greef, South Cambridgeshire Faten Hameed, Glasgow Central Peter Lamb, Crawley Martin McCluskey, Inverclyde Cheryl Pidgeon, Rushcliffe Moira Ramage, Paisley and Renfrewshire Matt Uberoi, Chelsea and Fulham Emma Whysall, Chipping Barnet The crossbench peer Gus O\u2019Donnell has said on the Today programme that the future chancellor would have to increase taxes in order to fund the government\u2019s and the opposition\u2019s current spending promises. \u201cWhen you look at the big capital spending increases \u2013 it\u2019s about 50 billion for Labour, 20 billion for the Conservatives - do we have the capacity?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe civil servants who are writing their briefing packs for the incoming ministers for various parties will be thinking: well what could you spend this on? \u201cWhat\u2019s, as it were, shovel ready? Will you get good value for money if you rush at it this quickly? \u201cSo I think there\u2019ll be lots of bottlenecks.\u201d The Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West, Christine Jardine, has criticised the SNP\u2019s push for another independence referendum, and told Sky that she believes the SNP needs \u201cto start thinking about what\u2019s best for the people of Scotland, not independence\u201d. The Clacton Labour candidate, Gideon Bull, has quit over the accusation that he used an antisemitic term in front of a Jewish Labour councillor. According to the BBC\u2019s Simon Dedman, Bull admitted in an interview with BBC Essex to using the term \u201cShylock\u201d in a meeting, but added: \u201cThe allegation that I called a Jewish cabinet member \u2018Shylock\u2019 is entirely false.\u201d While on the campaign trail, Boris Johnson promised there won\u2019t be any checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, a comment that has caused much furore on Twitter. This from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll: And this from Sky\u2019s deputy political editor, Sam Coates: And this from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: While membership growth is of course a boost for Labour\u2019s chances at the polls next month, it remains to be seen whether the party will be able to overcome scepticism amongst moderate supporters. Mike Gapes, the long-standing MP for Ilford South, who left the Labour party earlier this year, accused Shami Chakrabarti of \u201cwhitewashing\u201d in regard to her comments today on antisemitism. The Spectator\u2019s editor, Fraser Nelson, has gone as far as suggesting that Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as the party\u2019s deputy leader and Ian Austin\u2019s decision to leave the party and endorse the Conservatives is a sign that \u201ctrue Labour supporters need to vote for Boris Johnson\u201d. Labour party membership numbers are recovering, according to PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. In July, it emerged that tens of thousands of members had quit, causing membership to shrink to less than half a million. The Labour peer and shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the Labour party had dragged its feet over complaints about antisemitism. When asked about an opinion poll in the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, according to which the vast majority of British Jews consider Jeremy Corbyn to be an antisemite, she responded: \u201cThat obviously is incredibly alarming and disappointing. Because we dragged our feet on implementation for so long there is a trust gap. \u201cAnd so even though I believe that our procedures are way better now than they were a few years ago, it\u2019s going to take time to rebuild trust, and it\u2019s going to take more than procedures.\u201d Chakrabarti also described Labour\u2019s pledge to change the way women are treated at work as \u201cperhaps the most radical offer to women in 50 years\u201d. Under a Labour-led government, mothers will be given maternity pay for a full year after the birth of their children and all employees will have a right to work flexibly, according to the party\u2019s manifesto. Hello, I\u2019m taking over the blog from my colleague Kate Lyons. The SNP is launching its election campaign today. Hours ahead of the launch, the party\u2019s official Twitter account shared an article from the Scotsman, in which it was reported yesterday that Boris Johnson would not allow another Scottish independence referendum, and that the PM had claimed the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and Jeremy Corbyn were \u201cyoke-mates of destruction\u201d over the threat they both pose to the future of the UK. Sturgeon is to seek a section 30 order before the end of the year from whoever will be the next PM, which would allow Scotland to stage another vote on leaving the UK. Speaking before the launch, Sturgeon said: A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and to give people in Scotland the chance to choose a better future as an independent country so we never have to worry about our NHS being sold off by a Westminster government. [...] And while the Scottish parliament has control of health policy, we cannot currently stop Westminster signing away that protection in a trade deal, or entering agreements that dramatically push up drug prices or risk our public services, including the NHS. Boris Johnson has been very clear about his desire for a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump \u2013 and no one should underestimate the threat which that poses. PA Media has this report on Margaret Hodge\u2019s interview on BBC Radio 4 this morning: Hodge, when asked who she would prefer to have as prime minister \u2013 Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 said: \u201cI want a Labour government.\u201d When pressed on the issue, the Labour candidate told the Today programme: \u201cI think any government is more than any individual. And I want a Labour government. And I think that was as true of the past as it is of the present.\u201d She told the programme there are parts of the current Labour project with which she disagrees: \u201cI will not give up fighting for what I believe to be right and moral and important. I will never do that.\u201d Hodge said there was \u201csome hostility\u201d to the work she had done around fighting antisemitism, adding: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a terrible reflection that actually there is myself and Ruth Smeeth and we\u2019re the only two women Jewish MPs left on the Labour side.\u201d The papers Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, on Boris Johnson: What\u2019s happening today? Nigel Farage is heading to Wales and will be attending a rally for the Brexit party in Pontypool at about midday and then another at Newport in the evening. Labour will be holding a lunchtime event in Stevenage featuring Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, who announced last night she would be throwing her hat into the ring for the job of deputy Labour leader. Jo Swinson is in Fife and Boris Johnson is on pooled visits, though it\u2019s unclear exactly where. The list of candidates who have stood down for inappropriate behaviour continues to grow. A former radio host running as a Conservative candidate for Broadland in Norfolk withdrew from the race after saying women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape and a Labour candidate who had been standing for Gordon in Aberdeenshire announced she would no longer run after it emerged she had made comments comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, was among those told this week by the national executive committee that he would not be endorsed as a Labour candidate over his support for people protesting against the teaching of LGBT equality classes at a local school. He has confirmed he will run as an Independent Labour candidate. Good morning! It\u2019s day two of the election campaign and we hope you\u2019re still brimful of energy for political news. I\u2019m Kate Lyons and will be bringing you the day\u2019s political news early in the morning, before I hand over the blog. As usual, you can get in touch via Twitter or email. The parties have started unveiling their plans and promises as leaders travel the country, laying out their stalls for election. Boris Johnson has announced a plan for half-price visas and preferential immigration processes for doctors and nurses wanting to work in the UK. The new NHS visa would cost just \u00a3464 and would operate under a fast-track process, with applicants guaranteed a decision within two weeks. Labour has unveiled its plans to improve equality in the workplace, pledging to introduce maternity pay for a full year after the birth of a child and give workers the rights to choose hours that suit them, putting the onus on employers to explain why they cannot offer flexible working hours. The announcement comes as the shock of Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as deputy leader continues to ripple through the party. Watson\u2019s allies have called his decision a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the centre, with one saying \u201cit leaves some of us feeling abandoned. Tom was our shield.\u201d The race to replace him has already begun, with Dawn Butler, the women\u2019s and equalities shadow minister, the first to announce she will be throwing her hat in the ring for the job. Rajeev Syal has written this guide to the runners and riders for the job. But both parties have been warned by the Institute of Fiscal Studies about their ambitious spending promises, saying that the public spending bidding war Labour and the Conservatives are engaged in may return infrastructure investment back to 1970s levels, but may also be undeliverable.

I don\u2019t know if my body just, like, out of a desperate need to find a place for my anxiety or find a use for it, takes it and puts it there.\u201d</p> <p>The December issue of Vogue, which features Lizzo wearing a black bustier dress by Versace, an Adrienne Landau feather boa and Chopard earrings on the cover, marks the two-year anniversary of Edward Enninful\u2019s editorship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Lizzo on Vogue\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "The singer and rapper Lizzo has spoken of how she was affected by seeing negative and stereotypical images of plus-size bodies as a child. \u201cI would watch things on television and look at magazines and I would not see myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t see yourself, you think something is wrong with you.\u201d Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson, said this lack of representation affected her mental health. \u201cYou want to look like those things and when you realise it\u2019s a physical impossibility you start to think, \u2018What the fuck is wrong with me?\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that took a bigger toll on me, psychologically, growing up than what anyone could have said to me.\u201d The singer, who has been acclaimed for being a plus-size celebrity, also talked about the dangers of using body positivity as a marketing tool. \u201cAnybody that uses body positivity to sell something is using it for their personal gain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t selling anything in the beginning. We were just selling ourselves and selling ourselves on the idea \u2013 selling ourselves on ourselves.\u201d Interviewed in the latest edition of British Vogue, the classically trained singer also reveals the anxiety that fuels her turbo-charged performances. \u201cWhen I get really, really anxious before a show, I just go harder and harder and harder when I\u2019m performing and I just go crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but my anxiety sometimes fuels who I am as a performer and who I am as an artist. I don\u2019t know if my body just, like, out of a desperate need to find a place for my anxiety or find a use for it, takes it and puts it there.\u201d The December issue of Vogue, which features Lizzo wearing a black bustier dress by Versace, an Adrienne Landau feather boa and Chopard earrings on the cover, marks the two-year anniversary of Edward Enninful\u2019s editorship. It has two cover stars, the other being the actor Emma Watson, but the choice of Lizzo underlines Enninful\u2019s commitment to championing diversity: His first cover featured the Ghanaian-British model Adwoa Aboah, while later cover stars have included Jourdan Dunn, Naomi Campbell and Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u201cSeeing such a positive force for good on our cover in all her glory makes me realise how far we have come.

      "bodyText": "Billionaires seem to be nervous about the prospect of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic nomination for president. On Thursday, the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the door to a possible 2020 run \u2013 which would make him the second billionaire, alongside Tom Steyer, to finance a run for the White House. A day earlier, Bill Gates expressed disdain for Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax. \u201cI\u2019ve paid over $10bn in taxes,\u201d Gates said at the New York Times\u2019s Dealbook conference on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20bn, it\u2019s fine. But when you say I should pay $100bn, OK, then I\u2019m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.\u201d Gates, whose net worth is an estimated $107bn, would have a mere $7bn to survive on under that scenario. But as the Warren campaign was quick to point out, he wouldn\u2019t be forced to pay anywhere near that much. To illustrate the point, Warren shared a tool on her site called A Calculator for Billionaires to help Gates, Bloomberg and other wealth hoarders work out how much they would pay. \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d the site explains. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.\u201d The page first asks visitors if they are a billionaire or not. A yes answer offers a prompt to enter your net worth, with quick links available for Bloomberg, Gates or Leon Cooperman, the hedge-fund billionaire who recently criticized Warren\u2019s tax proposals as \u201cidiocy\u201d and \u201cbull\u201d. Clicking through as Gates brings an exciting result. \u201cWow! You\u2019ve got a lot of money,\u201d it reads. \u201cYour wealth puts you in the top 0.0002% of Americans. Now you have the opportunity to invest some of it back into our society so everyone has a chance to succeed.\u201d Gates would pay $6.379bn in tax next year, according to the calculator. Bloomberg would pay $3.079bn. Overall, Warren\u2019s tax would install a 2% rate on a net worth of $50m to $1bn, and 6% for those who earn more than $1bn. \u201cGood news \u2013 you\u2019ll still be extraordinarily rich!\u201d the calculator says. \u201cAnd if history is any guide, if you do nothing other than invest your wealth in the stock market, it\u2019s likely that your wealth will continue to grow.\u201d",

Time after time the stats show just how short of staff we really are, but anyone working on the frontline will tell you the real situation is even worse.</p> <p>The next government must deliver for hardworking and dedicated NHS staff. We need to double the number of medical students and rapidly increase the numbers of doctors, nurses and other clinicians in training, while also creating an environment where our people are valued, recognised and rewarded.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> Andrew Goddard</strong><br><em>President</em><em>, Royal College of Physicians</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article fails to consider the impact of the loss of those doctors on the source countries. The UK already employs over 66,000 doctors from outside the EU, mostly from low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC), which have much lower doctor-to-population ratios than our own, and whose populations suffer a much greater disease burden. Thus despite decades of medical training schemes in LAMIC, Africa still has only 1.3% of the global health workforce and 25% of the disease burden.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s exasperating that when NHS staff are buckling under significant workforce shortages and growing patient need, one government department continues to ignore a quick win that could alleviate that pressure and improve patient care. (\u2018No-brainer\u2019 plans to allow more foreign doctors into UK blocked by the Home Office, 4 November). Clinicians are putting our faith in the next government to get to grips with the health and care workforce crisis. Time after time the stats show just how short of staff we really are, but anyone working on the frontline will tell you the real situation is even worse. The next government must deliver for hardworking and dedicated NHS staff. We need to double the number of medical students and rapidly increase the numbers of doctors, nurses and other clinicians in training, while also creating an environment where our people are valued, recognised and rewarded. Prof Andrew Goddard President, Royal College of Physicians \u2022 Your article fails to consider the impact of the loss of those doctors on the source countries. The UK already employs over 66,000 doctors from outside the EU, mostly from low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC), which have much lower doctor-to-population ratios than our own, and whose populations suffer a much greater disease burden. Thus despite decades of medical training schemes in LAMIC, Africa still has only 1.3% of the global health workforce and 25% of the disease burden. The numbers returning to their source countries after specialist training in the UK is extremely small \u2013 only 175 over the last five years. The UK is a signatory to the World Health Organization code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel 2010, which recommends that member states discourage active recruitment from LAMICs facing critical shortages of health workers (and never recruits from the 57 poorest countries), and create their own sustainable health workforce. At present the UK is employing over 7,000 doctors from the 57 poorest countries. It is time to stop behaving like a plumber who, when called to mend a burst pipe, instead pours in more water, and indeed acquires such water from countries suffering extreme drought. The UK has unfilled medical posts because of a very high rate of premature retirement across all age groups, and it is this issue that needs to be tackled, together with further expansion of UK medical training, rather than continuing to damage health systems in LAMIC.

      "bodyText": "Hopes of an early end to the US-China trade war have received a setback after Donald Trump said he had yet to agree to start reducing tariffs on imports from America\u2019s rival. The US president said that while he was keen on a deal with China, reports from Beijing that he had agreed to start phasing out tariffs were untrue. In what will be seen as an attempt to extract fresh concessions from Xi Jinping, Trump told reporters there was not a deal in place to reduce any levies on Chinese goods. The Chinese commerce ministry had boosted optimism that 18 months of intensifying protectionism might be coming to an end when it said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases. But there was immediate pushback from White House officials, who feel more work needs to be done before the two presidents can meet to sign a deal. Although tariffs on imported goods are hitting corporate profits and leading to higher prices for US consumers, Trump said he was happy with the current state of affairs. \u201cThey\u2019d like to have a rollback but I\u2019ve not agreed to anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback because they know I won\u2019t do it. \u201cWe\u2019re getting along very well with China.

The deputy chief constable of Essex police, Pippa Mills, told reporters in Grays that these lorry deaths were \u201can absolute tragedy\u201d and a \u201ctragic discovery\u201d to have made. And the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2019-10-28/boris-johnson-signs-book-of-condolence-over-essex-lorry-deaths/\" title=\"\">signed a book of condolence</a> to the victims, writing that \u201cthe whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country\u201d. </p> <p>Throughout the year, journalists, politicians and investigators have described similar incidents by appealing to emotions in a manner that presents migrant deaths as something apolitical.

When more than 100 migrants perished off Lampedusa in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-italy-migrants\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Mignon</a>, the then president of the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly, claimed that \u201ca terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>For many, these words of grief seem most fitting for the description of such incidents. They allow us to express the emotions we feel as witnesses to unnecessary deaths, and they point to the suffering that people endure in their attempts to secure better lives.</p> <p>Such appeals to emotion, however, carry out other work behind the scenes \u2013 work that does not always have migrants\u2019 best interests at heart. While emotive language is understandable, we need to combine this with critical commentary and political analysis. Simply labelling events as \u201ctragedies\u201d, without any analysis of the conditions that created them, frames avoidable deaths as exceptional, isolated, symbolic incidents. We are encouraged to pause, to weep and to regret. We are not, however, encouraged to investigate, criticise or protest.</p> <p>In these moments of mourning, we lose sight of politics and the question of culpability. Migrant deaths can be presented as accidents rather than the logical outcome of border policies that deliberately reduce legal pathways of migration. </p> <p>Framing such events in mainly emotional terms can hide people\u2019s histories. In learning of the fate of the 39 Essex migrants, we focus on the moment of death, somewhere en route from Belgium, rather than on the more complex individual stories. Likewise, we think of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean or in Mexico in isolation from the lives that came before. The last page of a person\u2019s story becomes the only page we are asked to read.</p> <p>What has happened to the longer stories of why these individuals travelled to Europe or America?

      "bodyText": "The 39 Vietnamese nationals whose bodies were discovered in a lorry trailer in Essex last month had pinned their hopes for their futures on their journey to the UK. Images taken of the lorry show stickers on its windscreen displaying the words The Ultimate Dream \u2013 a deeply ironic reflection on the reality for so many migrants. Newspapers and articles covering the subsequent investigation have adopted the language of tragedy, horror and shock \u2013 the Independent referred to the \u201ctragic deaths\u201d, a Global Times editorial talked of a \u201cserious humanitarian disaster\u201d that occurred \u201cunder the eyes of\u201d the British, and the BBC has repeatedly used the word \u201ctragedy\u201d in its reports. Meanwhile, the police force has used similar language in its statements. The deputy chief constable of Essex police, Pippa Mills, told reporters in Grays that these lorry deaths were \u201can absolute tragedy\u201d and a \u201ctragic discovery\u201d to have made. And the prime minister, Boris Johnson, signed a book of condolence to the victims, writing that \u201cthe whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country\u201d. Throughout the year, journalists, politicians and investigators have described similar incidents by appealing to emotions in a manner that presents migrant deaths as something apolitical. After the discovery of the bodies of 58 Chinese people in a container in Dover in 2000, Gwyn Prosser, the then Labour MP for Dover and Deal, said he was stunned by the event, which emphasised \u201cthe awful desperation some people must be experiencing to take the chances they take to cross the channel on the backs of lorries\u201d. The invocation of a humanitarian \u2013 rather than a political \u2013 shock and grief is prominent in reports about people who die attempting to cross the border between the US and Mexico, as well as in reports of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea. When more than 100 migrants perished off Lampedusa in 2013, Jean-Claude Mignon, the then president of the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly, claimed that \u201ca terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe\u201d. For many, these words of grief seem most fitting for the description of such incidents. They allow us to express the emotions we feel as witnesses to unnecessary deaths, and they point to the suffering that people endure in their attempts to secure better lives. Such appeals to emotion, however, carry out other work behind the scenes \u2013 work that does not always have migrants\u2019 best interests at heart. While emotive language is understandable, we need to combine this with critical commentary and political analysis. Simply labelling events as \u201ctragedies\u201d, without any analysis of the conditions that created them, frames avoidable deaths as exceptional, isolated, symbolic incidents. We are encouraged to pause, to weep and to regret. We are not, however, encouraged to investigate, criticise or protest. In these moments of mourning, we lose sight of politics and the question of culpability. Migrant deaths can be presented as accidents rather than the logical outcome of border policies that deliberately reduce legal pathways of migration. Framing such events in mainly emotional terms can hide people\u2019s histories. In learning of the fate of the 39 Essex migrants, we focus on the moment of death, somewhere en route from Belgium, rather than on the more complex individual stories. Likewise, we think of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean or in Mexico in isolation from the lives that came before. The last page of a person\u2019s story becomes the only page we are asked to read. What has happened to the longer stories of why these individuals travelled to Europe or America? What factors made them feel that they had no choice but to attempt dangerous, and often illegal, journeys? It is here, in the narratives of violence, conflict, oppression and discrimination, that we can find the true \u201ctragedies\u201d. But since these tragedies are deeply political, and deeply connected to big issues such as labour exploitation, people-smuggling and the lack of legal migration routes for those seeking international protection, we are not encouraged to consider them. If we do not look into the deep-rooted dynamics of migration and its connection to suffering, then we will never truly be able to prevent incidents like this from happening again. Here we are, 19 years on from the Dover lorry deaths, six years on from the Lampedusa disaster, discussing the same issues in the same language. Meanwhile, nothing fundamental has changed in terms of the driving forces which propel people away from the places that they used to call home. What remains outside the order of emotive language is the figure of a migrant with a history and a voice, who we can stand with in the struggle for rights. Migrants should not become silent victims who we cry for \u2013 they need to be talked about as subjects seeking political rights and protection. They need politics, not pity. \u2022 Imogen Dobie is a PhD student focusing on issues of migration and asylum",

I was trying to remember who had floated the idea that you could dictate to the EU in this way, when the name came to me: it was a guy called Boris Johnson. A real end-to-end service, as has always been the case with Johnson and Brexit since his Brussels correspondent days. He makes you sick so he can sell you the cure, and when the cure makes you even sicker, he\u2019ll flog you the cure for that. I mean, I\u2019ll tolerate this as the business model for Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/28/goop-london-wellness-summit-gwyneth-paltrow\" title=\"\">Goop website</a>, but feel like it\u2019s aiming low for a country.</p> \n<p>Ditto the truly alarming clip of Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/08/there-will-not-be-checks-on-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-great-britain-boris-johnson-says-video\" title=\"\">lurching and rambling</a> at a Northern Ireland reception on Thursday night, during which he appeared to misunderstand Irish border checks, his own Brexit deal, and when to close his mouth. I know we\u2019ve all had to lower our bars, but I guess I still want the person in control to be able to control himself.</p> \n<p>The most disturbing element of this performance is that the prime minister will almost certainly not have drunk a drop of alcohol. Just as it did in his nightmarish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/boris-johnson-twilight-zone-police-escort-conservatives\" title=\"\">turn at the police academy</a> a few weeks ago, the task of governing even himself seemed quite beyond him. Frequently accused of sexual incontinence, Johnson now seems to have developed verbal incontinence. And who knows what besides. That\u2019s the thing about unchecked appetites: they end up consuming you.</p> \n<p>So let\u2019s play out this first week of the election campaign with the prime minister shambling about, like the grotesque illustration to some cautionary nursery rhyme. \u201cBoris was so self-obsessed / It quite devoured all the rest / Nothing but a husk remained / To his ego was he chained. / Here he gurgled on the telly / Droning about vermicelli / There he mumbled customs vows / His own supporters raising brows. / Children out for number one / Start with friends but end with none. / They\u2019re left quite mad and most unhappy / Needing several kinds of nappy.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Ditto the truly alarming clip of Johnson lurching and rambling at a Northern Ireland reception on Thursday night, during which he appeared to misunderstand Irish border checks, his own Brexit deal, and when to close his mouth. I know we\u2019ve all had to lower our bars, but I guess I still want the person in control to be able to control himself. The most disturbing element of this performance is that the prime minister will almost certainly not have drunk a drop of alcohol. Just as it did in his nightmarish turn at the police academy a few weeks ago, the task of governing even himself seemed quite beyond him. Frequently accused of sexual incontinence, Johnson now seems to have developed verbal incontinence. And who knows what besides. That\u2019s the thing about unchecked appetites: they end up consuming you. So let\u2019s play out this first week of the election campaign with the prime minister shambling about, like the grotesque illustration to some cautionary nursery rhyme. \u201cBoris was so self-obsessed / It quite devoured all the rest / Nothing but a husk remained / To his ego was he chained. / Here he gurgled on the telly / Droning about vermicelli / There he mumbled customs vows / His own supporters raising brows. / Children out for number one / Start with friends but end with none. / They\u2019re left quite mad and most unhappy / Needing several kinds of nappy.\u201d \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

The Huddersfield-based baby and maternity retailer collapsed into administration on Friday and was immediately bought back by other firms controlled by Bluegem Capital, its private equity owner. The arrangement, which allows a failing company to ditch some of its debts, is called a pre-pack administration. The business will continue to trade from 26 shops, preserving more than 600 jobs. A company spokesman said the appointment of administrators from Deloitte was not linked to Mothercare\u2019s collapse earlier this week. Mamas &amp; Papas, which was founded in 1981, is a major supplier to Mothercare but is understood to have limited its debts to the retailer. Mothercare began a closing down sale at all of its 79 UK stores on Friday. Riccardo Cincotta, the executive chairman of Mamas &amp; Papas, said the store closures and administration were \u201cnecessary in a challenging market\u201d to ensure the firm can realise \u201cits considerable future potential\u201d. He said Mamas &amp; Papas would continue to review its store portfolio in the light of changing shopper behaviour, but remained \u201cfully focused on maintaining our position as the UK\u2019s most popular nursery brand\u201d. \u201cOur digital performance is tracking ahead of expectation, our wholesale distribution in the UK and internationally continues to grow,\u201d he said. The administration comes five years after Mamas &amp; Papas cut rents via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement, or CVA, after Bluegem took control of the business. The latest difficulties at Mamas &amp; Papas also come just a few months after Sports Direct bought Bluegem\u2019s Jack Wills fashion chain out of administration.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s outriders used to boast during the 2016 referendum that unlike David Cameron, whose slick campaign events were carefully controlled, their man actually enjoyed the rough and tumble of getting off the Vote Leave bus and in among the public. But at the end of this first gaffe-strewn week of the general election campaign, the prime minister has barely met a voter \u2013 aside from the Northern Irish manufacturers he addressed in a rambling speech on Thursday evening, during which he appeared to misconstrue his own Brexit deal. It certainly was not the start the prime minister would have hoped for. The week began with Jacob Rees-Mogg being forced to apologise over remarks about the Grenfell Tower fire, and continued with Alun Cairns resigning as Welsh secretary over his support for a former aide whose testimony caused a rape trial to collapse. Tory advisers were not shrugging off the seriousness of the Rees-Mogg comments or the Cairns debacle, saying the response to both of them indicated they knew both could have spiralled badly. \u201cThey weren\u2019t problems of our own making. So we did the only thing we could to make them not problems any more as fast as possible,\u201d says one aide. The same approach was taken again on Thursday night when a Tory candidate withdrew after being heavily criticised for having once said women should keep their knickers on to avoid rape. After the disastrous start to the campaign, weary and worried cabinet ministers piled on a train to Birmingham on Wednesday night for the prime minister\u2019s first stump speech of the campaign \u2013 some, such as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, in first class and others such as the departing culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, braving it in standard along with hordes of journalists. The event itself was like no previous Tory eve-of-election gathering. It had shades of a \u201cCameron direct\u201d event where the former PM used to address activists with his sleeves rolled up, speaking without notes. But Johnson\u2019s stunt really had more in common with the atmosphere of a Donald Trump or Jeremy Corbyn rally \u2013 albeit with a much smaller fan base than either of them. A few hundred activists had turned up to welcome the prime minister, and were offered free XXL T-shirts bearing Tory campaign slogans in garish colours. They then brandished giant placards and chanted \u201cBoris, Boris\u201d as the prime minister came on to rock music. The effect on the television was to present Johnson as surrounded by adoring fans, but when the cameras panned out it was obvious the spectacle was taking place in one small corner of a cavernous exhibition hall. After providing a smiling, cheering backdrop, cabinet ministers traipsed back to London again \u2013 eating Subway sandwiches on the way from the only open eatery at Birmingham International railway station. No 10 advisers have now moved over from Downing Street to Conservative party headquarters (CCHQ), where the team is led by Isaac Levido, the former right-hand man to the Australian election guru Sir Lynton Crosby. Levido, along with Michael Brooks, the party\u2019s pollster, sits at the centre of the room along with the campaign\u2019s digital leaders. However, there is no confirmation about the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s controversial chief of staff who was due to have an operation in November. He told special advisers last week that Levido was \u201cin charge\u201d. The election war room is so crowded that CCHQ is scrambling for extra desks, with a particularly big press team and social media operation \u2013 partly to compensate for the weaknesses of 2017\u2019s digital operation when the Tories found themselves outgunned online by Labour and Momentum. Cabinet ministers are also not being dispatched to many big campaign events this time, according to one adviser, supposedly because it eats into the limited spending budgets of local candidates. This leaves all their press aides stuck in CCHQ, staffing the phones and a rebuttal unit.

Wasn't Bravo the one in goal when Man City beat LFC in the community shield? Plus the way Man City play its not like their opponent will constantly be shooting at goal . Yes they will lose Ederson's ball playing skills but i don't think Bravo is as poor as people are making out. Liverpool coped without Alisson for a while I doubt Ederson's absence is much of a game changer for Man City. The Spurs goalie was their man of the match at Anfield and i don't even know him.</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>I think the fear for City fans is how much Ederson\u2019s distribution will be missed in a match when their backline will be pressed far more intensely than they were by Liverpool at Wembley. Bravo can play out from the back but Ederson\u2019s passing is incredible for a goalkeeper and his accuracy makes it so much easier for City\u2019s defenders when they receive the ball. If Bravo\u2019s passing is slower, or not quite as accurate, it will play into Liverpool\u2019s hands. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T15:36:11.198Z\">at 3.36pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc587e58f08be4a102e57f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T15:22:58.889Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The weekend is fast approaching and so are our match previews.</strong> The latest to land hot off the press are Newcastle v Bournemouth and Chelsea v Crystal Palace: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/08/newcastle-bournemouth-match-preview-premier-league\">Newcastle United v Bournemouth: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/08/chelsea-crystal-palace-match-preview-premier-league\">Chelsea v Crystal Palace: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T15:27:26.575Z\">at 3.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc587288f0867dcebfd139c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T15:19:01.224Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u201cI love that Klopp is exhorting even the Anfield hotdog vendors to give it their all this Sunday,\u201d</strong> writes Peter Oh. \u201cFantastic (condi)mentality!

That\u2019s completely different. [The coach incident] was a senseless thing. If somebody at Man City is concerned still, then it\u2019s our fault. Not that we did it all together, we all didn\u2019t thrown the bottle or whatever it was, but it was one of us. That\u2019s why we are responsible. All of us have to make sure that something like this will never happen again.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s long ago and since then nothing has happened. I don\u2019t think it was Man City specific.

Actually, we used to enjoy that [the coach welcome], when we come in, it\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s a nice part of football, but if you overstep the line then it\u2019s not allowed that you do it anymore. That\u2019s how it is.</p> \n   <p>I wish I could say it will never happen again but unfortunately I can\u2019t. But what I can say is we will do everything that it will never happen again. Everybody agrees to feel this responsibility that it won\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s why I say \u2013 go in the stadium, nothing to do outside, have your food, go in, wait for the team, we will come, let\u2019s make a pretty special game of it.

Neil Lennon is still basking in the warm, fuzzy feeling of Celtic\u2019s dramatic late win over Lazio in the Europa League, describing the 2-1 victory as \u201cjust behind beating Barcelona\u201d. The Hoops face third-placed Motherwell on Sunday. The only time they have lost in the league this season, at Livingston, came after a Europa League match. With Rangers level on points at the top, they can\u2019t afford another hangover. Nor can Rangers, who will be wary of Celtic\u2019s defeat at Livingston when they pay a visit to the Almondvale Stadium on Sunday. Look how close it is at the top: It says much about Everton\u2019s dire start to the season that Southampton manager Ralph Hassenhutl described them as one of the \u201cbottom teams\u201d when he spoke about the importance of the match in his press conference earlier. Every game is very important because we are under the line and this is not a coincidence because we didn\u2019t take enough points. We have played against the first eight clubs so far and now come the fixtures against the bottom teams and we live on our results. This is a big opportunity for us to win, because we have to win. Everybody knows this and the players are very focused. We had a very intense game in the last Premier League game against Manchester City. We were close to taking something there and the performance was much better. The table doesn\u2019t lie. Southampton can go level on points with Everton if they beat them at St Mary\u2019s. The Fiver is live and it\u2019s not even five o\u2019clock!

He then scored twice in midweek against Red Star Belgrade: He was affected like everyone during the [Everton] game and after the game. He was involved, there was a bit of confusion in the action, with the decision to show the red card. He felt responsible, then when we concede with 10 men. But he wasn\u2019t guilty for the injury, and he showed that he is in a good state and mental level. Of course he is sorry about Andre, like everyone, but it was a big relief with the message from Andre on social media, which was good and positive, and Son is now training and recovering well. And here\u2019s our match preview for tomorrow\u2019s game against Sheffield United: Ever since we published our Miracle of Burnley piece a few weeks ago, Sean Dyche\u2019s team have shipped nine goals and lost three games on the spin. They won\u2019t get a better chance to turn things around against a West Ham team who haven\u2019t won a match since 22 September. Here\u2019s what Sean Dyche had to say about West Ham\u2019s visit: We need to turn it around because the first half [in the 3-0 defeat at Sheffield United] is unacceptable. Second half we get a tiny bit of credit in that we kept going and tried to do the right things, certainly more so than in the first half. There is a lot of honesty in the group and I don\u2019t think they will need too much to affect their own response without my words. I think there will be an adjustment this week in the mentality for the next game, that is certainly what I will be looking for. There was good news for Dyche and Burnley on the eve of the game against the Hammers as Chris Wood joined strike partner Ashley Barnes in agreeing a new contract. Barnes committed his future on Thursday and on Friday, Wood signed up to the end of 2023. \u201cIt feels exactly like home and it\u2019s a nice settled place for me,\u201d Wood told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cI am very happy to have it signed and looking forward to the future.\u201d Anyway, here\u2019s a picture of Sean Dyche\u2019s head carved out of wood in a Burnley pub\u2019s beer garden. Here\u2019s a video wrap of both J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s and Pep Guardiola\u2019s press conferences before the ding-dong clash at Anfield on Sunday. The Football Supporters\u2019 Federation are inviting fans to cast their votes in 11 categories ahead of their annual awards ceremony on 16 December. The 11 categories are as follows: Men\u2019s Player of the Year Women\u2019s Player of the Year Commentator of the Year Fan Media of the Year Newspaper of the Year (*Cough \u2026 Guardian! \u2026 *Cough) Online Media of the Year (*Cough \u2026 David Squires! \u2026*Cough) Football Podcast of the Year (*Cough \u2026 Football Weekly! \u2026 *Cough) Pundit of the Year Radio Show of the Year Writer of the Year (*Cough \u2026 David Conn or Suzanne Wrack! \u2026 *Cough) The Safe Hands Award You can cast your votes by following this link. Here\u2019s a little more from Guardiola earlier on his rivalry with Klopp which, let\u2019s face it, is hardly Clough v Revie, or Fergie v Wenger. He says as much too: I don\u2019t think we can compare anyone with the rivalry of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, because they are absolute legends at their own clubs and for more than one decade, two decades there. I will wait to see if my hair grows in the next 20 years, because they were more than 20 years together. A view on whether City losing Ederson is a game-changer for them: I think the fear for City fans is how much Ederson\u2019s distribution will be missed in a match when their backline will be pressed far more intensely than they were by Liverpool at Wembley. Bravo can play out from the back but Ederson\u2019s passing is incredible for a goalkeeper and his accuracy makes it so much easier for City\u2019s defenders when they receive the ball. If Bravo\u2019s passing is slower, or not quite as accurate, it will play into Liverpool\u2019s hands. The weekend is fast approaching and so are our match previews. The latest to land hot off the press are Newcastle v Bournemouth and Chelsea v Crystal Palace: \u201cI love that Klopp is exhorting even the Anfield hotdog vendors to give it their all this Sunday,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cFantastic (condi)mentality! I relish seeing the Opta stat of how many frankfurters are sold. Tasty.\u201d Having sampled an Anfield hot dog, I too would like the hot dog vendors to raise their game, Peter. Unai Emery has confirmed that Granit Xhaka is still not in the right frame of mind to play for Arsenal. The midfielder, who has not played since reacting to jeers from Arsenal fans as he left the field against Wolves, has been linked with a love to Newcastle and even with Dani Ceballos out injured, Arsenal cannot call on him to join the matchday squad for a huge test at Leicester. I spoke with him. I spoke with him on Tuesday about how he\u2019s feeling now and how he is in his mind. He\u2019s working well, he\u2019s training well, but he said to me that he\u2019s not feeling good enough at the moment to play. We are going to wait. Mesut \u00d6zil, however, might be brought in to face Leicester: He\u2019s training well and I think he\u2019s now being consistent in the training, he\u2019s also helping and he\u2019s also positive. I am thinking about him for tomorrow, for the possibility to play. Now [Leicester] have a six-point difference with us and tomorrow is a very big challenge, a very good opportunity also for them and for us. I am looking forward to seeing how we can respond tomorrow. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r believes Mason Greenwood, who scored in the 3-0 win over Partizan Belgrade last night, is going to be a top, top player: Mason is going to have a very good career, he\u2019s a natural finisher and he\u2019s just as composed in front of a crowd of 60,000 as he is kicking a ball about with his mates, but if it takes a couple of years for him to become established we are fine with that. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t expect him to start against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday, though. There\u2019s a tasty West Midlands derby between Wolves and Aston Villa at Molineux on Sunday. It\u2019s a difficult one to call. Wolves are coming into it on the back of a energy-sapping Europa League win, while Villa will want to put behind them the disappointment of losing very late in the day against Liverpool last weekend. Dean Smith may be without Jack Grealish again, though: He\u2019s 50/50 at the moment. I expected him to be training now but the bleed on his calf is bigger. He\u2019s certainly physically OK, he\u2019s been doing an awful lot of work in the swimming pool, we just need to make sure he can get through a training session tomorrow. The masseurs have been working on it. We\u2019re hopeful of him training tomorrow. Let\u2019s hear it for Cosmin Moti! If you have nothing planned next Thursday why not come and heckle the Guardian\u2019s head of sport and a collection of writers as they delve behind the headlines after a stellar year of sport. Tickets are available here: Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking about the challenge they face when the buoyant Blades visit north London tomorrow. He\u2019s impressed by the job Chris Wilder is doing: It is fantastic. I think everyone has seen how he has been working. It is going to be very difficult. They work so hard, what impressed me the most is their belief and togetherness. They have the spirit like a rugby team that fight for each other. That is fantastic to see in a football team. That is why they have done so well, they have a good squad, good organisation, a great manager and coaching staff. They fight for each other, they have good players, that is the key of Sheffield United, they are doing so well, they have lots of points and are in a good position in the table. He says there is a question mark hanging over Giovani Lo Celso\u2019s fitness but says the Premier League gives you no time to think when injuries strike: The problem in the competition in the high level, you don\u2019t have time to miss people. It is like now with [Erik] Lamela, or [Jan] Vertonghen, how you sit in the chair and cry because you miss someone. You miss the person, the professional, but the competition does not allow you to cry. You have to move on quick. It is a bit cruel, but you have to move on and try to win the next game. If you ask me like an MP, not as a coach, you miss the person when they are not involved, or close to you. Everyone provides different energy, but you cannot be affected. It is so important. Everton play the first of two games against teams below them when they face Southampton on Saturday and a win is essential for under-pressure manager Marco Silva. The Saints can take heart from their performance last week against Manchester City, though. Here\u2019s our match preview: A few injury updates from manager of the month Frank Lampard before Chelsea\u2019s game against Crystal Palace tomorrow. He said that Ross Barkley is out with an ankle injury and could have to withdraw from the England squad. Meanwhile Antonio Rudiger has had surgery on a groin problem and will be out for three weeks \u2013 the German has only played once this season. More positively N\u2019Golo Kante should start tomorrow and Mason Mount, who injured an ankle in the 4-4 draw with Ajax, is in the squad. Lampard doesn\u2019t have much to choose from this weekend. The intrigue is whether he starts Reece James at right-back and moves Cesar Azpilicueta to the left. My instinct is ... he won\u2019t. But would be a huge test for James against Zaha. Lampard\u2019s doing a very decent job isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s pipped J\u00fcrgen Klopp to the gong for October having led his young pups to three wins in a row over Southampton, Newcastle and Burnley. Lampard is the first manager other than Pep Guardiola or Klopp to win the award since Solskj\u00e6r scooped it way back in January when things were rosy for a few weeks at Manchester United. Other contenders were Leicester\u2019s Brendan Rodgers, Aston Villa manager Dean Smith and Brighton\u2019s Graham Potter. Here are some more extensive quotes from J\u00fcrgen Klopp as filed by our man on Merseyside, Andy Hunter. On Sean Cox, Klopp says he hopes to meet him on Sunday: When it happened to Sean it was probably really the lowest point for me in my whole time at Liverpool because that is something that should not happen, in general, in life and it should not happen around a football game. It happened around a football game. The love for Sean and his family have for this club and football I hope it gave him strength and power in his recovery time \u2013 we know it is not finished yet and there is a long way to go \u2013 but having that we can give him the opportunity to come back to watch a really big game, and he wants to do that, for me, coming from a low point, is one of my highlights since I\u2019ve been here. It is so nice and I am really looking forward to it. I hope we can organise for me to see him before the game for a couple of minutes \u2013 I really want to \u2013 because how the Liverpool community dealt with it I hope he feels that. We don\u2019t normally sing \u2018You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u2019, we really live that, and in this specific situation it was very important to show that. I really hope they felt that the whole time and they will feel it in the future and we can help them in this recovery. And on concerns about the Manchester City coach, Klopp says: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer of fan power \u2013 in the stadium. That\u2019s completely different. [The coach incident] was a senseless thing. If somebody at Man City is concerned still, then it\u2019s our fault. Not that we did it all together, we all didn\u2019t thrown the bottle or whatever it was, but it was one of us. That\u2019s why we are responsible. All of us have to make sure that something like this will never happen again. It\u2019s long ago and since then nothing has happened. I don\u2019t think it was Man City specific. After the punishment we got, we haven\u2019t had a similar situation \u2013 the positive outcome of something like this. Actually, we used to enjoy that [the coach welcome], when we come in, it\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s a nice part of football, but if you overstep the line then it\u2019s not allowed that you do it anymore. That\u2019s how it is. I wish I could say it will never happen again but unfortunately I can\u2019t. But what I can say is we will do everything that it will never happen again. Everybody agrees to feel this responsibility that it won\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s why I say \u2013 go in the stadium, nothing to do outside, have your food, go in, wait for the team, we will come, let\u2019s make a pretty special game of it. In football, you never know what you get for it. But we know what we have to do for it. Let\u2019s make sure that we show that. It\u2019s Der Klassiker this weekend, with Dortmund heading to Bayern for a 5.30pm GMT kick-off. Marcus Christenson sets the scene: Bayern welcome Borussia Dortmund for the season\u2019s first Klassiker and they do so in fourth. True, they are only four points behind the leaders, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, and a single one behind Saturday\u2019s opponents. Short term Bayern are surely able to recover from their rocky start but long term there is a question about where the club is heading. Here\u2019s some more Pep. He wasn\u2019t happy when the Guardian\u2019s Jamie Jackson asked him a question about whether he can really trust Claudio Bravo when he himself chose to replace him with Ederson after his first season at the club: Why should I doubt any player in my team? Why do you ask these questions? You have to respect this guy, he has won trophies and the Copa Am\u00e9rica. In his first season the team was not at the top level. All the players in our squad are [there] because we have incredible confidence in them. And on the challenge posed by Liverpool: For me as a manager, last season when we won the league, [Liverpool were] the best contender I ever faced in my career. Right now they are one of the strongest teams in the world. We are going to try to [carefully] follow the plan in this game. When Klopp took over the team they were not a contender but in three or four years he built something marvellous. And is the title-race over if Liverpool win and go nine points clear? I don\u2019t know. In November it is never the end. The experience in the squad is to fight until the end \u2026 on Sunday and in the rest of the games. Liverpool lost only one game last season and none this season \u2026 but a lot of situations can happen. Pep Guardiola says Ederson is not fit to face Liverpool on Sunday: He\u2019s not able to play. I don\u2019t know [when he\u2019ll be back]. We have another top keeper. Claudio Bravo can do it [play out from the back] too. We won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup thanks to Claudio. I missed this earlier but it appears that Steve Bruce has already hit one of his targets at Newcastle this season: I think some of us look at October and November and think \u2018we\u2019ve got past that hurdle of getting the sack!\u2019 I Shouldn\u2019t say that \u2026\u201d It\u2019s not exactly breaking news, but Manchester United probably aren\u2019t going to win the league. Here\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r explaining why: The Premier League trophy is out of our reach, we\u2019re too far behind the top teams. Any trophy you can get your hands on, we\u2019re going to go for. But we need to improve our league form, definitely. Ewan Murray has been tapping away furiously to give Stoke fans an optimistic taster of what they can expect under their new manager Michael O\u2019Neill: Stoke\u2019s attraction to O\u2019Neill is obvious. He maximises resources by creating an environment players relish. The Northern Ireland squad remained firmly behind their manager even when early results were bad. Call-offs remained at a premium, as did retirements \u2026 attention to detail for squad gatherings became wonderfully intense, whereby every aspect of opposition was bestowed on players and in various forms. O\u2019Neill didn\u2019t care about outsiders learning his selection \u2013 in order to give maximum preparation time, he would lay out plans at the earliest opportunity. Unless City suffer another calamity on Sunday we probably won\u2019t be seeing Kyle Walker in goal, which is a shame, because few things in football are as much fun as seeing an outfield player thrust between the sticks. One of our picture editors, Steve Bloor, has put together a collection of some of the best examples of this over the years here: And a question for you: which player would you most like to see suffering an existential meltdown in goal? For me, it would have to be Cristiano Ronaldo. Klopp was very keen that everyone at Liverpool plays their part in helping his side to victory over Manchester City on Sunday. And he means EVERYBODY! If you want to climb you have to take top spot where City is. For us, it is obvious the improvements the boys have made [against them]. We have to play our best game, everyone. The guys who sell the hotdogs have to! That\u2019s what I wish for. He also spoke about the emotional impact Sean Cox\u2019s injury had on him. Cox will be at Anfield on Sunday for the first time since being attacked by Roma fans outside the ground in 2018 and suffering life-altering injuries. When it happened, it was the lowest point for me here at Liverpool. Because it should not happen in life or football games. The love Sean and his family have for this club, I hope it has given him strength and power in recovery. How the Liverpool community dealt with this, I hope he feels that. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone \u2013 they sing it and live it. I hope he felt that the whole time. We can help him. The Klopp-Guardiola rivalry is certainly no Fergie-Wenger, is it? J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been lavishing praise on Manchester City\u2019s manager before Sunday\u2019s match. I couldn\u2019t respect him more. For me he is the best manager in the world. Wherever he goes he has a proper impact on the team. Now he\u2019s at Man City and it\u2019s not too bad. I don\u2019t have a negative relationship with anyone on the sidelines. It might look like that but it is respectful. Very respectful. Klopp also spoke about the concerns City have about the greeting their team bus might receive. If someone at Man City is concerned still, it is our fault. We didn\u2019t throw the bottle but it was one of us. We all need to make sure if doesn\u2019t happen again. It was a long time ago, nothing happened since. If we overstep the line, we cannot do it [the bus greeting] anymore.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Barcelona Lyon v Bayern Munich Glasgow City v Wolfsburg Arsenal v PSG Quarter-final ties to be played on 24-25 March and 1-2 April 2020. Semi-final ties to be played on 25-26 April and 2-3 May 2020. In the draw for the semi-finals, the winner of Glasgow City v Wolfsburg will play the winner of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Barcelona, which means Arsenal or PSG will face Lyon or Bayern Munich. The English champions play the 2016-17 runners-up. Glasgow City face the two-times winners. The reigning champions will play the Germans, who have never won the tournament. The first quarter-final in the Women\u2019s Champions League is an all-Spanish affair. It\u2019s hardly the biggest secret, but Stoke and the Irish FA have confirmed that Michael O\u2019Neill has agreed to take the reins at embattled Stoke, who are bottom of the Championship table. He has signed a three-and-a-half year contract but will stay on for at least a couple more matches and juggle responsibilities. The club said in a statement: O\u2019Neill, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the Club, will take charge of City at Barnsley tomorrow after he oversaw his first training session this morning. Michael is now fully focussed on preparing the team for the trip to Barnsley and will speak to the media for the first time as manager of Stoke City after the game in South Yorkshire. The Irish FA added: He will remain in charge of the Northern Ireland senior men\u2019s team for the remaining two matches in UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifying Group C and any Euro 2020 play-off matches in March 2020. Women\u2019s Champions League draw! Right, this is due to get under way any second, so hold tight folks. Remember, nobody wants to draw Lyon. They have won it four times in a row and guarantee almost certain death. Glasgow City are the minnows in the pot. They\u2019re the only team without a men\u2019s \u201cparent team\u201d and play at a sports centre. Suzanne Wrack wrote a fascinating piece about them this week: It\u2019s not long until the Women\u2019s Champions League draw for the quarter-finals and semi-finals. Here\u2019s the draw procedure, courtesy of Uefa: The quarter-final draw is without restriction. In each case, the club drawn first will play the opening leg at home For the semi-final draw, four balls are prepared: Winner of Quarter-final 1, Winner of Quarter-final 2, and so on. The draw is without restriction, following the same principles as the quarter-final draw England\u2019s Demi Stokes has been talking about the cross-sport solidarity between female athletes that has helped inspire each other. When you see Jessica Ennis, Dina Asher-Smith or Nicola Adams you think: \u2018God, if they can do it then I can.\u2019 You want to see everyone win. You can read the full article here: Here\u2019s a Liverpool fan\u2019s view on Sunday\u2019s game from below the line: I agree, it would feel very different if City were ahead by six or nine points. Liverpool\u2019s busy schedule and experience of letting a lead slip last season makes the title-race feel much closer than it would if Pep Guardiola\u2019s side were top. What a strange career Armand Traore has had: Arsenal, Portsmouth, Juventus, QPR, Nottingham Forest, Cardiff, \u00c7aykur Rizespor, and now he\u2019s back at Cardiff again. The 30-year-old made four appearances for Cardiff during a loan spell in the 2017-18 season. Here\u2019s Neil Warnock confirming the news: Armand has signed as cover. He\u2019s been with us six weeks and he\u2019s just about got up to fitness. It\u2019s a short contract in case anything happens. Fans know him. He\u2019s got a very good left foot and loads of ability. He has trained really hard in the time he has been with us. It\u2019s an appearance-based contract as well, so it\u2019s up to him. Two claret and blue sides on the slide meet at Turf Moor on Saturday. Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s match preview: Merseyside Police have released a statement making it clear that they are aware of the social media post calling on Liverpool fans to line the streets of Anfield with their \u201cpyro and pints\u201d before the match. They seem to be confident the match will go ahead without any bus-bothering trouble, as it did last year. Merseyside Police is working with Liverpool FC and Manchester City ahead of their Premier League match at Anfield on Sunday, 10 November 2019 to ensure fans of both clubs have a safe and enjoyable afternoon. Superintendent Paul White said: \u201cAs with any match, a comprehensive and appropriate policing operation has been put in place ahead of Sunday\u2019s game and we have liaised with both clubs and their supporter groups. \u201cWe are aware of one poster on social media regarding a bus welcome. The corresponding last fixture ran smoothly and we are working to ensure this game can be enjoyed safely by all as well as minimising any disruption to local residents and roads. \u201cAs with all Premier League fixtures at Anfield, we will have officers on duty at the ground, both uniformed and plain clothed, supported by mobile CCTV, provided by Liverpool City Council, and specialist resources including the Dog Section, mounted police and the National Police Air Service. We will also have a city centre policing plan in place throughout the day. This is standard procedure. \u201cWe know that this will be a busy operation and we hope that fans attending the match will act as ambassadors for their clubs. As usual we would ask fans with tickets to arrive at the ground as early as possible. Fans without tickets should not attend at all; they will not be allowed entry into the stadium.\u201d The Women\u2019s Champions League quarter-finals and semi-finals draw takes place in 45 minutes\u2019 time. Here\u2019s the rundown of the teams who will be in the pot in Nyon but in short, everybody will want to avoid Lyon, whose striker Ada Hegerberg became the all-time top scorer on 53 goals last week. Arsenal Previous best: winners (2006-07) Quarter-final record: W6 L6 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Previous best: first quarter-finals Barcelona Previous best: final (2018-19) Quarter-final record: W2 L3 Bayern Munich Previous best: semi-finals (2018-19) Quarter-final record: W1 L1 Glasgow City Previous best: quarter-final (2014-15) Quarter-final record: W0 L1 Lyon Previous best: winners (2010-11, 2011-12, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19) Quarter-final record: W10 L0 Paris Saint-Germain Previous best: runners-up (2014-15) Quarter-final record: W3 L1 Wolfsburg Previous best: winners (2012-13, 2013-14) Quarter-final record: W5 L2 The dates Quarter-finals: 24-25 March and 1-2 April 2020 Semi-finals: 25-26 April and 2/3 May 2020 Final (Viola Park, Vienna): 24 May 2020 Our man in Madrid, Sid Lowe, speaking the truth here. If Joel Matip is not fit for Liverpool this weekend, who will J\u00fcrgen Klopp pick in his place? Joe Gomez or Dejan Lovren? He\u2019s tended to favour Lovren in recent weeks and I expect he will do so again on Sunday, perhaps because of his experience. When Gomez and Alexander-Arnold have played on the right this season, that side has looked more exposed. Whoever he chooses, City will likely get more chances than they would against the hugely impressive Van Dijk-Matip partnership. It\u2019s Der Klassiker tomorrow, with Bayern Munich hosting Dortmund at 5.30pm GMT. Jadon Sancho and Marco Reus are likely to miss out through injury but Bayern\u2019s caretaker manager, Hansi Flick, still expects a huge challenge from the second-placed visitors, who are one point ahead of Bayern. Flick wants to tighten his side up at the back. We will undertake one or two changes. The way we have been conceding goals is not very Bayern-like. It is important for the team to be active. We have to defend from the front and try to get the ball back as quickly as possible. Those are the points we want to address. On reflection, letting Mats Hummels return to Dortmund probably wasn\u2019t the best move was it? Both sides enjoyed midweek Champions League wins, with Dortmund\u2019s 3-2 comeback victory against Inter the most impressive. Forget first versus second, what about last versus second-bottom? It\u2019s happening tonight when Norwich host Watford, who are still without a win in the league this season \u2026 but there is still hope for Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s side. Here\u2019s Martin Laurence to explain why: Sheffield United, in sixth (sixth!) visit 11th-placed Spurs tomorrow looking to extend their four-match unbeaten run in the league. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect from Tottenham. They were bereft of confidence and disjointed at Everton but in midweek against Red Star they were full of beans and the football was flowing again as they won 4-0 in a bear-pit atmosphere. Chris Wilder reckons Spurs will soon bring that kind of form into their league campaign: Sometimes things happen and people don\u2019t start in the fashion they\u2019d have wanted to, but scratch beneath the surface and what you\u2019ve got is one of the world\u2019s top managers coaching an unbelievable group of players. I\u2019ve always had a lot of admiration for what Tottenham have done and the work they do on the training ground. Whatever system they play they have an identity but they mix it up - three centre-halves, diamond, all kinds of different systems. Whatever they do they have world class individuals and one result will get them up and running. They can\u2019t fail with the amount of quality they\u2019ve got. But it\u2019s also another great afternoon for us to pit our wits against top-class individuals. We\u2019ll be fearless in our approach. There\u2019s a sell-out crowd expected for England v Germany at Wembley tomorrow, which will be a record attendance for a women\u2019s game in England \u2013 and it\u2019s only a friendly! The sheen has worn off Phil Neville\u2019s side since the run to the World Cup semi-finals, though, and Louise Taylor has looked into some of the reasons why here: England will come up against an extraordinary talent in Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n. The Lyon playmaker will be pulling the strings for Germany but she is just grateful to be playing at all having just recovered from a life-threatening pulmonary embolism: There\u2019s an intriguing match at St James\u2019 Park on Saturday, where Newcastle host Bournemouth. It\u2019s like the clubs have traded places in terms of style. Bournemouth are the stingy counterattacking side these days (like Rafa\u2019s Newcastle last season), having kept three clean sheets on the bounce. They have scored only once in those games, mind. Newcastle tore West Ham apart with some freewheeling football last weekend while having a wobble at the back in the manner of the Cherries in seasons past. Newcastle will be without their former Bournemouth player, Matt Ritchie, who has had a setback while returning from an ankle injury. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe wants more of the same from his side after the 1-0 defeat of Manchester United last weekend: Last week was great. We were really pleased with the performance, but the most important thing now is to hit that mark each week. Newcastle have some exceptional individuals. What we know is that we need to produce that Manchester United performance and if we do that, we can do well. We need to show the same mentality we have in recent weeks. I have been really pleased with that side of our game, we have had a steeliness which has made a big difference and we want that to become part of our DNA. Mo Salah is playing down talk of Liverpool being nailed on for the title if they win on Sunday. He\u2019s been speaking to Sky about the title race: They were talking about that in December last year. Six points, seven points, it\u2019s not much. It\u2019s just three games. It\u2019s too early to talk about the Premier League [title]. Perhaps he has a point given how stacked Liverpool\u2019s fixture schedule is in December. If this match was in January perhaps a nine-point lead would look insurmountable. Can Liverpool v Manchester City be accepted as England\u2019s biggest game? asks Paul Wilson. Well, can it? Arsenal have suffered an injury blow before their visit to Leicester on Saturday evening. Dani Ceballos has been ruled out with a hamstring injury, and with the mightily miffed Granit Xhaka\u2019s future at the club uncertain, it leaves Unai Emery\u2019s options in central midfield a little light. If Arsenal want to finish in the top four, they really have to win this game. If they don\u2019t, a gap could open up between the top four and the rest. It\u2019s hard to see the Gunners improving enough to topple Leicester away, though. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side have been brilliant this season, both tactically and in terms of motivation and a win for the Foxes would surely heap more pressure on Emery. There is some concern at Manchester City about the welcome their team bus might receive from Liverpool fans before Sunday\u2019s match. A social media post doing the rounds is urging Liverpool supporters to line the streets around Anfield before Sunday\u2019s game in the way they did before the Champions League quarter-final first leg in 2018, in which the City bus was damaged by bottles and other bits and pieces that were thrown its way. The post doesn\u2019t encourage that sort of behaviour, though, and does not mention the City coach at all, but the club has sought assurances from Liverpool that the coach will be given safe passage to the ground. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s story: Some managerial news from the Championship now, where it is being reported by Sky that the Northern Ireland manager Michael O\u2019Neill is taking a training session at Stoke ahead of being announced as their new boss. It\u2019s understandable why they would want him to get his hands dirty so quickly. They\u2019re bottom of the table, on eight points, and face second-bottom Barnsley \u2013 who are a point ahead of them \u2013 tomorrow. He\u2019s been brilliant for Northern Ireland, but is he the right choice for Stoke? He hasn\u2019t managed a club side for eight years \u2013 and he\u2019s only managed two in his career: Shamrock Rovers and Brechin City. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock this week, you may have heard there\u2019s a match taking place at Anfield on Sunday. It\u2019s the biggest Premier League match of the season to date by a stretch. Liverpool are six clear and could extend their lead to nine points, or they could be pegged back to three if City record their first league win at Anfield since 3 May 2003, when the Reds were undone by two goals from one of their former players, Nicolas Anelka, who was partnered in attack by the one and only Robbie Fowler. And who was the manager? Mr Kevin Keegan. Will Ederson be fit for Sunday, though? We may find out at 1.30pm, when I\u2019ll bring you news from Pep Guardiola\u2019s press conference. Maybe Kyle Walker is his No 1 now. He does like a ball-playing keeper doesn\u2019t he? J\u00fcrgen Klopp will face the press at 12.30 GMT, which is when the Women\u2019s Champions League draw will be taking place. I\u2019ll bring you news of the quarter-final lineup and the eight teams will find out who they may face in the semi finals, too. The eight teams in the pot for the Women\u2019s Champions League draw are as follows: Arsenal, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Glasgow City, Lyon, PSG, Wolfsburg. And here are the Premier League fixtures this weekend: Friday Norwich v Watford (8pm) Is it too early to call tonight\u2019s match a relegation six-pointer? Saturday Chelsea v Crystal Palace (12.30pm) Burnley v West Ham (3pm) Newcastle v Bournemouth (3pm) Southampton v Everton (3pm) Spurs v Sheffield United (3pm) Leicester v Arsenal (5.30pm) Sunday Manchester United v Brighton (2pm) Wolves v Aston Villa (2pm) Liverpool v Manchester City (4.30pm) If you\u2019re wondering what to look out for in the matches above, this should help: I\u2019ll bring you any news from Germany on Der Klassiker, too. Managerless Bayern, in fourth, host second-placed Dortmund at 5.30pm GMT on Saturday. It\u2019s a big one.",

Or, to be specific, about the N47 180bhp four-cylinder common rail diesel engine.</p> <p>This was the standard engine fitted in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bmw+3+series+touring+car+2010&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr6erD7drlAhWIgM4BHdE-Bn0Q2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=bmw+3+series+touring+car+2010&amp;gs_l=img.3...17702.19652..20027...0.0..1.221.675.11j0j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i7i30.P5dn5UG_y6A&amp;ei=vn_FXeuSJ4iBur4P0f2Y6Ac\" title=\"\">BMW 3-series touring cars</a> in the years 2010-2014. Most notably in the 320d model, arguably the greatest mass-market small estate car ever produced and one of those deeply boring things that carries its own strange, irresistible fascination.</p> <p>It seems likely anyone buying a reliable second-hand estate car has already been forced to make compromises. Domesticity has narrowed the bars of the cage. And so here you are in a car you\u2019d rather not have, driving through some fish-grey cityscape and spewing what was once green-option diesel fuel but which now turns out to be corrosive diesel death smoke. Easing out of a junction you nudge the throttle vaguely. And into this drab scene a note of startling purity intrudes. The diesel surge comes in a rush, then dies, then rushes again, like chemicals across the synapses.</p> <p>This is not a jazzed-up toy car. It\u2019s a travelling salesman\u2019s motorway box. But it has in that right-hand pedal an extraordinary sweetness, a natureless thrill, a suggestion of human progress, human ultimacy. Cars have become a burden, a problem to be solved, an object of hatred for some. But somehow this toxic lugger carries a whisper of their lost beauty. It\u2019s in there just out of sight, a legacy of the golden years of the American century when the car was an instrument of personal freedom, of crossing boundaries, of hammering towards the horizon at exhilarating speed.</p> <p>Andy Warhol said the greatest thing about America is its democratising of luxury.

The point being, you really can feel nostalgic for a high-end, grey plastic estate car, something that burns with sweetness and power but which is now toxic, <em>verboten</em>, out of time. Farewell then N47 four-cylinder common rail diesel engine: giver of life, which turned out also to be a giver of death.</p> <p>All of which leads quite naturally on to Mourinho and Arsenal, and a link that has already been rubbished by Arsenal\u2019s executive but which has still inspired some strange responses.

Although oddly it is often the things that weren\u2019t that good for you in the first place you end up missing most. Take, for example, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who has this week been linked with a return to the Premier League at Arsenal, albeit most likely by some covert arm of the Mourinho-Industrial complex. Or, even better, how about cars, which have always seemed like a wildly over-promoted object of affection. Start again from scratch and it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d come up with the idea of the car, of each person having their own highly complex, carbon-fed internal combustion engine just to get down to Asda a bit quicker.

Soylu said Turkey was holding almost 1,200 foreign members of Isis in custody and had captured a further 287, including women and children, during its recent invasion of Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria. Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old British woman important to the group\u2019s online recruitment efforts, is currently believed to be in Turkish custody in Syria after escaping a Kurdish-run detention camp in the chaos caused by the fighting. The minister\u2019s remarks follow reports last month that two Dutch women suspected of Isis membership who fled a Syrian detention camp visited their country\u2019s embassy in Ankara with their children, requesting to be sent home. They were arrested by Turkish authorities and the Netherlands swiftly said one of the women \u2013 a dual Dutch-Morrocan citizen \u2013 had been stripped of Dutch nationality. Since 2010 the UK has stripped more than 100 people of British citizenship over their alleged links to Isis, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and other terrorist groups.

Mary O\u2019Rourke, the QC acting for Freeman, said the affidavit was held in the managing editor of the newspaper\u2019s safe as \u201can insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford\u201d and that it contained \u201ca number of lies\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A British Indian author and journalist has been stripped of his Indian overseas citizenship after he wrote an article criticising the regime of the country\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi.</p> \n<p>Aatish Taseer, who was born in the UK but raised in India and spent a further decade living there from the age of 25, was stripped of his overseas citizenship of India (OCI) status on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Taseer, who has written multiple books on India, described the government\u2019s move as \u201chighly suspicious and systematic\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are making an example of me and sending a warning message to other journalists.\u201d</p> \n<p>The decision followed the publication of his cover piece for Time magazine in May, just before the Indian elections, titled India\u2019s divider in chief, which was highly critical of Modi\u2019s actions while in power.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithin India, the Modi government has completely altered the media climate, everyone critical has been muffled or silenced,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd now my case shows that even those who think they are protected because they write abroad or for a foreign publisher, they are not going to be safe either.\u201d</p> \n<p>The decision to remove his OCI means he is blacklisted from India and may never be able to return.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy work is so immersed in Indian life so there is a real pain as a writer, not being able to ever be in contact with this material again,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd the other kind of pain is very personal. My mother who is 70 lives there. My grandmother who raised me lives there and she is 90 next year. Even if I take this to court, it is unlikely I will ever be able to see her again and for me that is the hardest part of all.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reason given by the home ministry for its action was that Taseer had \u201cconcealed the fact that his late father was of Pakistani origin\u201d and was therefore ineligible for OCI status.</p> \n<p>But Taseer denied this, saying his connection to Pakistan had never been hidden and had simply made him an \u201ceasy target\u201d.

Or so goes the story that has become the core of Narendra Modi\u2019s extraordinary appeal.</p>\n    <p>Modi was born in 1958 to a poor family in western India\u2019s Gujarat state, where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling Congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father\u2019s tea stall.</p>\n    <p>While still a child, he started attending daily meetings of the <a href=\"http://rss.org/\">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a>, said to be the world\u2019s largest volunteer organisation, whose Hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country\u2019s diverse Hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in India.</p>\n    <p>Hindu nationalists were sidelined by India\u2019s founding prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/01/greatspeeches\">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, whose vision of India was of a secular nation at ease with its bewildering plurality. Their parties, including Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s, when they started to expand on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\">national campaign to demolish a 16th-century Mughal mosque</a> and replace it with a Hindu temple.</p>\n    <p>BJP\u2019s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country\u2019s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.</p>\n    <p>Modi\u2019s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country\u2019s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country\u2019s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. Young Indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.</p>\n    <p>Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country\u2019s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\">anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people</a>, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.</p>\n    <p>In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.</p>\n    <p>When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. His mastery of political theatre, and finger on the pulse of Indians, has now secured him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/india-election-results-narendra-modi-bjp-victory\">the strongest mandate of any leader in decades</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\">Michael Safi</a></b>&nbsp;<i>in Delhi</i><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PIBHomeAffairs/status/1192476528346447873?s=20\">tweet</a> on Thursday before declaring his OCI status had been stripped, the home ministry claimed Taseer had not asserted his right to appeal, which he also said was untrue.</p> \n<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Taseer\u2019s fate showed that Modi\u2019s governing party was intolerant of criticism and freedom of the press.

      "bodyText": "A British Indian author and journalist has been stripped of his Indian overseas citizenship after he wrote an article criticising the regime of the country\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Aatish Taseer, who was born in the UK but raised in India and spent a further decade living there from the age of 25, was stripped of his overseas citizenship of India (OCI) status on Thursday. Taseer, who has written multiple books on India, described the government\u2019s move as \u201chighly suspicious and systematic\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are making an example of me and sending a warning message to other journalists.\u201d The decision followed the publication of his cover piece for Time magazine in May, just before the Indian elections, titled India\u2019s divider in chief, which was highly critical of Modi\u2019s actions while in power. \u201cWithin India, the Modi government has completely altered the media climate, everyone critical has been muffled or silenced,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd now my case shows that even those who think they are protected because they write abroad or for a foreign publisher, they are not going to be safe either.\u201d The decision to remove his OCI means he is blacklisted from India and may never be able to return. \u201cMy work is so immersed in Indian life so there is a real pain as a writer, not being able to ever be in contact with this material again,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cAnd the other kind of pain is very personal. My mother who is 70 lives there. My grandmother who raised me lives there and she is 90 next year. Even if I take this to court, it is unlikely I will ever be able to see her again and for me that is the hardest part of all.\u201d The reason given by the home ministry for its action was that Taseer had \u201cconcealed the fact that his late father was of Pakistani origin\u201d and was therefore ineligible for OCI status. But Taseer denied this, saying his connection to Pakistan had never been hidden and had simply made him an \u201ceasy target\u201d. He was not given official written notice that he had been stripped of his OCI status and instead found out via a public tweet from the ministry on Thursday. Taseer\u2019s father is Salman Taseer, a Pakistani born in pre-partition British India who later held the position of governor of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province until his assassination in 2011 for opposing the country\u2019s blasphemy laws. Growing up, Taseer had no connection to his father at all and his mother, a prominent journalist, was his sole legal guardian. Nonetheless, Taseer\u2019s father had been clearly named on all his official documentation registering his status as an Indian citizen, first in 2000 when he received his person of Indian origin status, and again in 2016 when it was transferred to OCI status \u201cwithout any issue\u201d. \u201cI never had any problems with my citizenship until after the Time piece was written,\u201d said Taseer. \u201cThere have been a number of times where my father\u2019s Pakistani nationality has been as clear as day. I wrote a book on discovering him aged 21. He was assassinated in 2011 and it was a major story across the world. Everyone knew he was my father, that there was this connection, and not once did anyone in the government raise a question about my OCI status. But within 90 days of that Time story, suddenly it gets raised.\u201d In September Taseer received a letter saying the government was taking action against him for allegedly defrauding the home ministry and his OCI status was under review. It followed an alleged smear campaign against him in India led by Sambit Patra, the spokesperson for Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party, and which was then picked up by Modi himself after the publication of the Time magazine article, where Taseer was repeatedly described as having an anti-India agenda due to his \u201cPakistani political family\u201d background. In a tweet on Thursday before declaring his OCI status had been stripped, the home ministry claimed Taseer had not asserted his right to appeal, which he also said was untrue. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Taseer\u2019s fate showed that Modi\u2019s governing party was intolerant of criticism and freedom of the press. Under Modi, in power since 2014, India has fallen to 140th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Pen America, which defends freedom of expression, said: \u201cHarassing critical writers and journalists not just in India but globally is a disturbing new low for Modi\u2019s government that\u2019s already put Indian democracy on its heels.\u201d Taseer said he was fearful he was only the first to be targeted by the regime, and that OCI status would now be used as a sword of damocles to target Indian journalists writing internationally. \u201cThere are a lot of journalists who, like me, rely on this as a foundational document to connect them to their country, to own land, to visit family, to live in India as long as you like,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, anyone in a similar situation to me knows they are on notice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before Paradise became synonymous with fire, it was the trees that lured people here. Hundreds of thousands dotted the town: ponderosa pines, Douglas firs and cedars. Life in the town of 27,000, nestled in the Sierra Nevada foothills, was affordable, with modern suburban conveniences and an abundance of natural beauty. That life was largely destroyed when the Camp fire tore through Paradise so quickly that thousands were trapped on gridlocked roads trying to escape. The fire killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including 14,000 homes. Top: Firefighters push down a wall while battling against a burning apartment complex in Paradise, California, on 9 November 2018. Photograph by Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Bottom: Paradise, California, on 6 November 2019. One year on, the town and its remaining residents are trying to rebuild. An estimated 3,000 have returned to Paradise, and several hundred more have applied for permits to rebuild. On a recent afternoon in Paradise, as the first anniversary of the disaster loomed, Mary Nieland stood in front of the 1940s farmhouse where she has lived since 2005. Her home was one of just three on her block that did not burn in the Camp fire. It took firefighters more than two weeks to contain the 153,000-acre blaze, California\u2019s deadliest and most destructive fire. Left: Mary Nieland\u2019s home is one of the three on her block that did not burn in the Camp fire. Right: Mike Zuccolillo, a real estate broker and town councilman. Nieland stayed behind until close to noon the day the fire started to protect her home, and she barely escaped with her life. Recalling that day, she described how fire seemed to rain down from the clouds, and how at one point, as she and others were trapped in their cars, first responders told them to abandon their vehicles and run. Nieland fled from her blue Ford Ranger with her four-year-old chocolate lab, Bear. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think we were going to make it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThere were cars burning on both sides of the road, burning telephone poles across the road, homes off the bike path in flames.\u201d She walked for an hour before someone picked her up. After escaping, her dog became sick and eventually died. Nieland developed an infection and needed breathing treatments after smoke badly irritated her lungs. Top: Police officer David Akin searches the trailer site of the Skinners\u2019 neighbor to look for a missing generator, gas cans, chain and propane tanks. Bottom: Sgt Robert Nichols (center) holding Zoele Mickey. Anastasia Skinner (left) was in labor during the Camp Fire, and Nichols was one of several people who helped get her to safety. This was Nichols\u2019 first time meeting Zoele. Nieland, who was born in 1950 and raised in Paradise, returned to the town as soon as it reopened. She has owned an antique store, Attic Treasures, for more than 29 years. It also survived the fire. Her garage and barn burned down, but her home sustained only minor damage, including holes from embers in the roof that she discovered when it began to rain. Every native tree on the property died in the fire, but a small orchard of fruit trees survived, and she will be planting nut trees as part of her recovery efforts. \u201cIt may take a long time, but I see us coming back,\u201d she said earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful.\u201d Top left: Lunchtime at Bootleg BBQ. Top right: Aaron Burleson, 25, a laborer from Chico, orders lunch. Bottom: Brandy Wilson waits for lunch orders that she will deliver. Just a few lots down from Attic Treasures, people line up to eat pulled pork sandwiches, smoked mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese and Carolina mustard slaw at Bootleg BBQ, one of about a dozen food trucks in town. The business serves about 75 people a day.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contradictory at all.\u201d Perhaps not \u2013 although those fans who were persuaded to buy tickets to see Federer play in a rare visit to Sydney in January might see it differently. Djokovic, meanwhile, remains committed to regaining the No 1 ranking and opens the tournament on Sunday afternoon against Matteo Berrettini, the first Italian to make the finals. \u201cThat serves as a great motivation,\u201d said the five-times winner of this title. \u201cWe all work very hard in the longest season of all sports to qualify for the season\u2019s finale. Historically, I\u2019ve played well in the indoor season.\u201d Berrettini, eighth in the world, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here at the beginning of the season or even a few months ago. The US Open [where he reached the semi-finals, losing to Nadal] changed it.\u201d Djokovic and Berrettini are in the Bjorn Borg Group with Federer and Thiem, while Nadal and Zverev compete in the Andre Agassi quartet alongside the sensationally in-form Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The challenge for the Big Three once was to conquer each other; now it is to survive until the final weekend.",

Given the predictably ludicrous levels of hype \u2013 Sky Sports News\u2019s Countdown To Kick-Off timer tells us there\u2019s (eek!) just two more days to go! \u2013 it\u2019s tempting to suggest that, as with New Year\u2019s Eve, the Phantom Menace, the Seinfeld finale and lists of things in tea-timely emails, anticipation inevitably leads to disappointment. But somehow Liverpool and Manchester City, who meet in The Game To End All Games And Definitely Decide The Title on Sunday, seem able to dodge that old cliche. We were spoiled in 2017-18 when the four-game series between the sides was a 9-9 aggregate thrillfest, but even last season\u2019s more sedate affairs had their memorable moments: Riyad Mahrez missing that late penalty in the 0-0 at Anfield and John Stones\u2019s goalline clearance when City ended Liverpool\u2019s 20-match unbeaten run to reignite the title race at the Etihad in January. No wonder there is plenty of mutual backslapping about. \u201cFor me Pep is the best manager in the world,\u201d cheered J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cRight now Liverpool is the strongest team in the world!\u201d right-back-atcha-ed Pep Guardiola. This time around, though, the signs aren\u2019t good for City. They\u2019ve not won at Anfield in November since 1930, they\u2019ve never beaten Liverpool in the league on a Sunday despite umpteen attempts and, obviously, Mercury is in retrograde which is, of course, bad news for Guardiola, the Catalan Capricorn. Perhaps of slightly more relevance, they\u2019ve also been Not Quite As Good this season, although when it comes to City that is very much a relative criticism (and we\u2019re not talking about Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s Tin-fuelled \u201cfriendly feedback\u201d sessions), given they\u2019ve averaged 14,798 points over the past couple of campaigns. The blithering idiots have mustered a mere 25 points from 11 games so far this time around, scoring a frankly embarrassing 34 goals in the process. Ederson is knacked. They\u2019re second. Losers. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side are favourites, then, but he isn\u2019t taking anything for granted. \u201cEveryone has to be in top shape,\u201d he roared. \u201cThe guys who sell the hot dogs have to be in top shape!\u201d Which presumably they will be as long as they stick to selling their wares rather than eating them. Guardiola, meanwhile, was full of praise for his back-up goalkeeper \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose because of Kyle Claudio\u201d \u2013 which must have been music to Bravo\u2019s ears.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m signing off now but here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main flooding news: A woman\u2019s body has been pulled from flood water in Derbyshire after reports of someone being swept away by a river, police said. Emergency services were called to a stretch of the River Derwent in Darley Dale, close to Matlock, in the early hours of Friday morning, Derbyshire police said. Derbyshire was hit with more rainfall in 24 hours than it normally receives in a single month. The Environment Agency\u2019s gauge in Glossop, a market town on the edge of the Peak District, recorded 114mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 4am. Derbyshire receives an average of 90.7mm of rain for the month of November. Flooding has sparked huge transport disruption today, leaving thousands of commuters facing a battle to get to work. Train operators warned passengers not to travel on a series of routes through Yorkshire \u2013 particularly in the Sheffield area \u2013 and between Hebden Bridge and Rochdale in the north-west. Stranded shoppers who were forced to camp out for the night had to buy spare clothes from Primark as they sheltered from the floods. Saskia Hazelwood, 17, a student from Doncaster, who was among those trapped in Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall shopping centre until 7am, told how she took refuge on sofas in M&amp;S. \u201cWe instantly started panicking and, when we found out there was no way of getting home, we went into Primark and all bought spare clothes and we bought food and drinks to keep us going throughout the night. As the clean up operation begins, the rainfall has eased off with little or none across the Midlands and north, bar the odd isolated shower. Tomorrow a weather front will move from Wales towards the east of England but it will fizzle out by the evening, according to the Met Office. While flood waters have left many stranded, one woman was determined not to let the weather get in the way of her journey to the shops. Footage captured by a passerby yesterday shows an older woman ploughing through flood water on her mobility scooter. As cars grind past at snail\u2019s pace, the scooter continues in determined fashion. Stephanie Jubb, who witnessed the scene in Sheffield and posted the video on her Facebook page with a caption reading \u201cOMG [Oh my God]\u201d, said: \u201cThe woman just started driving and we were like, \u2018she\u2019s not gonna do it, she\u2019s not gonna do it\u2019 and then she just carried on. She didn\u2019t even lift her legs up or anything.\u201d Jubb, who works in a pharmacy, said the woman later returned with shopping bags onboard her scooter. \u201cShe\u2019s come back through it with her shopping bags, but we didn\u2019t get that on tape,\u201d Jubb told PA Media. She said she could not believe the clip had gone viral, adding that she felt the clip illustrated \u201cnorthern spirit\u201d. \u201cThe people up north are quite strong. They just carry on doing their daily thing.\u201d More from Doncaster, as it has emerged one woman was rescued from her property and carried through flood waters on a man\u2019s back. Meanwhile, another resident, Lacey Hanrahan, was taken away with her baby by boat when water started flooding into her home. The 24-year-old told PA Media: \u201cI live down the end where there\u2019s a dip in the road, so we were one of the first to be affected. It got to the point where I wasn\u2019t able to walk out, so I was taken out on the boat. I just can\u2019t believe how deep the water has got.\u201d My colleague, Paul Scruton, has produced a map showing the array of flood warnings put out by the Environment Agency as of 10am this morning. Since then, the number has reduced to 70 in addition to six severe flood warnings, which indicate a risk to life. The emergency operation to find the woman whose body was recovered from flood water in Darley Dale involved a coastguard helicopter, a drone and mountain rescuers. Local worker Mark Hopkinson, who workd told BBC Radio Derby: \u201cThere was a police helicopter flying up and down this area as though they were looking for somebody or something. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether they were just checking the water levels or the extent of the flooding. Then police vehicles started turning up and we learned they were looking for a missing person. \u201cThey had people on the ground looking, and mountain rescuers. We saw a little drone go up and the coastguard helicopter came, and that was then circling, hovering over some trees.\u201d A woman\u2019s body has been pulled from flood water in Derbyshire after reports of someone being swept away by a river, police said. Emergency services were called to a stretch of the River Derwent in Darley Dale, close to Matlock, in the early hours of Friday morning, Derbyshire police said. A spokesman said:\u201cThe woman was reported as having been swept away by flood water in Rowsley and the body of what is believed to be the same woman was found in Darley Dale and was recovered at 10.40am. \u201cThe family of the woman have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time. Formal identification has yet to take place.\u201d Stranded residents in Doncaster had to be rescued from their homes by boat yesterday as waist-high water filled the road. Rescue teams put down sandbags in an attempt to stem the flow of water, while police cars surrounded the area. One woman, who has lived in her home in Yarborough Terrace \u2013 near the banks of the River Don \u2013 for more than 20 years, said the downstairs of her property had filled with water at about 7am on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve never known it to be this bad\u201d, she told PA Media. Another woman, who did not wish to be named, said she would have to house her daughter and grandchildren for the next few days because of the flooding. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just taken the decision to get out of here as soon as possible \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous as it is and it\u2019ll only get worse.\u201d South Yorkshire fire and rescue service received nearly 1,200 emergency calls in 24 hours. The service, which took more than 500 999 calls last night, said it has rescued more than 120 people. As people battle to get to work, the fire service is warning them not to put themselves at risk by entering flood water either by car or foot. Here\u2019s some pictures of the trail of devastation left behind by rainfall last night. In Rotherham, abandoned vehicles sit submerged in water in a car park. A member of the fire and rescue service wades through flood water as he escorts a JCB towing an truck along a flooded road in the town. Meanwhile, a smart car appears not to have made it to the gates of a warehouse because of rising waters. In Sheffield, a lorry struggles to drive through flood water near Meadowhall shopping centre, where people were trapped overnight because of the weather. Derbyshire was hit with more rainfall in 24 hours than it normally receives in a single month, the Guardian has confirmed. The Environment Agency\u2019s gauge in Glossop, a market town on the edge of the Peak District, recorded 114mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 4am. Derbyshire receives an average of 90.7mm of rain for the month of November. At local business Glossop Caravans, staff were forced to move dozens of vehicles to stop them being submerged in flood water. Receptionist Kirstie Booth told the Guardian: \u201cThe motorhomes were all moved on the main site. They had to be put on the top car park. The water was really deep. It\u2019s cleared up a lot now, we\u2019re still clearing up all the mud and leaves that it\u2019s left behind. \u201cThere\u2019s still a bit of a stream coming down off the top fields but it\u2019s not as bad as it was yesterday. I know someone came in and said it was nearly up to their knees at one point on the main road.\u201d Good news for those affected by the flooding as the Met Office says rainfall is due to ease off today with little or none across the Midlands and north, bar the odd isolated shower. Tomorrow a weather front will move from Wales towards the east of England but it will fizzle out by the evening. The Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Guardian: \u201cIt may linger a little bit over the Midlands, I would be looking at Oxfordshire, Warwickshire. But we\u2019re not expecting significant rainfall. As of the moment, there\u2019s no plans to issue any warnings for that.\u201d Schoolchildren were forced to wade through freezing knee-high floodwater to get home yesterday in Sheffield after their bus was forced to stop because of the weather. Daniel Harrison, 12, was among children told to leave school early at 2pm on Thursday because of the flooding but says he and classmates had to walk because their bus could go no further. \u201cThe water was up to my knees,\u201d Daniel recalled, as he waited to catch a different bus this morning to get to school. Speaking to PA Media, he added: \u201cI had to get home straight away because the water was absolutely freezing. The river had completely opened and all the water had flooded on to the road, it was terrible. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in that water but there was no choice \u2013 you had to go through it to get home.\u201d Villagers in South Yorkshire have described how they suffered \u201calmost biblical\u201d amounts of rainfall overnight. Kathleen Overton, a Post Office worker in Toll Bar, a village near Doncaster, told PA Media: \u201cIt must have started at around 9am yesterday when I was taking my grandson to school, and then it just didn\u2019t stop. At one point the water was coming right over my doorstep, and my daughters and I were worrying that it was going to come into the house.\u201d The village was also hit by severe flooding in June 2007. Overton, 61, added: \u201cPeople\u2019s cars were getting submerged in the water, gardens were ruined, you couldn\u2019t drive anywhere. It was carnage.\u201d Roy Kerr, 71, said the situation could have been far worse were it not for the help of young volunteers who put down sandbags and pumped out water. He said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as it was in 2007, but it easily could have been if it wasn\u2019t for those lads.\u201d In Derbyshire, locals are bucketing water out of their cars this morning. The BBC\u2019s Heidi Booth reports from Darley Dale: Footage shows cars submerged and a Premier Inn sign peeking out from the waters: The flooding has also devastated farmers\u2019 livelihoods as they wake up to find their fields submerged in water. Andrew Ward, a farmer in Lincolnshire, which has also been hit by heavy rainfall, tweeted footage of rain covered fields this morning. He wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve had wet periods but never as much as this and at this time of year. Situation is dire. The river is to the top, dykes can\u2019t empty so field drains not working. A lot of worried farmers in this area.\u201d He added: \u201cAnother 30mm yesterday and this is the result. In the last six weeks we\u2019ve had the amount of rain we usually get in six months. Not one acre planted and not looking too hopeful.\u201d Another farmer, Jono Dixon, in east Yorkshire, said his land had received 44mm of rainfall in 24 hours. He wrote: \u201cAfter the gloom of yesterday, wake-up sun is shining. However, not for long as the gloomy clouds are gathering again.\u201d Stranded shoppers who were forced to camp out for the night had to buy spare clothes from Primark as they sheltered from the floods. Saskia Hazelwood, 17, a student from Doncaster, who was among those trapped in Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall shopping centre until 7am, told how she took refuge on sofas in M&amp;S. Her father tried to reach the shopping centre by car to rescue her but had to turn back because of the flood water. Hazelwood says shoppers were provided with free refreshments throughout the night but complained it was \u201cnot enough\u201d. She told PA news agency: \u201cWhen we got to Meadowhall it was very hectic and we heard about the flooding and saw the river about to burst. Our trains were then cancelled so we went to get food, then spoke to the police and security and they told us it was unsafe to leave and there was no way of getting in or out. \u201cSo we instantly started panicking and, when we found out there was no way of getting home, we went into Primark and all bought spare clothes and we bought food and drinks to keep us going throughout the night. \u201cWe were in M&amp;S for a while on the sofas until they closed the store, and we were then moved to the Oasis food quarter. We were there until 7am.\u201d Meanwhile, a photojournalist tweeted footage of river flood defences being breached near Meadowhall last night: Hazelwood added: \u201cWe were provided with free refreshments throughout the night and morning but it was certainly not enough. \u201cWe had to basically camp out in the food area until they finally got a taxi to us at 7am. None of us had slept for over 24 hours. We were very tired, stressed and, of course, our families were panicking and kept keeping in touch. \u201cMy dad even tried driving to us around 11.30pm but, because the centre was gridlocked and also flooded and shut off, he wasn\u2019t able to get to us and so he had to turn around and go home. \u201cAt the start we thought it would be fun, a nice sleepover, something to certainly remember, but after 14 hours of being stranded in Meadowhall we just couldn\u2019t wait to get home, get into our own beds, feel safe again, and catch up on sleep.\u201d My colleague, Rachel Obordo, the Guardian\u2019s community editor, wants to hear from you.

Sky\u2019s Steph Oliver has made it through flood water to assess the scene this morning in Rotherham\u2019s town centre: A determined lone commuter wades through waist-high flood water with his bike. Asked if he was cold, he replied that his bike will keep him warm. \u201cI would have turned back if I felt the current was too strong,\u201d Michael the cyclist tells Sky. The River Don is following very high near the city\u2019s train station: More from the trapped shoppers last night as 12-year-old Dakota Hallam tells a reporter how she was stuck at Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. The schoolgirl told LBC yesterday: \u201cI don\u2019t know how long but we\u2019ve been here absolutely ages.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve asked Greggs [the shop] if they were going to stay overnight and they\u2019re staying overnight so we might as well.\u201d Meanwhile, Hannah Crossley, who was also trapped at the shopping centre, tweeted this video that apparently showed the scene outside Meadowhall last night: She later tweeted that she had made it home: Meadowhall, which says it is reopening at 10am this morning, said at 10.46pm last night that the \u201cmajority of customers left the building\u201d but that there were \u201ca small number of people who have chosen to stay with us for now\u201d. Flooding has sparked huge transport disruption today, leaving thousands of commuters facing a battle to get to work. Train operators are warning passengers not to travel on a series of routes through Yorkshire \u2013 particularly in the Sheffield area \u2013 and between Hebden Bridge and Rochdale in the north-west. Network Rail, which owns Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, said track inspections would take place \u201cwhere possible\u201d. Northern rail warned disruption could continue into the weekend despite the weather improving in many areas. The company has issued an update on blocked lines: A spokesman told PA Media: \u201cWe are still advising customers on several routes not to travel as flooding is making rail and road travel extremely difficult. \u201cColleagues at Network Rail are inspecting the tracks and working hard to return them to normal, but at present we have no estimate as to when we will be able to operate services on the affected routes.\u201d Other train companies hit by the weather include CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, LNER, TransPennine Express, Transport for Wales and Virgin Trains. The BBC weather forecaster Simon King gives a good summary of the numbers on rainfall in south Yorkshire as of 7.45am. Meanwhile, readers can view the Environment Agency\u2019s flood warnings in their area and across the country here, which are updated constantly. And for those wondering how the weather will fare later, King tweets: One villager near Sheffield described how he had a sea of water across his carpets in his home this morning following the rain \u2013 and up to four feet outside. James Barber, who lives in the village of Whiston, near Sheffield in south Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis morning it seems to have subsided quite a bit. It got to its peak at around two o\u2019clock this morning. In our house it got to about seven inches or so in the lower levels.\u201d Asked if he had a sea of water across his floors and carpets, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d adding: \u201cBut outside, in the yard, in the drive, it got to about four feet.\u201d He continued: \u201cI moved my car out earlier on and I\u2019m really glad I did because we thought that the pinnacle of it was at around three o\u2019clock yesterday afternoon.\u201d An emergency contractor from Streets Ahead, which has been helping local residents overnight, also told the programme: \u201cWe\u2019ve got teams our there. They\u2019ve been supporting members of the public providing sandbags. We\u2019ve been taking people out of their cars that\u2019ve been flooded, trying to remove those flood waters from roads to allow people to commute through the city.\u201d The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has tweeted about the floods this morning: Sheffield city council has issued an update on road closures as of 7am. Rotherham council did the same last night at 1.55am. Meanwhile, Derbyshire olice have issued a warning about motorists driving in flood water: Nearly a month\u2019s worth of rainfall has fallen in Sheffield in 24 hours, according to the Met Office. The forecaster told the Guardian 75.6mm of rain fell in the city up to 6am this morning, compared with a monthly average for the whole of November in Yorkshire of 89.7mm. Five severe flood warnings remain in place, 117 flood warnings and 121 flood alerts. The Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: \u201cOver the last 24 hours it\u2019s been a very wet. It\u2019s come after a wetter than average October so it\u2019s almost been the worst possible combination for Sheffield. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very wet autumn and yesterday was extremely wet, almost a month\u2019s worth of rain falling in 24 hours over an urban area. It\u2019s never a good combination. That\u2019s why we are seeing the flooding across parts of Sheffield.\u201d Good morning, folks. Simon Murphy here, I\u2019ll be liveblogging the latest developments in Yorkshire and the Midlands, where torrential rain has caused flooding that has led to chaos overnight. Hundreds of shoppers were trapped in shopping centres in both Sheffield and Rotherham. Many homes have been forced to evacuate and 116 flood warnings remain in place, the majority of them in Yorkshire. The Met Office predicts flooding rains will clear, moving south-east by lunchtime. But, as the clean-up operation begins, flood warnings are expected to remain in place for several days.",

      "body": "<p>The stonemason Trevor Proudfoot, who has died aged 65 following complications from pancreatic cancer, pioneered the adoption of traditional materials, techniques and craftsmanship in conservation. He was a conservator in stone and plaster with a maker\u2019s sensibility, a historian\u2019s understanding and a curator\u2019s eye. When an old building or sculpture needed attention, he always looked to prolong its life and beauty in the fewest possible steps.</p> <p>As a young man he trained under the London stonemason John Bysouth. In 1979, when he was working with John\u2019s sons on the conservation of the 14th-century Bristol High Cross, which since the mid 18th century has stood in the landscape gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire, Trevor\u2019s skills were noticed by David Winfield, the National Trust\u2019s first surveyor of conservation. In the early 1980s, as the charity\u2019s newly appointed adviser for the conservation of stone and plaster, Trevor established a statuary conservation workshop on the Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>For nearly 40 years the trust\u2019s properties, its staff and fellow advisers and consultants were beneficiaries of Trevor\u2019s guidance, based on principles such as the retention of original fabric, reversibility and conservation on a little and often basis. In 1989, working alongside trust staff and other conservation advisers, Trevor responded heroically to the ravages of the fire at Uppark, West Sussex. He masterminded the restoration of plasterwork throughout the house, ensuring that surviving fragments were incorporated into the new work, which, in turn, he advocated should be modelled freehand, so as to reflect the verve and vitality of the original. Trevor\u2019s oversight of this process brought out the skills of craftsmen who went on to establish new firms, and a renaissance of traditional craft skills followed. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4457992539ad171184c58f00de64b1b37108455b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4457992539ad171184c58f00de64b1b37108455b/0_67_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Proudfoot with the restored Blue Horse at Aphrodisias, Turkey, 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Proudfoot with the restored Blue Horse at Aphrodisias, Turkey, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RRR Smith/Aphrodisias Excavations</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the same year, Trevor was invited to advise at <a href=\"http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/site.html\" title=\"\">New York University\u2019s excavation site at Aphrodisias</a>, the Hellenistic and Roman city in Caria, now western Anatolia in Turkey. Its ancient marble quarries, distinctive school of sculpture and wealth of epigraphical inscriptions helped connect him to the ancient world, its builders, sculptors and the materials and techniques that they used. Working with Bert Smith, now of Oxford University, over 18 seasons, and often joined by one or two colleagues from Cliveden Conservation, Trevor led projects to restore and conserve <a href=\"http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/northagora.html\" title=\"\">the North Agora</a> (civic square), <a href=\"http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/hadrianicbaths.html\" title=\"\">the Hadrianic Baths</a> (dedicated to the emperor) and the <a href=\"http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/sebasteion.html\" title=\"\">Sebasteion Propylon</a> (monumental temple gateway).</p> <p>He trained a local team to protect exposed wall heads with lime-mortar cappings \u2013 much needed on other sites across the Mediterranean \u2013 and, with the support of Turkish craftsmen whose skills he had nurtured, he conserved and displayed in the Aphrodisias Museum a large number of sculptural reliefs and statues, among them a series of late antique shield portraits, the Zoilos Frieze, the so-called Blue Horse, and 65 life-size reliefs from the Sebasteion.</p> <p>In 1991 Cliveden Conservation became an entity independent of the National Trust, and Trevor developed it as an international business with satellite workshops in Bath and north Norfolk. Both National Trust and private clients benefited from this expansion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7c4e4c5ffee86d3a6456cb0ed86271208887b91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7c4e4c5ffee86d3a6456cb0ed86271208887b91/0_287_2148_1288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fully restored ceiling at Uppark, West Sussex, after a disastrous fire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trevor worked productively alongside material scientists including John Stewart, a specialist in historic lime mortars, and Mike Schwar, with whom he developed a service to identify and analyse natural stones and mortars used in historic buildings. His talent, authority and affability made him popular with fellow professionals \u2013 conservators, curators, architects and craftsmen \u2013 and private and institutional owners of historic buildings.</p> <p>Born in Herne Bay, Kent, Trevor was the son of Peter, who ran the family printing firm, AJ Proudfoot and Son, and his wife, Miriam (nee Stopps), a hairdresser. He was educated at Vernon Holme school, Canterbury, and Kent College before undertaking a foundation year at Exeter School of Art. He abandoned his subsequent studies at Hull College of Art to join his future wife, Hannah Firmin, in London; they married in 1980.</p> <p>A gifted athlete, Trevor played rugby well into his 50s. He had an incisive mind coupled with an irreverent charm that masked a seriousness of purpose.</p> <p>He and Hannah had two sons, Lewis and Dorian; they divorced in 1997. In 2002 he married Laura Hebert, and they had a daughter, Emily; they divorced in 2007. He is survived by these three children; by another daughter, Sophie, from a relationship with Julie Marsden; and by three sisters.</p> <p>\u2022 Trevor James Proudfoot, stonemason and conservator, born 10 July 1954; died 12 September 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "The stonemason Trevor Proudfoot, who has died aged 65 following complications from pancreatic cancer, pioneered the adoption of traditional materials, techniques and craftsmanship in conservation. He was a conservator in stone and plaster with a maker\u2019s sensibility, a historian\u2019s understanding and a curator\u2019s eye. When an old building or sculpture needed attention, he always looked to prolong its life and beauty in the fewest possible steps. As a young man he trained under the London stonemason John Bysouth. In 1979, when he was working with John\u2019s sons on the conservation of the 14th-century Bristol High Cross, which since the mid 18th century has stood in the landscape gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire, Trevor\u2019s skills were noticed by David Winfield, the National Trust\u2019s first surveyor of conservation. In the early 1980s, as the charity\u2019s newly appointed adviser for the conservation of stone and plaster, Trevor established a statuary conservation workshop on the Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire. For nearly 40 years the trust\u2019s properties, its staff and fellow advisers and consultants were beneficiaries of Trevor\u2019s guidance, based on principles such as the retention of original fabric, reversibility and conservation on a little and often basis. In 1989, working alongside trust staff and other conservation advisers, Trevor responded heroically to the ravages of the fire at Uppark, West Sussex. He masterminded the restoration of plasterwork throughout the house, ensuring that surviving fragments were incorporated into the new work, which, in turn, he advocated should be modelled freehand, so as to reflect the verve and vitality of the original. Trevor\u2019s oversight of this process brought out the skills of craftsmen who went on to establish new firms, and a renaissance of traditional craft skills followed. In the same year, Trevor was invited to advise at New York University\u2019s excavation site at Aphrodisias, the Hellenistic and Roman city in Caria, now western Anatolia in Turkey. Its ancient marble quarries, distinctive school of sculpture and wealth of epigraphical inscriptions helped connect him to the ancient world, its builders, sculptors and the materials and techniques that they used. Working with Bert Smith, now of Oxford University, over 18 seasons, and often joined by one or two colleagues from Cliveden Conservation, Trevor led projects to restore and conserve the North Agora (civic square), the Hadrianic Baths (dedicated to the emperor) and the Sebasteion Propylon (monumental temple gateway). He trained a local team to protect exposed wall heads with lime-mortar cappings \u2013 much needed on other sites across the Mediterranean \u2013 and, with the support of Turkish craftsmen whose skills he had nurtured, he conserved and displayed in the Aphrodisias Museum a large number of sculptural reliefs and statues, among them a series of late antique shield portraits, the Zoilos Frieze, the so-called Blue Horse, and 65 life-size reliefs from the Sebasteion. In 1991 Cliveden Conservation became an entity independent of the National Trust, and Trevor developed it as an international business with satellite workshops in Bath and north Norfolk. Both National Trust and private clients benefited from this expansion. Trevor worked productively alongside material scientists including John Stewart, a specialist in historic lime mortars, and Mike Schwar, with whom he developed a service to identify and analyse natural stones and mortars used in historic buildings. His talent, authority and affability made him popular with fellow professionals \u2013 conservators, curators, architects and craftsmen \u2013 and private and institutional owners of historic buildings. Born in Herne Bay, Kent, Trevor was the son of Peter, who ran the family printing firm, AJ Proudfoot and Son, and his wife, Miriam (nee Stopps), a hairdresser. He was educated at Vernon Holme school, Canterbury, and Kent College before undertaking a foundation year at Exeter School of Art. He abandoned his subsequent studies at Hull College of Art to join his future wife, Hannah Firmin, in London; they married in 1980. A gifted athlete, Trevor played rugby well into his 50s. He had an incisive mind coupled with an irreverent charm that masked a seriousness of purpose. He and Hannah had two sons, Lewis and Dorian; they divorced in 1997. In 2002 he married Laura Hebert, and they had a daughter, Emily; they divorced in 2007. He is survived by these three children; by another daughter, Sophie, from a relationship with Julie Marsden; and by three sisters. \u2022 Trevor James Proudfoot, stonemason and conservator, born 10 July 1954; died 12 September 2019",

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is predicting a big future for Mason Greenwood and has explained why the 18-year-old forward has been used sparingly this season. Greenwood scored the opening goal in Manchester United\u2019s win against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday, but missed their previous cup outing against Chelsea through being selected for the U21s to play Doncaster the night before. Even when Anthony Martial was out injured, Solskj\u00e6r resisted the temptation to use Greenwood in league games because he did not want to rush his development or give him too much responsibility too early. \u201cWe can\u2019t play him all the time, we are trying to ease him in gradually,\u201d the manager said. \u201cAs a young boy you have ups and downs. It would not be fair to ask him to play every week and it would not have been right either to put all the weight on Mason\u2019s shoulders when Anthony was missing. This club is all about giving young players with the right attitude a chance, but at that age you have to be careful. \u201cMason is going to have a very good career. He\u2019s a natural finisher and he\u2019s just as composed in front of a crowd of 60,000 as he is kicking a ball about with his mates but if it takes a couple of years for him to become established we are fine with that.\u201d United face Brighton at home on Sunday and Solskj\u00e6r believes their opponents have improved significantly under Graham Potter. \u201cI thought they were a good team last season. I remember thinking we were lucky to beat them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to have turned a corner since, they have been controlling games and we are going to need loads of energy to press really well. We can\u2019t let them be comfortable here at Old Trafford.\u201d Defeat at Bournemouth in their last league fixture put an end to the mini-recovery United had staged since becoming the first side this season to take points from Liverpool, and Solskj\u00e6r accepts there will be backward steps as well as forward ones. \u201cYou will get that with such a young team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still not quite as consistent as we would like to be but we are learning all the time. We know the Premier League is out of our reach, we are too far behind the top teams, but there is a lot of the season left and any cup competition that comes around we intend to go for.\u201d",

Maybe, for you, this fling was a way to get back in touch with who you were, or what you feel you are missing out on now. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

As well as the two children aged 15, Dinh Dinh Binh and Nguyen Huy Hung, there was one 17-year-old, four 18-year-olds and three 19-year-olds.</p> <p>A team of Vietnamese officials traveled to Britain to help with the formal identification. Assistant chief constable Tim Smith, who is leading the inquiry, said: \u201cThis was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.</p> <p>\u201cOur priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims\u2019 friends and families. It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual\u2019s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one\u2019s identity.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Beasley-Murray, senior coroner in Essex, offered her condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cMy thoughts are with them at this unimaginably difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>Police confirmed that Pham Thi Tra My, the 26-year-old who sent text messages to her family to tell them she was dying, was among the dead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Pham wrote from the lorry.</p> <p>The oldest victim was 44. Most came from three known people-smuggling areas in Vietnam: Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Quang Binh. Ha Tinh province was the site of a chemical spill from a steel factory in 2016 that poisoned up to 125 miles of the northern coastline and devastated the fishing industry.

      "bodyText": "Ten teenagers were among the 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex last month, the youngest of them being two 15-year-old boys, police have revealed. Detectives have completed identification of the bodies found in the container, which was shipped from Belgium to Essex on 23 October, and confirmed that all the victims, 31 males and eight females, were Vietnamese. As well as the two children aged 15, Dinh Dinh Binh and Nguyen Huy Hung, there was one 17-year-old, four 18-year-olds and three 19-year-olds. A team of Vietnamese officials traveled to Britain to help with the formal identification. Assistant chief constable Tim Smith, who is leading the inquiry, said: \u201cThis was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores. \u201cOur priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims\u2019 friends and families. It remained of paramount importance to us to ensure that an individual\u2019s next of kin were informed, and that they were given some time to absorb this tragic news before we publicly confirmed their loved one\u2019s identity.\u201d Caroline Beasley-Murray, senior coroner in Essex, offered her condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cMy thoughts are with them at this unimaginably difficult time.\u201d Police confirmed that Pham Thi Tra My, the 26-year-old who sent text messages to her family to tell them she was dying, was among the dead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Pham wrote from the lorry. The oldest victim was 44. Most came from three known people-smuggling areas in Vietnam: Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Quang Binh. Ha Tinh province was the site of a chemical spill from a steel factory in 2016 that poisoned up to 125 miles of the northern coastline and devastated the fishing industry. Many people have left the area in search of work abroad. The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, 25, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Eight suspects were arrested in Vietnam this week in relation to people smuggling offences. Katherine Mulhern, the head of the anti-trafficking charity, Ecpat UK, said: \u201cThis tragedy has shocked the UK and its impact has been felt by people across the country who arrived in the UK in the back of lorries.

Children and teenagers have an exacerbated vulnerability, they are under the thumb of the trafficking network that is controlling them.\u201d The full list of victims\u2019 names, released by Essex police: Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Huy Phong, 35, from Ha Tinh Vo Nhan Du, 19, from Ha Tinh Tran Manh Hung, 37, from Ha Tinh Tran Khanh Tho, 18, from Ha Tinh Vo Van Linh, 25, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Van Nhan, 33, from Ha Tinh Bui Phan Thang, 37, from Ha Tinh Nguyen Huy Hung, 15, from Ha Tinh Tran Thi Tho, 21, from Nghe An Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Nghe An Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, from Nghe An Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, from Nghe An Le Van Ha, 30, from Nghe An Tran Thi Ngoc, 19, from Nghe An Nguyen Van Hung, 33, from Nghe An Hoang Van Tiep, 18, from Nghe An Cao Tien Dung, 37, from Nghe An Cao Huy Thanh, 33, from Nghe An Tran Thi Mai Nhung, 18, from Nghe An Nguyen Minh Quang, 20, from Nghe An Le Trong Thanh, 44, from Dien Chau Pham Thi Ngoc Oanh, 28, from Nghe An Hoang Van Hoi, 24, from Nghe An Nguyen Tho Tuan, 25, from Nghe An Dang Huu Tuyen, 22, from Nghe An Nguyen Trong Thai, 26, from Nghe An Nguyen Van Hiep, 24, from Nghe An Nguyen Thi Van, 35, from Nghe An Tran Hai Loc, 35, from Nghe An Duong Minh Tuan, 27, from Quang Binh Nguyen Ngoc Ha, 32, from Quang Binh Nguyen Tien Dung, 33, from Quang, Binh Phan Thi Thanh, 41, from Hai Phong Nguyen Ba Vu Hung, 34, from Thua Tien Hue Dinh Dinh Thai Quyen, 18, from Hai Phong Tran Ngoc Hieu, 17, from Hai Duong Dinh Dinh Binh, 15, from Hai Phong",

      "body": "<p>General elections are rarely epoch-defining events. Though the parties pretend that their political differences are large, in economic terms they rarely are. But this one could be different.</p> <p>Of course, elections lead to change. Labour\u2019s victory in 1997 marked a decisive break with the Thatcher-Major years in terms of public spending and welfare policy. Yet New Labour didn\u2019t fundamentally challenge the dominant model of economic policy that it had inherited from the Tories: a globalised and declining manufacturing sector, and deregulated financial and labour markets. In 2010 the coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-vat-austerity-plan\" title=\"\">brought in austerity</a>. But Labour would have done so too, continuing the fiscal orthodoxy. Even at elections, economic policy is usually largely consensual.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/green-new-deal-climate-disaster\">The beauty of a Green New Deal is that it would pay for itself | Ann Pettifor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are exceptions. The two epochal elections of modern times were those of 1945 and 1979. Both followed crises in the formerly dominant model of capitalism. And both led to what social scientists call a paradigm shift in economic thinking and policy.</p> <p>By 1945 it was clear that the <a href=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/20190/concepts/laissez-faire-economics/\" title=\"\">laissez-faire economics</a> of the prewar period was dead. It had failed to prevent, and could not solve, the mass unemployment of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/18/great-depression-photography-art-exhibition-chicago\" title=\"\">Great Depression</a>, and offered nothing to the troops returning from the war. The election won by Clement Attlee marked the start of a new era of Keynesian economics: active government to maintain full employment, and a welfare state to support universal living standards.</p> <p>The new economic model lasted 30 (golden) years, but eventually it too collapsed in crisis. When President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates in 1971, and the oil-producing nations quadrupled oil prices two years later, the UK lurched into stagflation \u2013 simultaneous recession and high inflation. The Keynesian model seemed to have run out of solutions. The election of 1979 saw Margaret Thatcher enter Downing Street armed with a new economic orthodoxy: that of free markets, deregulation and privatisation. The rest is history.</p> <p>Except that the free market model has also now collapsed. The financial crash of 2008 marked the decisive moment, but the last decade of earnings stagnation, rising inequality and climate breakdown has made it clear.</p> <p>Just as in the 1930s and 1970s, the orthodox policy prescriptions have failed. After almost 10 years of austerity, the economy remains <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/uk-in-the-global-economy\" title=\"\">on the life support</a> of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing. Investment remains low, productivity stagnant and trade in deficit. The revival of the metropolitan economies of London and some major cities has merely exposed a widening gulf with the rest of the country. As most people\u2019s living standards have stalled, the wealth of the top 1% has soared. Loaded with student debt, facing a future of precarious work and expensive rented housing, young people may be the first generation in modern times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/18/millennials-earn-8000-pounds-less-in-their-20s-than-predecessors\" title=\"\">poorer than their parents</a>. If people are angry at the elite, it is no wonder.</p> <p>The free-market model has managed to generate a triple crisis for capitalism: it is financially unstable, environmentally unsustainable and politically unpopular.</p> <p>This is why 2019 needs to become another of those epoch-defining elections. For just as in 1945 and 1979, we cannot get out of this crisis by carrying on as before.</p> <p>This is not a view held only on the left of the political spectrum. Read <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/06/07/good-capitalism-v-bad-capitalism\" title=\"\">the Economist</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a8ab27e-d470-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77\" title=\"\">Financial Times</a>, or listen to business leaders in the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses, and it is apparent that even capitalists think the current model of capitalism is in trouble.

      "bodyText": "General elections are rarely epoch-defining events. Though the parties pretend that their political differences are large, in economic terms they rarely are. But this one could be different. Of course, elections lead to change. Labour\u2019s victory in 1997 marked a decisive break with the Thatcher-Major years in terms of public spending and welfare policy. Yet New Labour didn\u2019t fundamentally challenge the dominant model of economic policy that it had inherited from the Tories: a globalised and declining manufacturing sector, and deregulated financial and labour markets. In 2010 the coalition brought in austerity. But Labour would have done so too, continuing the fiscal orthodoxy. Even at elections, economic policy is usually largely consensual. There are exceptions. The two epochal elections of modern times were those of 1945 and 1979. Both followed crises in the formerly dominant model of capitalism. And both led to what social scientists call a paradigm shift in economic thinking and policy. By 1945 it was clear that the laissez-faire economics of the prewar period was dead. It had failed to prevent, and could not solve, the mass unemployment of the Great Depression, and offered nothing to the troops returning from the war. The election won by Clement Attlee marked the start of a new era of Keynesian economics: active government to maintain full employment, and a welfare state to support universal living standards. The new economic model lasted 30 (golden) years, but eventually it too collapsed in crisis. When President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates in 1971, and the oil-producing nations quadrupled oil prices two years later, the UK lurched into stagflation \u2013 simultaneous recession and high inflation. The Keynesian model seemed to have run out of solutions. The election of 1979 saw Margaret Thatcher enter Downing Street armed with a new economic orthodoxy: that of free markets, deregulation and privatisation. The rest is history. Except that the free market model has also now collapsed. The financial crash of 2008 marked the decisive moment, but the last decade of earnings stagnation, rising inequality and climate breakdown has made it clear. Just as in the 1930s and 1970s, the orthodox policy prescriptions have failed. After almost 10 years of austerity, the economy remains on the life support of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing. Investment remains low, productivity stagnant and trade in deficit. The revival of the metropolitan economies of London and some major cities has merely exposed a widening gulf with the rest of the country. As most people\u2019s living standards have stalled, the wealth of the top 1% has soared. Loaded with student debt, facing a future of precarious work and expensive rented housing, young people may be the first generation in modern times poorer than their parents. If people are angry at the elite, it is no wonder. The free-market model has managed to generate a triple crisis for capitalism: it is financially unstable, environmentally unsustainable and politically unpopular. This is why 2019 needs to become another of those epoch-defining elections. For just as in 1945 and 1979, we cannot get out of this crisis by carrying on as before. This is not a view held only on the left of the political spectrum. Read the Economist and the Financial Times, or listen to business leaders in the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses, and it is apparent that even capitalists think the current model of capitalism is in trouble. Their anxiety is not just that it has lost public support. It is that the core engine of private sector growth is no longer working. In almost every field of economic policy it is becoming clear that tinkering at the edges of the current economic system is not going to be enough. A much more fundamental transformation is required. There is a gathering consensus on what this requires. It must start by putting the economy on an ecological footing. A comprehensive set of environmental targets and policies are required to drive down carbon emissions, pollution and biodiversity loss: a new Sustainable Economy Act combined with a Green New Deal. This will need higher levels of investment. With the government currently able to borrow at negative real interest rates, raising capital spending \u2013 particularly for green infrastructure such as renewable energy, home insulation and public transport \u2013 is economically highly rational. A more active industrial strategy would then guide private investment into the innovation and export-oriented sectors, which can create jobs across the country. The labour market needs to be rebalanced. For wages to rise, workers need to take home a larger share of national income \u2013 through a higher minimum wage, more security for workers in the \u201cgig economy\u201d and a higher proportion of sectors in which trade unions engage in collective bargaining. As other European countries show, this helps, not hinders, productivity improvement. And governments must provide decent public services, if necessary paid for through higher taxes. Public services are what makes modern societies civilised, and many of them \u2013 education, health, childcare \u2013 raise productivity too.

Flabby and puffy, this child seems like a proto-person who will only take truly human shape by absorbing knowledge. Reading is central to that civilising process. The teacher looks more sharply defined, more of a person. She is a gentle teacher, a loving missionary to this infant savage. This painting is a perfect expression of the ideals of the Enlightenment, which, led by such thinkers as Voltaire and Diderot and taking its guiding light from Newton\u2019s science, believed in redemption through reason. The apt pupil will grow up to read Rousseau, listen to Mozart and may live long enough to see reason die in the Jacobin Terror. \u2022 National Gallery, London.

      "body": "<p>One of the highlights of my year is the annual Italian feast at <a href=\"https://www.wildartichokes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wild Artichokes</a> in Kingsbridge, Devon, which is cooked by the wonderful chef and food writer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jane-baxter\" title=\"\"> Jane Baxter</a>, who makes an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jane-baxter\" title=\"\">occasional appearance on these pages</a>, and on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v5y2\" title=\"\">BBC1\u2019s Saturday Kitchen</a>, come to that.</p> <p>Baxter, whose motto should be \u201cnever knowingly undercatered\u201d, is incapable of making a meal with fewer than a dozen courses, and this year was no different, including six antipasti and three pastas, which makes a nonsense of trying to match individual dishes. The trick is to find a wine that will rub along with pretty well everything you throw at it, and I found it in an Etna bianco from Sicilian producer Tasca d\u2019Almerita.</p> <p>Like many Italian whites, it was fresh, crisp, dry and comparatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that wouldn\u2019t stand out in a tasting but that bursts into life with food. That\u2019s true of many Italian whites, even pinot grigio, whose comparative neutrality is a positive bonus as a backdrop to a meal. (It\u2019s interesting that most Italians don\u2019t instinctively reach for an aromatic sauvignon blanc or oaky chardonnay with their meals, although they do make more international styles for the UK market.)</p> <p>Italian reds, too, tend to be lighter and more acidic than their French and Spanish counterparts. I know the term \u201cacid\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly appealing, but it\u2019s another word for the freshness in a wine that cuts through food so appealingly. With the exception again of the richer styles you find in the Maremma region of Tuscany, Sicily and the south, these are red wines that behave like a white, which works particularly well with the veg-centred food we tend to be eating these days. Compared with other European wines, they\u2019re good value, too, with plenty available for less than \u00a310, although they may not appeal if you\u2019re a fan of more full-bodied reds such as malbec, say.</p> <p>The downside with Italian wines \u2013 as I touched on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/01/how-to-choose-a-wine-that-punches-above-its-price-point\" title=\"\">last week</a> \u2013 is that they\u2019re not particularly consistent. Pinot grigio can be really good value or it can, frankly, be piss-poor. Go for the top-of-the-range supermarket own-labels such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/254844107%0D\" title=\"\">Tesco Finest* Pinot Grigio</a></strong> at \u00a37, or more expensive pinot grigios when they\u2019re on special offer, such as the <strong>Terre di Vita Organic Pinot Grigio 2018</strong> (12.5%), which is normally \u00a37.99 but is currently reduced to \u00a35.99 on Waitrose\u2019s current 25%-off-six-bottles offer. Even if you don\u2019t regard yourself a pinot grigio fan, that\u2019s a really good deal.</p> <h2>Four food-friendly Italian wines to see you right through a meal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spacer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48cfb0b31e768fb01bc075d575caa6bf2df50a3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48cfb0b31e768fb01bc075d575caa6bf2df50a3e/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Verdicchio dei Castelli de Jesi Classico 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Verdicchio dei Castelli de Jesi Classico 2018</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/verdicchio-dei-castelli-di-jesi-classico-case-of-6/p/p21127057\" title=\"\">\u00a37 Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, 13%. </p> <p>One of the most reliable and authentic Italian whites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"s-acer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eb1705f85bead7349bd4687bcb391ac516f77f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb1705f85bead7349bd4687bcb391ac516f77f0/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicosia Lenza di Munti Etna Bianco 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Nicosia Lenza di Munti Etna Bianco 2017</strong></p> <p>\u00a311 Booths, 12.5%.

The trick is to find a wine that will rub along with pretty well everything you throw at it, and I found it in an Etna bianco from Sicilian producer Tasca d\u2019Almerita. Like many Italian whites, it was fresh, crisp, dry and comparatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that wouldn\u2019t stand out in a tasting but that bursts into life with food. That\u2019s true of many Italian whites, even pinot grigio, whose comparative neutrality is a positive bonus as a backdrop to a meal. (It\u2019s interesting that most Italians don\u2019t instinctively reach for an aromatic sauvignon blanc or oaky chardonnay with their meals, although they do make more international styles for the UK market.) Italian reds, too, tend to be lighter and more acidic than their French and Spanish counterparts. I know the term \u201cacid\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly appealing, but it\u2019s another word for the freshness in a wine that cuts through food so appealingly. With the exception again of the richer styles you find in the Maremma region of Tuscany, Sicily and the south, these are red wines that behave like a white, which works particularly well with the veg-centred food we tend to be eating these days. Compared with other European wines, they\u2019re good value, too, with plenty available for less than \u00a310, although they may not appeal if you\u2019re a fan of more full-bodied reds such as malbec, say. The downside with Italian wines \u2013 as I touched on last week \u2013 is that they\u2019re not particularly consistent. Pinot grigio can be really good value or it can, frankly, be piss-poor. Go for the top-of-the-range supermarket own-labels such as Tesco Finest* Pinot Grigio at \u00a37, or more expensive pinot grigios when they\u2019re on special offer, such as the Terre di Vita Organic Pinot Grigio 2018 (12.5%), which is normally \u00a37.99 but is currently reduced to \u00a35.99 on Waitrose\u2019s current 25%-off-six-bottles offer. Even if you don\u2019t regard yourself a pinot grigio fan, that\u2019s a really good deal. Four food-friendly Italian wines to see you right through a meal Verdicchio dei Castelli de Jesi Classico 2018 \u00a37 Marks &amp; Spencer, 13%. One of the most reliable and authentic Italian whites. Nicosia Lenza di Munti Etna Bianco 2017 \u00a311 Booths, 12.5%. Very well priced (for Etna), mineral volcanic white. Perfect for seafood. Custoza Monte del Fra 2018 \u00a39.50 Booths, \u00a312.50 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. Really appealing, smooth, dry white, similar in style to a soave. Cecchi Morellino di Scansano 2018 \u00a37.49 (on offer) Waitrose, 13%. Fresh, fruity, Tuscan red to go with rag\u00f9 or roast lamb. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

      "body": "<p>Companies that aim to remove all plastic packaging from their operations could inadvertently increase environmental damage, according to experts who attended a roundtable discussion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">supported by</a> Henkel, at the Guardian on 30 October. \u201cWe need to use as little plastic as possible but as much as necessary,\u201d said Marcus Gover, chief executive of the Waste and Resources Action Programme, the government\u2019s waste advisory body.</p> <p>Gover said some plastic packaging helps reduce food waste, which is responsible for <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bb144e.pdf\">8% of all greenhouse gas emissions</a>. A 225g beef steak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jul/19/climatechange.climatechange\">responsible for the equivalent of 8kg of carbon dioxide</a> emissions, is less likely to be wasted if protected by a plastic tray and film. \u201cIf [packaging] makes that piece of beef last and not be wasted, it\u2019s done a very important job,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But even if it does not make sense to remove all plastic packaging, there is great potential to replace, recycle and reuse more of the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752091/Plastics_factsheet_web.pdf\">2.26</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752091/Plastics_factsheet_web.pdf\">m</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752091/Plastics_factsheet_web.pdf\"> tonnes of plastic packaging</a> used each year in the UK, with 46.2% currently recovered or recycled according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/784263/UK_Statistics_on_Waste_statistical_notice_March_2019_rev_FINAL.pdf\">government figures</a> (pdf). </p> <p>As well as companies replacing plastics \u2013 such as brewer Molson Coors, which plans to swap plastic for cardboard in sleeve packaging for cans of Carling and Coors Light by spring 2021 \u2013 many bars and restaurants are also cutting down on waste, for instance, by by scrapping plastic straws.</p> <p>Replacement is not always the answer, however. Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable wastes management at the University of Northampton, said she has heard of people buying supposedly sustainable bamboo boxes to replace durable plastic storage boxes, whose initial environmental impact is mitigated by each reuse, or building large collections of \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d fabric shopping bags. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that people buy stuff they don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s not environmentally friendly.\u201d</p> <p>Recycling is well-established as a way to reduce plastic waste, but it too has its problems. Joe Kingston, business improvement and group strategy manager for the City of London Corporation\u2019s environmental department, said that local authorities have good systems for recycling plastics but depend on the public using them. For many people, \u201cit\u2019s not even registering \u2013 they put it in their bins and go about their day-to-day lives\u201d, he said, meaning the City of London only recycles half of the area\u2019s plastic waste.</p> <p>Local authorities also have to deal with a mismatch between waste processing contracts that can last 25 years and prices for recycled plastic that can change daily. Many were affected when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/20/plastic-recycling-industrys-problems-costing-councils-up-to-500000-a-year\">China banned imports of post-consumer plastic</a>. There are, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/18/packaging-producers-to-pay-full-recycling-costs-under-waste-scheme\">plans to ease the financial burden of recycling</a> on local councils under the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/765914/resources-waste-strategy-dec-2018.pdf\">government\u2019s waste strategy</a>, which proposes to charge retailers and producers of packaging the full cost of collecting and recycling.</p> <p>Some companies want to use more recycled plastic in their packaging but are limited by what is available.

      "bodyText": "Companies that aim to remove all plastic packaging from their operations could inadvertently increase environmental damage, according to experts who attended a roundtable discussion, supported by Henkel, at the Guardian on 30 October. \u201cWe need to use as little plastic as possible but as much as necessary,\u201d said Marcus Gover, chief executive of the Waste and Resources Action Programme, the government\u2019s waste advisory body. Gover said some plastic packaging helps reduce food waste, which is responsible for 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions. A 225g beef steak, responsible for the equivalent of 8kg of carbon dioxide emissions, is less likely to be wasted if protected by a plastic tray and film. \u201cIf [packaging] makes that piece of beef last and not be wasted, it\u2019s done a very important job,\u201d he said. But even if it does not make sense to remove all plastic packaging, there is great potential to replace, recycle and reuse more of the 2.26m tonnes of plastic packaging used each year in the UK, with 46.2% currently recovered or recycled according to government figures (pdf). As well as companies replacing plastics \u2013 such as brewer Molson Coors, which plans to swap plastic for cardboard in sleeve packaging for cans of Carling and Coors Light by spring 2021 \u2013 many bars and restaurants are also cutting down on waste, for instance, by by scrapping plastic straws. Replacement is not always the answer, however. Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable wastes management at the University of Northampton, said she has heard of people buying supposedly sustainable bamboo boxes to replace durable plastic storage boxes, whose initial environmental impact is mitigated by each reuse, or building large collections of \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d fabric shopping bags. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that people buy stuff they don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s not environmentally friendly.\u201d Recycling is well-established as a way to reduce plastic waste, but it too has its problems. Joe Kingston, business improvement and group strategy manager for the City of London Corporation\u2019s environmental department, said that local authorities have good systems for recycling plastics but depend on the public using them. For many people, \u201cit\u2019s not even registering \u2013 they put it in their bins and go about their day-to-day lives\u201d, he said, meaning the City of London only recycles half of the area\u2019s plastic waste. Local authorities also have to deal with a mismatch between waste processing contracts that can last 25 years and prices for recycled plastic that can change daily. Many were affected when China banned imports of post-consumer plastic. There are, however, plans to ease the financial burden of recycling on local councils under the government\u2019s waste strategy, which proposes to charge retailers and producers of packaging the full cost of collecting and recycling. Some companies want to use more recycled plastic in their packaging but are limited by what is available. Julian Hunt, public affairs vice-president of drink bottler Coca-Cola European Partners, said the company currently uses 25% recycled plastic for bottles and will increase this to 50% next year, but a lack of good-quality post-consumer plastic means it will struggle to go higher. The quality of recycled plastic packaging can depend on how it is sorted and what it contained. Numerous countries require consumers to pay a deposit on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) drink bottles, meaning many are returned and can easily be recycled as they are all the same type of material. Scotland is in the process of introducing a similar deposit return scheme and the government is consulting on a UK-wide DRS, which is likely to be implemented. \u201cThe more selective we are on collection, the better quality we get,\u201d said Uwe Bergmann, head of sustainability management at the German adhesives, cosmetics and detergent maker Henkel.

This was unlike the output of mechanical recycling, which is only suitable for a few uses. Chemical recycling is currently expensive, but a new bacteria-based process could make it cheaper: \u201cThere are these emerging technologies, which are really exciting,\u201d Watson added.

      "body": "<p>In recent weeks, all five members of boyband behemoth One Direction \u2013 now nearly four years into their \u201chiatus\u201d \u2013 have released solo singles. Out of those five, only one has so far reached the UK Top 30, with Harry Styles\u2019s Zayn-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/11/harry-styles-lights-up-review-soulful-enigmatic-return\">Lights Up entering at a not-too-disrespectful No 3</a>. For everyone else, it looks like a rapid fall from grace: lovely Niall Horan\u2019s Nice to Meet Ya entered at No 51; Liam Payne\u2019s awkward trap-pop bop Stack It Up started at No 84; while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/25/louis-tomlinson-one-direction-dark-side-gives-me-strength\">Louis Tomlinson</a>\u2019s Kill My Mind failed to chart. As for Zayn, whose 27-track second album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/23/zayn-malik-icarus-falls-review\">Icarus Falls flew in at No 77 last December</a>, he is now relying on collaborations to keep his Spotify plays ticking over. So why has the post-1D bubble burst?</p> <p>In many ways, the band represented the last true cross-generational, all-consuming pop culture moment. They were also a global phenomenon, who arrived when less quantifiable stats \u2013 such as huge YouTube viewing figures and Twitter followers the size of Peru (Niall Horan is currently the band\u2019s most followed with 39.4 million followers) \u2013 started to infiltrate music. </p> <p>However, the old-school idea of millions of latent followers resulting in a Top 10 hit is over. Even Katy Perry\u2019s last single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQEgklEwhSo\">Harleys in Hawaii</a>, peaked at No 45 in this country and she is the second most-followed person on Twitter. This is especially brutal when a group splits. As chart obsessive James Masterton, who runs the Chart Watch UK blog, says: \u201cThe One Direction fandom [was] so notoriously noisy and in so many ways scarily obsessive that people assumed it would automatically carry over to the solo careers.\u201d But once a band implodes the fanbase fractures, meaning, Masterton adds, \u201cYou\u2019re only good for automatic Top 30 hits rather than automatic top fives\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NZvM1918_E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NZvM1918_E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Beyond the industry shifts, perhaps a failure to launch also boils down to each of the boys\u2019 solo identities. Niall has conformed to his role in One Direction: the cute-as-a-button, thick-knit jumper wearer. Cosy initially, but now wearing thin. The most successful member Harry \u2013 AKA the enigmatic \u201crock star\u201d \u2013 has done the same, but made it edgier for a new audience (ie his sweat-ridden Lights Up video). Meanwhile, Louis and Liam have confused their narratives, making it hard for fans to keep up. Louis\u2019s releases have been all over the shop, veering from threadbare EDM (Back to You) to Avril Lavigne-esque punk-pop (Miss You); while Liam, very much the Gary Barlow of 1D, has now restyled himself as an R&amp;B lothario as reimagined by the Lonely Island. As for Zayn, his unwillingness to play the promo game outside of style magazine covers has stunted any real breakthrough.</p> <p>A post-boyband identity crisis is to be expected, but pop is rarely patient. Perhaps the inevitable reunion is on its way. You can hear the hysteria already. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In recent weeks, all five members of boyband behemoth One Direction \u2013 now nearly four years into their \u201chiatus\u201d \u2013 have released solo singles. Out of those five, only one has so far reached the UK Top 30, with Harry Styles\u2019s Zayn-esque Lights Up entering at a not-too-disrespectful No 3. For everyone else, it looks like a rapid fall from grace: lovely Niall Horan\u2019s Nice to Meet Ya entered at No 51; Liam Payne\u2019s awkward trap-pop bop Stack It Up started at No 84; while Louis Tomlinson\u2019s Kill My Mind failed to chart. As for Zayn, whose 27-track second album Icarus Falls flew in at No 77 last December, he is now relying on collaborations to keep his Spotify plays ticking over. So why has the post-1D bubble burst? In many ways, the band represented the last true cross-generational, all-consuming pop culture moment. They were also a global phenomenon, who arrived when less quantifiable stats \u2013 such as huge YouTube viewing figures and Twitter followers the size of Peru (Niall Horan is currently the band\u2019s most followed with 39.4 million followers) \u2013 started to infiltrate music. However, the old-school idea of millions of latent followers resulting in a Top 10 hit is over. Even Katy Perry\u2019s last single, Harleys in Hawaii, peaked at No 45 in this country and she is the second most-followed person on Twitter. This is especially brutal when a group splits. As chart obsessive James Masterton, who runs the Chart Watch UK blog, says: \u201cThe One Direction fandom [was] so notoriously noisy and in so many ways scarily obsessive that people assumed it would automatically carry over to the solo careers.\u201d But once a band implodes the fanbase fractures, meaning, Masterton adds, \u201cYou\u2019re only good for automatic Top 30 hits rather than automatic top fives\u201d. Beyond the industry shifts, perhaps a failure to launch also boils down to each of the boys\u2019 solo identities. Niall has conformed to his role in One Direction: the cute-as-a-button, thick-knit jumper wearer. Cosy initially, but now wearing thin. The most successful member Harry \u2013 AKA the enigmatic \u201crock star\u201d \u2013 has done the same, but made it edgier for a new audience (ie his sweat-ridden Lights Up video). Meanwhile, Louis and Liam have confused their narratives, making it hard for fans to keep up. Louis\u2019s releases have been all over the shop, veering from threadbare EDM (Back to You) to Avril Lavigne-esque punk-pop (Miss You); while Liam, very much the Gary Barlow of 1D, has now restyled himself as an R&amp;B lothario as reimagined by the Lonely Island. As for Zayn, his unwillingness to play the promo game outside of style magazine covers has stunted any real breakthrough. A post-boyband identity crisis is to be expected, but pop is rarely patient. Perhaps the inevitable reunion is on its way. You can hear the hysteria already.",

Music can tell facts of our humanity that may seem imprecise, but are actually as precise as it\u2019s possible to be because they can only be what they are. This of course is old wisdom, but old never means it\u2019s less.<br><br>The teaching and sharing of music is important because, put simply, music is important. Before it was notated, codified, refined, studied and given names, it was a gift from the depth of one person\u2019s soul to another, or the capturing of a moment\u2019s emotion, or a lifetime\u2019s devotion to a god, or simply improvised expression and a means of communication.<br><br>It is the art of all the things we can\u2019t see or touch. It is feelings and thoughts, offerings of generosity, vulnerability and openness. It addresses us, communicates and passes invisible things from people creating sound to people receiving sound. It has the power to capture us, to make us feel many complex things. It can lift us high into optimism and accompany us during feelings of hurt and pain. The making of music can be described as healing, invigorating, exhausting and all-consuming. It brings millions together through the basic act of listening and thousands together through the act of making melody, rhythm and harmony in the practice and service of collective expression.<br><br>So what about education? My duo partner <a href=\"http://grynyuk.com/\">Alexei Grynyuk</a> studied in Kyiv with a strict teacher who was the ultimate authority \u2013 what she said was how it was going to go. He then came to study at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/royalacademyofmusic\">Royal Academy [of Music]</a> and was shocked to discover there could be dialogue in learning, and that he could determine the answers to questions himself. Watching Alexei teach now is basically an entire series of questions.

French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas said that teaching is the presence of infinity breaking the closed circle of totality. In other words, through education, are we trying to open windows into worlds you would never dream of yourself? Interacting with, and ultimately embracing, the \u201cother\u201d or that which is radically different to you.<br><br>Is education preparing us to become units of production taking up our place in the workforce? Or is education simply, as we often experience now, a process of giving systematic instruction? The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Arnold\">Matthew Arnold</a> notion of passing on the best of what\u2019s been thought and written in our culture.<br><br>Music and education can be a tricky combination. Music, so unquantifiable and very difficult to test. So reliant on creativity, individuality, freedom and expression, and the untidy messiness of life. Education is so often experienced as something more structured, controlled and systematic.</p> <p>We are all accustomed to hearing that music teaches empathy, coordination, concentration, cooperation, how to listen while expressing something, how to express ourselves more confidently, how to be definitive while staying flexible, how to communicate and relate. We hear that it improves confidence and personal satisfaction, it boosts all-round academic attainment and lifts morale, our physical and spiritual wellbeing are affected, our sense of achievement and ownership over something is nurtured.</p> <p>We hear about the opening up of our creativity \u2013 creativity in problem-solving, in thought, in how to make it through a day that bit better or that bit more easily \u2013 it addresses the releasing of blocked channels in our minds and our hearts, our ability to trust and stay resilient and positive, even when things don\u2019t go our way, even when nothing goes our way. We know it can also give us early exposure to the idea of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d, in our attempt to make it through a difficult piece in front of our friends and teachers (and keep a straight face when something goes wrong), or in how to set up the hall, and try to make sure the Christmas concert lasts two hours instead of four!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have learnt more about the pieces I\u2019m playing from critiques of sp,e four-year-olds than from years studying with learned professors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Learning an instrument demands learning how to practise. Practice itself can teach us uncommon discipline, persistence and patience. We know that caring for our instrument teaches us responsibility. That technical work and accuracy, playing in tune, coming in on time, paying attention to accents, dots, crescendos and sound production \u2013 all while trying to express something collectively \u2013 teaches us loud and clear about balancing opposites and staying afloat.</p> <p>Music can teach us about meaning. Music fires the imagination in young minds. On some occasions, I have learnt more about the pieces I\u2019m playing from critiques of four-year-olds than from years of studying with learned professors.</p> <p>Music\u2019s power is born out of its social practice and the art of creation and interaction. It is conversation.</p> <p>Music teaches us about our connections to the thoughts, feelings and voices of those from other countries and eras. It puts us in the mind and space of those who seem to experience lives very far from our own. It allows us to strip away all that separates us and urges us to see and feel what unites us. Ultimately our biggest challenge on this planet is to understand, empathise and elevate one another in pursuit of our common humanity. There is no greater challenge or reward.</p> <p>\u2022This is an edited extract from a speech <a href=\"https://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/whats_on/nicola-benedetti-1\">Nicola Benedetti gave to the Royal Philharmonic Society on 5 November</a>.

Before it was notated, codified, refined, studied and given names, it was a gift from the depth of one person\u2019s soul to another, or the capturing of a moment\u2019s emotion, or a lifetime\u2019s devotion to a god, or simply improvised expression and a means of communication. It is the art of all the things we can\u2019t see or touch. It is feelings and thoughts, offerings of generosity, vulnerability and openness. It addresses us, communicates and passes invisible things from people creating sound to people receiving sound. It has the power to capture us, to make us feel many complex things. It can lift us high into optimism and accompany us during feelings of hurt and pain. The making of music can be described as healing, invigorating, exhausting and all-consuming. It brings millions together through the basic act of listening and thousands together through the act of making melody, rhythm and harmony in the practice and service of collective expression. So what about education? My duo partner Alexei Grynyuk studied in Kyiv with a strict teacher who was the ultimate authority \u2013 what she said was how it was going to go. He then came to study at the Royal Academy [of Music] and was shocked to discover there could be dialogue in learning, and that he could determine the answers to questions himself. Watching Alexei teach now is basically an entire series of questions. He is uninterested in forcing an idea on a student, unless that idea is that they must think for themselves. For Socrates, the role of a teacher was akin to that of a midwife, implying that you have something within you that only requires bringing forth. French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas said that teaching is the presence of infinity breaking the closed circle of totality. In other words, through education, are we trying to open windows into worlds you would never dream of yourself? Interacting with, and ultimately embracing, the \u201cother\u201d or that which is radically different to you. Is education preparing us to become units of production taking up our place in the workforce? Or is education simply, as we often experience now, a process of giving systematic instruction? The Matthew Arnold notion of passing on the best of what\u2019s been thought and written in our culture. Music and education can be a tricky combination. Music, so unquantifiable and very difficult to test. So reliant on creativity, individuality, freedom and expression, and the untidy messiness of life. Education is so often experienced as something more structured, controlled and systematic. We are all accustomed to hearing that music teaches empathy, coordination, concentration, cooperation, how to listen while expressing something, how to express ourselves more confidently, how to be definitive while staying flexible, how to communicate and relate. We hear that it improves confidence and personal satisfaction, it boosts all-round academic attainment and lifts morale, our physical and spiritual wellbeing are affected, our sense of achievement and ownership over something is nurtured. We hear about the opening up of our creativity \u2013 creativity in problem-solving, in thought, in how to make it through a day that bit better or that bit more easily \u2013 it addresses the releasing of blocked channels in our minds and our hearts, our ability to trust and stay resilient and positive, even when things don\u2019t go our way, even when nothing goes our way. We know it can also give us early exposure to the idea of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d, in our attempt to make it through a difficult piece in front of our friends and teachers (and keep a straight face when something goes wrong), or in how to set up the hall, and try to make sure the Christmas concert lasts two hours instead of four! Learning an instrument demands learning how to practise. Practice itself can teach us uncommon discipline, persistence and patience. We know that caring for our instrument teaches us responsibility. That technical work and accuracy, playing in tune, coming in on time, paying attention to accents, dots, crescendos and sound production \u2013 all while trying to express something collectively \u2013 teaches us loud and clear about balancing opposites and staying afloat. Music can teach us about meaning. Music fires the imagination in young minds. On some occasions, I have learnt more about the pieces I\u2019m playing from critiques of four-year-olds than from years of studying with learned professors. Music\u2019s power is born out of its social practice and the art of creation and interaction. It is conversation. Music teaches us about our connections to the thoughts, feelings and voices of those from other countries and eras. It puts us in the mind and space of those who seem to experience lives very far from our own. It allows us to strip away all that separates us and urges us to see and feel what unites us. Ultimately our biggest challenge on this planet is to understand, empathise and elevate one another in pursuit of our common humanity. There is no greater challenge or reward. \u2022This is an edited extract from a speech Nicola Benedetti gave to the Royal Philharmonic Society on 5 November. Watch her full speech here.",

But in our view this should be set within the context of the broader trend of strong growth. Billionaire wealth dropped 4.3% globally, after five years when it grew by 34.5%. As the centre of economic activity shifts towards Asia, the region\u2019s entrepreneurs are playing a strong role. There will be many more winners and losers in the years to come.\u201d However, Chinese billionaires suffered the biggest losses, with their collective net worth decreasing by 12.8% because of falling stock markets, a weaker local currency, and growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy in 2018 slowing to its lowest level in nearly three decades. The number of billionaires in China fell by 39 to 436. \u201cIn fact, 103 [Chinese] people\u2019s wealth dipped below a billion dollars, while 56 made the threshold,\u201d the report said. It added that the US tech industry, which is going through another prolonged investment boom, had created a new wave of billionaires. \u201cOnly the Americas bucked the trend, lifted by the fortunes of US tech entrepreneurs \u2013 there were 89 US tech billionaires at the end of 2018, up from 70 in 2017.\u201d The report did not detail the number of billionaires in the UK, but across western Europe there were 17 fewer billionaires than in 2017 and their collective wealth fell by 18% to $1.7tn. Sir Philip Green, the Topshop tycoon, lost his billionaire status last year according to the Sunday Times rich list which said his fortune had halved in 2018 due to the declining value of his Arcadia fashion business. When the Guardian caught up with him earlier this year in the tax haven of Monaco Green declined to comment on the size of his fortune, which is thought to have fallen from \u00a34.9bn in 2007 to around \u00a3950m.",

      "bodyText": "A Labour parliamentary candidate has withdrawn from standing in the general election following accusations that he used the insulting term \u201cShylock\u201d at a meeting where a Jewish councillor was present. Gideon Bull, a councillor from the London borough of Haringey, was supposed to be the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate in the Essex seaside town of Clacton in December. He has withdrawn from standing for the seat after referring to the Shakespearean Jewish moneylender at a meeting in July that included a Jewish Labour councillor. He denies any intention to insult but has apologised for making the remark. All candidates have until Thursday at 4pm to register for the election on 12 December, according to the Electoral Commission. Party officials are struggling to check the backgrounds, social media histories and credentials of dozens of potential candidates. Labour is investigating a complaint from Bull\u2019s fellow councillor, the deputy council leader, Zena Brabazon. The Shylock character is best known for lending money to a rival in The Merchant of Venice on the condition that if it was not repaid, Shylock would take a pound of the rival\u2019s flesh. The alleged antisemitic incident occurred at a meeting of cabinet members in July at which plans for the redevelopment of council-owned land in south Tottenham, known as the Red House scheme, were discussed. Bull told the Guardian he made the comment in a clumsy attempt to describe a person who relentlessly tries to get what they want. \u201cI\u2019m standing down because I don\u2019t want anything to deflect from the fact that Clacton has had years of neglect under the Tories. It was an honest mistake. The fact that there was a Jewish councillor in the room had no bearing on me saying it.\u201d Bull claims he did not realise the character from The Merchant of Venice was Jewish and said he would have known if his schooling had been better. \u201cI grew up in a working class area in Ilford where this was a common saying, but I didn\u2019t know it was offensive. This was a genuine accident and I reiterate my sincere apology for this mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the education system had been better under Margaret Thatcher, I might have known.\u201d In March 2018, Brabazon was among several Jewish Labour members in Haringey who signed a letter to the Guardian from the organisation Jewish Voice for Labour, which argued against the view that Haringey Labour is not a safe space for Jews. The letter said that \u201cnothing could be further from the truth\u201d, and that although antisemitic comments were made in the Labour party and should be stopped, \u201cthis is no different nor more frequent than in wider society\u201d. She has been approached for comment. Another Labour candidate stood down on Thursday after being investigated for a blogpost that compared Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. Kate Ramsden, who had been standing for Gordon, in Aberdeenshire, withdrew for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d after Labour asked her to re-interview and said she could face a disciplinary process. In the blogpost, reported by the Jewish Chronicle, she said: \u201cTo me, the Israeli state is like an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.\u201d The Brexit party is being urged to dump a candidate over his involvement with a Luftwaffe-themed band. Graham Cushway is standing in Brighton Kemptown but he has been criticised for being a member of the heavy metal band Stuka Squadron. Named after the infamous second world war fighter plane, the band perform as \u201cvampire Luftwaffe pilots\u201d dressed in leather trenchcoats and wearing caps used by the German airforce unit. Cushway defended his involvement as a piece of \u201ccomedic performance art\u201d with no rightwing or extremist links when confronted by PoliticsHome. \u201cIt is entirely true that I performed in the art-house heavy metal band Stuka Squadron, which involved a complex back-story in which we were vampires who were also Luftwaffe pilots,\u201d he said. The development came as one of Labour\u2019s most prominent Jewish MPs, Margaret Hodge, declined to say whether she would prefer Corbyn or Boris Johnson as prime minister. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether she would prefer Corbyn or Johnson as prime minister, she replied: \u201cI want a Labour government.\u201d Pressed on the issue, she said: \u201cI think any government is more than any individual.

      "body": "<p>It was 4.30am on a dark September morning and I was suddenly awake. I knew straight away that something was wrong.</p> <p>The house was quiet and I could hear the steady breathing of my wife in bed beside me, but I was feeling extremely strange. My pulse was pounding fast, I felt hot and cold all over, my skin was prickling and I was sweating like a runner.</p> <p>I swung my legs over the edge of the bed. I don\u2019t express emotion on the whole, but tears began running down my nose, mingling with the rivulets of sweat. I drank some water. All at once something very bad happened: I was overtaken by the alarming conviction that I was about to die. The sensation was real and frightening. This was it.</p> <p>I shook my wife\u2019s arm. \u201cWake up!\u201d I gasped. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with me. Something\u2019s seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>She woke up and listened to me calmly. My wife is a positive, cheerful person, unlike me. I am cool, precise, ironic, a watcher in the shadows, prone to low moods and restlessness. She considered me for a moment. Then she said, matter-of-factly: \u201cYou\u2019re having a panic attack.\u201d</p> <p>The attack seemed to come out of the blue, yet there had long been signs that something was wrong. For a while I had been waking in the middle of the night, lying there, staring at the ceiling, turning things over. From a golden sunset to a good meal, I found life unrewarding. My hobbies had lapsed: typography, sleight-of-hand magic, and British road signage had been the focus of my interest for a long time, but now they disgusted me a bit. Family friends found me hard work. During one pub lunch, after I\u2019d wolfed down a sandwich while they laughed and chatted over their roast beef one of them asked me sharply, \u201cWhy do you never savour a meal?\u201d My aloof social disposition was damaging friendships. People have told me that when I think I am smiling, I\u2019m actually frowning. I was astonished recently when somebody showed me photographs of myself at a wedding. Everyone around me was smiling beautifully. I looked positively unpleasant.</p> <p>Yet I was happily married, I was fairly healthy, and some of my books had been bestsellers around the world. So why the constant knot in my stomach? In the morning I rolled up to see my GP. She asked me how I was.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel right: sort of \u2018empty\u2019. I\u2019m finding social situations increasingly hard.\u201d</p> <p>After examining me she nodded decisively. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything physically wrong. But you do seem remarkably tense. Are you an anxious person, would you say?\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t really ever thought of myself as anxious, but maybe it would explain the constant tightness in my chest, the pacing up and down, my suppressed rage at a friend\u2019s one-minute-late arrival for lunch.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I could be described as anxious, yes,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you anxious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeing alive in the world.\u201d I got a genuine laugh in response.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At one party I said something so badly wrong that the hostess burst into tears. \u201cGet him out of my house!\u201d she cried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My GP explained that we\u2019d leave antidepressants until we\u2019d tried a few sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy. It didn\u2019t do much for me, but in my last session the light finally came on when my therapist said: \u201cI think something else might be going on here, Tom.\u201d</p> <p>I braced myself. \u201cYou say you find social situations \u2018taxing\u2019: you\u2019ve taught yourself how to fit in but you feel as if you are always pretending \u2013 people find you aloof; you dress oddly; and you have a special interest in road signs \u2013 in one session you talked at some length about the London tube map.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a diagram, really, not a map,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cThere! You\u2019re a details man and a rules man: definitions, commas, errors, corrections - <em>didactic interruptions</em>. Now taken together I think all this might be pointing to something. I think you might be on the autism spectrum \u2013 Asperger syndrome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with people who have Asperger\u2019s and I\u2019ve read about it. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d</p> <p>The therapist drew a line. \u201cThe people you\u2019ve met might be down here on the spectrum. At the further end. And you might be up here. A bit harder to spot. Have a think about it, Tom. Go away and read about it and come back and tell me what you think next time.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve always known there was something different about the way I relate to the world. I seem to experience things more intensely than other people. I have trouble with noises and smells. I get sensory overload in supermarkets: the flickering lights, all those people, all that racket, the turmoil of all those shelves, all those labels, all those smells, all that advertising.</p> <p>But worse were the social troubles. Chatting I found impossible and for as long as I could recall, parties had been a special kind of torture, provoking silent dread days ahead. I vividly remember my own seventh birthday party watching the other children playing games and having fun while I stood uncomprehending and resentful at the edge, an invisible force field somehow separating me from them.</p> <p>Many years later when I was studying art at university, bohemian parties were frequent. I would force myself to go but usually ended up alone, looking through bookshelves or staring into my glass. I always seemed to say the wrong thing and people found me brusque, abrupt, or stupefyingly rude. At one party I said something so badly wrong that the hostess burst into tears. \u201cGet him out of my house!\u201d she cried, and within seconds I was on the doorstep, coat in hand. I was obliged to walk three miles in the rain back to my digs.</p> <p>I am sometimes accused of being overly critical. I often have to button my lip at somebody\u2019s slipshod cooking or a language error in a wedding invitation. There is no good to be had from pointing out these things. I have had to learn that people do not want you constantly criticising them and underlining their weaknesses. A woman once told me, \u201cYou spoil <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been good at other things. From an early age I\u2019d had a bent for the geometry and mechanics of language. I enjoyed the pernickety details of style, and found etymology rewarding. I saw linguistic communication as an engineering job and had a knack for identifying the crucial architecture of a sentence, just as an engineer might pick out the vital members of an iron bridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37cc5b2676e400b8e0bdee93d9baabc7b9002a36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37cc5b2676e400b8e0bdee93d9baabc7b9002a36/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Professor Uta Frith says that Sherlock Holmes acts like someone with Asperger syndrome\u2019 ... Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Hartswood Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I read up on Asperger\u2019s, I discovered that one of its main features is the drive to look uncommonly deeply into preferred subjects, often mechanical or systemisable ones. It might be bus timetables, the human body, entomology, etymology, Dewey numbers, tornadoes, car engines, flags, films, fairground rides or any of a thousand other quirky subjects. One of my special interests is Sherlock Holmes. Oddly enough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/24/uta-frith-autism-neuroscience-rational\">in her 1989 book, Autism: Explaining the Enigma</a>, Professor Uta Frith says that Holmes acts like someone with Asperger syndrome; his absent-mindedness in relation to other people and his single-mindedness about special ideas are, she says, classic traits. Holmes is an expert in practical chemistry, as well as an authority on newspaper typography, cigarette ash, the sonnets of Petrarch, secret writing, bicycle tyres, music and the varieties of London mud.</p> <p>Engineering and music crop up often in autistic families, and literature, too, is a rich field. Though one cannot diagnose a dead person, the signs of autistic traits among some eminent writers are there. WH Auden displayed plenty of features of the condition. He had a gawky gait, collected hats, dressed strangely \u2013 wearing carpet slippers in public \u2013 spoke in a rather monotonous voice, and displayed a marked lack of eye contact. He had another quirky trait: he liked to sleep beneath weighty blankets, and once went to bed underneath a rolled stair carpet; another time under a heavy oil painting.</p> <p>Another language engineer was Philip Larkin. An unsociable man, he had interests in ties, crime fiction and Beatrix Potter. A great collector of souvenirs, and particular about their placement, Larkin was, tellingly, a librarian. His secretary at Hull University said that when the library was being built he used to come in every Saturday, dressed in a weird combination of, say, a pink jumper and yellow socks, to photograph the progress of the girders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e32ef24961acfcb7f120255f080cad434ecda09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e32ef24961acfcb7f120255f080cad434ecda09/380_307_9485_5694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Larkin, 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ties, crime fiction and Beatrix Potter \u2026 Philip Larkin in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I too have a fascination for civil engineering projects. Among my other special interests are vehicle numberplate typography, the shapes disguised as letters used on eye-test charts, and above all British road sign design. As a boy I fell in love with typography: a world governed by system, formality, detail and rules. After all, the full stop at the end of this sentence is not just a dot; it was drawn on a grid by someone. I find full stops easier to get on with than people.</p> <p>Asperger\u2019s was a richer and more varied condition than I\u2019d thought. And if the therapist was right, it would have been affecting me my entire life, souring my relationships; getting me into scrapes; winding my spring. I decided I had to get a proper diagnosis.</p> <p>I contacted Sarah Hendrickx, an expert in autism. Maybe she could shed light on my trouble understanding other people and getting on with them. After various questionnaires and hours of cross-examining me, she told me plainly: \u201cI think you have Asperger syndrome.\u201d</p> <p>More formally, my \u201cAutism Spectrum Assessment\u201d said this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tom is a concrete thinker, with difficulties in reading people and social signals, which results in social awkwardness and difficulties in understanding the emotional perspectives of others.

      "bodyText": "It was 4.30am on a dark September morning and I was suddenly awake. I knew straight away that something was wrong. The house was quiet and I could hear the steady breathing of my wife in bed beside me, but I was feeling extremely strange. My pulse was pounding fast, I felt hot and cold all over, my skin was prickling and I was sweating like a runner. I swung my legs over the edge of the bed. I don\u2019t express emotion on the whole, but tears began running down my nose, mingling with the rivulets of sweat. I drank some water. All at once something very bad happened: I was overtaken by the alarming conviction that I was about to die. The sensation was real and frightening. This was it. I shook my wife\u2019s arm. \u201cWake up!\u201d I gasped. \u201cI think there\u2019s something wrong with me. Something\u2019s seriously wrong.\u201d She woke up and listened to me calmly. My wife is a positive, cheerful person, unlike me. I am cool, precise, ironic, a watcher in the shadows, prone to low moods and restlessness. She considered me for a moment. Then she said, matter-of-factly: \u201cYou\u2019re having a panic attack.\u201d The attack seemed to come out of the blue, yet there had long been signs that something was wrong. For a while I had been waking in the middle of the night, lying there, staring at the ceiling, turning things over. From a golden sunset to a good meal, I found life unrewarding. My hobbies had lapsed: typography, sleight-of-hand magic, and British road signage had been the focus of my interest for a long time, but now they disgusted me a bit. Family friends found me hard work. During one pub lunch, after I\u2019d wolfed down a sandwich while they laughed and chatted over their roast beef one of them asked me sharply, \u201cWhy do you never savour a meal?\u201d My aloof social disposition was damaging friendships. People have told me that when I think I am smiling, I\u2019m actually frowning. I was astonished recently when somebody showed me photographs of myself at a wedding. Everyone around me was smiling beautifully. I looked positively unpleasant. Yet I was happily married, I was fairly healthy, and some of my books had been bestsellers around the world. So why the constant knot in my stomach? In the morning I rolled up to see my GP. She asked me how I was. \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel right: sort of \u2018empty\u2019. I\u2019m finding social situations increasingly hard.\u201d After examining me she nodded decisively. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything physically wrong. But you do seem remarkably tense. Are you an anxious person, would you say?\u201d I hadn\u2019t really ever thought of myself as anxious, but maybe it would explain the constant tightness in my chest, the pacing up and down, my suppressed rage at a friend\u2019s one-minute-late arrival for lunch. \u201cI suppose I could be described as anxious, yes,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat makes you anxious?\u201d \u201cBeing alive in the world.\u201d I got a genuine laugh in response. My GP explained that we\u2019d leave antidepressants until we\u2019d tried a few sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy. It didn\u2019t do much for me, but in my last session the light finally came on when my therapist said: \u201cI think something else might be going on here, Tom.\u201d I braced myself. \u201cYou say you find social situations \u2018taxing\u2019: you\u2019ve taught yourself how to fit in but you feel as if you are always pretending \u2013 people find you aloof; you dress oddly; and you have a special interest in road signs \u2013 in one session you talked at some length about the London tube map.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a diagram, really, not a map,\u201d I said. \u201cThere! You\u2019re a details man and a rules man: definitions, commas, errors, corrections - didactic interruptions. Now taken together I think all this might be pointing to something. I think you might be on the autism spectrum \u2013 Asperger syndrome.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I insisted, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with people who have Asperger\u2019s and I\u2019ve read about it. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d The therapist drew a line. \u201cThe people you\u2019ve met might be down here on the spectrum. At the further end. And you might be up here. A bit harder to spot. Have a think about it, Tom. Go away and read about it and come back and tell me what you think next time.\u201d I\u2019ve always known there was something different about the way I relate to the world. I seem to experience things more intensely than other people. I have trouble with noises and smells. I get sensory overload in supermarkets: the flickering lights, all those people, all that racket, the turmoil of all those shelves, all those labels, all those smells, all that advertising. But worse were the social troubles. Chatting I found impossible and for as long as I could recall, parties had been a special kind of torture, provoking silent dread days ahead. I vividly remember my own seventh birthday party watching the other children playing games and having fun while I stood uncomprehending and resentful at the edge, an invisible force field somehow separating me from them. Many years later when I was studying art at university, bohemian parties were frequent. I would force myself to go but usually ended up alone, looking through bookshelves or staring into my glass. I always seemed to say the wrong thing and people found me brusque, abrupt, or stupefyingly rude. At one party I said something so badly wrong that the hostess burst into tears. \u201cGet him out of my house!\u201d she cried, and within seconds I was on the doorstep, coat in hand. I was obliged to walk three miles in the rain back to my digs. I am sometimes accused of being overly critical. I often have to button my lip at somebody\u2019s slipshod cooking or a language error in a wedding invitation. There is no good to be had from pointing out these things. I have had to learn that people do not want you constantly criticising them and underlining their weaknesses. A woman once told me, \u201cYou spoil everything.\u201d I\u2019ve always been good at other things. From an early age I\u2019d had a bent for the geometry and mechanics of language. I enjoyed the pernickety details of style, and found etymology rewarding. I saw linguistic communication as an engineering job and had a knack for identifying the crucial architecture of a sentence, just as an engineer might pick out the vital members of an iron bridge. As I read up on Asperger\u2019s, I discovered that one of its main features is the drive to look uncommonly deeply into preferred subjects, often mechanical or systemisable ones. It might be bus timetables, the human body, entomology, etymology, Dewey numbers, tornadoes, car engines, flags, films, fairground rides or any of a thousand other quirky subjects. One of my special interests is Sherlock Holmes. Oddly enough, in her 1989 book, Autism: Explaining the Enigma, Professor Uta Frith says that Holmes acts like someone with Asperger syndrome; his absent-mindedness in relation to other people and his single-mindedness about special ideas are, she says, classic traits. Holmes is an expert in practical chemistry, as well as an authority on newspaper typography, cigarette ash, the sonnets of Petrarch, secret writing, bicycle tyres, music and the varieties of London mud. Engineering and music crop up often in autistic families, and literature, too, is a rich field. Though one cannot diagnose a dead person, the signs of autistic traits among some eminent writers are there. WH Auden displayed plenty of features of the condition. He had a gawky gait, collected hats, dressed strangely \u2013 wearing carpet slippers in public \u2013 spoke in a rather monotonous voice, and displayed a marked lack of eye contact. He had another quirky trait: he liked to sleep beneath weighty blankets, and once went to bed underneath a rolled stair carpet; another time under a heavy oil painting. Another language engineer was Philip Larkin. An unsociable man, he had interests in ties, crime fiction and Beatrix Potter. A great collector of souvenirs, and particular about their placement, Larkin was, tellingly, a librarian. His secretary at Hull University said that when the library was being built he used to come in every Saturday, dressed in a weird combination of, say, a pink jumper and yellow socks, to photograph the progress of the girders. I too have a fascination for civil engineering projects. Among my other special interests are vehicle numberplate typography, the shapes disguised as letters used on eye-test charts, and above all British road sign design. As a boy I fell in love with typography: a world governed by system, formality, detail and rules. After all, the full stop at the end of this sentence is not just a dot; it was drawn on a grid by someone. I find full stops easier to get on with than people. Asperger\u2019s was a richer and more varied condition than I\u2019d thought. And if the therapist was right, it would have been affecting me my entire life, souring my relationships; getting me into scrapes; winding my spring. I decided I had to get a proper diagnosis. I contacted Sarah Hendrickx, an expert in autism. Maybe she could shed light on my trouble understanding other people and getting on with them. After various questionnaires and hours of cross-examining me, she told me plainly: \u201cI think you have Asperger syndrome.\u201d More formally, my \u201cAutism Spectrum Assessment\u201d said this: Tom is a concrete thinker, with difficulties in reading people and social signals, which results in social awkwardness and difficulties in understanding the emotional perspectives of others. He has some lifelong intense interests (including road signs and type). Tom\u2019s experiences of anxiety and depression could be related to this atypical cognitive profile and its impact on a sense of \u201cfitting in\u201d. Asperger syndrome: so that was it. At last, this condition made sense of the non sequitur of my often lonely and overridingly out-of-sync life. I wasn\u2019t, as I\u2019d thought, mad; I wasn\u2019t, as I\u2019d thought, alone. I had unwittingly been autistic my whole life. After my diagnosis, I decided to get some fresh air. I had a lot to think about, but rather than ruminating uselessly I felt a comforting peace descend around me: a novel sensation. My depression, which had been with me for four decades, simply began to evaporate. \u2022 Keep Clear: my adventures with Asperger\u2019s by Tom Cutler is published by Scribe.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>All political parties took a day off from campaigning to meet in the Commons for the election of the new Speaker. AKA a total shambles. In theory the whole process could have been wrapped up inside an hour with a simple preference voting system. Instead it dragged on for more than six. Proceedings opened with Ken Clarke, father of the house, inviting the seven candidates to speak for five minutes. Despite all of them promising to be the very opposite of John Bercow, not least in keeping things brief, at least three managed to talk well beyond their allotted time slot. Old habits die hard. Then came the first round of voting which took over an hour. Twenty minutes for MPs to walk 50 yards to the voting lobby to mark their cross and then well 50 minutes or so for the tellers to count the votes of the 570 MPs who had chosen to participate. Something you\u2019d have thought would have taken five minutes tops. The first round knocked out just two candidates, Meg Hillier and Edward Leigh, who clocked up just 22 votes between them. On and on it went, with an extra 20 minutes needed for every subsequent round of voting to allow time to print new ballot papers because MPs couldn\u2019t be relied on to remember just who was still in the running despite being told moments earlier. To help fill in the down time, Tory MPs got Ken Clarke to sign their order papers, while the Labour frontbench signed footballs and beer bottles. The last round was a straight contest between Lindsay Hoyle and Chris Bryant, which Hoyle won at a canter. Just as everyone had known he would when they first walked into the chamber earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>The Commons was nearly empty for the final day before parliament dissolved. As is traditional, the afternoon was handed over to MPs who are standing down at the election to make their valedictory speeches and was one of the more entertaining sessions of the past two years. Justine Greening got the ball rolling by interrupting Patrick McLoughlin, who was droning on about his time in the whips\u2019 office, to observe: \u201cIn my experience, I always saw the whips\u2019 office as a human resources department, but with the \u2018human\u2019 bit taken out.\u201d Then Ed Vaizey managed to confuse everyone by giving a long speech, during which Kate Hoey intervened to say how sorry she was that he was leaving, only to then insist that he wasn\u2019t actually standing down at hall and had just felt like a bit of a natter. The person he most confused, though, was himself, as the following day he announced he was standing down after all. My favourite speech \u2013 and not just because I got a name check \u2013 my first ever mention in Hansard \u2013 came from Labour\u2019s Steve Pound, one of the funniest and most gentle MPs in the current parliament. \u201cI leave the House with great sadness,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat tipped me over the edge was a message from the Argyle surgery in my constituency, inviting me to attend an end-of-life seminar.\u201d He concluded by saying \u201cQuite clearly, I have achieved very little.\u201d Not true. He was always true to himself and left the Commons a better place than most cabinet ministers. What was most depressing was the realisation that almost all of those standing down were the good men and women from the centre of both main parties. Whatever the result of the next election, parliament will be top heavy with more MPs from the far right and the far left. Politics will be more toxic than ever and the chances of uniting the country virtually nil.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a thought that\u2019s often bothered me. Would Boris Johnson pass a lie detector test? Is he so well trained to lie that he is now incapable of distinguishing between the truth and falsehoods or is there a vestigial trace of conscience that keeps him awake at night? In his Trump-style rally in Birmingham to launch the Tory election campaign \u2013 a few hundred people corralled into the corner of a hall to make it look on TV like the place was rammed, and sharp-suited minders prodding activists to wave their placards at key moments in the speech \u2013 it was far easier to keep track of Johnson\u2019s lies than anything remotely accurate. First he declared he didn\u2019t want the election \u2013 despite having begged parliament for it three times \u2013 and then maintained that MPs had blocked his withdrawal bill despite the fact it had passed its second reading and it had been Johnson himself who had pulled his own legislation. Thereafter, the lies came thick and fast. The only thing the country can trust the prime minister to be is untrustworthy \u2013 and in his 10-minute speech I counted almost 20 barefaced lies. That\u2019s one nearly every 30 seconds. He couldn\u2019t even tell the truth about how long he had been in No 10. Almost certainly none of this matters and Johnson will continue to make the same false statements in every speech he gives and most voters either won\u2019t notice or won\u2019t care. But I have decided that I will continue to call him out for his lies in every sketch I write about him. It will make me feel better even if it achieves little else.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>According to the latest edition of Country Life, I am a \u201ccertified gentleman\u201d. I know this because I manage to tell the difference between Glenda Jackson and Glenfiddich, hold the car door open more often than not, end my relationships face to face rather than by Skype or text \u2013 though to be fair the last time I ended a relationship, neither Skype nor text existed, and it was me who was being told to get lost \u2013 I wear flip-flops rather than loafers in summer and would never dream of owning a chihuahua. I fear there may be some mistake here, because Country Life goes on to list 39 things that the modern gentlemen does with style, most of which are alien to my skillset. I don\u2019t negotiate airports with ease: I\u2019m a hopeless traveller who annoys my family by insisting on turning up hours early. I have several tattoos, which are a big no-no. I don\u2019t have a tweed suit or dinner jacket. I don\u2019t tip the gamekeeper in the field. I don\u2019t sing lustily in church \u2013 partly because I don\u2019t go to church but mainly because I don\u2019t sing lustily anywhere. It\u2019s kinder for everyone that way. I can\u2019t ride a horse, partly because I\u2019ve no interest in learning how but mostly because I\u2019m a bit scared of them. I can\u2019t prepare a one-match bonfire \u2013 unless several gallons of diesel are involved. I can\u2019t tie a bowtie. I could go on, but you get the picture. I would be a total disappointment to every Country Life reader. On the other hand, if you\u2019re after a depressive neurotic with high levels of anxiety and general incompetence then I\u2019m your man.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>Just a week into the campaign and I\u2019m already feeling knackered. Early starts to hear politicians make promises they have no idea they can keep and each party seemingly hellbent on doing its best to lose the election is hard on the psyche. So home has become more than ever a security blanket, a place where I can detoxify myself after the chaos. I can feel myself regressing by the day. In the early evening, we binge on box sets. We were late to Succession \u2013 we\u2019re currently only three-quarters of the way through the first season \u2013 but it is perfect escapism. A family that is somehow both more unpleasant than anything our own politics throws up and yet weirdly also more likeable. It\u2019s hard to imagine just how much more dysfunctional the Roy clan is going to get, but with a brilliant cast and whip-smart scripts, I\u2019m sure they will find a way. I\u2019ve also gone back to Sherlock Holmes, my default comfort reading ever since I was a teenager and was desperate for any escape from the boredom of being me. A recent BBC poll of the 100 Best Books included the Hound of the Baskervilles. I\u2019m not quite sure why, as I\u2019ve found the four long-form Holmes stories tend to drag. The Hound of the Baskervilles was a particular disappointment: having promised so much at the start, Holmes rather fades out of the story for nearly 100 pages and then re-emerges near the end for a slightly \u201cso what?\u201d denouement. Far better are the short stories, which are a more gripping mix of plot and character. One a night will see anyone through the next five weeks.</p> <p><strong>Digested week digested: 34 days and counting</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a77d927a2f587369a15ae5884105a353caf836bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a77d927a2f587369a15ae5884105a353caf836bd/0_0_3500_2489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dog to Queen: \u2018No, you get out of my way\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dog to Queen: \u2018No, you get out of my way\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Pohle/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>John Crace\u2019s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by Guardian Faber.

Would Boris Johnson pass a lie detector test? Is he so well trained to lie that he is now incapable of distinguishing between the truth and falsehoods or is there a vestigial trace of conscience that keeps him awake at night? In his Trump-style rally in Birmingham to launch the Tory election campaign \u2013 a few hundred people corralled into the corner of a hall to make it look on TV like the place was rammed, and sharp-suited minders prodding activists to wave their placards at key moments in the speech \u2013 it was far easier to keep track of Johnson\u2019s lies than anything remotely accurate. First he declared he didn\u2019t want the election \u2013 despite having begged parliament for it three times \u2013 and then maintained that MPs had blocked his withdrawal bill despite the fact it had passed its second reading and it had been Johnson himself who had pulled his own legislation. Thereafter, the lies came thick and fast. The only thing the country can trust the prime minister to be is untrustworthy \u2013 and in his 10-minute speech I counted almost 20 barefaced lies. That\u2019s one nearly every 30 seconds. He couldn\u2019t even tell the truth about how long he had been in No 10. Almost certainly none of this matters and Johnson will continue to make the same false statements in every speech he gives and most voters either won\u2019t notice or won\u2019t care. But I have decided that I will continue to call him out for his lies in every sketch I write about him. It will make me feel better even if it achieves little else. Thursday According to the latest edition of Country Life, I am a \u201ccertified gentleman\u201d. I know this because I manage to tell the difference between Glenda Jackson and Glenfiddich, hold the car door open more often than not, end my relationships face to face rather than by Skype or text \u2013 though to be fair the last time I ended a relationship, neither Skype nor text existed, and it was me who was being told to get lost \u2013 I wear flip-flops rather than loafers in summer and would never dream of owning a chihuahua. I fear there may be some mistake here, because Country Life goes on to list 39 things that the modern gentlemen does with style, most of which are alien to my skillset. I don\u2019t negotiate airports with ease: I\u2019m a hopeless traveller who annoys my family by insisting on turning up hours early. I have several tattoos, which are a big no-no. I don\u2019t have a tweed suit or dinner jacket. I don\u2019t tip the gamekeeper in the field. I don\u2019t sing lustily in church \u2013 partly because I don\u2019t go to church but mainly because I don\u2019t sing lustily anywhere. It\u2019s kinder for everyone that way. I can\u2019t ride a horse, partly because I\u2019ve no interest in learning how but mostly because I\u2019m a bit scared of them. I can\u2019t prepare a one-match bonfire \u2013 unless several gallons of diesel are involved. I can\u2019t tie a bowtie. I could go on, but you get the picture. I would be a total disappointment to every Country Life reader. On the other hand, if you\u2019re after a depressive neurotic with high levels of anxiety and general incompetence then I\u2019m your man. Friday Just a week into the campaign and I\u2019m already feeling knackered. Early starts to hear politicians make promises they have no idea they can keep and each party seemingly hellbent on doing its best to lose the election is hard on the psyche. So home has become more than ever a security blanket, a place where I can detoxify myself after the chaos. I can feel myself regressing by the day. In the early evening, we binge on box sets. We were late to Succession \u2013 we\u2019re currently only three-quarters of the way through the first season \u2013 but it is perfect escapism. A family that is somehow both more unpleasant than anything our own politics throws up and yet weirdly also more likeable. It\u2019s hard to imagine just how much more dysfunctional the Roy clan is going to get, but with a brilliant cast and whip-smart scripts, I\u2019m sure they will find a way. I\u2019ve also gone back to Sherlock Holmes, my default comfort reading ever since I was a teenager and was desperate for any escape from the boredom of being me. A recent BBC poll of the 100 Best Books included the Hound of the Baskervilles. I\u2019m not quite sure why, as I\u2019ve found the four long-form Holmes stories tend to drag. The Hound of the Baskervilles was a particular disappointment: having promised so much at the start, Holmes rather fades out of the story for nearly 100 pages and then re-emerges near the end for a slightly \u201cso what?\u201d denouement. Far better are the short stories, which are a more gripping mix of plot and character. One a night will see anyone through the next five weeks.

Ellie Gould\u2019s family said Thomas Griffiths, now 18, would remain a danger to society and to women in particular.

Time travel has always existed through the agency of the Machines, five mysterious devices situated at various points around the world since the Cambrian era, which allow travellers to make small changes to history that will affect the future. The novel follows Tess in her fight against a misogynist cabal known as the Comstockers, named after the 19th-century US anti-vice moralist Anthony Comstock. The Comstockers are using the Machines to edit history and will stop at nothing to eradicate women of influence, as well as gay and transgender people, in order to build a male-dominated future.

Known for his bestselling fantasy and horror novels \u2013 as well as for film and comic scripts \u2013 Carey doesn\u2019t often venture into the short form, but is adept at bringing fresh twists to the ghost and zombie genres, and excels at combining fantasy, gross-out horror and mystery. In a volume of uniform excellence, stories of note include \u201cThe Sons of Tammany\u201d, featuring Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s detective C Auguste Dupin in a mystery about police corruption in 1870s New York; \u201cTaproot\u201d, a fantasy set in 1930s Istanbul about an American ingenue, her fascist father and their involvement with Nazi spies; and \u201cFace\u201d, a courtroom drama set in a weird fantasy world akin to a grotesque British Raj.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"11c3fdfd2d896772c70e970ff3dada666e543de4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c3fdfd2d896772c70e970ff3dada666e543de4/0_0_325_500/325.jpg\" alt=\"The Pursuit of William Abbey.

The eponymous Abbey is a flawed character who in 1884 ventures to Africa with little more on his mind than sex with Hottentot women. While serving as a doctor in Natal, he witnesses the burning to death of a Zulu boy by a white mob, and does nothing to save the child. He is cursed by the boy\u2019s mother: he will be followed to the ends of the earth by the boy\u2019s shadow and, when it finds him, his loved ones will die. He will also become a \u201ctruth-speaker\u201d, with the ability to see into the hearts and minds of those he meets. Along with other truth-speakers, he\u2019s dragooned by the British to work as a spy. What follows is a tense, historical picaresque as Abbey flees the curse, comes to understand the evils of his paymasters, and seeks his revenge against them. North employs a fascinating supernatural conceit to explore the complicity and guilt of those involved in colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a71b1d4d1e6dc197403a12d593f540fbb5b2d8d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a71b1d4d1e6dc197403a12d593f540fbb5b2d8d6/0_0_656_1000/656.jpg\" alt=\"Mistletoe.

Following the deaths of her husband and son, Leah Hamilton buys a derelict farm in remote Yorkshire \u2013 partly because her husband had wished to renovate the place, partly to keep her busy over a lonely Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Annalee Newitz combines time travel, multi-alternative realities and feminist politics in the fast-paced, complex and mind-bending The Future of Another Timeline (Orbit, \u00a38.99), a follow-up to her well-received 2017 debut Autonomous. Time travel has always existed through the agency of the Machines, five mysterious devices situated at various points around the world since the Cambrian era, which allow travellers to make small changes to history that will affect the future. The novel follows Tess in her fight against a misogynist cabal known as the Comstockers, named after the 19th-century US anti-vice moralist Anthony Comstock. The Comstockers are using the Machines to edit history and will stop at nothing to eradicate women of influence, as well as gay and transgender people, in order to build a male-dominated future. There are echoes of Joanna Russ as Newitz deploys her extensive knowledge of feminism, gender politics and history in a compulsively readable novel of controlled anger that, despite the horror, offers hope. The Complete Short Stories of Mike Carey (PS, \u00a312.99) gathers all his 17 published stories plus one previously unpublished fragment. Known for his bestselling fantasy and horror novels \u2013 as well as for film and comic scripts \u2013 Carey doesn\u2019t often venture into the short form, but is adept at bringing fresh twists to the ghost and zombie genres, and excels at combining fantasy, gross-out horror and mystery. In a volume of uniform excellence, stories of note include \u201cThe Sons of Tammany\u201d, featuring Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s detective C Auguste Dupin in a mystery about police corruption in 1870s New York; \u201cTaproot\u201d, a fantasy set in 1930s Istanbul about an American ingenue, her fascist father and their involvement with Nazi spies; and \u201cFace\u201d, a courtroom drama set in a weird fantasy world akin to a grotesque British Raj. There\u2019s another take on colonialism and its consequences from Claire North in her seventh novel The Pursuit of William Abbey (Orbit, \u00a318.99). The eponymous Abbey is a flawed character who in 1884 ventures to Africa with little more on his mind than sex with Hottentot women. While serving as a doctor in Natal, he witnesses the burning to death of a Zulu boy by a white mob, and does nothing to save the child. He is cursed by the boy\u2019s mother: he will be followed to the ends of the earth by the boy\u2019s shadow and, when it finds him, his loved ones will die. He will also become a \u201ctruth-speaker\u201d, with the ability to see into the hearts and minds of those he meets. Along with other truth-speakers, he\u2019s dragooned by the British to work as a spy. What follows is a tense, historical picaresque as Abbey flees the curse, comes to understand the evils of his paymasters, and seeks his revenge against them. North employs a fascinating supernatural conceit to explore the complicity and guilt of those involved in colonialism. Over the course of half a dozen novels Alison Littlewood has built a reputation for atmospheric, well researched and impeccably observed horror stories. Her seventh, Mistletoe (Jo Fletcher, \u00a314.99), is her best yet. Following the deaths of her husband and son, Leah Hamilton buys a derelict farm in remote Yorkshire \u2013 partly because her husband had wished to renovate the place, partly to keep her busy over a lonely Christmas. In the best tradition of haunted house stories, strange things begin to happen as soon as she moves in: her son\u2019s toys mysteriously appear in the house, along with dolls wrapped in mistletoe; children\u2019s voices echo down the corridors, and snowballs launch themselves at the front door. Then Leah begins to experience visions from the past, and learns that the farm harbours a terrible secret. Mistletoe is a creepy, page-turning triumph enlivened with excellent folkloric details, beautiful descriptions of winter landscapes and sensitive characterisation. Kim Lakin-Smith\u2019s fourth novel Rise (NewCon, \u00a312.99) presents a bleak vision of the world in the year 5059. Two races exist in a super-heated future, where lava flows between impacting tectonic plates and cities are surrounded by inhospitable deserts.

Prep 10 min Cook 15 min Serves 2 1 cup rolled oats (about 85g) Salt 1 cup milk (I use oat) 1 tbsp toasted pumpkin seeds, plus extra for serving 1 large pinch ground cinnamon or ground cardamom For the maple pears 2 pears, cored and 1 tbsp maple syrup, plus extra to serve 1 pinch cinnamon 1 pinch ground cardamom Put the oats in a pan with two cups of water (using the same measure as you used for the oats) and a pinch of salt, and simmer over a low heat for eight to 10 minutes, or until the oats are tender. Stir in the milk, seeds and cinnamon, and warm through. Meanwhile, heat the pears and maple syrup in a separate pan over a medium heat for five minutes until just warmed through, then stir in the spices. Serve the porridge topped with the warm pears, an extra drizzle of maple syrup and a sprinkle of toasted seeds.",

Presenters include Graham Norton and Ade Adepitan along with the England football team, an EastEnders Strictly special and a revival of 70s kids TV staple Crackerjack. Friday 15 November, 7.30pm, BBC One The Cockfields Joe Wilkinson brings girlfriend Diane Morgan to the Isle of Wight to meet the parents in this three-part series. It is a well-trodden format but mum and stepdad Sue Johnston and Bobby Ball are cringe-inducingly funny as they negotiate spare beds for the couple and put on a bad lunch. Sitcom splendour from co-writers Wilkinson and David Earl. Tuesday 12 November, 10pm, Gold The Driver Walter Hill\u2019s masterly 1978 slice of neo-noir, taut and spare and set in a midnight-dark downtown LA, stars Ryan O\u2019Neal as the (getaway) Driver, Bruce Dern as the Detective \u2013 and the one is after the other. The sparse, fractured dialogue adds existential tones to Hill\u2019s revved-up thriller, which powers through a series of brilliantly executed, tyre-shrieking car chases. Saturday 9 November, 9.15pm, Talking Pictures TV I\u2019m With the Band: Nasty Cherry Uncompromising pop star Charli XCX does her best P Diddy in this new series charting her efforts to put together a new four-piece girl group, Nasty Cherry. Like a party-fuelled version of The X Factor, the show follows the group as they live together, record their first single and perform their first chaotic live shows, all under Charli\u2019s benevolent gaze. From Friday 15 November, Netflix",

      "bodyText": "Christina Aguilera is draped across an elaborate golden throne that is rising, tantalisingly slowly, from the belly of the Hydro. Glasgow\u2019s impatient crowd erupts with noise before she\u2019s even visible. A dizzying recap of Aguilera\u2019s 20-year career, the X Tour is her first visit to the UK in well over a decade. Such is her legend that two buskers are competing to cover her classics in the walkway to the arena, pandering to punters who shriek with delight. The X Tour throws together her biggest hits in a series of randomly themed, over-produced acts, with costume changes, unholy guitar solos and video footage punchier than a Marvel fight scene. Presumably adapted from Aguilera\u2019s Vegas residency, this dazzling spectacle feels almost like a one-woman variety show, were it not for the eight dancers, three singers, full band and mountain of glitter. Everything is supersized, but nothing more so than her voice. Aguilera can switch from breezy ad-lib to finger-waving, earpiece-tapping devastation in a split-second. Genuinely jaw-dropping, her vocals are so rich and powerful that she cuts through all the chaos \u2013 of which there is a lot. Seemingly ordered by a Magic 8 Ball, the setlist delivers incredible moments. A fiery, gold-themed one combines Dirrty \u2013 the stickiest, sweatiest dancefloor hit ever written \u2013 with Vanity, a \u201cbadass bitch\u201d mantra from fan-favourite album Bionic, Express, a showgirl extravaganza replete with lots of spanking from the Burlesque soundtrack, and the heart-stopping roar of Lady Marmalade.

The tour, which is ostensibly to promote Aguilera\u2019s 2018 album Liberation, dedicates a full 10 minutes to Sick of Sittin\u2019, a frustrated foot-stomper that flourishes with an arena-rock staging, and Maria, a Kanye West-produced gospel track that turns into a full-band jam session led by Aguilera dressed as the Virgin Mary. But it\u2019s her 2002 album Stripped that hogs the spotlight. The album flipped the good-girl-gone-bad narrative expected of American sweethearts and \u2013 in pleather and motorbike oil \u2013 doubled down on vigorous, visceral emotional and sexual emancipation.

It\u2019s their seventh straight T20 international win and their third consecutive T20 series victory, something they\u2019ve never achieved before. Better yet, Australia haven\u2019t tasted defeat in T20s this year. It started with the ball, and what a pleasure it was to see Abbott back in the side after such a long absence. Iftikhar aside, Pakistan\u2019s batsmen had no answer to Australia\u2019s pressing length that was just short of good. A tally of 106 was never going to be enough, and in the end it wasn\u2019t even close as Finch and Warner picked off the target with ease. Australia look set up nicely for next year\u2019s T20 World Cup, not to mention the upcoming Test series. Thanks for your company.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T11:36:49.974Z\">at 11.36am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc54e888f08be4a102e557d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T11:20:22.116Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia win by 10 wickets with 49 balls remaining</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>11.5 overs: Australia 109-0 (Finch 52, Warner 48)</strong></p> <p>Warner and Finch see it through to the end in a victory that looked likely from the opening moments of the game, Finch ending the game with a boundary off Musa to bring up his fifty.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc54d468f0867dcebfd10e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T11:15:06.163Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>11th over: Australia 100-0 (Finch 45, Warner 47) </strong>A nice bit of variation from Hasnain leaves Warner guessing, but when your luck\u2019s in your luck\u2019s in ... and his waft outside off-stump flies high but safely between the fielders at point.<strong> Australia need another 7 runs to win.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc54c8a8f0867dcebfd10df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-08T11:10:53.782Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>10th over: Australia 94-0 (Finch 42, Warner 45) </strong>Really smart placement from Warner off Musa, splitting mid-on and mid-wicket for yet another boundary.

What do Australia and Spain have in common (besides an agreeable climate, nice beaches and, um, a love of Spanish food)? Both nations are on a six-game winning streak in Twenty20 internationals, Australia arriving there with their win over Pakistan in Canberra - barely days after Spain did a frightful job on Gibraltar to make it a sextet of their own. Tonight in Perth - where these two teams have never met in a such a format - Australia can make it a heavenly seven, though even victory will not be enough to dislodge Pakistan from the No.1 spot in the rankings. Damn that washout in game one. </p> <p>So, this match represents another milepost as Australia roll on towards the 2020 T20 World Cup (I\u2019ll never tire of writing that) and even towards the Test summer, which is on our doorstep. No Pat Cummins tonight with said Test matches on the horizon, but Steve Smith will be there and there\u2019ll be nary a frown in town if he can emulate his deeds with the willow in Canberra. </p> <p>Anyway, looking forward to a good game as much as I am your company.

      "bodyText": "Australia take the series 2-0 in seriously clinical fashion. It\u2019s their seventh straight T20 international win and their third consecutive T20 series victory, something they\u2019ve never achieved before. Better yet, Australia haven\u2019t tasted defeat in T20s this year. It started with the ball, and what a pleasure it was to see Abbott back in the side after such a long absence. Iftikhar aside, Pakistan\u2019s batsmen had no answer to Australia\u2019s pressing length that was just short of good. A tally of 106 was never going to be enough, and in the end it wasn\u2019t even close as Finch and Warner picked off the target with ease. Australia look set up nicely for next year\u2019s T20 World Cup, not to mention the upcoming Test series. Thanks for your company. 11.5 overs: Australia 109-0 (Finch 52, Warner 48) Warner and Finch see it through to the end in a victory that looked likely from the opening moments of the game, Finch ending the game with a boundary off Musa to bring up his fifty. 11th over: Australia 100-0 (Finch 45, Warner 47) A nice bit of variation from Hasnain leaves Warner guessing, but when your luck\u2019s in your luck\u2019s in ... and his waft outside off-stump flies high but safely between the fielders at point. Australia need another 7 runs to win. 10th over: Australia 94-0 (Finch 42, Warner 45) Really smart placement from Warner off Musa, splitting mid-on and mid-wicket for yet another boundary. This has been an imperious, powerful partnership from the opening batsmen. Australia need another 13 runs to win. 9th over: Australia 85-0 (Finch 40, Warner 38) Six! Finch clearly has a dinner date to get to. The leftie rocks back in the crease and pulls Hasnain over deep square for another maximum. Just pure, unbridled power. The end is nigh. 8th over: Australia 75-0 (Finch 33, Warner 37) Imad is brought into the attack but the lack of pace on the ball does nothing to quell these hard-hitting openers. Six! Warner steps into one and brutalises it down the ground for a massive six. Sensational catch in Row K by the gent in the striped t-shirt and sunnies on his noggin. 7th over: Australia 63-0 (Finch 32, Warner 26) Hasnain continues and it\u2019s a much better over from the youngster, but some sharp running between the wickets still brings seven runs from the over. Australia need another 44 runs to win. 6th over: Australia 56-0 (Finch 31, Warner 22) Amir continues but perhaps he\u2019d rather be grazing at third man. Now Warner helps himself to some runs, pouncing on a full-toss and driving straight down the ground for four. Another boundary follows, this time with grace instead of power, caressed backward of square. Way to cash in on the power play. 5th over: Australia 45-0 (Finch 30, Warner 13) Hasnain, another 19-year-old paceman, enters the fray but the Finch show just rolls on. Six! Pure power from the skipper, clearing the square-leg rope with a brutal stand-and-deliver pull shot. This could all be over rather quickly. 4th over: Australia 35-0 (Finch 21, Warner 12) Six! Musa loses his length, sending down a short one to Finch and paying the price as the Aussie captain hooks over deep backward square. Finch then follows up with a four just wide of point. Thirteen off the over. Australia need another 72 runs to win. 3rd over: Australia 22-0 (Finch 9, Warner 11) There\u2019s no hanging around here by Australia, this time Warner meting out punishment with a cracking pulled four off Amir. The paceman looks rocked, losing his radar and sending down two leg-side wides. Does it need to be said that Pakistan need a wicket?! 2nd over: Australia 14-0 (Finch 8, Warner 6) 19-year-old Musa steams in for his first crack at this level. The right-armer bowls with good pace and a slinging action but Finch welcomes him to the international game with a couple of boundaries past point. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Finch 0, Warner 6) Amir takes the new ball for Pakistan, giving Warner plenty of room outside off-stump and inviting the big swing. Warner just gets it over the hands of Hasnain at third man, collecting an early six. Mass confusion between the wickets then should have cost Warner his wicket but Imam misses his shy at the stumps from the covers. An eventful first over! An expert display from Australia\u2019s pace attack, weeding out the top-order threats in the power play before befuddling the middle and lower order with bowling that was short enough to keep Pakistan on the back foot. Abbott (2-14) was great on his return and Richardson (3-18), also. Iftikhar (45 off 37 balls) was the only batsman to even remotely take the game to the hosts. Only Australia\u2019s reply will put this effort in context but Finch\u2019s men are short-priced favourites to win from here. 20th over: Pakistan 106-8 (Amir 9, Hasnain 4) Hardly a late-innings flurry from Pakistan but that\u2019s partly down to sublime seam bowling from Abbott, and Richardson before him. Hasnain and Amir simply can\u2019t get bat on ball. A risible one run from the final over but, disappointingly for Pakistan, fitting given what transpired beforehand. 19th over: Pakistan 105-8 (Amir 8, Hasnain 4) Amir gives himself plenty of room outside off-stump to Richardson but to no avail. Three dot balls are not what Pakistan need right now ... and nor is a fourth, but that is what they get. One run from the over! 18th over: Pakistan 104-8 (Amir 7, Hasnain 4) Starc returns to the attack and, though Finch is clearly going for the kill, Amir does what his predecessors couldn\u2019t ... hit a six, using the full face of the bat, and the pace of the ball, to fly over the keeper\u2019s head and over the rope. They\u2019re dropping like the proverbial flies now, as they do at this stage of the innings, and Shadab is the latest to perish, picking out Finch at mid-on. 17th over: Pakistan 96-8 (Amir o, Hasnain 4) Iftikhar\u2019s nicely crafted dig comes to an end courtesy of another short ball, this time Richardson heaved down to fine-leg where Starc takes another well-judged catch. 16th over: Pakistan 92-6 (Iftikhar 45, Shadab 1) Stanlake traps Iftikhar in two minds with another probing short ball, which the batsman can only prod into the air a metre in front of himself. Good, disciplined bowling from Stanlake, who returns 0-19 from his four overs and was unlucky not to break through. 15th over: Pakistan 89-6 (Iftikhar 43, Shadab 0) Excellent bowling from Abbott and his fellow pacemen. Pakistan have failed to deal with the shorter stuff and now it\u2019s Shadab\u2019s turn to lend Iftikhar a hand. Abbott returns to the attack after his good work earlier in the innings. Imad learns nothing from a mistimed pull early in the over, attempting the same two balls later and picking out Agar, who claims a very tidy sliding catch past mid-wicket. 14th over: Pakistan 86-5 (Iftikhar 41, Imad 5) Imad gets off the mark as the two batsmen in the middle nudge Agar into the gaps for ones and twos. 13th over: Pakistan 79-5 (Iftikhar 39, Imad 0) Pakistan\u2019s hopes now rest with Iftikhar and the right-hander seems happy to meet the challenge head-on, sending Richardson twice to the fence after the loss of Khushdil. The Storm came rather sooner than anticipated, with Khushdil lifting the head and throwing the bat at Richardson. The ball takes forever to return to earth but Starc is equal to the task, pocketing a tough chance in the deep. 12th over: Pakistan 69-4 (Iftikhar 29, Khushdil 8) More nurdling and quick singles from Pakistan sees six taken from Agar\u2019s latest offering. With four men down, this is the calm before the storm as Pakistan endeavour to post a competitive total. 11th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Iftikhar 27, Khushdil 4) Stanlake continues as Pakistan seem content to settle into accumulation mode. Just four from the over but the visitors will take that. It beats the loss of another wicket. 10th over: Pakistan 59-4 (Iftikhar 25, Khushdil 3) Pakistan are back firmly under the cosh following that wicket. What they needed after the blood-letting of the power play was a partnership. What they got what Haris throwing his wicket away. Haris tries to take the game to the Australia spinner but his charge down the wicket is half-hearted at best and he lofts one straight into the waiting hands of Richardson at long-off. 9th over: Pakistan 54-3 (Haris 8, Iftikhar 23) Stanlake continues, over the wicket to the left-handed Haris. The paceman looks to struggle with his line at such an exaggerated angle, conceding a leg-side wide before being picked off for an easy single. Iftikhar then straight-drives one hard onto the boot of Stanlake, an intervention that saves a certain boundary. 8th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Haris 5, Iftikhar 21) Finch keeps Pakistan guessing with the impressive Agar brought into the attack. With the pace now off the ball, Iftikhar works Agar around the wide expanses of Optus Stadium for ones and twos. 7th over: Pakistan 41-3 (Haris 1, Iftikhar 18) Stanlake into the attack and Iftikhar goes for it again, slashing hard outside off-stump to beat Richardson for a boundary past third-man. Pakistan won\u2019t die wondering here after Australia\u2019s damaging work through the power play. 6th over: Pakistan 34-3 (Haris 0, Iftikhar 12) That\u2019s more like it from Pakistan as Iftikhar clobbers the returning Starc for consecutive boundaries. He misses a third that was there for the taking but makes no mistake on the last ball, punching through the covers to make it 12 for the over. 5th over: Pakistan 22-3 (Haris 0, Iftikhar 0) Major issues for Pakistan early in this game. Two dangermen back in the dressing room, two new batsmen at the crease and Australia with their tails in the air. Imam refuses to let the early wickets dampen his resolve to score quickly, but in this instance he dies by the sword as he skies an attempted pull shot off Abbott into the waiting hands on McDermott at mid-wicket. 4th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Imam 10, Haris 0) Richardson into the attack and he does a fine, probing job to keep the over to three runs, beating Imam\u2019s outside edge with the last ball of the over. Masterful pressure bowling from Starc sees Rizwan clean bowled through an inviting gap and the Aussie left-armer on a hat-trick. 3rd over: Pakistan 15-2 (Imam 7, Haris 0) Starc loses his radar, bowling successive led-side wides before he over-corrects and invites the red-hot Babar to crash him through the covers for four. Then two wickets in two balls puts this match on its head. No hat-trick for Starc but no bother. A great over. Starc traps the Pakistan captain on the front pads and the batsman is given out leg before. Babar sends the decision upstairs and the referral seems to take an eternity to be adjudicated, but there is no edge and no line issues. Big wicket for Australia. 2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Babar 2, Imam 7) Great to see Abbott back in Australian colours and with new ball in fist. This man has taken more wickets in this format than most. Both Babar and the bespectacled Imam milk some singles. There\u2019s seam movement and bounce off this pitch. Abbott beats Imam\u2019s edge with an off-cutter before the leftie advances down the pitch for a welcome boundary over mid-on. 1st over: Pakistan 3-0 (Babar 1, Imam 2) And we\u2019re away under clear skies in Perth. Starc has ball in hand and first ball Imam barely feathers an edge through the vacant gully region that flies down to third man. Plenty of bounce in this greenish deck. Starc responds with a ripper of a yorker to Babar. A watchful beginning from the Pakistan opening batsmen. England have just put the finishing touches on a good, old-fashioned demolition job on New Zealand in Napier. Check out Tanya Aldred\u2019s frankly superb blow-by-blow account below. Changes galore from the Canberra match. For the hosts, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa are left out, with Sean Abbott and Billy Stanlake coming in. Pakistan have made four, yes four, changes. Imam Ul Haq, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Hasnain and Muhammad Musa are the new faces, with Khushdil and Musa making their T20 international debuts. Australia: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Steve Smith, Ben McDermott, Ashton Turner, Alex Carey (w), Ashton Agar, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Billy Stanlake. Pakistan: Imam Ul Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (w), Haris Sohail, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Hasnain, Muhammad Musa Aaron Finch says there is enough in the deck, and enough in the history books, to suggest chasing is the way to go on this Perth deck. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam says he would have bowled first, too. I guess you could say it\u2019s first blood to Australia. Moving away ever so marginally from the matter at hand, where do you stand on Australia\u2019s Test captaincy? With Smith well and truly back in the fold, and his leadership ban ending in March, talk will not go away about whether he\u2019s the right man to take over from Tim Paine. Is it, dare I say, inevitable that the former skipper is a future skipper in waiting? Good evening, cricket fans. What do Australia and Spain have in common (besides an agreeable climate, nice beaches and, um, a love of Spanish food)? Both nations are on a six-game winning streak in Twenty20 internationals, Australia arriving there with their win over Pakistan in Canberra - barely days after Spain did a frightful job on Gibraltar to make it a sextet of their own. Tonight in Perth - where these two teams have never met in a such a format - Australia can make it a heavenly seven, though even victory will not be enough to dislodge Pakistan from the No.1 spot in the rankings. Damn that washout in game one. So, this match represents another milepost as Australia roll on towards the 2020 T20 World Cup (I\u2019ll never tire of writing that) and even towards the Test summer, which is on our doorstep. No Pat Cummins tonight with said Test matches on the horizon, but Steve Smith will be there and there\u2019ll be nary a frown in town if he can emulate his deeds with the willow in Canberra. Anyway, looking forward to a good game as much as I am your company. Be more than a spectator by adding a comment below, emailing me or tweeting @scott_heinrich",

A survey of lead councillors for children\u2019s services in England just published by the Local Government Association delivers a devastating assessment of the factors behind massive and rising demand, while the same relentless cuts fuelling it prevent local authorities from providing the care and support that is so badly needed. While much of the debate about council funding has focused on adult social care, the survey reveals that for each of the three years between 2015 and 2018, well over half the councils had to make significant cuts to children\u2019s services. Half of the 152 councils in England responded to the survey, with 47% saying that budget shortfalls last year created a severe or significant risk to children\u2019s social care. Cuts to services such as policing and youth work are aggravating factors, and there are major concerns about what will happen following the end of the current budget for the Troubled Families programme. Against this backdrop of financial atrophy, demand for services is swelling. Around 64% of the lead councillors said the number or complexity of children\u2019s cases had increased \u201cto a great extent\u201d over the past four years.

Two years ago, the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services warned that the relentless cuts were pushing families into crisis, as punitive welfare policies such as the two-child limit and housing benefit cuts \u2013 imposed by politicians with little understanding of the reality of many people\u2019s lives \u2013 took their toll. In 2017/18, more than 75,000 children were in care \u2013 an increase of 24% in a decade. More than 170,000 child in need assessments that year identified domestic abuse is a factor \u2013 a scandalous number and a quarter of the total. Children\u2019s services directors are adamant that welfare reforms are putting more children in danger by pushing more families into poverty. It is sickening to see them report that the Homelessness Reduction Act 2018 has driven up homelessness. As well as exacerbating the conditions that lead to children being harmed, austerity has stripped away vital support to cope with the consequences. To give just one example, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that local authorities in England cut their spending on domestic violence refuges by 24% between 2010 and 2017. Last year\u2019s home affairs select committee report on domestic abuse said the impact on children included mental illness, education difficulties, poor cognitive development and trauma from parental breakup. Children make up around half the residents of women\u2019s refuges, but support for them is often poor. The pattern seen with domestic abuse \u2013 austerity driving up demand and driving down support \u2013 is mirrored in areas such as substance abuse and homelessness. With both Conservatives and Labour promising a post-election spending spree, it is tempting to believe that the dark clouds of austerity will soon lift, but they will not. Even if there is a sudden increase in local government funding for day-to-day services \u2013 and it is far from clear that will happen \u2013 it will take years to rebuild lost capacity such as the hundreds of shuttered Sure Start centres, countless voluntary sector programmes and the loss of experienced staff. Unless there is a surprise in their manifesto, the Conservatives show no sign of recanting on their welfare reforms, and the practical and emotional damage already inflicted on families on the edge will endure for many years whatever the policy changes. Austerity has assailed children from every angle, fracturing their homes and depriving them and their families of help. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2019.

      "body": "<p>When the author Michelle Tea began writing in her early 20s, it was, she says, entirely compulsive. She had come through a series of traumatic experiences including the discovery that her stepfather had drilled a hole in the wall of her bedroom in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in order to spy on her, and what she calls her \u201clesbian feminist nervous breakdown\u201d, a sexual and ideological awakening that she laughs about now but at the time she found \u201coverwhelming\u201d. Ten years later, Tea read an essay in the New Yorker about the Harvard neuroscientist Alice Flaherty\u2019s experiences of hypergraphia following a miscarriage, meaning she was possessed with the need to write her story. \u201cReading this experience of what it felt in her body to have this deep desire to write, and have it be so personal, I was, like: \u2018Yes! That\u2019s what it feels like for me\u2019,\u201d she recalls over coffee and cake in a London cafe.</p> <p>Tea is smartly dressed in orange trousers and a black turtleneck; her countercultural roots are just about detectable in the tattoos that curl around her wrists and hands. She is on the last leg of her UK tour during which she has been reading from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/19/against-memoir-and-other-stories-by-michelle-tea-review\" title=\"\">Against Memoir</a></em>, a typically visceral and defiant collection of essays spanning nearly two decades of work that variously touches on art, music, alcohol addiction, her stint as a sex worker, her family life and adventures in queer culture (she describes herself as pansexual although, she adds, \u201cmy primary attraction is to masculine and gender-queer people and trans men\u201d).</p> <p>Examining the need to record her experiences in the title essay, she writes: \u201cPersonal narrative is a mental illness, but you don\u2019t want to be well.\u201d She tells me how the compulsion to write is similar to the craving to drink: \u201cIn the way that people in the throes of alcoholism tend to be selfish and in pursuit of one thing, memoir writing is a very selfish act. When you get sober, you have to step back and look at the effects that your drinking may have on the people around you. So I did that for a moment [with writing] and there\u2019s wreckage behind me. It\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s always my hope that if I\u2019m writing about somebody they can at least see that what I\u2019m saying is true, but the reality is that truth is subjective.\u201d</p> <p>Tea, who is also the author of the novels <em>Valencia</em> (2000) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/black-wave-michelle-tea-review\" title=\"\">Black Wave </a></em>(2016), and the memoirs <em>Rent Girl</em> (2005), <em>The Chelsea Whistle</em> (2008) and <em>How to Grow Up</em> (2015), says her new book is a collection of essays and articles \u201cthat are scattered around the internet. I\u2019m just used to books and I prefer them.\u201d Alongside new pieces including \u201cHAGS in Your Face\u201d, about the San Francisco lesbian motorcycle gang, and \u201cPolishness\u201d, about heartbreak in a strange city, there are deeply personal paeans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/prince-interview-paisley-park-studios-minneapolis\" title=\"\">Prince</a>, the 1980 film <em>Times Square</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/08/news4\" title=\"\">Valerie Solanas</a>, the author of the Scum Manifesto who shot Andy Warhol in 1968.</p> <p>In \u201cHow to Not Be a Queer Douchebag\u201d, she shares her wisdom about life in the queer community and urges everyone to \u201cstop policing each other ... I have never seen a quadrant of people so ready to tear each other\u2019s faces off as queers.\u201d The book also includes a lengthy and thoughtful dispatch, written in 2003, from the Michigan Womyn\u2019s music festival (MWMF), in which she details the fallout from the festival\u2019s decision to evict a transgender woman from the event in 1991, prompting the creation of a protest camp across the road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465f4d5c1000c5ea198ac12ca338f6d26b2d0208\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465f4d5c1000c5ea198ac12ca338f6d26b2d0208/0_176_3501_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dykes on Bikes at the start of the 38th annual San Francisco Pride parade, 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dykes on Bikes at the start of the 38th annual San Francisco Pride parade, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s striking about this and other essays is how Tea was grappling with themes 15 or so years ago that are widely and often ferociously debated today. \u201cI think right now there\u2019s a critical mass of people talking about this stuff, whether that\u2019s misogyny or queerness or transness,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThe brutal shock of the Trump presidency has made a lot of people feel, like: \u2018Hell no.\u2019 It\u2019s like we didn\u2019t realise how far gone the culture was that this could be allowed. So we have come back with this equally fierce, powerful and brutal response of saying there must be zero tolerance to misogyny, to queer phobia, to transphobia, to racism, to all of the social problems that have always been there.\u201d Tea cites Chavisa Woods\u2019s recent memoir of sexism <em>100 Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/06/paul-takes-form-of-mortal-girl-andrea-lawlor-review\" title=\"\">Andrea Lawlor\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/06/paul-takes-form-of-mortal-girl-andrea-lawlor-review\" title=\"\">Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl</a></em> and Brontez Purnell\u2019s<em> Since I Laid My Burden Down</em> as examples of books that have fearlessly and artfully tackled themes of power and gender relations, misogyny and sexual violence. \u201cRight now, I think the [publishing] industry is responding to what is happening and saying: \u2018Yes we really need these voices, we need these ideas out in the world.\u2019 And I think people are hungry for it. They are hungry for work that affirms their values and offers an alternative to what we are seeing.\u201d</p> <p>Tea\u2019s own expertise as a writer lies in blending broader cultural concerns with raw and vivid snapshots of her own life. Born in 1971, she can\u2019t remember a time when she didn\u2019t feel like a fish out of water. \u201cI saw the world differently from others and the people around me,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe things that excited me and inspired me seemed to be odd to everyone else. I craved a larger life than what I saw.\u201d Music was a lifeline, as evidenced by her essays on the bands<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/apr/21/this-weeks-new-events\" title=\"\"> Gene Loves Jezebel</a> and Minor Threat. \u201cI was a total goth at high school,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBeing able to seek out artists who affirmed my point of view was so important. I knew from music culture that there were people who had figured out how to look how they wanted and say whatever they wanted, and how to be brave and outrageous. These were the people I cared about. I would ask: \u2018What would Siouxsie do?\u2019, rather than \u2018What would my mother do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Books also loomed large \u2013 she was captivated by the social commentary in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/mar/27/review-the-outsider-s-e-hinton\" title=\"\">SE Hinton\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/mar/27/review-the-outsider-s-e-hinton\" title=\"\">The Outsiders</a></em>, and later became obsessed with Sylvia Plath and the Beat writers. Her lightbulb moment came when she was 20 and read the anthology <em>Angry Women</em>, in which writers and performers including bell hooks, Lydia Lunch, Kathy Acker and Diamanda Gal\u00e1s examined feminism and patriarchal power \u2013 \u201cThat really made me see that there is a lineage [of female writers], and a path, and I could really put myself on that.\u201d</p> <p>Tea subconsciously knew that her stepfather had been spying on her, but says for a long time she had been in denial. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to look at even though you\u2019re haunted by it and accruing all this trauma,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThere are all these tricks you have to do with your mind to stay in that denial.\u201d Part of that process involved drinking \u2013 she began in her mid-teens and didn\u2019t stop until she was 32 when she finally sought help.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>'I felt I could be my whole self, which at that point was queer, feminist, punk and working-class'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her stepfather eventually admitted what he had been doing when she was 19, but her mother decided to stay with him. Tea responded by moving out of the family home and in with a girlfriend in Boston. She was working at two minimum-wage jobs at the time \u2013 as a receptionist in a hair salon and making sandwiches at a deli \u2013 and was always broke. Meanwhile, her girlfriend, who was a sex worker, always seemed to have money. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why am I not doing this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI had been with my first boyfriend for years and had had a ton of sex that I didn\u2019t enjoy \u2026 At least here it was very cut and dried. I\u2019m not having to pretend to this person \u2018I love it and everything\u2019s great.\u2019 That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t traumas associated with prostitution, but it was absolutely the best choice for me at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually Tea split up with her girlfriend and moved to San Francisco. It was the early 1990s and, she notes, \u201cThe city was in the throes of a punk, dyke-centric cultural explosion, and I was like: \u2018Woah, are you kidding me? This is incredible.\u201d By this point she was already writing, and tapped into the spoken-word scene, which, she says, \u201cwas very democratic. There were open mics every night. The poetry was self-taught \u2013 punk and hip-hop inspired street poetry. It was perfect for me. I felt I could be my whole self, which at that point was queer, feminist, punk and working-class.\u201d</p> <p>In 1994 she co-founded Sister Spit, a raucous lesbian-feminist spoken word and performance art collective, the aim of which was to give voice to the queer and working-class women who felt they had been excluded by second-wave feminism and who aspired to the life of a touring rock band. \u201cWe were, largely, a group of people who had heard the word \u2018no\u2019 a lot,\u201d she writes in <em>Against Memoir</em>. \u201cNo to being queer, to wanting to be artists, and to thinking anyone would want to listen to our attitudinal manifestos.\u201d</p> <p>Nowadays, Tea lives in Los Angeles, writing books, putting on literary events and looking after her young son, Atticus. In 2013 she married her partner Dashiell Lippman. In the midst of marital bliss, the autobiographical writing has continued to pour forth. One essay in <em>Against Memoir</em> called \u201cHow to Refer to My Husband-Wife\u201d finds Tea pondering the question of what to call \u201cmy totally masculine female partner\u201d. As the officiant uttered the words \u201cI now pronounce you \u2026\u201d at their wedding, she recalls how \u201cthe phrase hung in the air, truncated, and we all waited to see what my love and I were about to become.\u201d</p> <p>Tea tells me that, at readings, people approach her to thank her for writing about her life because it\u2019s made them feel less alone, and validated. By extension, she says, this makes her feel less alone and validated \u201cbecause I come from a family that had and continues to have a lot of denial. When I was younger, part of my writing was to claim my experience and to affirm that it was real and that it happened.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if there is a personal cost to her candour and in returning repeatedly to the more difficult aspects of her life. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she replies. \u201cMy daily life is informed by my past traumas. I don\u2019t dwell on them and neither do I bury them. At this point I think I\u2019m in the space of acceptance about everything. People say that it\u2019s cathartic to write about certain things. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cathartic, but I also don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s opening a wound. I feel like it\u2019s just talking about life.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> Against Memoir </em>is published by And Other Stories (\u00a310).

I don\u2019t dwell on them and neither do I bury them. At this point I think I\u2019m in the space of acceptance about everything. People say that it\u2019s cathartic to write about certain things. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cathartic, but I also don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s opening a wound.

Like a lot of progressives, I can proudly say that I\u2019ve never had a Chick-fil-A sandwich.

There\u2019s been no shortage of online shaming over this conversation, some of it animated by the respectability politics that have black folks taking other black folks to task for feeding stereotypes. Many of the exhaustive media takes on the sandwich wars have been penned by black writers linking the sandwich to black culture, and defending the right to <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-viral-janelle-monae-20190829.html\">enjoy it</a> despite that.</p> <p>This tension has turned the cultural moment into a political one. For many, that included casting Popeyes as the conquering hero and Chick-fil-A as the evil king in need of dethroning. There\u2019s a clear reason for that: Chick-fil-A is a bad company with immoral politics. Boycotting them in favor of Popeyes is a choice I\u2019m happy to make.</p> <p>Chick-fil-A has long supported rightwing politics. It\u2019s best known in progressive circles for opposition to LGBT rights, but like most projects of the right wing, that work is intertwined with anti-blackness and patriarchy. The company has given <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/08/03/meet-the-cathys-your-guide-to-the-billionaires-behind-chick-fil-a/#7aae0c8a33a7\">millions</a> to anti-gay political groups, including the known <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council\">hate group</a> Family Research Council, run by Tony Perkins. According to the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/tony-perkins\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, Perkins has spoken to an avowed white supremacist organization and railed against the growth of Islam in America. When running the Senate campaign of his mentor, Woody Jenkins, he <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/justice-sunday-preachers/\">paid</a> Klan leader David Duke $82,000 for his mailing list, then hid it from election officials. He is one of a group of rightwing, pseudo-Christian advocates who have boosted and defended Donald Trump despite the president\u2019s total lack of Christian morality and flagrant racism.</p> <p>Chick-fil-A\u2019s political record meant many were ready to back Popeyes, which is clearly going after Chick-fil-A\u2019s market share. Their sandwich is remarkably similar, right down to the wrapper. The two companies threw <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/chicken-sandwich-wars-popeyes-and-chick-fil-a-feud-on-twitter-in-bid-to-boost-sales.html\">shade</a> at each other on Twitter. In a new ad last week, Popeyes even <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/business/2019/10/28/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-returns-takes-aim-antigay-chick-fil\">trolled</a> Chick-fil-A\u2019s famous decision to remain closed on Sundays for church.</p> <p>But that last dig is the only reference Popeyes has made to the conservative views of Chick-fil-A\u2019s owners. The company has done very little else to brand itself as a progressive alternative to its rival. It has no history of standing up for racial justice, even though black folks, culture and colloquialisms are prominent in their advertising. In fact, a look at their advertising shows no prominent history of aligning with causes beyond selling chicken, biscuits and sides, which of course is the only thing they care about. That hasn\u2019t stopped many people from placing their support for Popeyes squarely in a political context. The LGBT publication the Advocate titled its <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/business/2019/8/19/popeyes-sandwich-v-chick-fil-more-flavor-less-homophobia\">review</a> of the sandwich \u201cMore Flavor, Less Homophobia\u201d.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a mistake to think that Popeyes, or any corporation, is a part of our movement. Like most fast-food chains, the company is decidedly anti-worker. A <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/08/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-fast-food-workers\">report</a> in Jacobin<em> </em>notes that Popeyes continues to pay its diverse workforce poverty wages, just $8.32 an hour for cooks. Its parent company, Restaurants Brands International, made $5.35bn in revenue in 2018. But when a hard-fought organizing campaign resulted in a higher minimum wage in Ontario in 2016, RBI <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/02/08/tim-hortons-and-the-saga-of-ontarios-minimum-wage\">responded</a> by cutting health benefits and paid breaks at the company\u2019s Tim Hortons franchise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/06/halloween-party-shooting-killed-five-response-airbnb-policy\">After a Halloween party shooting, focus on Airbnb policy draws outrage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The corporation has also come under fire from environmental advocates. Unlike competitors, the company has <a href=\"https://www.sumofus.org/media/consumer-group-representing-shareholders-deliver-massive-petition-demanding-restaurant-brands-international-nyse-qsr-reduce-impacts-of-deforestation/\">not taken steps</a> to reduce its contributions to deforestation through its supply chain, which relies heavily on things like palm oil.</p> <p>Other corporations have tried to trade on wokeness far more explicitly than Popeyes. Nike got praise from many for its 2018 ad featuring Colin Kaepernick, the blacklisted black quarterback frozen out of the NFL for daring to protest against police violence against the black community. At the same time, the company is moving backwards on its accountability on exploited sweatshop labor.

Starbucks made headlines in 2015 with an ill-received campaign that encouraged baristas to talk about race, then made different <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1486260/timeline-crisis-starbucks-racial-bias-training\">headlines</a> in 2018 for calling the police on black patrons who dared to sit in their cafe and do nothing (like everyone else).</p> <p>Corporations use wokeness like they use blackness and everything else: to them it\u2019s a commodity, to be used if it helps turn a profit and discarded if it does not. They make a public display of celebrating Black History Month while they funnel dollars to politicians who dismantle the hard-fought victory of the heroes they pay tribute to. CEOs take selfies with pink breast-cancer-awareness ribbons while they continue to encourage a work culture that denigrates and endangers women. They sponsor elaborate Pride floats and then give money to politicians on the other side of progress for LGBTQ people around the world. Companies like Chick-fil-A which are open about their prejudices are easy to hate. But companies that try to hide their misdeeds behind a veneer of justice are in some ways worse.</p> <p>So where does that leave you and me? We need to eat. We need to buy clothes. Like all people on this earth, we deserve opportunities to have joyful experiences. The demand isn\u2019t that we opt out entirely from the economy.

I\u2019m not saying choosing Popeyes is a poor choice, but we shouldn\u2019t overstate its impact or confuse it for systemic change. Unless we are holding corporations to a high standard on how they engage in our politics and economy \u2013 changing policies and practices in the process \u2013 then the status quo remains. The net result will be our movements, mission, and public support co-opted for profit.</p> <p>We must expect more than \u201cshoutouts\u201d from the stage. Refuse to give companies a free pass just for being better than the worst corporate actors.

You remember: you\u2019d lie on your bed and think about your crush constantly before kicking off at your mum for calling you down for dinner when you\u2019re LITERALLY DYING UP HERE.

Don\u2019t want to see her dancing with somebody? Don\u2019t show up. Don\u2019t come out. Don\u2019t start caring about her now. Walk away and again: don\u2019t start caring about her now. Clear? In Dua Lipa\u2019s extremely strict regime, basically all you are allowed to do is sit inside and watch Netflix, which is sort of what everyone\u2019s planning on from now until March 2020 anyway. Lola Young 6 Feet Under Eighteen-year-old Lola Young\u2019s debut single is all about being \u201cyoung, in love and dumb\u201d and perfectly encapsulates the teenage emotion of \u201cif he doesn\u2019t love me back, I may as well be dead\u201d. You remember: you\u2019d lie on your bed and think about your crush constantly before kicking off at your mum for calling you down for dinner when you\u2019re LITERALLY DYING UP HERE. Then, after three weeks of staring at his social media, you accidentally run into him at a party, realise he\u2019s also just an insecure teenager like you, and never want to see him again. Anyway, this song is that, but much cooler. Sam Smith I Feel Love Sam Smith\u2019s new single is a cover of Donna Summer\u2019s I Feel Love. So what can we say?

It\u2019s also just plain stupid, logically and conceptually. If a woman has sex exclusively with women and has 500 partners in her life, is she still a virgin? Why is a woman who has anal but not vaginal sex a technical virgin, but a man who has only had anal sex with men not one? A woman could ostensibly have a long and active career as a porn star and still be a virgin, so long as the vaginal sex was the one act she would not engage in. Is a woman still a virgin if she\u2019s penetrated with a sex toy but not a human penis?</p> <p>There is no good reason for the concept of \u201cvirginity\u201d to persist. Not one. Virginity, whatever it means, has no bearing on morality, goodness or innocence. You aren\u2019t more pure or kind or good if you haven\u2019t experienced vaginal sex. You don\u2019t \u201close\u201d something by having pleasurable, consensual sex \u2013 you gain a new, fun experience. Yet women the world over receive the implicit (and sometimes explicit) message that virginity makes them more valuable and more worthy of love and respect.</p> <p>Virginity until marriage is also not as value-neutral as even some liberals make it sound \u2013 choose your choice, it\u2019s up to the woman if she wants to be a virgin until marriage or not. Of course it should be up to any individual person when and with whom they decide to have sex. But celebrating virginity until marriage \u2013 or even being neutral on the question of virginity until marriage \u2013 is misogynistic and dangerous. It removes sex from the realm of consent and desire and puts it in the realm of an exchange: you give me a formal commitment, I give you sex on an agreed-upon date. It positions sex as something women have and men get. It can make the experience of sexual violence even more traumatic, as a woman who experiences rape now hears that she\u2019s less valuable for not being a \u201cvirgin\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/07/ti-rapper-daughter-hymen-check-outrage\">Outrage as US rapper TI says he has daughter's hymen checked annually</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it sets couples up for profound dissatisfaction and imbalance.

      "bodyText": "One of the subtle ironies of Soviet life was that its founding moment was habitually celebrated in the wrong month. The \u201cgreat October\u201d marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history. If you\u2019re not convinced, perhaps these before and after images from Berlin will change your mind.

South Korean president Moon Jae-in attended one of the performances in September 2018, and gave a historic speech to the capacity crowd alongside North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The 2018 Mass Games were a kaleidoscope of North Korea\u2019s culture. It was a display of absolute determination. But on this scale it was also a kind of art.

The symbolism is heavy, with the hammer representing the workers, the brush the intellectuals, and the sickle for farmers, while the structure itself is 50 metres tall \u2014 one for each year of the anniversary. What struck me immediately was the alignment of this spot with the Mansu Hill Grand Monument across the river, at the centre of which stand two immense bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. They face the people presented in the Party Foundation Monument. This connection, incredibly direct, is transmitted across the residential blocks for all to see. Pyongyang ice rink The biggest indoor ice rink in North Korea was also one of my favourite buildings in the city \u2014 an eccentric structure on the bank of the Pothong River that stands to attention on a flat open space. Working in Pyongyang, however, turned my usual methodology completely upside down. Typically, my process begins with unbridled exploration. I wander freely \u2014 a type of d\u00e9rive \u2014 and enjoy abundant access to the space around me. North Korea\u2019s capital provided the opposite. I would walk permitted routes as I was invited to marvel, like the tourists before me, at the socialist wonderland. May Day stadium Another sporting site I was invited to marvel at was the May Day Stadium \u2014 the largest stadium in the world, and the venue for North Korea\u2019s Mass Games, which involve some 100,000 performers in a display of synchronised gymnastics and dance. South Korean president Moon Jae-in attended one of the performances in September 2018, and gave a historic speech to the capacity crowd alongside North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The 2018 Mass Games were a kaleidoscope of North Korea\u2019s culture. It was a display of absolute determination. But on this scale it was also a kind of art. An extraordinary mix of theatre, gymnastics, talent and pride. Mount Paektu This mountain is actually situated on the Chinese-North Korean border, nowhere near Pyongyang, but it features prominently in the country\u2019s propaganda, mythology and symbolism, so my drawing places Paektu and its stories at the very top of the artwork. It is as if it\u2019s looking over the city, an all-seeing powerful eye that rests hundreds of miles away in the north of the country. It is said that Dangun, the founder of the first Korean kingdom, was born here. Kim Jong Il\u2019s official biography also states that he was born on Mount Paektu.

      "body": "<p>Jane thought she tasted something not quite right about that can of beans. But money was tight and she was hungry. So she ate some of it and became violently ill the next day. She kept the leftovers in the fridge but lacked the expertise or equipment to analyse it.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency had long since been abolished, so she would have to sue the manufacturer or the retailer of her contaminated supper by herself, without recourse to legal aid. This wasn\u2019t realistic, so for several months many other people were poisoned too. A senior politician remarked that they should have used their \u201ccommon sense\u201d before eating the cut-price pulses. Jane received an equally dismissive reception when complaining about her unsafe rented housing and the chemicals that a multinational plant kept tipping into the nearby stream.</p> <p>Then there was work. She had overheard enough conversations over the years to strongly suspect that the men were paid more. She spoke to her union rep, who was supportive, but she was put off by the need to stick her neck out, put her name to a grievance and maybe even sue her bosses, comparing the worth of her own contribution to that of male colleagues and friends. Not the easiest route to a quiet life.</p> <p>The first paragraph of what I have written is pure dystopian fiction, if rooted in my reasonable fears about a future Boris Johnson Tory Britain with deregulation turbocharged by a trade deal with Donald Trump. The second paragraph represents the actual lived experience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender-pay-gap\" title=\"\">many working women in Britain</a>, whether poor or relatively affluent, professional, highly or less-skilled.</p> <p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/01/looking-back-equal-pay\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s landmark Equal Pay Act</a>, inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/jun/20/dagenham-women-ford-strike-equal-pay\" title=\"\">women strikers at the Ford car plant in Dagenham</a>, which put the great Barbara Castle in feminist history books forever; 2020 will also mark 10 years of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/a-guide-to-the-new-equality-act\" title=\"\">Equality Act</a>, for which we have Harriet Harman to thank. That\u2019s nearly five decades of legal obligations to pay women and men equally for equivalent work. I am a passionate believer in legislation but also in constantly reviewing and updating the law so that it never becomes a dead letter in a sealed book.</p> <p>The Fawcett Society reports that the mean hourly <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap\" title=\"\">gender pay gap is 13%</a>.

      "bodyText": "Jane thought she tasted something not quite right about that can of beans. But money was tight and she was hungry. So she ate some of it and became violently ill the next day. She kept the leftovers in the fridge but lacked the expertise or equipment to analyse it. The Food Standards Agency had long since been abolished, so she would have to sue the manufacturer or the retailer of her contaminated supper by herself, without recourse to legal aid. This wasn\u2019t realistic, so for several months many other people were poisoned too. A senior politician remarked that they should have used their \u201ccommon sense\u201d before eating the cut-price pulses. Jane received an equally dismissive reception when complaining about her unsafe rented housing and the chemicals that a multinational plant kept tipping into the nearby stream. Then there was work. She had overheard enough conversations over the years to strongly suspect that the men were paid more. She spoke to her union rep, who was supportive, but she was put off by the need to stick her neck out, put her name to a grievance and maybe even sue her bosses, comparing the worth of her own contribution to that of male colleagues and friends. Not the easiest route to a quiet life. The first paragraph of what I have written is pure dystopian fiction, if rooted in my reasonable fears about a future Boris Johnson Tory Britain with deregulation turbocharged by a trade deal with Donald Trump. The second paragraph represents the actual lived experience of many working women in Britain, whether poor or relatively affluent, professional, highly or less-skilled. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of Labour\u2019s landmark Equal Pay Act, inspired by the women strikers at the Ford car plant in Dagenham, which put the great Barbara Castle in feminist history books forever; 2020 will also mark 10 years of the Equality Act, for which we have Harriet Harman to thank. That\u2019s nearly five decades of legal obligations to pay women and men equally for equivalent work. I am a passionate believer in legislation but also in constantly reviewing and updating the law so that it never becomes a dead letter in a sealed book. The Fawcett Society reports that the mean hourly gender pay gap is 13%. On this basis, next Thursday, 14 November, becomes Equal Pay Day, the day after which women in effect start working for free for the rest of the year. The society also projects that, at the current rate of progress, it will take another 60 years to close the gap. So why has equal pay law failed to deliver equal pay for women up and down the land \u2013 from lawyers, bankers and journalists, to women working as cleaners, in hospitality and social care? The answer is enforcement. How ridiculous. It\u2019s as if individual pupils were left to sue their schools for not teaching them basic arithmetic, or patients had individually to verify the safety of prescribed medication before being able to trust it. Of course there have been high profile education and medical legal cases over the years, but the bottom line on regulation is that if society really cares about a standard \u2013 from schools and hospitals, to food, safety or the environment \u2013 the state takes responsibility for investigation and enforcement. Some Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have grudgingly accepted moves towards equal pay auditing, but even inspection and audit is insufficient in the face of an intransigent employer. That is why, as part of Labour\u2019s radical \u201cWomen in the workplace\u201d policy, we will amend the law to give a new Workers\u2019 Protection Agency \u2013 supported by HMRC \u2013 powers to inspect, direct and if necessary fine employers who are failing to provide equal pay. No longer should individual women be left to tackle discrimination and injustice alone. We will join the top tier of nations taking radical steps towards equal pay.

ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan.</p> <p>Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO <a href=\"https://www.climatestewards.org/\">Climate Stewards</a>, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/15/scottish-ministers-face-criticism-shell-tree-planting-scheme\">Scottish ministers face criticism for \u00a35m Shell tree-planting scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent \u201ccredits\u201d from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/aug/02/offsetting-carbon-emissions-how-to-travel-options\">Carbon offsetting has been controversial</a>, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels.</p> <p>But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are <a href=\"https://www.icroa.org/\">theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers</a>.</p> <p>The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: \u201cEveryone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.\u201d</p> <p>Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called \u201cScope 3 emissions\u201d from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate.</p> <p>Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water.</p> <p>\u201cThese are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gold Standard <a href=\"https://www.goldstandard.org/impact-quantification/gold-standard-global-goals\">has </a><a href=\"https://www.goldstandard.org/impact-quantification/gold-standard-global-goals\"> reported a fourfold increase in income</a> from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action.

      "bodyText": "Growing concern about the climate crisis and the \u201cGreta Thunberg effect\u201d are driving huge increases in individuals and businesses choosing to offset their emissions by investing in carbon-reducing projects in developing countries. NGOs and organisations involved in carbon offsetting have seen as much as a fourfold increase in investment from people who want to try to mitigate their carbon footprints. Agencies who work with large corporations have also seen a spike in investment in carbon offsetting over the last 18 months. ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan. Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO Climate Stewards, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent \u201ccredits\u201d from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has been controversial, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels. But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: \u201cEveryone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.\u201d Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called \u201cScope 3 emissions\u201d from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate. Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water. \u201cThese are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,\u201d she said. Gold Standard has reported a fourfold increase in income from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform. \u201cPeople are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action. We see it as a way that someone can feel empowered and reduce their carbon footprint,\u201d said Leugers. Climate Stewards funds a project in Nepal paid for by the purchase of carbon offsets, where 240 fuel-efficient cooking stoves have been built for remote communities. Each stove saves 6.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household and the stoves last for about 10 years. The price for a tonne of CO2 is not set globally, and varies between offset suppliers on the voluntary market. The US Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 assessed that for every tonne of CO2emitted into the atmosphere, we sacrifice between $11 and $212 in environmental degradation and negative social impacts. David Hughes, the chair of Climate Stewards, said: \u201cThis year, the whole business of carbon offsetting has suddenly taken off. It has been so gratifying to see a lot of individuals choosing to offset over the last 12 months \u2013 the numbers have more than doubled. \u201cWe are seeing the Greta effect, the impact of Extinction Rebellion, the impact of the words of David Attenborough, the school strikes, all of these coming together.\u201d But Hanrahan said while voluntary carbon mitigation and individual actions were laudable, ClimateCare was clear in its call for mandatory carbon pricing and mitigation for large corporations and industries like aviation. \u201cOur position is that this should not be an optional or voluntary thing.

Through his partner, an Anglican priest, he was introduced to Climate Stewards, and began to see a way in which he could compensate for his carbon footprint. \u201cBut then I thought, it isn\u2019t enough to offset the flights that I am going to take in the future, as I take them.

Unlike French, Italian, Spanish or even Dutch, it had no cultural prestige, and was useless overseas. Anyone who aspired to real civility, or to travel or trade with mainland Europe, had no option but to learn its languages. How English men and women of the late 15th to the early 18th century went about doing so is the subject of John Gallagher\u2019s fascinating new book, a welcome attempt to show that the history of language encompasses much more than just the history of words.</p> <p>It\u2019s always difficult to reconstruct an essentially oral practice from written evidence, but Gallagher trawls through an immense variety of printed and manuscript sources to capture the voices of soldiers, servants, captives and beggars, as well as students, tourists and diplomats. The teaching of languages in this era took place largely outside traditional educational institutions: at home, with a tutor; alongside the formal curriculum at Oxford and Cambridge; at the royal court; in London, with its numerous immigrant communities and language schools; and when travelling in mainland Europe itself, an increasingly fashionable educational experience for rich young Englishmen.</p> <p>Even when they used a printed guide, most people learned languages not by silently reading texts, but out loud, by practising conversation. To speak a foreign language competently was always as much about navigating cultural and political hierarchies as it was about grammatical correctness. That was why conversation manuals provided ample instruction not just in the niceties of pronunciation, but in continental rituals of greeting (\u201cI kisse your hands Sir / and I yours, at your service Sir\u201d), or how to dress down your Spanish servant (\u201cBlockhead, doest thou bring me my doublet before my shirt?\u201d), patronise your French inferiors (\u201cHo farmer, tell me \u2013 go I well here by to go to Paris?\u201d), or insult your Italian enemies (\u201cpoltrone, forfante, cattivo, buggiardo\u201d).

Yet female speech always remained inferior. In the model conversations of language manuals, women were overwhelmingly silent or subordinate.

Given his stated desire to inspire a greater awareness that the histories of England, Europe and empire are all essentially polyglot, he could also have made more of the fact that \u201cEnglish\u201d itself was far from uniform in this period, and that Britain\u2019s indigenous history has never been monoglot.

Still, their willingness to shift identity without compromising their core suggests Girl Ray could have a lustrous future.",

Nor do they have to juggle the advances of rival moguls before making their first film \u2013 or do so with an audience of 7.2 million people waiting for the results. Given all this, Rapman \u2013 the alias of the British rapper and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4769455/\" title=\"\">Andrew Onwubolu \u2013</a> is surprisingly relaxed, a bright-eyed barrage of words in sweatshirt and black jeans on a cold afternoon in London.</p> <p>The 7.2 million in question are the viewers to date of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7qJPUet81w\" title=\"\">Shiro\u2019s Story</a>, the three-part drama he authored, whose phenomenal numbers on YouTube have led to a movie, Blue Story. The film is set in Lewisham, south London, where its writer-director grew up, but which he has since had to leave. \u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of people are happy for me.

Still in place, too, are the seismic twists of fate that dogged Shiro, now driving a powerful tale of childhood friendship destroyed by a postcode war.

If Onwubolu has a brilliance for moreish storytelling, the past year of his life has shared the sense of <em>whatever next</em><em>?</em> When the final instalment of Shiro\u2019s Story was released on a Sunday last September, he was dropping his oldest son off with his ex-partner. The first two episodes had drawn a significant audience under the radar of the mainstream. By the end of the half-hour journey, the views had reached 150,000. That evening, they hit a million. He woke to find the UK media anointing him an overnight sensation.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5xB9Dh9bKo\" title=\"\">Good Morning Britain</a>, Susanna Reid told him: \u201cYou\u2019re making waves among a, you know, <em>great </em>audience.\u201d But palpable in the film and TV industry was a terror that their endless trawl for next big thing had somehow missed a writer-director able to build a vast fanbase \u2013 much of it young and of colour \u2013 entirely outside the system. Onwubolu took the chance to ask awkward questions. \u201cI said: \u2018Why aren\u2019t our stories on bigger platforms? Why are they not at the cinema? Why do we have to rush to our phones?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His own phone erupted to the sound of panicked executives. There were back-to-back meetings with British production companies. Their plan was always the same \u2013 to remake Shiro\u2019s Story with their logo on the credits. Amid the promises in members\u2019 clubs, he met the producer Damian Jones, whose CV includes Noel Clarke\u2019s Kidulthood trilogy as well as the film work of Alan Bennett. \u201cHe was literally the only person who asked: \u2018What do you want to do next?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8f2a4ba21ceff00332244305d540aa0af655508\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8f2a4ba21ceff00332244305d540aa0af655508/368_0_4322_5403/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Are people going to leave that comfy chair at home and the Netflix subscription?

Jones was keen, Onwubolu pragmatic. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, people talk a lot. So I\u2019m like: \u2018Cool. Let me know when there\u2019s a contract.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The producer turned out to be briskly effective. Conversations took place with heavyweight potential backers, including international studios. One wheeled out an assembly of staff to say how much they loved his script. They seemed less sure about why. At another, a senior figure talked eagerly about Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje\u2019s biographical drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/08/adewale-akinnuoye-agbaje-my-life-as-black-skinhead-farming-film\" title=\"\">Farming</a>. In the end, Onwubolu accepted an offer from BBC Films and the UK arm of the Hollywood studio Paramount. \u201cThey actually spoke about my writing in depth. They proper got it.\u201d</p> <p>Then, before the contract was finalised, came Jeffrey Katzenberg. The onetime chair of Disney and co-founder, with Steven Spielberg, of the studio DreamWorks, Katzenberg was busy with <a href=\"https://www.quibi.com/\" title=\"\">Quibi</a>, the bleeding-edge platform for \u201csnackable\u201d content made to be watched on phones. He had already signed up film-makers including Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez and Guillermo del Toro before a 2020 launch. Katzenberg flew Onwubolu to LA, where his team read the script for Blue Story. They were polite, but insistent. \u201cThey said: \u2018We feel you should leave this and come to work with us here on short-form ideas. Straight away.\u2019 And then they offered me a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, he started to doubt his own judgment. \u201cMy agent is saying: \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay more?\u2019 He\u2019s just loving life. I\u2019ve got Damian back in London saying: \u2018Where\u2019s your signature?\u2019\u201d Onwubolu wondered aloud to Katzenberg about the speed of events. It had been mere weeks since Shiro\u2019s Story Part 3. \u201cI said: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t there be a bit in between?\u2019\u201d Just asking the question clarified his thinking. \u201cI said: \u2018Nah, I\u2019m making my movie. I know you lot don\u2019t get it, but the people it\u2019s intended for will.\u2019\u201d This could, he reasoned, be his only shot at the film. Katzenberg was gracious, his agent despondent.</p> <p>A week later, Quibi phoned to say they would wait for him. Onwubolu is now writing a project for Katzenberg. He is no longer with his agent. \u201cI haven\u2019t mentioned Jay-Z yet, have I?\u201d he asks. Still in LA, a meeting was brokered at the hip-hop magnate\u2019s home, finalising a deal that saw Onwubolu sign with his management company, Roc Nation. Jay-Z, it turned out, was one of the viewers of Shiro\u2019s Story. \u201cThat contract was never not getting signed.\u201d</p> <p>He relishes the story. The one he tells in his movie has a different tone. Blue Story is blue because Lewisham is the \u201cblue borough\u201d, council signs rendered in the colour. Yet at 11, his Nigerian parents sent him to a Catholic secondary school a bus ride away in Camberwell. Between the two was Peckham, delivering him daily into a bitter local rivalry. For many of his peers in Lewisham, growing up without role models, gang hierarchies were at least a structure, dominant personalities demanding loyalty from boys hungry to belong to something, even if only a postcode. Onwubolu\u2019s parents were loving; he mostly stayed out of trouble. But he was a sociable kid. His friends were his friends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one in Sadiq Khan\u2019s office read the script! See my film, and tell me afterwards I\u2019ve glamorised gangs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He saddens discussing the violence he witnessed. \u201cWe\u2019d see a boy from Peckham and I\u2019d know we were meant to batter him. And I\u2019d think: \u2018But this kid never did anything to me.\u2019 I never had that dark heart.\u201d As his teens turned into his 20s, he tallied the acquaintances who had been stabbed and the friends in prison. He wanted a change of direction.</p> <p>He had rapped since school. Then, while working in JD Sports, he began to make a name for himself in London hip-hop with long, character-based rhymes. Catholic school had fuelled his gift for narrative. \u201cI\u2019m big on Bible stories. There\u2019s always a Judas in my stuff. But I\u2019m a sucker for plot generally. Might be Goodfellas; might be Desperate Housewives.\u201d</p> <p>For a film lover, video was a natural next step, although he wanted to do more than just accompany his tunes. In 2014, he learned his way around a camera, directing an early version of Blue Story with a beyond-skeletal crew. By 2017, he was debating what to do with a rap he had called Shiro\u2019s Story. \u201cI thought: \u2018Should I bother making a film for this?\u2019 But I wanted to test myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"564867b3a5b188be598652854764cf6da4e5a981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/564867b3a5b188be598652854764cf6da4e5a981/0_297_7892_4735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Story \u2026 some London councils refused permission to film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue Story \u2026 some London councils refused permission to film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Raphael/Paramount Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His feature debut was another education. The \u00a31.3m budget sounded lavish compared with the \u00a33,000 with which he made Shiro\u2019s Story until, he says, crew members hired over his head ate up costs. Having always shot guerilla-style, he now diligently applied for the correct official permissions.</p> <p>The result was Lewisham council and others in London refusing to let Blue Story shoot in their boroughs, under instruction from the London mayor\u2019s office to withhold support from projects depicting knife and gun crime. It appeared filming would have to take place in Dartford, Kent, a location Onwubolu saw as laughably inappropriate. At the last minute, he was allowed to film in Enfield, north London, a passable stand-in.</p> <p>Onwubolu is still affronted. \u201cNo one in [London mayor] Sadiq Khan\u2019s office read the script! The heart of the film is that the good times only exist before the violence. If you see my film and tell me afterwards I\u2019ve glamorised gangs, I\u2019ll know you\u2019ve just been sitting there on Instagram.\u201d</p> <p>The irony for a mayor desperate to address youth violence was that here was a film that laid bare its tragedy and a director with the attention of the audience who most need to see it. \u201cStart preaching at a 15-year-old, and they ain\u2019t going to hear you. A film gets the message over wrapped inside a story.\u201d</p> <p>His exasperation passes. The moment is too exciting to be downbeat \u2013 a true original crashing an invitation-only party. \u201cThe same people have been running the industry in Britain for years,\u201d he says. \u201cThey decide what stories get told, and who gets hired to make them. But you know what\u2019s funny? When it turns out the person they never heard of is the perfect person for the job.\u201d</p> <p><em>Blue Story is released on 22 November</em></p>",

He had lived with one for years and had implanted hundreds of other young, tech-savvy Swedes. For this community, the chip signified a seamless integration of biology and technology. They used the implants to gain access to their co-working spaces, pay for gym memberships, and even ride the train. With Biohax, \u00d6sterlund was hoping to introduce this concept to a global market.</p> <p>Three Square Market was a test case, the first company in the US to offer implants to employees on a public stage. But the highly charged reaction, which linked the devices not only to pernicious surveillance but to a vision of tech-apocalypse, raised a question that \u00d6sterlund is still grappling with: is the world ready for technology to get under the skin?</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Microchip implants are essentially cylindrical bar codes that, when scanned, transmit a unique signal through a layer of skin. Mostly, they have been used to organize products or warehouses or identify livestock and stray pets, though there has been some human experimentation.</p> <p>In 1998, Kevin Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a chip <a href=\"http://www.kevinwarwick.com/project-cyborg-1-0/\">implanted</a> in his hand both to demonstrate that it was possible, and as a way of exploring the transhumanist idea that fusing technology with the body is the next step in humanity\u2019s evolution.</p> <p>\u00d6sterlund first became aware of microchipping technology several years after Warwick\u2019s project, when his friend made a copy of his dog\u2019s chip and implanted it under his own skin. They were both part of the body modification scene in Sweden and frequently experimented with new techniques, such as branding and septum piercing. \u201cThe dog chip was kind of a practical joke, so that when my friend went to the vet he could be identified as his own pet labrador, or whatever,\u201d \u00d6sterlund told me. \u201cBut the idea of doing something more with implants stuck with me.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, \u00d6sterlund stumbled upon a German company selling industrial-grade microchips online. Unlike the chips used in pets, which can only transmit a single identification number, these devices were enabled with a communications protocol called NFC, which can be programmed to perform simple tasks.</p> <p>\u00d6sterlund ordered a batch and wrote a basic program that paired his Samsung 5 to the microchip, so that it would automatically call his wife when he picked up the phone. On the first implant attempt, \u00d6sterlund accidentally broke the tiny fuse in the chip while sterilizing it. But the second attempt stuck \u2013 when he touched his phone, it automatically triggered a call to his wife.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like my body was online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my very own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mnemonic_(film)\">Johnny Mnemonic</a> moment.\u201d</p> <p>Excited, \u00d6sterland reached out to a friend called Hannes Sj\u00f6blad, who was associated with the transhumanist community in Sweden. Sj\u00f6blad was impressed with \u00d6sterland\u2019s experiment and invited him to hold a demonstration at Epicenter, a tech-focused co-working space in Stockholm where Sj\u00f6blad was the \u201cchief disruption officer\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33950542cae620182cac455384e0acbf97140907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33950542cae620182cac455384e0acbf97140907/0_0_3141_2193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this March 14, 2017, file photo, Jowan Osterlund from Biohax Sweden, holds a small microchip implant, similar to those implanted into workers at the Epicenter digital innovation business center during a party at the co-working space in central Stockholm.

Sj\u00f6blad believes that by placing a device under the skin, instead of wearing it like a Fitbit, data collection will be greatly improved. \u201cSwipe it with an iPhone and you will be able to get your blood oxygenation, temperature profile, heart rate patterns, breathing patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who want to optimize their health, this would be a game changer.\u201d</p> <p>There are other companies pushing the limits of what microchip implants can do, most notably the Seattle-based Dangerous Things, which sells a variety of bio-enabled devices, including multi-colored LED lights that light up beneath the skin. But \u00d6sterlund believes that Sweden will be the focal point of cyborg innovation. \u201cThe national railway is already compatible with my chips and as a country we are planning to be totally <a href=\"https://qz.com/1218290/cash-is-dying-in-sweden-in-part-because-of-its-history-of-robberies/\">cashless</a> by 2023,\u201d he told me. \u201cI guess here you can see an example of how it can be done.\u201d</p> <p>But Urs Gasser, executive director at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, believes scaling up beyond the Swedish tech-hub environment to a broader market will be more legally and ethically tenuous than \u00d6sterlund might expect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/02/microchip-contactless-payment-three-square-market-biohax\">World's lamest cyborg? My microchip isn't cool now \u2013 but it could be the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis experiment has so far happened in a wealthy country, among very digitally savvy people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while having a chip may play out nicely for well-educated people in Sweden who are part of a digital hub, I question how this will play out for, say, a worker in a warehouse.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Gasser believes that many people reacted negatively to Three Square Market\u2019s highly publicized chipping event because it symbolized power imbalances in the workplace, conjuring dystopian images of an authoritarian employer dehumanizing and controlling workers. \u201cSeeing employees get implanted at the workplace made people question what it means to be an employee,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you a person being paid for your work, or are you the property of the company you work for?\u201d</p> <p>Ifeoma Ajunwa, professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University, adds that it is crucial to consider the implications of microchipping technology in the context of increasing worker surveillance. In a 2016 paper, <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4364&amp;context=californialawreview\">Limitless Worker Surveillance</a>, Ajunwa and her co-authors, Kate Crawford and Jason Schultz, argued that new data collection methods \u2013 tracking internet history, DNA testing, collection of health data as part of workplace wellness programs \u2013 not only provide employers a more intimate data profile of their employees at the workplace but bleed into their private and internal lives.</p> <p>Microchips, Ajunwa says, will deepen and intensify this dynamic. They \u201chave the potential for constant and intimate surveillance \u2013 they literally go with the worker wherever the worker goes. This seems to blur the line between work and family life.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Concerns about how microchipping might be implemented in the coming years have also been raised by a number of US lawmakers, including Skip Daly, a Democrat in the Nevada state assembly, who, in March, <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/ExhibitDocument/OpenExhibitDocument?exhibitId=38027&amp;fileDownloadName=0315WS_AB226%20packet.pdf\">introduced</a> a bill to make involuntary microchipping illegal in the state. <a href=\"https://5newsonline.com/2019/01/24/arkansas-house-votes-to-ban-forced-microchipping-of-workers/\">Arkansas</a>, <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/NJ/text/A2687/2018\">New Jersey</a> and Tennessee are also drafting legislation centered around implants.</p> <p>(In a company statement, Three Square Market was careful to <a href=\"https://32market.com/public/images/QA.pdf\">emphasize</a> that its \u201cchipping party\u201d was entirely voluntary.)</p> <p>But according to Ajunwa, because labor laws in the US often skew in favor of the employer, workers can still be subject to coercion when it comes to surveillance tech.</p> <p>In 2015, for example, a woman was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/worker-fired-for-disabling-gps-app-that-tracked-her-24-hours-a-day/\">fired</a> after she deleted an employee tracking app that recorded her movements, even when she was not at work. In another recent case, an employer was found to have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-verdict-dna-defecator/georgia-workers-win-2-2-million-in-devious-defecator-case-idUSKBN0P31TP20150623\">demanded</a> employees provide DNA samples for genetic testing after human feces was found in their workplace. Ajunwa says that in the absence of clear labor regulations that prevent workplace pressure to submit to surveillance, \u201cemployees might feel pressured to say yes to microchips even if they have reservations\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"559fb73cd744014afe8389254d02dbd9abaf574a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/559fb73cd744014afe8389254d02dbd9abaf574a/0_319_4844_2907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Danna, vice president of Three Square Market in River Falls, receives a microchip in his left hand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Danna, vice-president of Three Square Market, receives a microchip in his left hand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Baenen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I raised these concerns with \u00d6sterlund, he said that for microchipping to scale successfully, new legal frameworks, particularly around informed consent, were essential. In fact, part of the reason he believes Swedes have been early adopters of microchipping is because of stronger labor regulations and data protection laws, such as Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/19/gdpr-facebook-google-amazon-data-privacy-regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), which he believes creates an atmosphere of trust between government and society, employer and worker.</p> <p>Yet, both he and Sj\u00f6blad also presume that much of the fear elicited by microchips is founded less on privacy concerns and more on irrational prejudices against implants. \u201cMicrochips are inert and passive, basically like swipe cards that you can\u2019t lose,\u201d \u00d6sterlund said. \u201cSo I find it ironic when people with an iPhone and a Gmail account get on Facebook to scream about privacy just because they\u2019re freaked out by the incision.\u201d</p> <p>That we respond to new technologies in an emotional or psychological way, though, is unavoidable, particularly when body modification is involved. For Gasser, these emotional responses should not be immediately dismissed as superstitious or illogical. \u201cThe fear we feel in relation to microchips is less about a particular technology and more about that technology in the context of power and uneven power structures, like employer and worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when those dynamics are implanted in our bodies, there is a line we cross that simply feels different.\u201d</p>",

After the event, comments on Three Square Market\u2019s Facebook page urged employees to quit. The company\u2019s Google reviews page was inundated with one-star ratings. And Christian groups \u2013 convinced that the implants fulfilled an end-of-days prophecy where people are branded with \u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d \u2013 accused the company of being the antichrist. Jowan \u00d6sterlund, a Swedish tattooist and body piercing specialist whose company Biohax provided Three Square Market with the microchips, watched with interest. For \u00d6sterlund, microchip implants were not radical or even novel. He had lived with one for years and had implanted hundreds of other young, tech-savvy Swedes. For this community, the chip signified a seamless integration of biology and technology. They used the implants to gain access to their co-working spaces, pay for gym memberships, and even ride the train. With Biohax, \u00d6sterlund was hoping to introduce this concept to a global market. Three Square Market was a test case, the first company in the US to offer implants to employees on a public stage. But the highly charged reaction, which linked the devices not only to pernicious surveillance but to a vision of tech-apocalypse, raised a question that \u00d6sterlund is still grappling with: is the world ready for technology to get under the skin? \u2022\u2022\u2022 Microchip implants are essentially cylindrical bar codes that, when scanned, transmit a unique signal through a layer of skin. Mostly, they have been used to organize products or warehouses or identify livestock and stray pets, though there has been some human experimentation. In 1998, Kevin Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a chip implanted in his hand both to demonstrate that it was possible, and as a way of exploring the transhumanist idea that fusing technology with the body is the next step in humanity\u2019s evolution. \u00d6sterlund first became aware of microchipping technology several years after Warwick\u2019s project, when his friend made a copy of his dog\u2019s chip and implanted it under his own skin. They were both part of the body modification scene in Sweden and frequently experimented with new techniques, such as branding and septum piercing. \u201cThe dog chip was kind of a practical joke, so that when my friend went to the vet he could be identified as his own pet labrador, or whatever,\u201d \u00d6sterlund told me. \u201cBut the idea of doing something more with implants stuck with me.\u201d In 2013, \u00d6sterlund stumbled upon a German company selling industrial-grade microchips online. Unlike the chips used in pets, which can only transmit a single identification number, these devices were enabled with a communications protocol called NFC, which can be programmed to perform simple tasks. \u00d6sterlund ordered a batch and wrote a basic program that paired his Samsung 5 to the microchip, so that it would automatically call his wife when he picked up the phone. On the first implant attempt, \u00d6sterlund accidentally broke the tiny fuse in the chip while sterilizing it. But the second attempt stuck \u2013 when he touched his phone, it automatically triggered a call to his wife. \u201cIt was like my body was online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my very own Johnny Mnemonic moment.\u201d Excited, \u00d6sterland reached out to a friend called Hannes Sj\u00f6blad, who was associated with the transhumanist community in Sweden. Sj\u00f6blad was impressed with \u00d6sterland\u2019s experiment and invited him to hold a demonstration at Epicenter, a tech-focused co-working space in Stockholm where Sj\u00f6blad was the \u201cchief disruption officer\u201d. Other young innovators and startup founders at Epicenter were intrigued with \u00d6sterlund\u2019s implant, and soon, he and Sj\u00f6blad were hosting \u201cchips and beer\u201d evenings. \u00d6sterlund would implant microchips over alcoholic beverages and share ideas about what new cyborg applications were possible. \u201cIn no time, Epicenter was updated to be biochip compatible and suddenly we were opening the front door and printing documents with the implants,\u201d Sj\u00f6blad told me. \u201cIt was all community-based development and it was super exciting.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Today, \u00d6sterlund and Sj\u00f6blad have their own microchip-focused businesses. \u00d6sterlund\u2019s Biohax is aiming to simplify identity and access in the digital world, offering a replacement to the seemingly endless collection of passwords, keys, tickets, cards that clutter our lives. \u201cWith the chip, it\u2019s all in this one tiny device that is impossible to lose,\u201d he said. Sj\u00f6blad\u2019s business, Dsruptive, which is based out of a university in southern Sweden, approaches microchipping as an extension of the wearable health tracking industry. Sj\u00f6blad believes that by placing a device under the skin, instead of wearing it like a Fitbit, data collection will be greatly improved. \u201cSwipe it with an iPhone and you will be able to get your blood oxygenation, temperature profile, heart rate patterns, breathing patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who want to optimize their health, this would be a game changer.\u201d There are other companies pushing the limits of what microchip implants can do, most notably the Seattle-based Dangerous Things, which sells a variety of bio-enabled devices, including multi-colored LED lights that light up beneath the skin. But \u00d6sterlund believes that Sweden will be the focal point of cyborg innovation. \u201cThe national railway is already compatible with my chips and as a country we are planning to be totally cashless by 2023,\u201d he told me. \u201cI guess here you can see an example of how it can be done.\u201d But Urs Gasser, executive director at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, believes scaling up beyond the Swedish tech-hub environment to a broader market will be more legally and ethically tenuous than \u00d6sterlund might expect. \u201cThis experiment has so far happened in a wealthy country, among very digitally savvy people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while having a chip may play out nicely for well-educated people in Sweden who are part of a digital hub, I question how this will play out for, say, a worker in a warehouse.\u201d Indeed, Gasser believes that many people reacted negatively to Three Square Market\u2019s highly publicized chipping event because it symbolized power imbalances in the workplace, conjuring dystopian images of an authoritarian employer dehumanizing and controlling workers. \u201cSeeing employees get implanted at the workplace made people question what it means to be an employee,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you a person being paid for your work, or are you the property of the company you work for?\u201d Ifeoma Ajunwa, professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University, adds that it is crucial to consider the implications of microchipping technology in the context of increasing worker surveillance. In a 2016 paper, Limitless Worker Surveillance, Ajunwa and her co-authors, Kate Crawford and Jason Schultz, argued that new data collection methods \u2013 tracking internet history, DNA testing, collection of health data as part of workplace wellness programs \u2013 not only provide employers a more intimate data profile of their employees at the workplace but bleed into their private and internal lives. Microchips, Ajunwa says, will deepen and intensify this dynamic. They \u201chave the potential for constant and intimate surveillance \u2013 they literally go with the worker wherever the worker goes. This seems to blur the line between work and family life.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Concerns about how microchipping might be implemented in the coming years have also been raised by a number of US lawmakers, including Skip Daly, a Democrat in the Nevada state assembly, who, in March, introduced a bill to make involuntary microchipping illegal in the state. Arkansas, New Jersey and Tennessee are also drafting legislation centered around implants. (In a company statement, Three Square Market was careful to emphasize that its \u201cchipping party\u201d was entirely voluntary.) But according to Ajunwa, because labor laws in the US often skew in favor of the employer, workers can still be subject to coercion when it comes to surveillance tech. In 2015, for example, a woman was fired after she deleted an employee tracking app that recorded her movements, even when she was not at work. In another recent case, an employer was found to have demanded employees provide DNA samples for genetic testing after human feces was found in their workplace. Ajunwa says that in the absence of clear labor regulations that prevent workplace pressure to submit to surveillance, \u201cemployees might feel pressured to say yes to microchips even if they have reservations\u201d. When I raised these concerns with \u00d6sterlund, he said that for microchipping to scale successfully, new legal frameworks, particularly around informed consent, were essential. In fact, part of the reason he believes Swedes have been early adopters of microchipping is because of stronger labor regulations and data protection laws, such as Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which he believes creates an atmosphere of trust between government and society, employer and worker. Yet, both he and Sj\u00f6blad also presume that much of the fear elicited by microchips is founded less on privacy concerns and more on irrational prejudices against implants. \u201cMicrochips are inert and passive, basically like swipe cards that you can\u2019t lose,\u201d \u00d6sterlund said. \u201cSo I find it ironic when people with an iPhone and a Gmail account get on Facebook to scream about privacy just because they\u2019re freaked out by the incision.\u201d That we respond to new technologies in an emotional or psychological way, though, is unavoidable, particularly when body modification is involved. For Gasser, these emotional responses should not be immediately dismissed as superstitious or illogical. \u201cThe fear we feel in relation to microchips is less about a particular technology and more about that technology in the context of power and uneven power structures, like employer and worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when those dynamics are implanted in our bodies, there is a line we cross that simply feels different.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s two months left of this decade, and while it will be remembered for its divisive politics and the accelerating climate crisis, what about its fashion, pop culture and trends? What will now look like later? Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s 2042 and you\u2019re invited to a 2010s-themed party. Venue The venue is an \u201cAirbnb\u201d decorated in white tiles with a splash of green from indoor plants hanging from crocheted slings. The wood is blonde. When they enter, guests are saged. In the \u201cBasic zone\u201d are Kmart prints with the words \u201cLove, Create, Smile, Home\u201d in curly writing. In another room there is a wall of street art and an old-timey street artist painting in the style of the Old Master, Banksy. People joke that they caught an Uber. To drink On arrival there is a choice of 2010s-themed alcohol: Aperol spritz, negroni, prosecco, rose, orange wine, espresso martinis and hyper-local small batch gin or craft beer. You can also get coffee, and dotted around the party are people dressed as the beloved 2010s icon, the hipster barista \u2013 with butcher\u2019s aprons, massive beards and sleeve tattoos. We love it that people brought \u201ckeep cups\u201d from the era, that they found in antique stores. For those choosing not to drink (a very late 2010s thing, assure the hosts), there\u2019s medical marijuana or LSD microdosing available. Also: coconut water, green juice and various types of fake milks: cashew, almond, coconut, soy and macadamia. Food Guests are served avocado halves on a plate with a piece of toast, wedge of lemon and smear of salt. \u201cWhat the hell do I do with this?\u201d one guest is heard to say. Later in the night salmon poke bowls are brought out by people with Deliveroo bags, but otherwise it\u2019s mostly Mexican, cronuts, burgers, share plates and vegan food. A small number of partygoers dressed as swole muscle bros elect to consume protein powder or food sourced in the tradition of \u201cpaleo\u201d or combined in the tradition of \u201cketo\u201d. (The bulletproof coffee gets a lot of laughs.) Clothes Boiler suits, jumpsuits, metallics, peplum pieces, maxi dresses, bike shorts, linen, salmon pink shirts for men, short shorts, sneakers instead of stilettos, flower crowns and athleisure (of course). There is no-makeup makeup, contouring and people walk around wearing Korean face masks. Other people wear costumes \u2013 there are dozens of Elsas from Frozen and Kardashians. Some of the guests look strange, cartoonish almost. They wear exaggerated, stuck-on eyelashes and have painted their eyebrows three inches thick. Their faces have the alien look which we know to be a thing they used to call \u201cfillers\u201d, and under their clothes they\u2019ve stuffed fake bum implants. Some of the men arrive with Ned Kellys (large, but carefully maintained beards) or hair in a high topknot which they used to call a \u201cman bun\u201d (and we are embarrassed for the people of that era). Some are dressed as people in professions that no longer exist: Instagram poets, social media managers and emoji designers. Others have brought pets from the era \u2013 English bulldogs and Labradoodles were popular. Everyone is dancing to grime, alt country and trap music as well as the massive solo stars of the decade. Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Ed Sheeran and Adele are all on high rotation, along with Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989. Accessories Since being banned by President Donald Trump at the end of the decade, vaping has gone underground. So in a smoky cloud of nostalgia that feels very 2017, vapers inhale a cinnamon and strawberry donut flavoured Juul. There\u2019s an alarming number of people seemingly aimlessly doing laps around the perimeter of the party. On closer inspection they are all wearing a strange band on their wrists called a Fitbit and measuring their steps. \u201cWe have to get to 12,000.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just an arbitrary number we were given.\u201d Other guests have brought along their selfie sticks and personal drones or very old iPhones (which were enormous back then). They are taking hundreds of photos of themselves at all different angles (weird! gross! why??!!) which they jokingly say they will upload to the now defunct platform of Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m an influencer!\u201d they say to howls of laughter. Activities Guests are offered this thing called a \u201cclass pass\u201d and can choose between typical 2010s-era activities \u2013 crossfit, F45, barre, SoulCycle, standup paddleboarding or power yoga. You can have a gut health check and a (fake) faecal transplant. In another room is a screen with astrology apps, and you can pay for your chart using old-fashioned cryptocurrency. There is a room with buckets and disinfectant for people having an experience with ayahuasca and another room for people taking something called the \u201cice bucket challenge\u201d \u2013 and who are pointlessly being filmed on one of those stupid large phones while doing so. On screens set up around the party are nonstop cooking shows. It makes you think, life must have been really shit if you didn\u2019t stream in the 2010s. But some grim, monotonous show called MasterChef is in a way preferable to the documentary showing earlier \u2013 Kony 2012 \u2013 which looks truly deranged, but was apparently very popular at the time. As an alternative you can listen to a podcast via your airpods. There is some darkness visible at the edges of the party \u2013 after all, it was the 2010s. In the corner are people looking distressed and out of sorts. \u201cThat\u2019s the cancelled corner,\u201d says the host. \u201cAll the people that got cancelled go there \u2013 so people that sent a racist tweet, made a rape joke or accidentally liked something posted by an alt-right account.\u201d There is also a dank corner for the trolls (bathed in laptop light) and another area for those who have been ghosted.

TfL said it had agreed with the Department for Transport that the financing package would stay in place and was talking to the department about how to cover the extra costs. \u201cTfL has been advised by Crossrail Ltd that their latest assessment is that the opening of the central section will not occur in 2020, which was the first part of the previously declared opening window,\u201d TfL said. \u201cThe Elizabeth line will open as soon as practically possible in 2021.\u201d Crossrail was due to open in December 2018 but has been beset by delays and rising costs. The National Audit Office has blamed the debacle on management clinging to an unrealistic opening date instead of dealing with problems that appeared as early as 2015. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to complete the Elizabeth line as quickly as we can but there are no shortcuts to delivering this hugely complex railway. The Elizabeth line must be completed to the highest safety and quality standards.\u201d Changes to design and schedules increased costs on most of the project\u2019s 36 main contracts. The costs of civil engineering works at Whitechapel station alone, as of December 2018, were \u00a3659m \u2013 six times the amount originally budgeted and more than double the estimate in 2015. London politicians and business groups reacted with dismay. Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat assembly member, said it was \u201cappalling news for Londoners\u201d and said both the mayor and the transport secretary had failed to hold Crossrail to account. She said the delay would also \u201cput back further investment in London\u2019s transport network and create further havoc to TfL\u2019s finances. This also damages the hopes of Crossrail 2 getting started in the next decade.\u201d Business group London First said it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Its chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: \u201cEfforts must be redoubled to ensure that the railway opens as soon as practically possible and that we learn the lessons for future projects.\u201d Crossrail is on track for one impending milestone, with the full western branch out to Reading from Paddington due to come into service under TfL Rail on 15 December.",

And finally, in the world of women\u2019s football, Australia star Sam Kerr is Europe-bound but has yet to divulge where it is she\u2019ll be plying her trade. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process for me for a few years in making this decision,\u201d said the 26-year-old Matilda who has been linked with Chelsea and Real Madrid. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to make that decision in the next week or so and be really confident in that. There\u2019s been a few options I\u2019ve looked closely at, but I\u2019ve cut it down to one or two.\u201d",

Nottingham, Wednesday 13; London, Thursday 14 November MC C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant Wynton Marsalis once said of C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant: \u201cYou get a singer like this once in a generation or two.\u201d The audacity, imagination, versatility and timing of the Florida-born French-Haitian vocalist dazzlingly testifies to that. She joins the teeming Jazz Voice spectacular for the multi-gig opening night of the 10-day-long EFG London jazz festival. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 15 November JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Huddersfield contemporary music festival This year, Britain\u2019s pre-eminent showcase for new music has as its composer-in-residence Hanna Hartman, whose works frequently use sounds from everyday objects alongside conventional instruments. Her Hurricane Season is one of more than 20 pieces receiving their world premiere. There are others from Ann Cleare, Naomi Pinnock, J\u00fcrg Frey and Georg Friedrich Haas, while the opening concert, given by soprano Juliet Fraser and the Sonar Quartett, includes the first UK performance of Increshantum by Heinz Holliger. Various venues, Friday 15 to 24 November Orph\u00e9e ENO\u2019s disappointing Orpheus season ends with Philip Glass\u2019s 1991 work, the first of a trilogy of operas he based on films by Jean Cocteau. Cocteau\u2019s original French text, one of the beauties of the score, has been translated into English by Netia Jones, with Nicholas Lester as Orph\u00e9e and Sarah Tynan as Eurydice. London Coliseum, WC2, Friday 15 to 29 November The Art of the \u00c9tude As well as providing a potted modern history of the piano study, Tamara Stefanovich\u2019s three-part recital includes new pieces written for her by Milica Djordjevi\u0107 and Vassos Nicolaou, before ending with Rachmaninov\u2019s \u00c9tudes-Tableaux and Ligeti\u2019s late, technique-stretching studies. Barbican Centre: Milton Court Concert Hall, EC2, Sunday 10 November AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Steve McQueen The Turner prize and Oscar winner has photographed every Year 3 class in London in formal group portraits that add up to a snapshot of a generation. Did he somehow know when he planned this public statement about youth, hope and the future of Britain that it would open during a general election campaign? Vote McQueen. Tate Britain, SW1, Tuesday 12 November to 3 May Prix Pictet 2019 The theme of this year\u2019s prize for socially and ecologically aware photography is Hope, a challenge to today\u2019s apocalypticism. The shortlist is: Shahidul Alam, Joana Choumali, Margaret Courtney-Clarke, Rena Effendi Lucas Foglia, Janelle Lynch, Ross McDonnell, Gideon Mendel, Ivor Prickett, Robin Rhode, Awoiska van der Molen and Alexia Webster. Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, Thu to 8 December Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece The National Gallery\u2019s Virgin of the Rocks gets a digital makeover and high-tech analysis. This painting is enigmatic even by Leonardo\u2019s standards. There was no traditional source for showing Mary, Jesus, John the Baptist and an angel in a remote grotto, and the portrayal of Jesus and John as babyhood friends is borderline heretical. Even though only the angel is undoubtedly his own brushwork, this is the most unforgettable painting in the gallery. National Gallery, WC2, Saturday 9 November to 12 January George IV: Art &amp; Spectacle George IV was viciously portrayed as a glutton by Gillray in his own lifetime but he is also remembered as selfish, corrupt and crass. In fact, the bon viveur who ruled as regent for his ill father before becoming king is widely regarded as Britain\u2019s worst monarch, but his era was a national golden age with victories at Trafalgar and Waterloo, and the likes of Turner, Austen, Constable, Blake, Byron and Keats flourishing. The Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, SW1, Friday 15 November to 3 May Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh When Howard Carter peered into the forgotten tomb of a little-known pharaoh in 1922 it turned out to be crammed with beautiful artistic masterpieces in alabaster, wood and, oh yes, gold. This selection from the greatest archaeological haul of all time precedes the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza next year, where Tut\u2019s treasures will be the centrepiece. Saatchi Gallery, SW3, to 3 May JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows The Boy in the Dress David Walliams\u2019s popular children\u2019s book \u2013 about a young lad who loves dresses just as much as he loves football \u2013 is being adapted for the stage by Mark Ravenhill, who will be sure not to make things too schmaltzy. Gregory Doran directs and there are songs from the Entertainer himself, Robbie Williams, and collaborator Guy Chambers. Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 8 March Touching the Void Prepare to have your senses dazzled and, perhaps, your love of climbing knocked right out of you. David Greig has adapted Joe Simpson\u2019s gripping memoir about two friends who find themselves stranded on a remote mountain in the Andes, their friendship and survival skills pushed to the very limit. War Horse\u2019s Tom Morris directs. The Duke of York\u2019s, WC2, Saturday 10 November to 29 February &amp; Juliet This new musical will feature a slew of songs from hit-maestro Max Martin, who has written for Britney Spears, Pink, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. The final song list is a mix of classics such as \u2026 Baby One More Time as well as lesser-known gems. The show picks up at the end of Shakespeare\u2019s doomed romance and sees Juliet put aside the dagger and forge a new beginning. Miriam Teak-Lee stars and Luke Sheppard directs. Shaftesbury Theatre, WC2, to 28 March Henry VI All three of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VI plays are being bundled up into one epic piece of theatre. The drama will chart the entire Wars of the Roses, from Henry VI\u2019s doomed coronation through to his inevitable demise (plus a fierce guest appearance from Joan of Arc). With Richard III starting this week, this wraps up a long season of history plays that started with Henry IV in May. Ilinca Radulian and Sean Holmes, both lively theatre-makers, will co-direct. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 26 January My Cousin Rachel Anyone who saw Roger Michell\u2019s recent film adaptation of this superb thriller, starring Rachel Weisz, will be keen to see how this one plays out onstage. The novel was written by Daphne du Maurier and is spooky and sexy in equal measure. The story unfolds in Cornwall, where Countess Rachel Sangalletti has come to reclaim the home of her recently deceased husband \u2013 but is Rachel everything she claims to be? Helen George takes the lead role. Theatre Royal, Bath, Wednesday to 23 November MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Dorrance Dance: Myelination and Other Works Tap dance for the 21st century. Having learned from the masters of American rhythm tap, Michelle Dorrance brings artistic curiosity and damn good taste to her artform. Myelination\u2019s title refers to the speedy transmission of nerve impulses, and the dancers skitter so swiftly across the floor they\u2019re almost gliding. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Thursday 14 to 16 November Cardiff dance festival Two weeks of top-class contemporary dance, mostly small in scale but full of ideas, including a piece celebrating the Welsh passion for rugby by National Dance Company Wales; a sweatily intimate and acrobatic duet from Jan Martens; and the talented young dancers of Rambert2. Various venues, to 24 November Ballet Black: Triple Bill Mthuthuzeli November revisits a landmark of South African history in Ingoma: the story of 60,000 black miners on strike in the 1940s. There are also short and zingy pieces by Martin Lawrance and Sophie Laplane. Theatre Royal Stratford East, E15, Saturday 9; Stanley &amp; Audrey Burton Theatre, Leeds, Friday 15 to 16 November LW",

      "body": "<p>Near the beginning of Ben Lerner\u2019s third novel, a teenager named Adam Gordon creeps into what he thinks is his girlfriend\u2019s house. He goes into the bathroom and notices the toiletries there aren\u2019t hers. \u201cAlong with the sheer terror of finding himself in the wrong house,\u201d writes Lerner, \u201cwith his recognition of its difference, was a sense, because of the houses\u2019 sameness, that he was in all the houses around the lake at once; the sublime of identical layouts\u201d. It\u2019s a typical Lerner moment: an anecdotal event is mined for latent content, the literal uncanniness of Adam\u2019s experience suggesting something of the uniformity \u2013 both comforting and terrifying \u2013 of suburban America.</p> <p>Lerner\u2019s first two works of fiction were intelligent novels of ideas about characters who were more or less like him: disaffected, overeducated young men. What saved them from self-indulgence was their sentence-by-sentence virtuosity, their imaginative density, and the fact that the cleverness of his prose always felt appropriate to the stories he told.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lerner\u2019s third novel is his most successful effort at navigating between communal experience and individual feeling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Much of this is recognisable in <em>The Topeka School</em> (Adam is a pretentious high school student and gifted rhetorician: exactly the kind of person who would think of the \u201csublime of identical layouts\u201d when he has wandered into a stranger\u2019s house). But it is also a more earnest and sentimental novel than his previous books, which often sought to reconcile authenticity with postmodernist posturing by invoking a kind of ironic indeterminacy. <em>The Topeka School</em> \u2013 as dazzling as anything Lerner has written \u2013 is also his most successful effort at navigating between communal experience (the shared tropes, ideologies and cliches of a culture) and individual feeling (the specificities and textures of poetic expression) without denaturing either.</p> <p>His first novel, <em>Leaving </em><em>the Atocha Station</em> (2011), was about a US poet, also named Adam Gordon, living in Madrid on a poetry fellowship. He strolled around museums, spent time online \u201clooking at videos of terrible things\u201d, smoked hash and lamented his inability to have a \u201cprofound experience of art\u201d. His second, 2014\u2019s <em>10:04</em>, was about a writer who, like Lerner, taught at a New York university and had published his first book to great acclaim. In blurring the boundary between biography and novel these books had affinities with the autofictional projects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard\" title=\"\">Karl Ove Knausgaard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk\" title=\"\">Rachel Cusk</a>; what distinguished them was their tendency to insist on the conditions of their own interpretation. Both Gordon and the narrator of <em>10:04</em> were trained to deconstruct the framing devices Lerner erected around them, so that the books \u2013 peppered with essays on art and literature and anxious digressions on the impossibility of authenticity in the age of the internet \u2013 sometimes read as manifestos as much as novels.</p> <p><em>The Topeka School</em> is a sort of prequel to these two novels. It is set in the late 1990s, at the end of history (which turned out to be more of a pause) in Topeka, Kansas, where Lerner himself grew up. It is told in three intertwined narratives, alternating between the perspectives of Adam and his parents, Jonathan and Jane. When crossed, Adam uses his debating skills to launch on his parents \u201can overwhelming barrage of ridiculous but somehow irrefutable arguments\u201d. Jonathan and Jane are New York psychiatrists who moved to Topeka to work at \u201cthe Foundation\u201d, a psychiatric institution that is a liberal enclave in the otherwise conservative town. Jane has found national fame and local notoriety after writing a book about relationships and toxic masculinity. Jonathan is a therapist who as a research student discovered \u201cspeech shadowing\u201d: a phenomenon sometimes observed when subjects who are asked to repeat words played to them at increasing speed descend into nonsense.</p> <p>Interleaved with these is the story of Darren, a social misfit adopted by Adam and the alphas of their social group. Part mascot, part clown, Darren is treated with both ironic cruelty and confused affection. At a house party he joins the huddle of white middle-class schoolboys as they freestyle rap: his classmates \u201call shouted their encouragement and amazement and bobbed their heads to the nonexistent beat as though Darren were disclosing new territories of thought and feeling, new worlds, as though he were their Caedmon\u201d. But they also take him to a party by a lake and leave him to walk home on his own. The compulsive drive of the novel (which Lerner\u2019s previous books sometimes lacked) is provided by the foreknowledge that this treatment is going to make Darren do something awful.</p> <p>Unlike Darren, Adam is able to use his articulacy to access the cultural capital of freestyle rapping and competitive debating. But he dreams of becoming a poet, \u201cbecause poems were spells, were shaped sound unmaking and remaking sense that inflicted and repelled violence and made you renowned\u201d. It is this same verbal magic that sustains the novel. The prose is thickened with precise descriptions but also with micro-essays about everything from visual phenomena (as Adam and his girlfriend kiss he sees patterns of light against his closed eyes: \u201cPhosphenes, tiny fading Rorschachs formed by the inherent electrical charges the retina produces while at rest, an experience of light in the absence of light\u201d) to the intricacies of competitive debating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Baby talk, nonsense poetry, rap: the novel positions language\u2019s destruction as something literature alone can address</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Language\u2019s potential as both a tool and a weapon is one of the novel\u2019s central concerns. Competitive debating depends on a strategy called \u201cthe spread\u201d, in which many arguments are presented rapid fire, in a way that makes them difficult to respond to. Since the \u201crule among serious debaters\u201d is that a \u201cdropped argument\u201d, no matter its quality or its content, is conceded, the more arguments you can advance, the more are likely to be dropped by your competitors.

It can do things in the world, either through antagonism (debate; rap battles) or seduction (poetry; psychoanalysis), but it is only available to those who can wield it. Unlike Darren, who in his inarticulacy is compelled to employ actual violence, Adam is free to perform roles and move between registers as easily as he moves between social hierarchies.</p> <p>The fear in such a world is not muteness, which has its own significance, but meaninglessness: the linguistic breakdowns that constantly threaten Lerner\u2019s characters.

It was good to be inflicting optional damage on your bright pink lungs; it was good to be two young people tasting of Lanc\u00f4me and Philip Morris, synthetic pheromones and carcinogens, to be at the point of their most intimate contact, their most interchangeable, corporate persons; cliches, types.\u201d It\u2019s self-knowledge that liberates them, but also the fact that, despite their interchangeability, they remain specific people having a specific experience, in a specific place, at a specific time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Topeka School </em><em>is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

It was good to be inflicting optional damage on your bright pink lungs; it was good to be two young people tasting of Lanc\u00f4me and Philip Morris, synthetic pheromones and carcinogens, to be at the point of their most intimate contact, their most interchangeable, corporate persons; cliches, types.\u201d It\u2019s self-knowledge that liberates them, but also the fact that, despite their interchangeability, they remain specific people having a specific experience, in a specific place, at a specific time. \u2022 The Topeka School is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

They are simply too fatty. You are left tearing and pulling at your sandwich like a dog wrestling a bone off its owner. It is also a fallacy that even the sweatiest, melting jam\u00f3n is self-lubricating in a sandwich. Spanish food excels in many areas, but the prevalence of dry<em> </em>jam\u00f3n<em> </em>bocadillos, untouched by even a splash of olive oil or tomato pulp, is baffling. Live a little, Spain: slap a bit of butter on!</p> <h2><strong>Serving: two\u2019s company, three\u2019s a crowd</strong></h2> <p>This is not a ploughman\u2019s. Any half-decent jam\u00f3n is is best left to shine alone in the spotlight: silky, sweet, earthy, boldly savoury and lightly acidic. Particularly if you are eating good ib\u00e9rico, its intramuscular fat lush with acorn-derived monounsaturated oleic acid, it can stand alone. It is its own satisfyingly complex, self-contained world. It does not need partnering with crusty bread, cornichons, tomatoes, manchego or random cheeses, other continental meats, chutneys and remoulade, or any of those other items that nervous British restaurant kitchens feel they need to present it with in order to confidently charge a premium for such a product.</p> <p>Such over-elaboration actively detracts from the jam\u00f3n, muffling its flavours with a variety of lesser ingredients.

Easily achieved in Seville, less so in Swansea or Salford. At HTE Towers, for instance, the thermostat is only turned up past 19C in times of medical emergency. Given that, some suggest consumers should run packets of sliced ham under hot water before opening them or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/28/friends-of-ham-leeds-restaurant\">even hold individual slivers of ham in their loosely gripped hands </a>until the meat warms.

Ideally, you want your jam\u00f3n to be as clammy as a tube commuter in a July rush-hour, its fats beginning to bead and run so that, when thinly sliced, the jam\u00f3n almost melts on your tongue, flooding your mouth with flavour as you gently suck it into submission.</p> <p>As an aside, this is why jam\u00f3n only works as an extra topping with <em>pan con tomate</em> if, as is rarely the case, the pan is still warm and the tomate pulp is room temperature rather than, again, freshly blitzed from the fridge.</p> <h2><strong>Equipment</strong></h2> <p>Given the tendency of warm jam\u00f3n to stick to porcelain and cold plates to deleteriously chill your ham, a wooden board or neat square of pristine white greaseproof paper is preferable, practically and aesthetically.

But on an experimental tour possibly offering only one batsman the chance to join the big guns once England begin picking their strongest T20 squad next year, Malan\u2019s raid of nine fours and six sixes represented a huge leap for his career. At this rate, the 32-year-old may finally crack the true first XI too. After all, this was Malan\u2019s sixth 50-plus score from only nine games to date.

Morgs came out and took the initiative straight away and I piggy-backed him a little bit and was fortunate to capitalise on that, a couple of loose balls as the bowlers felt under pressure.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tim Southee, </strong>\u201cThe guys will learn from it and move on, we got off to a nice start but then we kept losing wickets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Eoin Morgan, </strong>\u201c I\u2019m absolutely over the moon, seeing young guys come through today particularly with the ball, and then seeing Dawid Malan coming through and making a century and the most of his opportunity, that\u2019s what we want to see. Very calm out there, lots of laughs, we made the most of the wicket, it was a beautiful wicket out there in Napier tonight.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s it from me!

      "bodyText": "The man of the match is Dawid Malan \u201cI can\u2019t describe how much fun it was out there, as good as it gets. In the first game I felt really rusty and every time since then that I have hit balls it has felt smoother and smoother - and I said to Colly this morning \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve got rid of the rust now.\u2019 Today I was definitely in the zone, I asked Tim Southee if I could change my gloves and he looked at me and said, there is one ball left! Morgs came out and took the initiative straight away and I piggy-backed him a little bit and was fortunate to capitalise on that, a couple of loose balls as the bowlers felt under pressure.\u201d Tim Southee, \u201cThe guys will learn from it and move on, we got off to a nice start but then we kept losing wickets.\u201d Eoin Morgan, \u201c I\u2019m absolutely over the moon, seeing young guys come through today particularly with the ball, and then seeing Dawid Malan coming through and making a century and the most of his opportunity, that\u2019s what we want to see. Very calm out there, lots of laughs, we made the most of the wicket, it was a beautiful wicket out there in Napier tonight.\u201d And that\u2019s it from me! See you at 1am on Sunday morning for the decider in Auckland. Have a lovely day. A brave first few overs by New Zealand, but the pressure of England\u2019s highest IT20 score, Malan\u2019s 48 ball hundred, a partnership of 183 with Morgan, 14 sixes and 21 fours was always going to be hard to bear, even on this excellent wicket. Malan is the name in lights, and deservedly, such aggression in the shots, but some tinsel too for Tom Banton, and Parkinson who took four wickets in only his second game and, as has been pointed out most forcefully in my inbox, could have had more. A few duff bits of fielding, but otherwise, a great day for England. Hook, line, sinker and flashing bails. An absolute thrashing! 15th over: New Zealand 160-9 (Tickner 4, Boult 4 ) Boult has a huge slog at Sammy Curran, yet the ball somehow bisects all three fielders in contention. A superb bit of fielding by Jordan for that run-out - he really is the supreme athlete I\u2019ve had a couple of emails about Lewis Gregory, sorry not to print them all, but Ed Rostrom sums them up: It looks like England will win at a canter here but their treatment of Lewis Gregory on this tour has been bizarre to say the least. Picked for all four games yet has bowled a total of four overs while batting in the lower order. If they don\u2019t like the look of him in training, why play him in the games; and if they play him in the games they\u2019re supposed to be using to look at new and promising players, why not use him? Surely he can\u2019t be there solely for his batting, when it\u2019s comfortably his lesser suit? Excellent point. Brilliant direct-hit from Jordan at mid-off, running out Sodhi charging to the non-striker\u2019s end. 14th over: New Zealand 153-8 (Sodhi 9, Boult 0 ) Sam turns into Tom, and Sodhi smashes his first ball over the stadium roof for six. Bob O\u2019Hara writes from the frozen north: I\u2019m a bit further north, in Trondheim, where the clear skies mean a frost so heavy they remove it with lawnmowers. There\u2019s snow on the hills, so it\u2019s definitely winter. Blue skies and frost? Gorgeous. 13th over: New Zealand 144-8 (Sodhi 1 ) Sam Curran comes back to calm things down. And takes a wicket, golden arm that he is. Santner goes for the pull and gloves the ball through to Billings behind the stumps 12th over: New Zealand 139-7 (Sodhi 0, Santner 7) An eventful final over for Parkinson\u2019s ... Southee thwacks him for six, then Pat Brown performs a piece of fielding best left to your imagination and the ball flies past him to the boundary. Parkinson smiles, half-sympathetically. Then the wicket, then a sympathy-review by Morgan to try and notch Parkinson\u2019s wicket-haul up to the full five - not a chance, pitched outside leg. Southee\u2019s slap and tickle innings comes to an end after being hit on the back-leg going for a slog. 11th over: New Zealand 126-6 (Southee 27, Santner 7) An improvised pull from Southee flies square and high straight to a blue shirted man in the crowd, then a wide from Pat Brown, then a slower ball that Southee misreads. Brown\u2019s run up is long and straight, but seems from here to slow down as he approaches the crease. Another wide, then a full-toss sent first-class down the ground by Santner. Seventeen from the over. Hmmm. 10th over: New Zealand 109-6 (Southee 18, Santner 3) Southee on the attack, two slog sweeps for six, then a DROP on the long-on boundary by Pat Brown who fell down on his knees and the ball falls through his backwards-facing hands. And that\u2019s almost the biggest roar of the day from the crowd. The sky is black now, then Lewis Gregory on the square leg boundary sticks out a hand only for the ball to spin the other way. Fielding malfunctions galore. Eighteen off the over. 10th over: New Zealand 91-6 (Southee 1, Santner 2) What a game for the rookies! Taylor flicks Brown off his legs and is caught low down, nonchalantly by Tom Banton, the Somerset wicketkeeper. I hope no-one came for the second innings. 9th over: New Zealand 85-5 (Taylor 11, Santner 0) New Zealand had no choice but to attack, and Parkinson reaps the benefits, three wickets in five balls. Taylor nobbles him for six, but then there is a handy lbw shout (turned down) which replays show should actually have been out as Taylor was hit on the back leg trying to sweep. Well he misses the hat-trick, but I think he\u2019ll take three in five! Mitchell dragged Parky straight and high and was well caught by Jordan just forward of the boundary. 8th over: New Zealand 77-4 (Taylor 3, Mitchell 2) Another baby-faced destroyer, Pat Brown, whose glance down at the ground in delivery is almost Anderson-esque. Just six from the over John Starbuck writes again, \u201c\u2018Im a bit further north in Yorkshire than Diana (1st over). As Dawn does her stuff, we can see faint traces of blue sky. Summer lingers on! I love your optimism John! Meanwhile Ian Wilson has words for the England selectors I think maybe the England Test team have been a bit hasty in asking Bairstow to stay on as cover for Denly, when Malan as been in good form and has an overseas test hundred recently, I admit he is into his mid 30s, but Bairstow is too inconsistent for a middle order role and is definitely not good enough to play wicketkeeper-batsman. 7th over: New Zealand 71-4 (Taylor 1, Mitchell 0) Morgan whistles up for Parkinson and the New Zealand batsmen can\u2019t resist having a go. And fall flat on their faces. This could end up a damp squib rather quickly. And another one, two in two balls, Munro down on one knee but doesn\u2019t get enough welly on it, and another catch at deep mid-wicket . The ball after de Grandhomme sent Parkinson for six, he tries again and the ball soars to Parkinson\u2019s former England U-19 teammate Banton on the boundary. Easy. 6th over: New Zealand 61-2 (de Grandhomme 0, Munro 28) Jonny Bairstow\u2019s on the mike, which I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s enjoying. He calls the Malan-Morgan partnership \u201cseriously special hitting\u201d and says \u201cParky\u2019s overs are going to be key.\u201d Then Munro charges straight into the back of Chris Jordan - Jordan winces, imagine a baby rhino in the ribs. Then the wicket - a couple more and NZ will have no chance. The slower ball, top edged to Curran who just waits for it to fall into his paws 5th over: New Zealand 56-1 (Sellert 1, Munro 26) Respite for England with Guptill\u2019s departure. At the same stage England were 31 for one - so the second-highest run-chase in IT20 history still very much on. England breathe a sigh of relief as Guptill flicks a low full toss straight to Malan at midwicket just after one-handedly pulling him for four. 4th over: New Zealand 49-0 (Guptill 23, Munro 24) Whoo-hoo! Guptill goes off the front-foot to Chris Jordan and send the ball square and high and out of the ground! It\u2019s his second six of the over as New Zealand see England, and raise them ten. 3rd over: New Zealand 34-0 (Guptill 10, Munro 22) The sky is pink, then purple, as Curran scampers in, little legs pumping, two hands clasped together. Guptill sends him over the short leg side boundary for six, Munro casually lofts him over the long-on boundary for four. A bouncer! No ball. \u201cThe pyramid tea bag was designed for situations such as your own, Tanya, where speed is of the essence, allowing the tea leaves to infuse faster than the traditional square or round versions where the leaves become trapped,\u201d writes Ian Forth \u201c I once spent years of my life in the development of pyramid tea bags so that people could save twenty or thirty seconds out of their day. Other people might worry about their legacy, but not me.\u201d Ian, as I sip my stewed tea, I raise my cap (or in this case my dressing-gown hood). 2nd over: New Zealand 16-0 (Guptill 3, Munro 14) Ah, love it, a brotherly opening pair, Tom Curran opens from the other end, taller, stockier, darker, palm trees silhouetted behind him. Munro gets a bottom edge and swings behind for a boundary. A handful of singles. 1st over: New Zealand 8-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 7) Sam Curran takes the new ball, the sun has set and the floodlights are starting to spread their fingertips. Munro flicks Curran off his hip for New Zealand\u2019s first boundary and Diana writes from over the Pennines - Morning Diana! Morning Tanya, It has finally stopped raining in South Yorkshire where we need our water-wings! Enjoy the cricket and Messrs Morgan and Milan. Thank you! Hope the waters are receeding in Sheffield. Oh god, they\u2019re back, I haven\u2019t even taken the tea bag out . I\u2019m just going to make a quick cup of tea, back in five. Malan\u2019s hundred, btw, was the fastest by an Englishman in IT20s. 20th over: England 241-3 (Billings 0, Malan 103) Well, what a cracking way to start the morning. A shame Morgan couldn\u2019t make three figures but England made the absolute most of those short boundaries - a partnership of 182 off 12.2 overs between Malan and Morgan full of booming boundaries and played with a wonderful laisser-faire. Poor Sam Billings got to face one ball, and missed it... them\u2019s the breaks. A standing ovation for Eoin Morgan as he selflessly goes for just one more boundary, a slog of sorts, and is caught at deep extra. 19th over: England 233-2 (Morgan 85, Malan 101) Such power in those wrists! Morgan flicks Mitchell, and the ball goes high over his shoulder, higher again, for six. He casually flicks out a couple more - one straight and low, another over long -off. And that\u2019s England\u2019s highest ever score in T20s and the third highest partnership in T20 history. How\u2019s that tasting with your cornflakes? 18th over: England 208-2 (Morgan 61 , Malan 101) Just a casual six from Dawid Malan off Boult - hang about, make that two! and that\u2019s Malan\u2019s first T20 hundred for England - 9 fours, six sixes, a hundred in 48 balls. \u2018You beauty!\u201d he says. England\u2019s highest score in IT20s is 230... 17th over: England 193-2 (Morgan 60 , Malan 89) Ah, Mr Malan, we\u2019ve been expecting you. FOUR, SIX, SIX, FOUR, SIX, TWO! A wide ball reverse swept, a leg-side six, another six at an attempted googly, a free-swinging reverse-sweep for four, another leg-side six and a nibble for two off poor old Sodhi. 20 fours and 8 sixes in the innings so far. 16th over: England 165-2 (Morgan 60 , Malan 61) The sun giving the fielders a few problems here, with half the ground in shade and the other half near-blinded by the setting sun. The hundred partnership comes up and Morgan hammers Tickner back over his head as the umpire ducks sideways for his life. And another escape for Morgan, as he is caught off another above waist-height no ball - Malan misses the free hit going for the scoop. We see Jonny Bairstow biting hard at his nails, finger, finger, thumb. 15th over: England 156-2 (Morgan 54 , Malan 59) Morgan gets a reprieve after heaving Santner to the fielder on the deep mid-wicket boundary, only for the ball to be ruled too high. The free hit only goes for one - actually a bit of light-relief that over, just seven from it. Five overs to go. 14th over: England 149-2 (Morgan 51 , Malan 57) Malan, Morgan, Malan, bish, bash, bosh, 20 off the over. Fifty for Malan, in consecutive matches, and now fifty for Eoin Morgan in 21 deliveries. New Zealand need to take a deep breath here. 13th over: England 129-2 (Morgan 40 , Malan 39) On TMS, Jonathan Agnew is gushing about Napier\u2019s art deco buildings; on the pitch, Malan and Morgan continue the ruthless brutality. Malan even loses his bat attempting to slice Tickner through point. He gets it back, only to brutalise another four in the same area. 12th over: England 120-2 (Morgan 40 , Malan 39) An edge down to third man off Boult to start the over, a straight charge for four to end it, happy days for Eoin Morgan. An email! \u201cMorning, Tanya.\u201d Hello John Starbuck! At 60-2 this is what we can call respectability, in so far as T20I is ever respectable. When is irresponsibility due to kick in? OOOh, that\u2019s a question. At 11 overs? Aged 55? Five to midnight? 11th over: England 108-2 (Morgan 30 , Malan 37) Santner coming in for some punishment as Malan and Morgan compete in a kind of duck-shooting contest either side of the square - 20 from the over and that\u2019s the fifty partnership. 10th over: England 88-2 (Morgan 23 , Malan 24) Malan survives a review for lbw, as Tickner\u2019s moustached delivery is judged to have hit him outside the line. Morgan steps legside and lofts him over long-on onto the grassy bank, then next ball over cover for four. I think Morgan wants to win this one. 9th over: England 73-2 (Morgan 13 , Malan 19) Morgan whallopps Sodhi high over deep square leg for six, effortlessly, as you do. Ah, and then a great bit of fielding on the boundary, as what was going to be a catch is thrown on the ground because the fielder was going to land on the rope - four runs saved. 8th over: England 61-2 (Morgan 2 , Malan 18) Tis a shame, Banton was looking in entertaining mood. Ah, now they\u2019re showing an aerial shot of the ground, that\u2019s just rubbing it in, we see the glistening south Pacific stretching out forever. Banton fancies a reverse sweep, he flips round to play the shot, almost cartoon style, and is hit on the back leg, I think, though it\u2019s hard to tell he\u2019s so skewed out of position. Anyway, the original decision is not out, New Zealand review, and Banton is on his way after a stylish cameo. 7th over: England 57-1 (Banton 31 , Malan 17) Malan is not to be outdone, he watches, waits, smoothly swivels and reverse sweeps Sodhi for four. Add five effortless singles to the mix and England are starting to accelerate away. 6th over: England 48-1 (Banton 29 , Malan 10) It\u2019s the last over of the power play and Tom Banton is in the mood. Boom - backwards of square for four. Bash - stand and deliver. Thwack - six, sailing, high, over deep midwicket. \u201cKevin Pieterseten!\u201d says David Lloyd. 5th over: England 31-1 (Banton 13 , Malan 9) Ah, that\u2019s gorgeous from Banton. His hand speed is so quick, and he sends the ball skimming through for four. Then Malan gets in on the act. 13 from the over. And a message! From Sam Aldred: \u201cA shout out to 20yr sports journalist Big W on his last day on the job at the NZ Herald.\u201d Good on ya, Winston, raising a glass from here, and good luck on whatever it is you\u2019re going to do next. 4th over: England 18-1 (Banton 8 , Malan 1) Yorkshire\u2019s newest recruit Dawid Malan sees out the over, squeezing a single off Santner\u2019s last ball. He\u2019s been in super form this series, and he\u2019s a man you feel will not waste his opportunities. First ball of Santner\u2019s spell, a long-hop, and Bairstow lofts him straight into Mitchell\u2019s hands on the deep square leg boundary. He leans on his bat in despair, before trudging off. 3rd over: England 16-0 (Banton 8 , Bairstow 8) An eventful over. Bairstow strides down the wicket and tonks Boult for what looks like a certain four but some super fielding from Southee in the circle stops a run. Next ball, he goes high, straight back down over Boult for a boundary. Then a rather reckless throw of the bat, before Banton is given out lbw, hit high on the back leg, they review, and he is reprieved, the ball pitched outside leg. 2nd over: England 10-0 (Banton 8 , Bairstow 2) Southee squints into the sunshine before starting his first over. A tasty shot from Banton, then Bairstow off the mark with a clip off his toes. Ah, dear me, a terrible near run-out, as Banton stop-starts and Bairstow is forced to dive back towards his crease. Don\u2019t do that to Jonny- he get mad. 1st over: England 5-0 (Banton 5 , Bairstow 0) Welsh Fire\u2019s opening partnership faces up to Trent Boult. Banton gets a tissue of bat onto a swinger from Boult which slides legside for four. He swings and misses at another, and then they run through for a single. They\u2019re out in the middle, shadows stretching over the pitch, Tom Banton in long sleeves doing knee squats, Bairstow in short sleeves and an arm guard. Here we go... In the Sky studio they\u2019re discussing boundaries (short, square of the wicket) and the drop in pitch. Do drop me a line if you\u2019re awake, wherever you are. Here\u2019s the scene at Napier. Ah, New Zealand have won the toss and will bowl - the skies look kind and dazzling. New Zealand have brought back Boult for Lockie Ferguson as expected, and Daryl Mitchell replaces a slightly off-colour Jimmy Neesham. England bring back Bairstow and Chris Jordan. New Zealand: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Colin Munro, 3 Tim Seifert (wk), 4 Colin de Grandhomme, 5 Ross Taylor, 6 Daryl Mitchell, 7 Mitchell Santner, 8 Tim Southee (capt), 9 Ish Sodhi, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Blair Tickner England: 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Tom Banton, 3 Dawid Malan, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Sam Billings (wk), 6 Lewis Gregory, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Tom Curran, 9 Chris Jordan, 10 Matt Parkinson, 11 Pat Brown Good morning from a sponge-like north of England, slowly sinking at every step. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s damp and I\u2019m incredibly envious of anyone waking up and stretching for a casual yet cool T-shirt before breakfasting on Kiwi coffee at some kind of funky pavement cafe. And they\u2019ve got Jacinda Ardern. Enough! To Napier, and the fourth IT20 of a five-match season, where England are currently 2-1 down, busted by terrible catching (match 2) and a collapse of 5-19 (match 3). Jonny Bairstow was yesterday granted a Test reprieve when it was announced that he would stay in New Zealand as cover for Joe Denly and his ankle injury, and we think he\u2019ll play today too. Likewise Tom Banton, who chanced a few flashy shots at Nelson. New Zealand are expected to bring back Trent Boult.",

The plotlines are well-balanced and our investment is evenly distributed thanks also to an exceptional cast of young actors. There\u2019s chemistry between the various couples (Merced and Moore prove particularly charismatic) and the segues into more serious, sentimental territory are mostly smooth \u2013 although I\u2019d argue there are a few too many scenes where one character storms away from another, the power of these dramatic exits diminishing by the end. There\u2019s also a nicely handled queer subplot which feels refreshingly casual and lacking in cliche, a promising sign of a post-Love, Simon teen movie landscape that allows gay kids the same soaring highs and crushing lows of high-school romance.</p> <p>British TV director Luke Snellin has figured out how to evoke just the right amount of festive spirit while avoiding overkill and also wisely picks a soundtrack that isn\u2019t wall-to-wall Christmas, with some unusual and effective songs scattered throughout. He also knows how to frame a scene, which might sound like faint praise, but given some of the poorly directed Netflix originals of late, it makes a striking difference.</p> <p>At a brief 93 minutes, Let It Snow comes and goes before you know it, and there\u2019s every chance the memory of watching it will have melted by the time Christmas comes around. But with great surprise, it mustered up more festive cheer from me than I expected, and for those eager to get in the mood, it\u2019ll probably do the same.</p> <ul> <li><p>Let It Snow is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

Then there\u2019s Dorrie (Liv Hewson from Santa Clarita Diet), who is trying to deal with a difficult crush while also fighting with her best friend Addie (Odeya Rush from Lady Bird and Dumplin\u2019). Oh, and Joan Cusack is in it. There\u2019s no plot development or line of dialogue in Let It Snow that will come as a great surprise to anyone, but the script, from British comic Laura Solon, Finding Dory writer Victoria Strouse and 30 Rock alumna Kay Cannon, peppers the predictability with wit and warmth, doing the bare minimum but doing it rather well. The plotlines are well-balanced and our investment is evenly distributed thanks also to an exceptional cast of young actors. There\u2019s chemistry between the various couples (Merced and Moore prove particularly charismatic) and the segues into more serious, sentimental territory are mostly smooth \u2013 although I\u2019d argue there are a few too many scenes where one character storms away from another, the power of these dramatic exits diminishing by the end. There\u2019s also a nicely handled queer subplot which feels refreshingly casual and lacking in cliche, a promising sign of a post-Love, Simon teen movie landscape that allows gay kids the same soaring highs and crushing lows of high-school romance. British TV director Luke Snellin has figured out how to evoke just the right amount of festive spirit while avoiding overkill and also wisely picks a soundtrack that isn\u2019t wall-to-wall Christmas, with some unusual and effective songs scattered throughout. He also knows how to frame a scene, which might sound like faint praise, but given some of the poorly directed Netflix originals of late, it makes a striking difference. At a brief 93 minutes, Let It Snow comes and goes before you know it, and there\u2019s every chance the memory of watching it will have melted by the time Christmas comes around. But with great surprise, it mustered up more festive cheer from me than I expected, and for those eager to get in the mood, it\u2019ll probably do the same. Let It Snow is now available on Netflix",

      "body": "<p>It is rare, in a first-past-the-post electoral system, to live in a constituency where you can vote exactly as you choose and know you\u2019ve made an impact. In a safe seat \u2013 which is most of them \u2013 you\u2019re either piling up votes needlessly for your candidate or barely making a dent in the majority of your opponent. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/campaigners-second-eu-referendum-plan-mass-tactical-vote\" title=\"\">Tactical voting</a> is thus nothing new, whether it is done directly by voting for a party you don\u2019t support, while knowing your own preference hasn\u2019t a hope, with a mind to stopping something worse, or indirectly, via the relatively recent phenomenon of sites such as Swap My Vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/tactical-voting-could-deliver-remain-victory-in-election-study\">Tactical voting website criticised for 'bogus' advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rarely has interest in tactical voting been as intense as it is for December\u2019s election, which is partly attributable to polarisation. These Conservatives, to mangle the <a href=\"https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2019/04/ms-brings-back-this-is-not-just-food-campaign/\" title=\"\">M&amp;S advert</a>, are not just any Conservatives: they are extraordinarily extreme, economically reckless, socially contemptuous (see Jacob Rees-Mogg and his views on the victims of Grenfell) and instinctively ethno-nationalist Conservatives. More people, across a greater range of political standpoints, will go to greater lengths to prevent a Boris Johnson government than one led by David Cameron. And on the other side of the coin \u2013 although it is facile to draw a direct equivalence of extremism \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour is considered far more dangerous by the right than Ed Miliband\u2019s ever was.</p> <p>Naturally, it is also Brexit that makes this election more consequential \u2013 whatever the outcome, many of us \u2013 give or take half the country, ho hum \u2013 will be deeply unhappy with it. So the understood norms of tactical voting \u2013 that it will be limited to marginal constituencies, that only 5-10% of voters will engage in it \u2013 will doubtless be stretched. But psephologist Chris Hanretty <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrishanretty/status/1189140129572671489\" title=\"\">warns</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrishanretty/status/1189140129572671489\" title=\"\"> against </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrishanretty/status/1189140129572671489\" title=\"\">exaggeration</a>: it\u2019s not an issue for the Tories because there\u2019s no challenger (the Brexit party is more of a bugbear; having no MPs, it presents no historical or quantifiable threat). So this is really only the preserve of Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters, with homeopathic quantities of Greens, which establishes the ceiling. Within that, there will be some who would never switch, and some who will cross the divide and go Labour to Tory (also bear in mind those who voted Lib Dem before but who are pro-Brexit). \u201cLet\u2019s say you can double it, there will still be no more than 15 to 20% of the electorate voting strategically,\u201d Hanretty predicts.</p> <p>Yet that\u2019s enough to change the result. <a href=\"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12130\" title=\"\">A study </a><a href=\"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12130\" title=\"\">four years ago</a> found that in 1997 tactical voting helped to elect nine Labour MPs and 21 Lib Dems (what\u2019s surprising about that research is, given the Labour landslide, people always assume Blair did the best out of the deal). Yet that same paper had a sting in its tail, estimating that up to 30% of tactical votes went in the wrong direction, away from the party that stood a good chance of winning, towards one that didn\u2019t.</p> <p>There is a huge amount of animus and posturing flying about right now: Lib Dems castigating the Labour party for their refusal to commit to remain, Labour supporters vowing never to support any party that was once (pretty recently, granted) in coalition with the Conservatives. Most of that is noise rather than signal.

      "bodyText": "It is rare, in a first-past-the-post electoral system, to live in a constituency where you can vote exactly as you choose and know you\u2019ve made an impact. In a safe seat \u2013 which is most of them \u2013 you\u2019re either piling up votes needlessly for your candidate or barely making a dent in the majority of your opponent. Tactical voting is thus nothing new, whether it is done directly by voting for a party you don\u2019t support, while knowing your own preference hasn\u2019t a hope, with a mind to stopping something worse, or indirectly, via the relatively recent phenomenon of sites such as Swap My Vote. Rarely has interest in tactical voting been as intense as it is for December\u2019s election, which is partly attributable to polarisation. These Conservatives, to mangle the M&amp;S advert, are not just any Conservatives: they are extraordinarily extreme, economically reckless, socially contemptuous (see Jacob Rees-Mogg and his views on the victims of Grenfell) and instinctively ethno-nationalist Conservatives. More people, across a greater range of political standpoints, will go to greater lengths to prevent a Boris Johnson government than one led by David Cameron. And on the other side of the coin \u2013 although it is facile to draw a direct equivalence of extremism \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour is considered far more dangerous by the right than Ed Miliband\u2019s ever was. Naturally, it is also Brexit that makes this election more consequential \u2013 whatever the outcome, many of us \u2013 give or take half the country, ho hum \u2013 will be deeply unhappy with it. So the understood norms of tactical voting \u2013 that it will be limited to marginal constituencies, that only 5-10% of voters will engage in it \u2013 will doubtless be stretched. But psephologist Chris Hanretty warns against exaggeration: it\u2019s not an issue for the Tories because there\u2019s no challenger (the Brexit party is more of a bugbear; having no MPs, it presents no historical or quantifiable threat). So this is really only the preserve of Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters, with homeopathic quantities of Greens, which establishes the ceiling. Within that, there will be some who would never switch, and some who will cross the divide and go Labour to Tory (also bear in mind those who voted Lib Dem before but who are pro-Brexit). \u201cLet\u2019s say you can double it, there will still be no more than 15 to 20% of the electorate voting strategically,\u201d Hanretty predicts. Yet that\u2019s enough to change the result. A study four years ago found that in 1997 tactical voting helped to elect nine Labour MPs and 21 Lib Dems (what\u2019s surprising about that research is, given the Labour landslide, people always assume Blair did the best out of the deal). Yet that same paper had a sting in its tail, estimating that up to 30% of tactical votes went in the wrong direction, away from the party that stood a good chance of winning, towards one that didn\u2019t. There is a huge amount of animus and posturing flying about right now: Lib Dems castigating the Labour party for their refusal to commit to remain, Labour supporters vowing never to support any party that was once (pretty recently, granted) in coalition with the Conservatives. Most of that is noise rather than signal. For any voter opposed to austerity, mindful of the climate crisis and anti-Brexit, the overwhelming impetus will be to avoid a Conservative majority, and for that they need not soul-deep certainty about the characters of Jo Swinson and Corbyn, but reliable, uncontested information. Typically, this starts with identifying marginals, but it is a little more complex than simply counting up majorities to find those under 5,000 (then there are ultra-marginals, with three-digit majorities).

Large, national opinion data used to be a reasonable way to forecast seats, but not any longer. People still do it, because the alternative is so expensive, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to tell us very much; the most accurate predictions, from the referendum to the Peterborough byelection, were all made using MRP. This is where you take a number of data points \u2013 how someone voted in 2017, in 2015, in the referendum, their sex, their level of education \u2013 then you figure out the number of people in that bracket in each constituency (this is the post-stratification).

Other dogs are yet to bark (People\u2019s Vote, most obviously, which is mired in its own crisis). Urgently needed is a site for the tactical climate vote \u2013 bespoke calculations not necessarily for Green voters but for anyone with the environment as their top priority.

That is, it\u2019s a memoir, but one told in the rebarbatively mannered style of his late trilogy of novels running from Umbrella to Phone \u2013 in which the narrative runs in great associative stream-of-consciousness skeins, shot through with buried quotations from song lyrics, inane catchphrases and second-order cliches ironised with italics and, especially where they end a sentence, preceded with the little drum-fill of an ellipsis. It could be that Self has decided that this is the best available narrative analogue for the working of the human mind, and that he\u2019s from now on determined to ... stick to it. To do it again ... annagain. Or it could be that he\u2019s fallen victim to the view that if you have a hammer everything looks ... like a nail. If you don\u2019t dig it, you won\u2019t dig this. I dug it in the fiction, but I only half dug it here: it has an evasive quality where memoir seems to ask for more directness; or, at least, a different sort of indirectness. And sometimes it just seems like an affectation.

      "bodyText": "Drive west from Doha\u2019s glistening glass towers, past two World Cup stadiums still under construction and out into the desert, and you\u2019ll eventually reach a small hospital surrounded only by sand and shrubs. At its entrance hang two flags rippling in the scorching breeze: one of Qatar, the other of Cuba. The hospital belongs to the Qatar government, but its entire medical staff \u2013 475 doctors, nurses and technicians \u2013 is from the Caribbean island half a world away. The Cuban hospital, as it is officially known, opened in 2012, boasting world class facilities and services. But there is one thing that is not up to international standards: the salaries the Cubans are paid. At just over $1,000 (\u00a3778) a month, they receive as little as 10% of what other foreign medical professionals can make working in government hospitals in Qatar. The remainder of their earnings are pocketed by the Cuban government under a secret deal with the Qataris. Neither the Qatari or Cuban authorities would reveal details of the agreement, but sources with knowledge of the hospital estimate Qatar pays Cuba between $5,000 and $10,000 a month for each medical professional. Cuba has been sending doctors around the world since the early 1960s; there are currently an estimated 30,000 Cuban doctors and nurses working in 60 countries. Starting with missions to Algeria and Chile, the programme has grown into a global exercise in soft power driven by humanitarian, political and economic goals. Cuban medical teams are often at the forefront of disaster relief efforts in Latin America. Leasing doctors to other countries is the main source of hard currency for Cuba\u2019s cash-strapped economy, earning the government $6-8bn a year \u2013 far more than it makes from tourism. In the past decade, partly prompted by declining revenue from its medical programme in Venezuela, Cuba has turned to new countries with no shortage of money: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In a similar arrangement with Brazil, the Cuban government was reportedly paid about $4,000 a month for each medic, of which the doctors received $1,000. When the rightwing Jair Bolsonaro, an opponent of Cuba, took power in Brazil last year, thousands of Cuban doctors left the country, prompting fears that poor areas of Brazil would be left without sufficient medical care. Cuba is not the only country that exports its citizens to earn foreign currency. North Korea has also sent workers to Qatar under a programme with some similarities. Although doctors sign up voluntarily to take part in the missions, US-based critics of the Cuban government say the programme is exploitative. \u201cI have no doubt that they are subject to a form of compelled labour \u2026 Cuba is a totalitarian state with a guaranteed pool of captive low-paid workers easily exploited as exportable commodities,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Werlau, the director of Cuba Archive, a Miami-based thinktank opposed to the Cuban administration. Werlau says Cuba\u2019s medics are victims of wage theft, passport confiscation, heavy surveillance and forced family separation. Amid deteriorating relations between the two countries, the US has recently increased criticism of the medical missions. In June, the State Department downgraded Cuba to the lowest tier of its Trafficking in Persons report, saying: \u201cThe [Cuban] government did not take action to address forced labour in the foreign medical missions programme, despite persistent allegations Cuban officials threatened and coerced some participants to remain in the programme.\u201d However, others argue the medical missions are highly-coveted opportunities in a country where doctors earn just $40 to $70 a month. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that they are being exploited,\u201d says John Kirk, professor of Spanish and Latin American studies at Dalhousie University in Canada. \u201cThey are earning significantly more than they would earn at home. They have been trained in a socialist system, have paid nothing for their medical training, and understand that the superior amount paid to the Cuban government is used to subsidise the healthcare system back in Cuba.\u201d The Guardian spoke to several medics at the Cuban hospital and some defended the system. \u201cI believe we should help everybody,\u201d says one. \u201cBased on that, yes it is fair, because I know that the other amount is used to support our health and education system \u2026 but if you think only of yourself, of course it\u2019s not fair.\u201d But a medic who defected from the mission in Qatar says he \u201cfelt like a slave\u201d on discovering that other doctors in the country were being paid more than him. \u201cWe were doing the same thing and earning far less than them.\u201d One reason doctors join the programme is that, even allowing for deductions made by their government, Qatar remains a lucrative and sought-after posting for Cuban healthcare professionals.

Anyone attempting to leave faces another problem: on arrival in Qatar, Cubans say they have to hand over their passports, a practice that is illegal in Qatar. Qatar recently announced reforms to its labour laws, which for the first time may allow workers to change jobs without their employer\u2019s permission, but it is unclear whether the Cuban medics will be free to find more lucrative work elsewhere in Qatar\u2019s healthcare system. Up until 2017, Cuban medical professionals who wanted to leave could seek asylum in a US embassy under a programme introduced by President George Bush in 2006. The defector from the Cuban hospital, who left in this way, says he knows of 16 others who did the same, though he was driven less by conditions in Qatar and more by the opportunity for a new life in America. Barack Obama withdrew the legislation just before he left office in 2017 as part of efforts to normalise relations with Cuba. \u201cNow they are trapped again,\u201d says the defector.

      "bodyText": "Leaked Signal messages from an online chat network around six-term Washington state Republican representative Matt Shea show new evidence of violent fantasies, surveillance of perceived adversaries, conspiracy thinking, Islamophobia and support for white nationalists. The messages from the chat group, exchanged between October 2017 and October 2018, show Shea\u2019s network includes other serving, former and aspiring rightwing politicians from Idaho and Washington, alongside activists associated with militia groups, anti-environmental causes and pro-gun activism. They also show participants, including Shea, preparing for economic and societal collapse even as they campaign for the secession of eastern Washington from the remainder of the state. The messages provide a rare insight into the inner workings \u2013 and paranoia \u2013 of the so-called patriot movement, whose members have participated in standoffs with the federal government in Nevada and Oregon, and whose far-right beliefs have been controversially promoted by Shea. Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at the progressive Western States Center, said of the chats: \u201cThe chat messages reveal Shea acting more like a militia leader than an elected official. His conspiratorial and violent mindset are on full display. If it was not already clear, Shea has demonstrated that he is unfit for public office. Now it\u2019s time for his colleagues in the Washington house of representatives to hold him accountable.\u201d Shea is currently under investigation by the Washington state house after reporting on his activities by the Guardian and local media outlets. The network The group chat the messages appeared in was repeatedly described by participants as an \u201cintel\u201d channel for sharing information among a large group of Shea\u2019s associates, including: Washington state representative Matt Shea, who posts in the chat under a frequently used online alias Verrumbellator. Two-term Idaho state representative Heather Scott. Former Spokane Valley councilman and Shea ally Mike Munch. Former Spokane Valley councilman and podcaster Caleb Collier. An account posting as \u201cMarble\u201d, attached to a phone number registered to Anne Byrd, who with husband Pastor Barry Byrd leads the secretive Marble Community church, headquartered in a compound in remote north-east Washington. Broadcaster and Shea lieutenant Jack Robertson, also known as John Jacob Schmidt. Patriot movement activist and Malheur standoff participant Anthony Bosworth. Bosworth runs a patriot movement group called Liberty For All, once ran for Yakima county sheriff, and was charged with assaulting his daughter in downtown Yakima. Also present in the chat were a number of rightwing activists, some from the region incorporating eastern Washington, north Idaho, and surrounding areas, which they have christened \u201cthe American Redoubt\u201d. These activists included: Former Spokane county employee and retired air force officer John Christina. Former candidate for Washington commissioner of public lands Steve McLaughlin, who told the SPLC in 2016 that he was pulling back from involvement the patriot movement Jay Pounder, a former Shea confidant who leaked the chats to the Guardian. Shea and the other sitting legislator, Heather Scott, are members of the chat for its entire length, and both weigh in on a wide range of topics. The Guardian confirmed participants by cross-checking phone numbers in the chat with public phone records. Civil war Participants frequently expressed a belief civil war was coming. In particular, they were exercised by false rumors of an \u201cantifa insurrection\u201d on 4 November 2017, which circulated widely in far-right and conservative media throughout the previous month. During that month, the chat also circulated false news, unattributed memes and fabricated intelligence about the supposedly impending insurrection. The Guardian previously reported on the messages of a smaller chat involving members of this larger group, which was also planning for the supposed antifa uprising. That chat saw Bosworth and Robertson fantasizing about sadistic violence, and promoting surveillance and opposition research about local activists. At one point in late October 2017, the larger chat took an unattributed meme listing supposed \u201cplanned riots\u201d in the region to be accurate. This led to chat members ventilating fantasies of a violent response. \u201cSometimes, ya just gotta go out and pick a fight with the philistines,\u201d Robertson wrote on 29 October 2017. \u201cKnock some heads. Bring back some foreskins. Lol!\u201d Later that day, Jack Robertson wrote: \u201cWe could have a contest \u2026 see how many communists we could knock out, before getting knocked out or arrested!\u201d Bosworth responded: \u201cOK. Now this is starting to sound fun.\u201d But there were no protests in the region, and only small ones in other parts of the country: peaceful events which had been planned by a group associated with the Revolutionary Communist party. Other events were taken as portents of civil war. In July 2018, when the Trump-backed congressional challenger Katie Arrington was badly injured in a car crash after ousting Mark Sanford in a primary, the chat took it as a sign of impending civil collapse. \u201cEvery day shows more and more we are sitting on the edge of civil war between two governmental factions. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make six years before we see shots fired,\u201d Bosworth remarked. Christina replied: \u201cAgreed. Banana republic sums it up quite well. Never thought I would see it come to my country in my lifetime.\u201d Islam and leftists Islam \u2013 a frequent bugbear in Shea\u2019s public speeches \u2013 is seen in dark hues by many members of the chat. Muslims and leftists are held to be working together to subvert the United States. Violent, paranoid reveries were aired about both groups by members of the chat. In December 2017, Robertson warned: \u201cExpect acid throwing attacks. Low tech, low cost. Effective and brutal. Since the announcement of moving out embassy to Jerusalem, things are about to get sporty. Be vigilant when you travel to large metro areas.\u201d In February 2018, after accepting as true faked photographs of the Parkland shooter Nicholas Cruz that depicted him as a leftist, the group ventilated more violent fantasies and conspiracy theories. \u201cThe communist bastards need to be shot,\u201d Bosworth wrote. \u201cCommunist Islam,\u201d Shea responded. In May 2018, Shea wrote: \u201cPlease remember tomorrow is the first day of Ramadan begins Tuesday/Wednesday. Higher likelihood of terror attacks.\u201d Robertson days later wrote: \u201cWow. Ramadan began yesterday. Avoid crowds when possible, be vigilant, stay armed, and keep a combat rifle accessible when practical.\u201d Leftists are equally feared and despised in the chats. In June 2018, the chat responded to news of the occupation of an Ice facility in Portland with more fantasies of violence and vigilantism. Bosworth said of potential police violence at the facility: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with federal agents clubbing them.

It\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to do it. It is ours, the rightful heirs to liberty fought and won by our founders.\u201d Requests for surveillance on perceived political opponents also permeate the chat, many coming from Shea. He asked whether a local conservative is a \u201cfriend or foe\u201d and at one point Bosworth shared images of what appears to be the FBI file of a Shea critic. Liberty state A central topic in the chats is the campaign to carve out a 51st state from eastern Washington, to be named Liberty state. The campaign for Liberty state has underpinned activism in the Shea network, but has also provoked fears among opponents who believe that proponents are seeking to implement a dominionist theocracy. At one point Bosworth asked if they can shake off federal and state control: \u201cPeople need to know what the new state is going to look like. Is it going to operate without federal control? If so our first step would be to show the people of the new state that we can operate without Olympia\u2019s control.\u201d Later in the chat, McLaughlin offered a view of what a successful Liberty state movement would look like: \u201cPeople standing up and applying the elements of power to undo lies, destroy the commie movement and taking political control.

Heather Scott replied: \u201cSounds like the name of a rock band.\u201d Bosworth replied: \u201cI\u2019m all for Christians doing some skull stomping in defense of their faith.\u201d G2 Apart from direct participants, the chat sees the repeated dissemination of intelligence from outside sources.

His prognostications were of intense interest to the group, including Shea, and taken to indicate impending global catastrophe.

Solicitations of G2\u2019s advice occur throughout the chats, and members treat him as an authoritative source. On 6 November 2017, Shea asked: \u201cA lot coming out right now about DPRK [North Korea].

It explicitly forbids the identification of a whistleblower by an inspector general, unless \u201c\u2026 the Inspector General determines such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation [of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations]\u201d.</p> <p>It also forbids other government employees \u2013 presumably including a president \u2013 from taking action that could be viewed as a \u201creprisal\u201d for their whistleblowing.</p> <p>Other laws exist too, especially for intelligence workers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, passed in 1998, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and subsequent presidential directives also contain specifics for persons who work with classified information, including protecting their identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/03/whistleblower-lawyer-cia-official-republican-questions-trump-ukraine-impeachment\">Trump rejects whistleblower offer to answer Republican questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnti-reprisal is sort of the core concept that\u2019s across many of these provisions,\u201d explained John Kostyack, the National Whistleblower Center\u2019s executive director, saying an underlying principle \u201cis the idea of anonymity or confidentiality\u201d.</p> <p>But the provisions that should protect intelligence whistleblowers \u201care general and subject to multiple interpretations\u201d, the center notes. The inspector general is mostly barred from releasing a whistleblower\u2019s name but other government officials are not explicitly prohibited from doing so.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and his allies have publicly attacked a whistleblower who filed a complaint about the president\u2019s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and triggered a chain of events that led to an impeachment inquiry of the president. But experts believe that the aggressive strategy is a highly risky one, both in terms of flirting with breaking laws around protecting whistleblowers but also in potentially doing lasting damage to a whistleblowing system set up to keep the powerful in check and provide a safe way of exposing the wrongdoing of America\u2019s politicians and government officials. Not that Trump and his allies have shown much concern over such fears. In addition to going after the credibility of this whistleblower \u2013 whose account has been repeatedly corroborated by witnesses in closed-door congressional hearings \u2013 Trump and his allies have pushed for the whistleblower to be identified. Indeed several of his most prominent supporters and inner circle have tweeted what they say is the whistleblower\u2019s name. The whistleblower\u2019s defenders, as well as experts in government accountability, contend that naming the person would flout legal protections, such as anonymity, for government employees who come forward about alleged wrongdoing. One law governing intelligence whistleblowers, the Inspector General Act of 1978, empowers federal agencies\u2019 respective watchdogs (called inspectors general), to investigate tips about potential wrongdoing and lays out protections, including confidentiality. It explicitly forbids the identification of a whistleblower by an inspector general, unless \u201c\u2026 the Inspector General determines such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation [of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations]\u201d. It also forbids other government employees \u2013 presumably including a president \u2013 from taking action that could be viewed as a \u201creprisal\u201d for their whistleblowing. Other laws exist too, especially for intelligence workers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, passed in 1998, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and subsequent presidential directives also contain specifics for persons who work with classified information, including protecting their identity. \u201cAnti-reprisal is sort of the core concept that\u2019s across many of these provisions,\u201d explained John Kostyack, the National Whistleblower Center\u2019s executive director, saying an underlying principle \u201cis the idea of anonymity or confidentiality\u201d. But the provisions that should protect intelligence whistleblowers \u201care general and subject to multiple interpretations\u201d, the center notes. The inspector general is mostly barred from releasing a whistleblower\u2019s name but other government officials are not explicitly prohibited from doing so. These federal laws also only govern federal employees\u2019 treatment of whistleblowers. The media and private persons are not barred from revealing whistleblowers\u2019 names, though news organizations overwhelmingly refrain from doing so. If revealing a whistleblower\u2019s identity is a form of retaliation, however, then there are \u201cserious legal problems\u201d for people who do name them. \u201cConsidering all of the threats that are being made against the whistleblower,\u201d Kostyack said, \u201cnaming the whistleblower is a form of reprisal.\u201d Experts agree the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal has more reason than most to believe their anonymity is protected by the law: their account has been subsequently corroborated by multiple other witnesses closer to events. That means any naming of the whistleblower could more easily be framed as retaliation. \u201cWith this whistleblower right now, this person\u2019s testimony isn\u2019t even necessary at this point, so there\u2019s no reason whatsoever for the [identity] of this person to be revealed,\u201d said Louis Clark, executive director and CEO of the Government Accountability Project. Reuben Guttmann, a veteran whistleblower attorney, voiced similar sentiments. \u201cIn a situation where the inspector general finds better information than the whistleblower has, then the whistleblower\u2019s testimony or information becomes irrelevant,\u201d Guttman said. \u201cIt appears to me that this whistleblower\u2019s not going to be needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is essentially retaliation against the whistleblower.\u201d Several former federal officials told NPR that Trump naming a whistleblower wouldn\u2019t be a criminal act. But Guttman contends that naming a whistleblower could lead to an article of impeachment or theoretically, be considered breaking criminal law, if naming the whistleblower was meant to obstruct justice. But the impact of the flurry of criticism and online identification of the whistleblower has implications far beyond the Ukraine scandal and the current impeachment saga. Experts and whistleblowers said Trump and his supporters\u2019 handling of the situation will have a chilling effect on others who want to come forward about wrongdoing. \u201cWhistleblowers are a check and balance of last resort,\u201d said Sherron Watkins, who blew the whistle on accounting fraud at Enron. \u201cTo me, when we seek out the messenger, the whistleblower, we\u2019re doing the wrong thing. \u201cThe more we persecute them, ruin their lives, let their name [be published],\u201d she continued, \u201cIt is concerning to me we will wipe away this check and balance of last resort.\u201d Frank Serpico, who memorably exposed corruption in the New York police department, offered a bleak view of the situation. \u201cWhistleblowers will always be treated the way they are,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey do this because, as a whole, whatever the organization is, they want to discourage it \u2013 because it affects whatever shenanigans they\u2019ve got going on. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that way,\u201d he said.",

In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.</p>\n    <p>Under Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups.</p>\n    <p>But Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.</p>\n    <p>When \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d.

But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.</p>\n    <p>Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the town of La Mora, about 70 miles south of the Arizona border, nobody is sure what exactly provoked Monday\u2019s attacks.</p> \n<p>Mexican officials have speculated that cartel gunmen mistook the group of women and children for members of a rival armed group.</p> \n<p>The region is understood to be the site of a battle for dominance between an organized crime group known as La L\u00ednea, based in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Chihuahua, and another group known as Los Salazar based in Sonora and affiliated with the Sinaloa cartel.</p> \n<p>But the eight children who survived \u2013 several of them with serious gunshot wounds \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/06/mexico-massacre-child-survivors-mormon\">told a story of senseless violence</a>, in which one of the women got out of her SUV to signal that they were women and children, only to be shot dead.</p> \n<p>The man in the audio recording \u2013 identified by a source as Kenneth Miller Sr \u2013described the aftermath of the attack, in which a search party from La Mora set out to find the missing families, only to turn back when they realized gunmen they suspect belonged to the Chihuahua faction were still in position on a nearby hilltop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e8c297709dc01472967083953386886296647305\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8c297709dc01472967083953386886296647305/0_0_3258_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A convoy of SUVs at the victims\u2019 funerals on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A convoy of SUVs at the victims\u2019 funerals on Thursday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPretty soon, here comes the Sonoran guys. Literally 50, 60 [of them] and they waited there. And they were a little nervous, too. So until they coked up \u2013 when they finally got brave to go \u2013 they went on in and we followed,\u201d he said in the recording, which was shared via WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>Relatives of the victims acknowledge that the security situation in the region had started to deteriorate as the rival crime groups battled to control the isolated road running north towards the frontier.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe tensions have escalated in the last few months. The Chihuahua side and the Sonora side have been battling over this route for a while now,\u201d Miller Jr said. \u201cThe Chihuahua side is trying to move in because this is a huge smuggling route through here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brent LeBar\u00f3n, whose aunt and cousins were killed in Monday\u2019s attack, said the first sign something was amiss came earlier this year, when American relatives traveling to a funeral in the region inadvertently drove through a cartel checkpoint \u2013 provoking a chase and a warning.</p> \n<p>Other warnings came \u201cthrough the grapevine\u201d, he said. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re fighting over turf and access to roads and getting their drugs to the border.\u201d</p> \n<p>This week\u2019s attack was not the first time the LeBar\u00f3n family had been targeted. A decade ago, a boy was kidnapped from the town of Colonia LeBar\u00f3n, which the family founded in Chihuahua. On that occasion,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/world/americas/26mexico.html\"> the family refused to pay a ransom and barricaded the town</a>, forcing the captors to free the boy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/mexico-funeral-mormons-killed-drug-cartel-attack\">Mexico: hymns and tears as victims of attack on Mormon families are buried</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But soon after, cartel henchmen returned and seized Benjam\u00edn LeBar\u00f3n \u2013 who had become prominent as an anti-crime activist \u2013 and his brother-in-law Luis Widmar.</p> \n<p>The two men were dragged from their homes and killed \u2013 but few in the family express regret that they stood up to the gunmen.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you pay one, you\u2019re going to get 10 more.

      "bodyText": "Amid the scrubby foothills of Sonora\u2019s Sierra Madre mountains, they farmed pomegranates and pistachios, raised large families and preached a fundamentalist Mormon faith. For years, the small community of La Mora also maintained an uneasy peace with the mafia gangs who dominate this part of northern Mexico: identifying themselves at cartel checkpoints and avoiding the region\u2019s lonely dirt roads after dark. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been stopped on the road \u2013 cartel groups just wanting to know who we are,\u201d said Kenneth Miller Jr, a resident of the little town. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had to worry about much. We were always warned beforehand if there was stuff going on in the area.\u201d But if the Mormons ever thought they would be protected by the US passports which most of them hold, any such illusions were shattered this week. Six children and three women \u2013 all US citizens \u2013 were massacred on a dirt road nearby, when gunmen ambushed their convoy of SUVs, killing children at point-blank range and shooting one mother as she begged for their lives. \u201cThey shot the shit out of my grandchildren, my daughters, daughter-in-law \u2013 just burned them to a crisp,\u201d said an anguished member of the family in a voice message shared among relatives, which was passed on to the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. Just a few bones.\u201d The massacre prompted Donald Trump to call for \u201cWAR\u201d against the cartels, mounding pressure on Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president whose discourse has forgone the militarized strategy of his predecessors in favor of a vaguely defined strategy of moral renovation. But the incident has also thrust the isolated Mormon communities into the spotlight, highlighting their long history in a harsh corner of the country, their origins as religious renegades fleeing US laws against polygamy \u2013 and their more recent brushes with Mexican drug cartels. In the town of La Mora, about 70 miles south of the Arizona border, nobody is sure what exactly provoked Monday\u2019s attacks. Mexican officials have speculated that cartel gunmen mistook the group of women and children for members of a rival armed group. The region is understood to be the site of a battle for dominance between an organized crime group known as La L\u00ednea, based in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Chihuahua, and another group known as Los Salazar based in Sonora and affiliated with the Sinaloa cartel. But the eight children who survived \u2013 several of them with serious gunshot wounds \u2013 told a story of senseless violence, in which one of the women got out of her SUV to signal that they were women and children, only to be shot dead. The man in the audio recording \u2013 identified by a source as Kenneth Miller Sr \u2013described the aftermath of the attack, in which a search party from La Mora set out to find the missing families, only to turn back when they realized gunmen they suspect belonged to the Chihuahua faction were still in position on a nearby hilltop. \u201cPretty soon, here comes the Sonoran guys. Literally 50, 60 [of them] and they waited there. And they were a little nervous, too. So until they coked up \u2013 when they finally got brave to go \u2013 they went on in and we followed,\u201d he said in the recording, which was shared via WhatsApp. Relatives of the victims acknowledge that the security situation in the region had started to deteriorate as the rival crime groups battled to control the isolated road running north towards the frontier. \u201cThe tensions have escalated in the last few months. The Chihuahua side and the Sonora side have been battling over this route for a while now,\u201d Miller Jr said. \u201cThe Chihuahua side is trying to move in because this is a huge smuggling route through here.\u201d Brent LeBar\u00f3n, whose aunt and cousins were killed in Monday\u2019s attack, said the first sign something was amiss came earlier this year, when American relatives traveling to a funeral in the region inadvertently drove through a cartel checkpoint \u2013 provoking a chase and a warning. Other warnings came \u201cthrough the grapevine\u201d, he said. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re fighting over turf and access to roads and getting their drugs to the border.\u201d This week\u2019s attack was not the first time the LeBar\u00f3n family had been targeted. A decade ago, a boy was kidnapped from the town of Colonia LeBar\u00f3n, which the family founded in Chihuahua. On that occasion, the family refused to pay a ransom and barricaded the town, forcing the captors to free the boy. But soon after, cartel henchmen returned and seized Benjam\u00edn LeBar\u00f3n \u2013 who had become prominent as an anti-crime activist \u2013 and his brother-in-law Luis Widmar. The two men were dragged from their homes and killed \u2013 but few in the family express regret that they stood up to the gunmen. \u201cIf you pay one, you\u2019re going to get 10 more. It was stance we had to take as a community,\u201d said Brent LeBar\u00f3n as he travelled to La Mora on Thursday for the victims\u2019 funerals. \u201cThat\u2019s why it got so much fame \u2026 because, hey, we\u2019re not going to stand for this. And if you can\u2019t protect us, then try to come in and take our farms or take us out of our farms.\u201d Such words reflect a frontier ethos influenced by the family\u2019s American roots \u2013 but also the fact most in the family are dual US-Mexican citizens. Brent LeBar\u00f3n acknowledged that in the past their status had made Mexican authorities more ready to react \u2013 \u201cit becomes a bigger problem with dual citizens being attacked.\u201d That was not the case on Monday, when it took police and army eight hours to reach the site of the attack. But in a country where victims\u2019 families usually remain silent for fear of retaliation \u2013 or stigmatized as somehow being complicit in the violence against them \u2013 the LeBar\u00f3ns and other Mormon families have made their voices heard. \u201cYes, death sucks, but we\u2019re not afraid of it and we\u2019re willing to defend what\u2019s ours: our rights and the right to life and happiness and the pursuit of it,\u201d said Brent LeBar\u00f3n. Despite the harsh surroundings, families in Mexico\u2019s Mormon colonies have prospered over the years. Many of the men work as roofers, framers and drywallers in the United States, then invest their earnings into pecan orchards and chili fields back in Mexico. But they trace their origins to 1876, when the Mormon prophet Brigham Young sent exploratory teams at a time the church was trying to escape US prohibitions on polygamy and evangelize in Mexico and Latin America, said Jeffrey Jones, a former Mexican senator and distant relative of a leader from the original expedition. Some of the community still belong to the official LDS church, though many still worship in unaffiliated congregations, said Brent LeBar\u00f3n, although he said the practice of polygamy is \u201cfading\u201d. The first settlers grew apples and peaches in nine colonies on the high plains \u2013 until the revolution of 1910 erupted. Revolutionary leaders ordered the settlers to disarm, prompting a mass exodus, said Jones \u2013 who resides on the same property in Colonia Dubl\u00e1n, the birthplace of George Romney, father of 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Some modern-day Mexican Mormons express similar fears of being unprotected in a country which has strict gun-control laws but is awash with illegal weapons. \u201cIf the Mexican government made it so a civilian could own a firearm, I truly believe all this stuff would calm down a lot quicker than anyone would realize,\u201d said Miller Jr. But another family member, Alex LeBar\u00f3n, pointed out that many of the weapons used in Mexico\u2019s raging drug wars come from north of the border. After Donald Trump tweeted \u201cyou sometimes need an army to defeat an army\u201d, he replied: \u201cWant to help some more? Stop the ATF and gun law loopholes from systematically injecting high-powered assault weapons to Mexico.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of children in care whose immigration status will be affected by Brexit could find themselves in the UK unlawfully, facing homelessness, immigration detention or deportation, an immigration legal charity has said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://gmiau.org/\">Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit</a> (GMIAU) warned that the EU settlement scheme for European nationals living in the UK who want to stay here after Brexit is designed for people leading ordered, uncomplicated lives who can easily access ID documents, not children with disrupted life histories who are less likely to have proof of nationality or previous addresses. Some original documents may remain with their parents, who may not be in the UK, some social workers may not know which documents were needed or how to get them.</p> <p>The charity attempted to work with local authorities over two days to help EU national looked-after children and care leavers to apply for the scheme, but were unable to make a single application. Two of the children they attempted to help were unlikely to ever have the required evidence, despite most of them meeting the requirements of \u201csettled status\u201d or British citizenship.</p> <p>The charity is calling for the Home Office to adopt an automatic system of settled status and the option to register for a document to prove it. They also say fees for citizenship applications should be waived for children in care and care leavers, to ease the financial burden on local authorities. The report also urges children\u2019s services and leaving care teams, which have a duty as corporate parents, to seek immigration advice on behalf of the children who will be affected.</p> <p>If children do not have their immigration status resolved before they turn 18, it can become significantly more difficult and expensive. Several <a href=\"https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/children-s-care-services/looked-after-children/13-019-106\">investigations</a> <a href=\"https://www.lgo.org.uk/decisions/children-s-care-services/looked-after-children/15-015-327\">have found</a> that local authorities failed to support looked-after children with their immigration issues. GMIAU estimates there are about 10,000 children in care and care leavers who are EU nationals, although local authorities do not routinely collect nationality data on the children in their care.</p> <p>Amanda Shah, the policy officer at GMIAU, said the findings \u201cshould sound alarm bells in central and local government\u201d, warning that \u201ca new generation is at risk of being thrown to the hostile environment\u201d.</p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/18/thousands-of-children-could-become-undocumented-after-brexit-new-windrush-generation\">comparisons have been drawn with the Windrush scandal</a> \u2013 where those who were in the UK legally struggled to prove it. She added: \u201cIf the lessons of this report are not acted upon, vulnerable young people will be left struggling to access services, at risk of homelessness, facing immigration detention or being removed from the UK. This is the future for children and young people in the care of local authorities without action now.\u201d</p> <p>EU nationals in the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families\" title=\"\">must have applied</a> for settled status before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, if they want to continue living and working here. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/eu-nationals-lacking-settled-status-could-be-deported-minister-says\">threatened EU citizens with deportation</a> if they failed to apply by the end of 2020.</p> <p>Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \u201cThis report highlights so many of the pitfalls of the government\u2019s scheme. Bureaucratic processing, the \u2018hostile environment\u2019, the insistence on non-existent documentation and the breach of rights of people entitled to be here were all a feature of the Windrush scandal.\u201d</p> <p>She warned that the Conservatives \u201cseem intent\u201d on repeating injustices faced by the Windrush generation \u201con a much larger scale with EU citizens\u201d. She said: \u201cOnly Labour will end the hostile environment and introduce an immigration system based on upholding rights and the needs of our society.\u201d</p> <p>Afzal Khan, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton and shadow immigration minister, said it was \u201chigh time the home secretary took action to protect these vulnerable young people\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Tories have been unwilling to listen to calls from the Labour party and across parliament to implement a declaratory scheme for EU citizens. As a bare minimum, they could grant automatic settled status to all looked-after EU children and care leavers.\u201d</p> <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.childrenslegalcentre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EUSS-briefing_Mar2019_FINAL.pdf\">a report</a> in March from Coram Children\u2019s Legal Centre, a children\u2019s legal charity, the issue was <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-09-03/debates/505E5FF3-0E9B-43BD-9AFD-72AD201FB365/EUSettlementSchemeLooked-AfterChildrenAndCareLeavers\">debated in the House of Commons</a> in September. The EU settlement scheme has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/ive-been-here-50-years-the-eu-citizens-struggling-for-the-right-to-stay-in-britain\">previously faced criticism</a> for IT glitches, only being accessible on an Android phone until recent weeks and being overly bureaucratic. Labour has repeatedly warned of creating another Windrush crisis, and Conservative and Brexit-supporting MEP Daniel Hannan has also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/1166850898179624967?lang=en\">issued warnings</a>.</p> <p>The Home Office says it is committed to supporting those who are most vulnerable, such as looked-after children, to obtain status. A spokesperson said that applicants can apply to the scheme without an identity document where they are unable to provide one due to \u201ccompelling compassionate or practical reasons, or circumstances beyond their control\u201d.</p> <p>They added: \u201cThe government has also confirmed that it will make provision for those who have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, including children whose parent or guardian has failed to submit an application on their behalf.\u201d</p> <h2>Case study</h2> <p>Anna, 15, is originally from Latvia. She came to the UK when she was eight and has been in the care of children\u2019s services for the past three years. She lives with foster carers in Greater Manchester. Marie, her social worker, has been aware for some time that Brexit immigration changes will affect Anna but she has been unsure what the changes mean and what she needs to do to support her. Marie met a solicitor from the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, but at the appointment Anna wasn\u2019t able to make an application to the EU Settlement scheme because she didn\u2019t have the required documentation. The only ID document Anna has is her Latvian passport, which had expired, and so did not count as a valid piece of ID for the Home Office application. When Marie contacted the nearest Latvian embassy to apply for a new passport for Anna, she was told it will take two months. She will need to submit the expired passport, which means Anna will have no ID in the meantime.</p> <p>Anna will also need written evidence of how long she has been in the UK. Marie can write a letter to cover the time Anna has been in care but this only covers three years \u2013 not the five years needed for an application for settled status. She will contact schools, doctors\u2019 surgeries and health visitors to try to get evidence of the additional years Anna has been in the UK so that she can get the settled status to which she is entitled, rather than the lesser pre-settled status, which means she wouldn\u2019t be able to access certain benefits and would need to reapply for settled status in the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of children in care whose immigration status will be affected by Brexit could find themselves in the UK unlawfully, facing homelessness, immigration detention or deportation, an immigration legal charity has said. The Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU) warned that the EU settlement scheme for European nationals living in the UK who want to stay here after Brexit is designed for people leading ordered, uncomplicated lives who can easily access ID documents, not children with disrupted life histories who are less likely to have proof of nationality or previous addresses. Some original documents may remain with their parents, who may not be in the UK, some social workers may not know which documents were needed or how to get them. The charity attempted to work with local authorities over two days to help EU national looked-after children and care leavers to apply for the scheme, but were unable to make a single application. Two of the children they attempted to help were unlikely to ever have the required evidence, despite most of them meeting the requirements of \u201csettled status\u201d or British citizenship. The charity is calling for the Home Office to adopt an automatic system of settled status and the option to register for a document to prove it. They also say fees for citizenship applications should be waived for children in care and care leavers, to ease the financial burden on local authorities. The report also urges children\u2019s services and leaving care teams, which have a duty as corporate parents, to seek immigration advice on behalf of the children who will be affected. If children do not have their immigration status resolved before they turn 18, it can become significantly more difficult and expensive. Several investigations have found that local authorities failed to support looked-after children with their immigration issues. GMIAU estimates there are about 10,000 children in care and care leavers who are EU nationals, although local authorities do not routinely collect nationality data on the children in their care. Amanda Shah, the policy officer at GMIAU, said the findings \u201cshould sound alarm bells in central and local government\u201d, warning that \u201ca new generation is at risk of being thrown to the hostile environment\u201d. She said comparisons have been drawn with the Windrush scandal \u2013 where those who were in the UK legally struggled to prove it. She added: \u201cIf the lessons of this report are not acted upon, vulnerable young people will be left struggling to access services, at risk of homelessness, facing immigration detention or being removed from the UK. This is the future for children and young people in the care of local authorities without action now.\u201d EU nationals in the UK must have applied for settled status before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, if they want to continue living and working here. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has threatened EU citizens with deportation if they failed to apply by the end of 2020. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \u201cThis report highlights so many of the pitfalls of the government\u2019s scheme. Bureaucratic processing, the \u2018hostile environment\u2019, the insistence on non-existent documentation and the breach of rights of people entitled to be here were all a feature of the Windrush scandal.\u201d She warned that the Conservatives \u201cseem intent\u201d on repeating injustices faced by the Windrush generation \u201con a much larger scale with EU citizens\u201d. She said: \u201cOnly Labour will end the hostile environment and introduce an immigration system based on upholding rights and the needs of our society.\u201d Afzal Khan, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton and shadow immigration minister, said it was \u201chigh time the home secretary took action to protect these vulnerable young people\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Tories have been unwilling to listen to calls from the Labour party and across parliament to implement a declaratory scheme for EU citizens. As a bare minimum, they could grant automatic settled status to all looked-after EU children and care leavers.\u201d Following a report in March from Coram Children\u2019s Legal Centre, a children\u2019s legal charity, the issue was debated in the House of Commons in September. The EU settlement scheme has previously faced criticism for IT glitches, only being accessible on an Android phone until recent weeks and being overly bureaucratic. Labour has repeatedly warned of creating another Windrush crisis, and Conservative and Brexit-supporting MEP Daniel Hannan has also issued warnings. The Home Office says it is committed to supporting those who are most vulnerable, such as looked-after children, to obtain status. A spokesperson said that applicants can apply to the scheme without an identity document where they are unable to provide one due to \u201ccompelling compassionate or practical reasons, or circumstances beyond their control\u201d. They added: \u201cThe government has also confirmed that it will make provision for those who have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, including children whose parent or guardian has failed to submit an application on their behalf.\u201d Case study Anna, 15, is originally from Latvia. She came to the UK when she was eight and has been in the care of children\u2019s services for the past three years. She lives with foster carers in Greater Manchester. Marie, her social worker, has been aware for some time that Brexit immigration changes will affect Anna but she has been unsure what the changes mean and what she needs to do to support her. Marie met a solicitor from the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, but at the appointment Anna wasn\u2019t able to make an application to the EU Settlement scheme because she didn\u2019t have the required documentation. The only ID document Anna has is her Latvian passport, which had expired, and so did not count as a valid piece of ID for the Home Office application. When Marie contacted the nearest Latvian embassy to apply for a new passport for Anna, she was told it will take two months. She will need to submit the expired passport, which means Anna will have no ID in the meantime. Anna will also need written evidence of how long she has been in the UK. Marie can write a letter to cover the time Anna has been in care but this only covers three years \u2013 not the five years needed for an application for settled status. She will contact schools, doctors\u2019 surgeries and health visitors to try to get evidence of the additional years Anna has been in the UK so that she can get the settled status to which she is entitled, rather than the lesser pre-settled status, which means she wouldn\u2019t be able to access certain benefits and would need to reapply for settled status in the future.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to your daily dose of news. Over the next five weeks we\u2019ll be running special election editions of the morning briefing, bringing you a round-up of news from the campaign trails, as well as a wrap of non-election news as well. As usual, we\u2019ll be bringing you the day\u2019s politics news as it breaks. What\u2019s going on? The parties have started unveiling their plans and promises as leaders travel the country laying out their stalls for the election. Boris Johnson has announced a plan for half-price visas and preferential immigration processes for doctors and nurses wanting to work in the UK. The new NHS visa would cost just \u00a3464 and would operate under a fast-track process, with applicants guaranteed a decision within two weeks. Labour has unveiled its strategy to improve equality in the workplace, pledging to introduce maternity pay for a full year after the birth of a child and give workers the right to choose hours that suit them, putting the onus on employers to explain why they cannot offer flexible working hours. The announcement comes as the shock of Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as deputy leader of the Labour party continues to ripple through the party. Watson\u2019s allies have called his decision a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the centre of the party, with one saying \u201cit leaves some of us feeling abandoned. Tom was our shield.\u201d The race to replace him has already begun, with Dawn Butler, the women\u2019s and equalities shadow minister, the first to announce she would be throwing her hat in the ring for the job. Rajeev Syal has written this guide to the runners and riders for the job. Both parties have been warned by the Institute of Fiscal Studies about their ambitious spending promises, saying that the public spending bidding war may return infrastructure investment back to 1970s levels, but could also be undeliverable. The list of candidates who have stood down for inappropriate behaviour has grown, after a former radio host running as a Conservative candidate for Broadland in Norfolk withdrew from the race after saying women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape and a Labour candidate who had been standing for Gordon in Aberdeenshire announced she would no longer run after it emerged she had made comments comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, was among those told this week by the national executive committee that he would not be endorsed as a Labour candidate over his support for people protesting the teaching of LGBT equality classes at a local school. He has confirmed he will run as an Independent Labour candidate. At a glance Plaid Cymru, the Greens and the Lib Dems have announced details of their agreement to stand aside for each other, so only one candidate from their pro-remain parties will be standing in each seat. The deal seems to heavily favour the Lib Dems. Boris Johnson has made a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge that he will not allow Scotland to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of the election result, saying \u201cpeople were promised in 2014 that it would be a once-in-a-generation event and I see no reason why we should go back on that pledge.\u201d Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has insisted her party can win even in places that voted to leave the EU, while on a visit to Somerset. For your definitive guide to how the parties are shaping up for the election, the Guardian\u2019s politics team have pulled together this guide to the parties\u2019 policies, preparedness and campaign strategies. The day ahead Nigel Farage is heading to Wales and will be attending a rally for the Brexit party in Pontypool at around midday and then another at Newport in the evening. Labour will be holding a lunchtime event in Stevenage featuring Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, who announced last night she would be throwing her hat into the ring for the job of deputy Labour leader. Jo Swinson is in Fife and Boris Johnson is on pooled visits, though it\u2019s unclear exactly where. Best of the rest &gt; Dozens of people have spent the night in Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield after torrential rain caused severe flooding around the complex, making roads impassable, causing the cancellation of trains and forcing homes to be evacuated. &gt; A book by an anonymous \u201csenior official\u201d at the White House has described Donald Trump as being like a \u201c12-year-old in an air traffic control tower\u201d, according to the Washington Post. And Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has opened the door to a possible run against Trump next year. &gt; A forensic scientist has told the jury in the murder trial of Grace Millane that blood found in the accused\u2019s hotel room most likely came from the British backpacker killed in Auckland last year. Today in Focus podcast: Inside the youth justice system The Guardian\u2019s north of England team has spent a month investigating the youth justice system in England and Wales, in which children as young as 10 are put on trial. Today in Focus joined the editor Helen Pidd in a youth court on the final day. And: Jonathan Freedland on the shambolic start to the general election campaign Lunchtime read: I do like Green Eggs and Ham The riotous world of the Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham has been brought triumphantly to life in a new Netflix series starring, among others, Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton. Our TV reviewer Lucy Mangan delights in the animation\u2019s emotional twists and turns and says it is worthy of the \u201cgreat doctor himself\u201d. Sport Manchester United are through to the last 32 of the Europa League after beating Partizan, with the Red Devils\u2019 strikers drawing praise from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. And Liverpool\u2019s resilience faces its biggest test, Jamie Vardy threatens to deepen Arsenal\u2019s gloom and a welcome dilemma for Newcastle \u2013 these are among the 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend. And still on the top-of-the-table clash, Manchester City fear a repeat bus attack after flagging a social media post asking Liverpool fans to line the potential route of City\u2019s team coach to Anfield on Sunday. In motor sport, Jamie Chadwick has expressed her admiration for Lewis Hamilton but concedes her aim of reaching Formula One won\u2019t be easy. And the former All Black Sonny Bill Williams has completed his record signing with Super League newcomers Toronto Wolfpack. Business Just as hopes rise that a US-China trade deal can avert a global recession, today\u2019s long read examines how the next big downturn could be caused by the extraordinary success and power of the big technology companies. Rana Foroohar, an American business writer, argues that their accumulation of huge amounts of corporate debt makes big tech, not big banks, the new too-big-to-fail industry.

      "body": "<p>Eric did not imagine this would be how he would spend his first <a href=\"https://blizzcon.com/en-gb/\">BlizzCon</a>. The 26-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a> (WoW) player from Glendale, California, was at the annual fan event in Anaheim held by Blizzard, the games company behind global hits such as Warcraft, Overwatch and more. Each year, more than 35,000 people pack into the city\u2019s vast convention centre to play games, attend talks and share in their fandom.</p> <p>But at this year\u2019s event, held last weekend, there was a different feel. Instead of WoW cosplay, Eric was sporting a mask as worn by Hong Kong protesters to shield their faces from tear gas and facial recognition. And rather than joining in with the hype during panels about the forthcoming World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion, he was outside the convention centre handing out \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d flyers, adorned with the protestors\u2019 adopted symbol, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/overwatch-how-blizzard-redefined-the-first-person-shooter\">Overwatch</a> character Mei.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/11/im-a-blizzard-gamer-i-am-boycotting-them-over-their-hong-kong-censorship\">I'm a Blizzard gamer. I am boycotting them over their Hong Kong censorship | Dylan Curran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eric has joined the protest group <a href=\"https://www.gamersforfreedom.com/\">Gamers for Freedom</a>, which he discovered though YouTube. \u201cI figured, I live out here, and I ought to do something I care about,\u201d he explains. \u201cI care about Blizzard games, but I also know the situation in Hong Kong is dire. I want businesses to listen to us, and know there are consequences when they make decisions.\u201d</p> <p>For the past month, the US game developer Blizzard has been engulfed in a political controversy. In October, after a major tournament for the company\u2019s game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/hearthstone-blizzard-strategy-trading-cards-greg-austin\">Hearthstone</a>, esports champion Ng \u201cblitzchung\u201d Wai Chung, who is from Hong Kong, used a livestreamed interview to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/blitzchung-hearthstone-blizzard-banned-hong-kong-protests\">state his support for protestors in his country</a>. Blizzard\u2019s punishment for expressing this view on their official channel, which doesn\u2019t allow political messages, was to issue him with a year\u2019s ban and revoke his $10,000 prize winnings.</p> <p>The decision provoked global outrage from fans, US senators and Blizzard\u2019s own employees, with people accusing the American company of favouring Chinese business interests over supporting free speech \u2013 a supposed tenet of its corporate philosophy. Disgruntled staff covered the signs on the company campus that expressed its devotion to creative freedom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lackofrealism/status/1181639970332659712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened.<br><br>Both the &quot;Think Globally&quot; and &quot;Every Voice Matters&quot; values have been covered up by incensed employees this morning. <a href=\"https://t.co/I7nAYUes6Q\">pic.twitter.com/I7nAYUes6Q</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Hovdestad (@lackofrealism) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lackofrealism/status/1181639970332659712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Bending to pressure, Blizzard later reinstated Ng Wai Chung\u2019s winnings and reduced the ban \u2013 though he is still suspended for six months. This did little to quell the outrage.</p> <p>While Eric and his group protested outside the fan expo at the weekend, the president of Blizzard Entertainment, J Allen Brack, took to the stage for BlizzCon 2019\u2019s opening ceremony, and prefaced the show\u2019s big new game announcements \u2013 Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV \u2013 with an apology to fans. Addressing how the company had handled the Hong Kong controversy, he said: \u201cWe failed in our purpose. For that, I am sorry, and I accept accountability.\u201d</p> <p>For many fans, the apology felt hollow. Blitzchung is still suspended. So too are the two Taiwanese Hearthstone casters who were hosting the stream.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/blitzchung-hearthstone-blizzard-banned-hong-kong-protests\">'No regrets': Hong Kong Hearthstone gamer banned over pro-democracy support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the days following the event, Blizzard Entertainment provided a new comment to the Guardian on the controversy. \u201cWe understand this is an important issue, and it\u2019s one many community members and employees feel strongly about,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe deeply value personal expression, and support everyone\u2019s rights to make their voices heard peacefully and lawfully.\u201d</p> <p>The first point is correct.

      "bodyText": "Eric did not imagine this would be how he would spend his first BlizzCon. The 26-year-old World of Warcraft (WoW) player from Glendale, California, was at the annual fan event in Anaheim held by Blizzard, the games company behind global hits such as Warcraft, Overwatch and more. Each year, more than 35,000 people pack into the city\u2019s vast convention centre to play games, attend talks and share in their fandom. But at this year\u2019s event, held last weekend, there was a different feel. Instead of WoW cosplay, Eric was sporting a mask as worn by Hong Kong protesters to shield their faces from tear gas and facial recognition. And rather than joining in with the hype during panels about the forthcoming World of Warcraft: Shadowlands expansion, he was outside the convention centre handing out \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d flyers, adorned with the protestors\u2019 adopted symbol, the Overwatch character Mei. Eric has joined the protest group Gamers for Freedom, which he discovered though YouTube. \u201cI figured, I live out here, and I ought to do something I care about,\u201d he explains. \u201cI care about Blizzard games, but I also know the situation in Hong Kong is dire. I want businesses to listen to us, and know there are consequences when they make decisions.\u201d For the past month, the US game developer Blizzard has been engulfed in a political controversy. In October, after a major tournament for the company\u2019s game Hearthstone, esports champion Ng \u201cblitzchung\u201d Wai Chung, who is from Hong Kong, used a livestreamed interview to state his support for protestors in his country. Blizzard\u2019s punishment for expressing this view on their official channel, which doesn\u2019t allow political messages, was to issue him with a year\u2019s ban and revoke his $10,000 prize winnings. The decision provoked global outrage from fans, US senators and Blizzard\u2019s own employees, with people accusing the American company of favouring Chinese business interests over supporting free speech \u2013 a supposed tenet of its corporate philosophy. Disgruntled staff covered the signs on the company campus that expressed its devotion to creative freedom. Bending to pressure, Blizzard later reinstated Ng Wai Chung\u2019s winnings and reduced the ban \u2013 though he is still suspended for six months. This did little to quell the outrage. While Eric and his group protested outside the fan expo at the weekend, the president of Blizzard Entertainment, J Allen Brack, took to the stage for BlizzCon 2019\u2019s opening ceremony, and prefaced the show\u2019s big new game announcements \u2013 Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV \u2013 with an apology to fans. Addressing how the company had handled the Hong Kong controversy, he said: \u201cWe failed in our purpose. For that, I am sorry, and I accept accountability.\u201d For many fans, the apology felt hollow. Blitzchung is still suspended. So too are the two Taiwanese Hearthstone casters who were hosting the stream. In the days following the event, Blizzard Entertainment provided a new comment to the Guardian on the controversy. \u201cWe understand this is an important issue, and it\u2019s one many community members and employees feel strongly about,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe deeply value personal expression, and support everyone\u2019s rights to make their voices heard peacefully and lawfully.\u201d The first point is correct. But the second seems to be contradicted by the company\u2019s actions. Brack has stated the punishment is \u201cnot about the content of Blitzchung\u2019s message\u201d, but about his breaking the rule that official Blizzard channels will not support any political messages of any kind, regardless of leaning. A message from the official Hearthstone account on Chinese social media site Weibo last month, however, appeared to have taken its own political stance.

Hadidjah Chamberlin, who prefers using they/them pronouns, is an effects artist on Hearthstone, having worked on the title for the past four years. \u201cI think the fact that J addressed it during opening ceremony was really important, and I\u2019m really glad he did that, personally,\u201d they told us, following the announcement. \u201cHearthstone has always been \u2026 such a fun, welcoming game and that\u2019s one of the things that I really love about it.

The one I found in my holiday accommodation (newly renovated Winsford Cottage Hospital in Devon) told the stories of people from a dozen local parishes.

She was the wealthy benefactor who built what is now the Winsford Centre at Halwill Junction, 10 miles from Okehampton in 1899-1900 as a memorial to her husband George, who had passed away the previous year. In doing so, she transformed the lives of locals who couldn\u2019t afford to call a doctor and often died of curable illnesses as a result. Back then, this part of Devon was busy. Halwill Junction takes its name from a now-disappeared railway station where lines from Barnstaple, Padstow, Bude and Exeter converged until Dr Beeching axed the lot in the 1960s. Unusually for such a rural village, it\u2019s still easily accessible by public transport \u2013 I took a bus from Exeter St David\u2019s station, passing Dartmoor on the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96b876df6262316e22cfee9fa5d29c5ea6f2a722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96b876df6262316e22cfee9fa5d29c5ea6f2a722/0_381_5712_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lounge at Winsford Cottage Hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lounge with \u2018generously proportioned\u2019 sofas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 273021001190/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winsford\u2019s designer was CFA Voysey, a friend of the Medleys and one of the most influential arts and crafts architects of his day. He almost exclusively designed grand houses, which explains why Winsford (with its striking triple gables and long band of mullioned windows) looks decidedly unlike a hospital. Barbara, the property\u2019s housekeeper, pointed out to me that he\u2019d even taken the trouble to make all the doors deliberately wide and low, \u201cso they didn\u2019t remind people of the shape of coffins\u201d. It\u2019s no wonder many of those who came to view the hospital when it opened in 1900 wrote in the visitors\u2019 book that they wished they could live in it.</p> <p>I found the interior oddly reminiscent of an early video game. Standing in the entrance hall I faced a long, wide corridor with myriad identical doors off it and no way of knowing what was behind them, until I pushed down on their latches and peered in. Along with four bedrooms, I discovered a tiny study, three bathrooms (two of which had baths, in one of which I later enjoyed gloriously languorous soaks), a flashily equipped kitchen, a delightfully formal dining room and a lounge with sofas so generously proportioned that I could almost have disappeared into them. Blissfully, there was neither a television nor wifi. In their place I found a library curated by one of the Landmark Trust\u2019s librarians, a chronicle of the hospital written by historian Caroline Stanford, and that fascinating register of patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a427164e4edb0f5905133671b48a892a3ea8a727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a427164e4edb0f5905133671b48a892a3ea8a727/0_0_6646_4431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corridor at the Winsford cottage hospital, Devon, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Open up \u2026 corridor at the cottage hospital</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was difficult to believe that the building \u2013 which closed in 1998 \u2013 had been in a state of advanced decay as recently as last year, when the Landmark Trust took it over. Using skilled local tradesmen and volunteers, it took Winsford back to how it would have looked in 1914, when its seven beds began to be filled by wounded and ailing soldiers. Cement was removed to reveal the sand-coloured mosaic floor; the Cornish Delabole slate roof was overhauled; the original fireplaces (decorated with Voysey\u2019s celebrated elongated hearts) were carefully preserved; and the white-and-dark-green colour scheme was reinstated. In all, the trust spent \u00a31.5m on restoration, creating an extensive holiday property while maintaining the east wing for community use (here one room has been mocked up as an early-20th-century ward).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f03e45b794ec4bcf66b2b44cded04604cfeb753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f03e45b794ec4bcf66b2b44cded04604cfeb753/0_27_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom at one of the Winsford Cottage Hospital bedrooms to feature a bath.

The elegance of the furniture, the soothing hues, the lack of clutter and the peace and quiet combined to lull me into a state of equanimity. From the kitchen I idly watched a flock of fieldfares landing, taking off and landing again in the field opposite. And every time I walked down the corridor I imagined nurses in starched cotton quietly going about their work with reassuring efficiency.</p> <p>The village beyond Winsford\u2019s doors runs to a little store, an ironmongers and a lively pub, the <a href=\"http://www.thejunctioninnhalwill.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Junction Inn</a>, where I popped in for a drink one evening.

Barbara, the property\u2019s housekeeper, pointed out to me that he\u2019d even taken the trouble to make all the doors deliberately wide and low, \u201cso they didn\u2019t remind people of the shape of coffins\u201d. It\u2019s no wonder many of those who came to view the hospital when it opened in 1900 wrote in the visitors\u2019 book that they wished they could live in it. I found the interior oddly reminiscent of an early video game. Standing in the entrance hall I faced a long, wide corridor with myriad identical doors off it and no way of knowing what was behind them, until I pushed down on their latches and peered in. Along with four bedrooms, I discovered a tiny study, three bathrooms (two of which had baths, in one of which I later enjoyed gloriously languorous soaks), a flashily equipped kitchen, a delightfully formal dining room and a lounge with sofas so generously proportioned that I could almost have disappeared into them. Blissfully, there was neither a television nor wifi. In their place I found a library curated by one of the Landmark Trust\u2019s librarians, a chronicle of the hospital written by historian Caroline Stanford, and that fascinating register of patients. It was difficult to believe that the building \u2013 which closed in 1998 \u2013 had been in a state of advanced decay as recently as last year, when the Landmark Trust took it over. Using skilled local tradesmen and volunteers, it took Winsford back to how it would have looked in 1914, when its seven beds began to be filled by wounded and ailing soldiers. Cement was removed to reveal the sand-coloured mosaic floor; the Cornish Delabole slate roof was overhauled; the original fireplaces (decorated with Voysey\u2019s celebrated elongated hearts) were carefully preserved; and the white-and-dark-green colour scheme was reinstated. In all, the trust spent \u00a31.5m on restoration, creating an extensive holiday property while maintaining the east wing for community use (here one room has been mocked up as an early-20th-century ward). The overall effect is of remarkable tranquillity. The elegance of the furniture, the soothing hues, the lack of clutter and the peace and quiet combined to lull me into a state of equanimity. From the kitchen I idly watched a flock of fieldfares landing, taking off and landing again in the field opposite. And every time I walked down the corridor I imagined nurses in starched cotton quietly going about their work with reassuring efficiency. The village beyond Winsford\u2019s doors runs to a little store, an ironmongers and a lively pub, the Junction Inn, where I popped in for a drink one evening. During the day, I foraged chestnuts and wandered along one of the former railway lines, now a bridleway. It took me through a nature reserve and into Cookworthy Forest, where a treecreeper defied all my attempts to photograph it. I returned to sit in the sunshine on the hospital\u2019s long veranda, to sip tea and nibble at a slice of toast, listen to the birdsong and imagine myself one of the patients of long ago, just about well enough for Sister to suggest some gentle recuperation in the health-giving fresh air. And if the outside world, with all its noise, panics and alarums is in some sense a disease, perhaps indeed I was a patient. Certainly, by the time I left, I felt that Winsford had done me a power of good. \u2022 Accommodation was provided by the Landmark Trust.

Ken Wyatt has already confirmed he would not pursue a key demand from the Uluru statement \u2013 that the voice be constitutionally enshrined \u2013 warning supporters they need to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d about what can be achieved. Instead he has said he would work towards legislating the voice to ensure the planned constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples referendum was successful. In announcing the co-design group, Wyatt said it would be asked to \u201cdevelop options for an Indigenous voice to government\u201d, with Indigenous leaders, Prof Tom Calma and Prof Dr Marcia Langton leading the process. Kenny had previously criticised Langton as being \u201caggressive\u201d towards \u201cperceived ideological enemies\u201d, leading to the burning of \u201cgoodwill faster than others can create it\u201d in a comment piece published in the Australian, which was broadly in favour of a \u201cpractical\u201d solution to the voice to parliament proposal. \u201cThe most likely avenue for compromise now is for [the prime minister, Scott] Morrison to prevail, as hinted at in Wyatt\u2019s speech, and have a voice formalised through legislation but not mandated in the constitution,\u201d Kenny wrote in July. \u201cThis will disappoint many Indigenous people but might fly.\u201d Kenny is a surprise inclusion in the group, which also includes Fr Frank Brennan, Mick Gooda, Noel Pearson, Josephine Cashman, Dr Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Alison Page. Prof Peter Buckskin, Marcia Ella-Duncan, Joanne Farrell, Vonda Malone, June Oscar, Benson Saulo, Pat Turner, Prof Maggie Walter, Tony Wurramarrba and Peter Yu round out the group. \u201cThe best outcomes are achieved when Indigenous Australians are at the centre of decision-making,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cWe know that for too long, decision-making treated the symptoms rather than the cause.\u201d The group\u2019s main role will be to offer suggestions on how Indigenous Australians \u201care heard at all levels of government\u201d and have been asked to form a national co-design group, as well as a local and regional co-design group to help the process. Both Calma and Langton support constitutionally enshrining the voice to parliament, but have said they are willing to work with the process to see what can be achieved. \u201cI would like to get the opportunity to establish the bodies and the process and look at all the models and how they might work, and then at a future time look at \u2013 and this is the government\u2019s role \u2013 to look at constitutional enshrinement or whatever,\u201d Calma told the Guardian late last month.",

Then she disappeared. In 2016, a new image emerged: Kesha wearing a white suit, sobbing in court as she tried to escape her contract with the producer Dr Luke (AKA Lukasz Gottwald), whom she accused of sexual and emotional abuse including date rape and bullying that led to her developing an eating disorder.

While she couldn\u2019t sing about her alleged strife, she made her stance plain: \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished, they won\u2019t even know your name,\u201d she belted on Praying. The rockier, more personal album earned her the best reviews of her career. \u201cI was not used to having nice press,\u201d Kesha says with a small, stunned laugh. \u201cIt was shocking, and also at a time where I so needed kindness.\u201d</p> <p>But the validation left her feeling uneasy. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m beholden to be a tragedy just because I\u2019ve gone through something that was tragic,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s <em>really</em> important for people to know \u2013 you do not have to be defined by something that was done to you.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q8VsGYchc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K5q8VsGYchc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is early October. Kesha, now 32 and newly brunette, has just debuted her new album, High Road, at a glitzy playback for the media. A few downbeat songs aside, her new music revitalises her rowdy trademark sound \u2013 in the way that Tina Turner and Rihanna did after rejecting their own victim narratives. \u201cAfter Praying, people thought I\u2019d always take the high road,\u201d she tells us, handing out tequila. \u201cAnd this song is about getting super fucking high.\u201d</p> <p>A while later, the drink worn off, Kesha sits in a hotel room. She is wearing enough gold chains to deflect a bullet and the glitter is back: translucent blue hearts encrusted beneath her eyes; gothic, bejewelled nails that look like 10 mini Iron Thrones crowning heavily tattooed arms. But she is nervous, speaking carefully and often steering her answers back to her gratitude for her fans\u2019 kindness \u2013 not so much platitudes, more a conversational safety net for a woman legally prevented from discussing certain things. She returns that kindness, too. When I ask for advice about a shared experience, she goes off-record and is so compassionate that I have to pull myself together before continuing.</p> <p>Before starting her fourth album, Kesha didn\u2019t think she deserved to make happy music. \u201cI can be so fucking mean to myself,\u201d she says, sighing at the understatement. Her brother told her she should be writing pop songs, the thing she was good at. \u201cAnd I was pissed!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do well with people telling me what to <em>do</em>, and I was so conflicted about what I wanted versus what was expected of me, and trying to please everyone is exhausting.\u201d</p> <p>She wrote her defiance into a rumbling thigh-slapper called My Own Dance: \u201cWhat\u2019s a girl to do? / You\u2019re the party girl / You\u2019re the tragedy / But the funny thing is I\u2019m fucking everything.\u201d She still had to be talked into following the poppy direction it suggested. \u201cThere was an element of not feeling like I should be celebratory because of everything I\u2019ve gone through so publicly.\u201d She pushed through: on High Road, wine is smuggled in handbags, impromptu drunk tattoos are inked, plentiful highs are toked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df4c5293b64a58c49784d98f7fe14f251302cb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df4c5293b64a58c49784d98f7fe14f251302cb0/0_0_3712_4640/800.jpg\" alt=\"On Jimmy Kimmel Live! in October.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Jimmy Kimmel Live! in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is as rebellious for Kesha to make feckless pop now as it was a decade ago. Then, she preached crashing the party, \u201cpissing in the Dom Perignon\u201d and the sexual liberation of women and LGBTQ people. She was seen as an emblem of the post-recession generation, revelling in the wreckage of their promised future. While she wasn\u2019t consciously addressing the economy, she says she related to \u201cgrowing up without extravagance\u201d, recalling her mother, the Nashville songwriter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grannywrapper?lang=en\" title=\"\">Pebe Sebert</a>, using food stamps. \u201cBut she still found a way to make life very joyful, and I never felt like I went without.\u201d</p> <p>Kesha never knew her father \u2013 never wanted to, although she contemplates what that might have been like on a softer new song, Father Daughter Dance \u2013 and says her childhood fostered her \u201cnihilistic\u201d approach to life: \u201cNothing matters, the world is going to burn up one day so I might as well have a good time while I\u2019m here, because what is the point of life? I don\u2019t know. But I have found that speaking from the heart and creating have made me more able to cope with that intensity.\u201d</p> <p>Kesha\u2019s verve excited Dr Luke. After he heard a country song and a goofy rap number that she had recorded during her mum\u2019s studio time, his interest was piqued by the latter and he brought the teenager to work with him in Los Angeles. The newly christened Ke$ha released her debut single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP6XpLQM2Cs\" title=\"\">Tik Tok</a>, in 2009. It spent nine weeks at No 1 in the US and announced the loud arrival of a new pop archetype: the female libertine who brushed her teeth \u201cwith a bottle of Jack\u201d before an all-nighter.</p> <p>The outraged response is quaint to revisit, not least because she steals a pushbike in the video. \u201cThere was some quote that said: \u2018Everyone\u2019s acting like Kesha is walking door to door selling butt plugs and heroin.\u2019 I remember thinking, this is it!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m literally talking about everything that men have sung about since the beginning of music.\u201d Not that she minded \u2013 it proved her point. \u201cThe Stooges are my favourite band and Iggy is my god. If I\u2019m not ruffling feathers, I\u2019m not a true child of punk rock.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cdc53441c284436e8895110a3b7fe6077c7bb857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc53441c284436e8895110a3b7fe6077c7bb857/290_181_2615_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kesha leaves court, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kesha leaves court, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alo Ceballos/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She started something: soon Miley Cyrus became the twerking, tongue-lolling <em>Miley Cyrus,</em> Sia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjPBrBU-TM\" title=\"\">self-obliteration anthems</a> reigned and Icona Pop\u2019s I Love It (\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d) gave a generation its soundtrack. But 10 years on, pop has gone dark, its stars battling anxiety over political and environmental apocalypse. While Kesha isn\u2019t surprised, she still thinks escapism is a noble pursuit. \u201cSince the beginning of making music, I wanted to make people happy.\u201d</p> <p>Though she has had to redefine her own version of escapism. She has alleged that Dr Luke repeatedly told her that all she was supposed to be was fun, and that he limited her music\u2019s emotional reach to capitalise on this image. Meanwhile, she stated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/14/singer-kesha-sues-producer-dr-luke-sexual-battery\" title=\"\">legal filings</a>, he put her \u201cunder immense pressure to starve myself\u201d, an endeavour that she says nearly killed her. She went to rehab for an eating disorder in 2014 and ditched the dollar sign from her name. These days, she doesn\u2019t care how anyone thinks she looks: \u201cMy body, my business\u201d is her abiding philosophy.</p> <p>Understandably, she doesn\u2019t care if anyone thinks that her return to pop is \u201cinauthentic\u201d. She avoided Auto-Tune and rapping on Rainbow because it didn\u2019t feel right. Both are back on High Road. \u201cAnd the beauty of it is that it was under <em>my</em> consent,\u201d she says pointedly. She has always wanted to be more involved with music production, and recalls a cross-country road trip with her brother in her teens: she was making beats in the sweltering car, only pausing recording to open a window so they didn\u2019t faint.</p> <p>Luke gave her little creative control. She executive-produced Rainbow and High Road and her new collaborators have to respect her assertiveness, but being respected in the studio is still not always a given. \u201cI\u2019ve realised it\u2019s OK to have boundaries, to have an opinion and to know what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t make you a bitch.\u201d While she prizes her authority in the studio, vulnerability has become a survival mechanism. \u201cI spent a lot of my career and life thinking the way to protect myself was to be strong: <em>I don\u2019t give a fuck, you can\u2019t hurt me</em>,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But to witness the music industry laud her emotional honesty sometimes felt like another kind of expoitation. As part of the 2018 Grammy awards\u2019 support of #TimesUp, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/kesha-praying-is-most-powerful-performance-at-grammys-2018\" title=\"\">Kesha performed Praying, backed by female musicians including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello</a>. She wept at the end. It was moving, but left a bad taste: a woman exposing her pain for the industry that allegedly enabled it, on a night where only one woman won a major award and the Grammys president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up\" title=\"\">suggested women \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted recognition</a>.</p> <p>Kesha\u2019s lasting memory of the night is one of solidarity, \u201cgetting a giant hug from all these people that the media had previously pitted against each other. It was us saying no.\u201d She considers my perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because I was putting a very traumatic experience on display, but it was something I consented to. I was also terrified. But if something terrifies me, I feel like it may be important. Even if it sounds like utter hell and I just weep on the microphone, at least I tried.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP6XpLQM2Cs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iP6XpLQM2Cs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The #MeToo movement saddens her. \u201cThat enough people have been assaulted and treated poorly that there has to be an entire movement,\u201d she says. She has no idea whether things have changed for younger, apparently freer peers such as Billie Eilish \u201cbecause you never really know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Because for a long period, people had no idea what was going on behind the scenes with me.\u201d</p> <p>The backdrop to the revelry of Kesha\u2019s fourth album is ongoing legal strife: her second appeal against Dr Luke\u2019s defamation case <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7559381/Kesha-loses-bid-appeal-Dr-Luke-defamation-suit-head-trial-claims-raped-her.html\" title=\"\">was denied in October</a>; the case is ongoing. To cope, she says she has to avoid living in the past, or thinking too much about the future. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019ve been through the <em>shit</em> and I have earned my happiness back,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cI have God only knows the amount of therapy bills and meditation apps and transcendental meditation retreats.\u201d She thrusts her right fist open in emphasis, revealing an eye tattooed on her palm.</p> <p>But she hasn\u2019t softened. In May, she attended a Grammys event wearing a diamante muzzle to protest against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/alabama-abortion-ban-blocked-federal-judge\" title=\"\">Alabama\u2019s abortion ban</a>. She didn\u2019t anticipate a renewed assault on reproductive rights when she was singing about sex so freely 10 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s really archaic,\u201d she says. She describes the era when American iconography \u2013 the dollar sign and flag \u2013 littered her work as \u201ca very different time\u201d. It was subversive, but also a bit patriotic. \u201cObama was president. We agreed upon not everything, but a lot of things.\u201d</p> <p>She would be unlikely to wear the stars and stripes today. \u201cVery basic human rights \u2013 women\u2019s rights, trans rights, gay rights, gun control \u2013 are being challenged and ruining people\u2019s lives. The basis of my constitution is all humans should be treated equally and lovingly.\u201d She sighs. \u201cMusicians used to be the rebellious ones. But now I feel an overwhelming responsibility to be as empathetic and kind and loving and as safe of a place as humanly possible for people.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks back to staging <a href=\"https://www.keshasrainbowcruise.com/\" title=\"\">her first cruise</a> in February \u2013 it sailed from Florida to the Bahamas and saw her play to fans alongside other acts including Betty Who, Girl Talk and Big Freedia. She had no idea what to expect and was moved by her fans\u2019 community spirit. While often \u201ctotally fucked, walking around naked\u201d, they looked after one another.</p> <p>There was one guy she\u2019ll never forget, who was paralysed from the neck down. \u201cThe other fans were helping him dance with his arms because he didn\u2019t have control over them, and putting glitter in his beard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so beautiful to see people being so kind and understanding and allowing each other to be exactly who the fuck they wanted.\u201d Here was what defined her, a reclaimed kingdom built on debauchery and respect.</p> <p><em>High Road is released on 10 Jan 2020 on RCA.</em></p>",

If I\u2019m not ruffling feathers, I\u2019m not a true child of punk rock.\u201d She started something: soon Miley Cyrus became the twerking, tongue-lolling Miley Cyrus, Sia\u2019s self-obliteration anthems reigned and Icona Pop\u2019s I Love It (\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d) gave a generation its soundtrack. But 10 years on, pop has gone dark, its stars battling anxiety over political and environmental apocalypse. While Kesha isn\u2019t surprised, she still thinks escapism is a noble pursuit. \u201cSince the beginning of making music, I wanted to make people happy.\u201d Though she has had to redefine her own version of escapism. She has alleged that Dr Luke repeatedly told her that all she was supposed to be was fun, and that he limited her music\u2019s emotional reach to capitalise on this image. Meanwhile, she stated in legal filings, he put her \u201cunder immense pressure to starve myself\u201d, an endeavour that she says nearly killed her. She went to rehab for an eating disorder in 2014 and ditched the dollar sign from her name. These days, she doesn\u2019t care how anyone thinks she looks: \u201cMy body, my business\u201d is her abiding philosophy. Understandably, she doesn\u2019t care if anyone thinks that her return to pop is \u201cinauthentic\u201d. She avoided Auto-Tune and rapping on Rainbow because it didn\u2019t feel right. Both are back on High Road. \u201cAnd the beauty of it is that it was under my consent,\u201d she says pointedly. She has always wanted to be more involved with music production, and recalls a cross-country road trip with her brother in her teens: she was making beats in the sweltering car, only pausing recording to open a window so they didn\u2019t faint. Luke gave her little creative control. She executive-produced Rainbow and High Road and her new collaborators have to respect her assertiveness, but being respected in the studio is still not always a given. \u201cI\u2019ve realised it\u2019s OK to have boundaries, to have an opinion and to know what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t make you a bitch.\u201d While she prizes her authority in the studio, vulnerability has become a survival mechanism. \u201cI spent a lot of my career and life thinking the way to protect myself was to be strong: I don\u2019t give a fuck, you can\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she says. But to witness the music industry laud her emotional honesty sometimes felt like another kind of expoitation. As part of the 2018 Grammy awards\u2019 support of #TimesUp, Kesha performed Praying, backed by female musicians including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello. She wept at the end. It was moving, but left a bad taste: a woman exposing her pain for the industry that allegedly enabled it, on a night where only one woman won a major award and the Grammys president suggested women \u201cstep up\u201d if they wanted recognition. Kesha\u2019s lasting memory of the night is one of solidarity, \u201cgetting a giant hug from all these people that the media had previously pitted against each other. It was us saying no.\u201d She considers my perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because I was putting a very traumatic experience on display, but it was something I consented to. I was also terrified. But if something terrifies me, I feel like it may be important. Even if it sounds like utter hell and I just weep on the microphone, at least I tried.\u201d The #MeToo movement saddens her. \u201cThat enough people have been assaulted and treated poorly that there has to be an entire movement,\u201d she says. She has no idea whether things have changed for younger, apparently freer peers such as Billie Eilish \u201cbecause you never really know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Because for a long period, people had no idea what was going on behind the scenes with me.\u201d The backdrop to the revelry of Kesha\u2019s fourth album is ongoing legal strife: her second appeal against Dr Luke\u2019s defamation case was denied in October; the case is ongoing. To cope, she says she has to avoid living in the past, or thinking too much about the future. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019ve been through the shit and I have earned my happiness back,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cI have God only knows the amount of therapy bills and meditation apps and transcendental meditation retreats.\u201d She thrusts her right fist open in emphasis, revealing an eye tattooed on her palm. But she hasn\u2019t softened. In May, she attended a Grammys event wearing a diamante muzzle to protest against Alabama\u2019s abortion ban. She didn\u2019t anticipate a renewed assault on reproductive rights when she was singing about sex so freely 10 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s really archaic,\u201d she says. She describes the era when American iconography \u2013 the dollar sign and flag \u2013 littered her work as \u201ca very different time\u201d. It was subversive, but also a bit patriotic. \u201cObama was president. We agreed upon not everything, but a lot of things.\u201d She would be unlikely to wear the stars and stripes today. \u201cVery basic human rights \u2013 women\u2019s rights, trans rights, gay rights, gun control \u2013 are being challenged and ruining people\u2019s lives. The basis of my constitution is all humans should be treated equally and lovingly.\u201d She sighs. \u201cMusicians used to be the rebellious ones. But now I feel an overwhelming responsibility to be as empathetic and kind and loving and as safe of a place as humanly possible for people.\u201d She thinks back to staging her first cruise in February \u2013 it sailed from Florida to the Bahamas and saw her play to fans alongside other acts including Betty Who, Girl Talk and Big Freedia. She had no idea what to expect and was moved by her fans\u2019 community spirit. While often \u201ctotally fucked, walking around naked\u201d, they looked after one another. There was one guy she\u2019ll never forget, who was paralysed from the neck down. \u201cThe other fans were helping him dance with his arms because he didn\u2019t have control over them, and putting glitter in his beard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so beautiful to see people being so kind and understanding and allowing each other to be exactly who the fuck they wanted.\u201d Here was what defined her, a reclaimed kingdom built on debauchery and respect. High Road is released on 10 Jan 2020 on RCA.",

      "bodyText": "US officials are struggling to explain the mission of up to a thousand US troops in Syria, who have mostly taken up positions near oil fields in response to Donald Trump\u2019s orders. A fortnight after ordering a complete evacuation of US troops ahead of a Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria, abandoning Kurdish partners in the fight against Isis, Trump changed his mind and said some forces should stay but only to \u201csecure the oil\u201d. So as hundreds US special forces are being flown out of Syria, hundreds of other soldiers, equipped with armoured vehicles, have been driving into the region, heading for small-scale oil patches Der Ezzor and Hasakah provinces, but without a clear idea of what they were supposed to do there. The unease of US officials implementing the policy became apparent on Thursday when an internal report by the top US diplomat in northern Syria, William Roebuck, was leaked to the New York Times. In the report, Roebuck complains that \u201cwe didn\u2019t try\u201d to deter the Turkish incursion, which has killed hundreds of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands. \u201cUS policy in eastern Syria these days seems to be an attempt at building a plane already in flight,\u201d Kayleigh Thomas, research associate for the Middle East Security programme at the Centre for a New American Security (CNAS), said. \u201cFor example, if Syrian government forces were to attack, would [US troops] then respond in self-defence? It looks like some of those legal questions are still being hashed out.\u201d The mission initially sounded straightforward as Trump presented it. \u201cWe want to bring our soldiers home. But we did leave soldiers because we\u2019re keeping the oil,\u201d he said on 1 November. \u201cI like oil. We\u2019re keeping the oil.\u201d The president suggested that taking possession of Syrian natural resources would be fair \u201creimbursement\u201d for the cost of going to war there. The problem for military planners is such pillage of a foreign country is a violation of the laws of war as applied in the Nuremberg trials and commonly accepted since. It could also violate the Authorisation for Use of Military Force granted by Congress to the US government in the immediate wake of the 9/11 attacks, intended for operations against al-Qaida and \u201cassociated forces\u201d, which has been used to justify armed intervention across the Middle East.

At Thursday\u2019s Pentagon briefing, Byrne insisted the ceasefire negotiated in northeastern Syria was holding apart from \u201crelatively small skirmishes\u201d. However, Turkish-backed Arab militias are reported to be pushing towards the town of Tal Tamr, which is outside the zone Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw from. Steve Gumaer, the head of the Partners Relief &amp; Development aid organisation, who was in Tel Tamr last week said the current front was only 4km north of the town. \u201cAll the time we were there has been non-stop fighting. People are being killed and injured every day,\u201d Gumaer said. A senior administration official expressed concern about the possibility that the militias involved around Tal Tamr were not under Ankara\u2019s full control. \u201cIt\u2019s basically these Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militias that are in there,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd we were very concerned because they were seemingly heading towards the city of Tal Tamr, which is a relatively large Christian area, which everybody acknowledges is outside of [the agreed Turkish zone].\u201d \u201cThe problem is that the people doing the fighting are these ill-disciplined Arab militias, some of whom we\u2019ve worked with in the past when we were arming the opposition, but many of whom are ill-disciplined, and relatively radical, and their ideology is essentially Islamic ideology.\u201d",

[To them] that bauxite is worth nothing if it\u2019s outside the mountain.\u201d That, she said, raises the question, \u201cCan we leave the bauxite in the mountain?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/jacob-rees-moggs-grenfell-remarks-caused-huge-distress-admits-tory-chairman\">Jacob Rees-Mogg's Grenfell remarks 'caused huge distress', admits Tory chairman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like the tale about the mountain and the decision about the bauxite, politics is, largely, about choices and narratives. It\u2019s a choice, not simply between different manifestos, policies and programmes, but between competing stories about who we are, what is important, how we got here and where we go next.</p> \n<p>This week clearly showcased the value systems underpinning the choice both in this election and in the broader political moment, and how they are framed by the media. They were revealed in remarks made accidentally and extemporaneously in two radio interviews \u2013 in moments of candour in which the interviewee spoke unselfconsciously in order to make a point, not the news. They went viral because they illustrated bigger truths that are widely held but rarely openly claimed.</p> \n<p>The first involved Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, on Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett Gets Answers. Barnett, who does get answers but rarely really listens to them, was quizzing Russell-Moyle about why Labour wanted to broaden the debate beyond Brexit. He steered <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07t8240\" title=\"\">the conversation</a> towards inequality, saying of the rich: \u201cYou will have a decision. What side are you on? Are you on the side of the tax dodgers and the billionaires or are you on the side of normal working people?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSome people aspire to be a billionaire in this country,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIs that a dirty thing?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should be a billionaire,\u201d replied Russell-Moyle.</p> \n<p>The second involved Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, who was asked by Nick Ferrari on LBC if race or class discrimination had anything to do with the Grenfell tragedy. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4AYHQEggRI\" title=\"\">Rees-Mogg</a> said no, pointing instead to the flammable cladding and the residents\u2019 decision to obey the fire brigade\u2019s demands to stay put. \u201cIf either of us were in a fire,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">told Ferrari</a>, \u201cwhatever the fire brigade said we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do and it\u2019s such a tragedy that that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Russell-Moyle let slip a combative vision of a country in which there should be a limit to how much wealth any one individual might have at a time when our schools and hospitals are underfunded, real wages have yet to recover from the financial crisis, and <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/poverty-uk-guide-facts-and-figures/\" title=\"\">14 million people</a> live in relative poverty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/04/four-million-british-workers-live-in-poverty-charity-says\" title=\"\">4 million</a> of whom are working.</p> \n<p>He set that limit pretty high. A billion pounds is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/03/labour-billionaires-general-election-super-rich-ashley-ratcliffe\" title=\"\">a lot of money</a>. Very few people aspire to that level of wealth because it\u2019s impossible to imagine. It\u2019s more than anyone can count or spend.

      "bodyText": "In a recent interview, the Indian novelist and campaigner Arundhati Roy described a tabletop mountain in the Indian state of Odisha as a symbol for who or what will rule the world. \u201cFor the mining companies, the mountain is worth the cost of the bauxite that can be mined,\u201d she told me. \u201cFor the people \u2026 who live on that mountain it\u2019s a water tank [that] has held the water of the monsoons and the plains for centuries. [To them] that bauxite is worth nothing if it\u2019s outside the mountain.\u201d That, she said, raises the question, \u201cCan we leave the bauxite in the mountain?\u201d Like the tale about the mountain and the decision about the bauxite, politics is, largely, about choices and narratives. It\u2019s a choice, not simply between different manifestos, policies and programmes, but between competing stories about who we are, what is important, how we got here and where we go next. This week clearly showcased the value systems underpinning the choice both in this election and in the broader political moment, and how they are framed by the media. They were revealed in remarks made accidentally and extemporaneously in two radio interviews \u2013 in moments of candour in which the interviewee spoke unselfconsciously in order to make a point, not the news. They went viral because they illustrated bigger truths that are widely held but rarely openly claimed. The first involved Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, on Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett Gets Answers. Barnett, who does get answers but rarely really listens to them, was quizzing Russell-Moyle about why Labour wanted to broaden the debate beyond Brexit. He steered the conversation towards inequality, saying of the rich: \u201cYou will have a decision. What side are you on? Are you on the side of the tax dodgers and the billionaires or are you on the side of normal working people?\u201d \u201cSome people aspire to be a billionaire in this country,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIs that a dirty thing?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should be a billionaire,\u201d replied Russell-Moyle. The second involved Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, who was asked by Nick Ferrari on LBC if race or class discrimination had anything to do with the Grenfell tragedy. Rees-Mogg said no, pointing instead to the flammable cladding and the residents\u2019 decision to obey the fire brigade\u2019s demands to stay put. \u201cIf either of us were in a fire,\u201d he told Ferrari, \u201cwhatever the fire brigade said we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do and it\u2019s such a tragedy that that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Russell-Moyle let slip a combative vision of a country in which there should be a limit to how much wealth any one individual might have at a time when our schools and hospitals are underfunded, real wages have yet to recover from the financial crisis, and 14 million people live in relative poverty, 4 million of whom are working. He set that limit pretty high. A billion pounds is a lot of money. Very few people aspire to that level of wealth because it\u2019s impossible to imagine. It\u2019s more than anyone can count or spend. In Britain it\u2019s not the realm of the 1% \u2013 the targets of Occupy Wall Street \u2013 but the 0.0002%. Nonetheless, it lays down a clear marker about the kind of country Russell-Moyle does not want to live in \u2013 where obscene wealth is possible amid widespread poverty. And he makes it clear it\u2019s a vision he\u2019s prepared to fight for. Rees-Mogg gives voice to a sense of innate superiority that comes with the privilege of his class. If he lived in Grenfell Tower he would have survived because, unlike those who died, he has common sense. Having insisted the tragedy had nothing to do with class discrimination, his contempt drips from every word. Drawing Ferrari in to his orbit \u2013 \u201cIf either of us were in a fire\u201d \u2013 you are left wondering what kind of people he thinks were actually in the fire. His is a world where people who live in tower blocks do not know what\u2019s best for them and die through deference, obedience or ignorance rather than survive through self-preservation, entitlement and determination. It is, in short, a world in which he is intrinsically better than other people. Both statements are off the cuff; neither are sanctioned by spin doctors or are official policy. Yet each, in its own way, illustrates the values and priorities of the two major parties: the first uncompromising in its pursuit of a fairer future for everyone; the second arrogantly assuming the unfairness that exists is the fault of those who suffer the most, who should have made better choices.

Someone must speak up for billionaires, and Barnett defends them as though they are an oppressed group. \u201cYou are painting all billionaires as offshore, morally base individuals.\u201d When Rees-Mogg makes his point, however, he is given free rein. The scandal is not realised in real time \u2013 the outrage emerges later from social media. Ferrari listens intently while Rees-Mogg prattles on. \u201cIt\u2019s rather sad to raise these kinds of points [of racism and classism] over a great tragedy,\u201d Rees-Mogg says. \u201cWell it\u2019s a Labour MP who\u2019s doing it,\u201d interjects Ferrari. Challenge the existence of billionaires and you will be confronted in disbelief; utter a slur against those who die in a fire and you will get an uninterrupted hearing. Finally, when faced with the furore they have caused, the two politicians\u2019 responses couldn\u2019t have been more different. Russell-Moyle doubled down, writing on the Guardian website: \u201cThe notion that billionaires should not exist is rather commonplace, and I am confident it\u2019s an idea shared by the majority of the population.\u201d Rees-Mogg folded, issuing an apology in which he claimed he meant to say the exact opposite to what he actually said. Then another Tory MP stepped up to defend him, explaining that what he really meant was that he was cleverer than the fire service chiefs who gave the advice. He too then apologised. These were only gaffes in the sense that both the Labour and Tory MPs were caught saying out loud what they actually believe. \u201cThe danger when Margaret speaks without thinking,\u201d the late leader of the House of Commons, Norman St John-Stevas, said of his former boss, Margaret Thatcher, \u201cis that she says what she thinks.\u201d She was not alone.

      "bodyText": "The pounding beats of bhangra music blare out of Satish\u2019s tractor as it roars across the charred, black earth of his farm. Fresh seeds are scattered in its wake. Yet hanging thick in the air, over this scene of new beginnings, is the tell-tale smoky stench of what came before. Like tens of thousands of farmers in India\u2019s northern states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Satish, whose farm sits on the outskirts of the rural Haryana village of Gharaunda, had recently cleared his fields of old rice crop stubble to make way for wheat by setting it alight. The practice was banned when its contribution to the mounting pollution crisis in nearby Delhi and across northern India became impossible to ignore, but deprived of equally cheap and easy alternatives of preparing the fields, farmers have continued to flout the law. As record-breaking pollution threw Delhi into a state of crisis this week, and the city was shrouded in a thick brown smog with toxins over 50 times the levels deemed healthy, crop burning \u2013 which began in earnest in late October and is due to continue for the rest of the month \u2013 was labelled as the chief culprit. According to the government environment agency, almost 50% of Delhi\u2019s pollution was from crop burning. \u201cBurning is very common, everyone around here does it and just ignores the laws,\u201d said Satish, who claimed only to be looking after the blackened land, though neighbouring farmers later confirmed he was the owner. \u201cWhat choice do we have? For most of us this method is the only option to clear our fields. I can not afford to buy a machine and even to rent it is 10,000 rupees (\u00a3110), maybe more. To burn it is just 1,000 rupees and the next day it is done.\u201d Enforcement of the law has been lax, with state governments keen to keep the large voting bloc of farmers on side. On Wednesday, over 5,000 crop-burning fires were registered in Haryana and Punjab in a single day and the total over the week exceeded 10,000. While a few farmers in Haryana and Punjab have been issued fines, and some carry out the burning under the cover of darkness, most said they had largely been left undisturbed. At the Indian supreme court on Wednesday, Justice Arun Mishra reprimanded the chief ministers of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh for failing to tackle the problem, and ordered them to begin giving financial incentives to farmers who had not burnt their fields. \u201cPunishing poor farmers for burning stubble is not a solution,\u201d said Mishra. Indeed, across Haryana, farmers remained defensive about their role in northern India\u2019s pollution crisis, arguing they have been both made into scapegoats for a much wider problem and also been expected to switch to more expensive methods and machinery, without any support from the state or national government. The problems caused by crop stubble have worsened in recent years, because the combine machines that are now used to harvest the rice leave several inches of stubble in the ground. Even just a few years ago, this excess crop would be used by farmers for cooking, as hay to keep their animals warm or even as extra insulation for homes, but that is increasingly outdated. Sitting atop his motorcycle looking out over the smoking fields, Sultan Singh, 59, said that farmers had been unfairly demonised for the toxic levels of pollution that engulfed Delhi this week.

Although the ruling socialist party (PSOE) won the most votes in the last election seven months ago, it fell short of a majority and was unable to enlist the necessary support to form a government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Spain heading to the polls so often?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Spanish politics has grown increasingly fragmented and polarised over recent years. The PSOE and their conservative rivals in the People\u2019s party (PP) ruled for decades until their duopoly was challenged by the emergence of the anti-austerity Podemos (We Can) party and the centre-right Citizens party.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The political picture has been further complicated by the advent of Vox, the first far-right party to win more than a single seat in congress since Spain\u2019s return to democracy, and by the appearance of M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, a new leftwing party led by I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos.</p>\n    <p>That means there are now three parties chasing votes on the left, and three chasing votes on the right.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What will happen on Sunday? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The PSOE is once again expected to finish first, but it will almost certainly fall well short of a majority and could lose a few of the 123 seats it won last time. The PP is predicted to rally after April\u2019s abysmal performance, Citizens to plummet, Unidas Podemos to dip slightly, and Vox to surge ahead, possibly becoming the third biggest party in congress.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>And then? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Back to the negotiating table and a familiar sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. With rightwing parties unlikely to win the 176 seats needed for a majority in the 350-seat parliament between them, it will again be up the PSOE to try to cut a deal with Podemos and others to regain office. Past experiences suggest the negotiations will be long, difficult and quite possibly fruitless. Other parties may need to break the impasse by abstaining so that the PSOE can resume power as a minority government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest general election comes just seven months after the previous one, and fewer than six months after European, regional and municipal elections were held.</p> \n<p>Since the end of April, the country has been in the hands of the acting government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose ruling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/28/spain-election-socialists-to-win-most-seats-far-right-vox-resurgent\">Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) won the last election but failed to win a majority</a>.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/17/spain-braces-for-another-election-as-deadline-looms\">PSOE\u2019s attempts to form a government came to nothing</a> after the centre-right Citizens party ruled out any form of co-operation, and efforts to make a deal with the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos also proved fruitless.</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez claims that his rivals\u2019 intransigence left him with no choice but to call another election.

      "bodyText": "The two women who stand chatting in the porch of San Gin\u00e9s church in Guadalajara on a crisp November afternoon speak eloquently for a large portion of the Spanish nation. \u201cEstoy hasta el gorro,\u201d says one after shaking her head and delivering a fusillade of sighs: I\u2019m sick to the back teeth of it all. Her companion nods: \u201cWe need a government that can actually govern.\u201d Like most Spaniards, the pair, who do not want to give their names nor say how they would vote, are not relishing Sunday\u2019s general election \u2013 the country\u2019s fourth in as many years. \u201cI just feel fed up and defrauded,\u201d says the first woman. \u201cNone of the politicians here seems to get it. We can\u2019t go on like this. We can\u2019t go on with more and more problems and more and more unemployment. People keep saying things are getting better but they\u2019re not.\u201d The latest general election comes just seven months after the previous one, and fewer than six months after European, regional and municipal elections were held. Since the end of April, the country has been in the hands of the acting government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) won the last election but failed to win a majority. The PSOE\u2019s attempts to form a government came to nothing after the centre-right Citizens party ruled out any form of co-operation, and efforts to make a deal with the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos also proved fruitless. S\u00e1nchez claims that his rivals\u2019 intransigence left him with no choice but to call another election. The timing, however, is far from ideal. The bitterly divisive question of Catalan independence re-erupted last month after Spain\u2019s supreme court jailed nine separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed push for independence two years ago, prompting violent protests on the streets of Barcelona. The unrest was seized on by the parties of the Spanish right, who accused S\u00e1nchez of weakness in the face of such separatist provocation. It has proved a particular gift to the far-right Vox party, which has seen a surge in support amid its calls for a radical recentralisation of Spain. Polls suggest the party could now become the country\u2019s third largest political force after the PSOE and the socialists\u2019 traditional rival, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). The Citizens party looks set to pay a high price for its decision to forfeit the centre ground and lurch to the right in the hope of competing with the PP and Vox. If recent polls prove accurate, the party will see its seat count tumble from 57 to 20 or fewer. To make matters worse, Spain\u2019s unemployment figures rose by almost 100,000 in October and the European commission has revised the country\u2019s growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.9% for this year, and from 1.9% to 1.5% for 2020. Then there is the question of frustration and apathy. In April, turnout reached 75.5%, well up from the 69.8% of voters who headed to the polls in June 2016. Jos\u00e9 Pablo Ferr\u00e1ndiz, chief researcher for the polling firm Metroscopia, believes turnout will be somewhere around 70% on Sunday. In places such as Guadalajara, which lies an hour\u2019s drive north-east of Madrid in Castilla-La Mancha, Citizens\u2019 collapse could be Vox\u2019s triumph. Six months ago, the PSOE, the PP and Citizens each took one of the province\u2019s three seats, with the latter edging out Vox by fewer than 3,500 votes. \u201cIf you look at the map of the last election, the people scrapping over the last seat in many places were Citizens and Vox,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cCitizens won them last time round, but the party\u2019s fall means that Vox won\u2019t need to pick up many more votes to take them.\u201d Although the PSOE are again expected to finish first, polls suggest they may lose some of the 123 seats they won in April. \u201cS\u00e1nchez thought he\u2019d keep the voters who supported him six months ago but also pick up some more from Citizens and so win a larger majority,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cBut neither of those things appears to be happening. The battle is now between the other parties on the right \u2013 and abstention.\u201d In keeping with the growing political fragmentation of recent years, things are also growing crowded on the Spanish left, with the PSOE and Podemos now joined by M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (More Country), a party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos. Whatever the result this weekend, negotiations to form a government promise to be as fraught and tortuous as last time, and a renewed impasse beckons. Despite the weariness though, Vox is not the only party looking forward to Sunday. The PP is expected to bounce back from its terrible showing in April, while the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 the largest and most moderate of Catalonia\u2019s three pro-independence parties \u2013 is expected to finish first in the region and perhaps extend its lead over the Catalan branch of the socialist party. The ERC favours a less confrontational and more pragmatic approach to the quest for Catalan independence than Together for Catalonia, the separatist party led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. The strategy appears to be paying off in a large chunk for the region \u2013 where many people are still furious over the supreme court\u2019s verdict. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re the ones who can make more progress than anybody else because we keep our ideas but we have a plan to implement the republic, even if it\u2019s not magic and we\u2019re not saying that things can be done overnight,\u201d said Alfred Bosch, the ERC politician who serves as the region\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cPerhaps that looks more realistic and more appealing.\u201d Realism may abound in places such as Guadalajara, but political appeal is in rather shorter supply. Jes\u00fas Iglesias, a 49-year-old security guard from the city, lists his worries as he takes a cigarette break: pensions; the cost of renting; the situation in Catalonia, and what he sees as an excess of ineffectual publicly elected officials. \u201cWe need to get rid of the political old guard and get some new, young people in,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven the size of the country, we have far too many politicians and local councillors.\u201d Iglesias may also be \u201chasta el gorro\u201d, and torn between the PP and Citizens, but he knows he once again has a democratic duty to fulfil on Sunday. And besides: \u201cIf I don\u2019t vote, I can\u2019t complain.\u201d",

They owned a nursery in regional Victoria. \u201cWe lived our lives by the weather,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cSo I have this fascination with how people deal with the challenges of climate change.\u201d Now, the 33-year-old has won this year\u2019s $10,000 Richell prize for emerging writers for Nearly Curtains, a collection of stories drawing on that fascination. Nearly Curtains explores a future ravaged by climate crisis and the divergent responses to it \u2013 from couples questioning whether or not they ought to have children, to the roles technologies such as genetic manipulation may play in how humanity adapts to the changing world. The Richell prize, supported by Hachette Australia, Guardian Australia and the Emerging Writers\u2019 festival, was established in 2015 and is open to emerging writers of both fiction and narrative non-fiction. The judging panel \u2013 including Robert Watkins, the head of literary at Hachette Australia; authors Hannah Richell and Sarah Schmidt; and Steve Sines, bookseller at Potts Point Bookshop \u2013 hailed Nearly Curtains as \u201ca firework show of bursting ideas\u201d. \u201cThe strength of Nearly Curtains is more than its beautiful prose, characterisation and concept: here is an emerging writer who has captured the heart of humanity in crisis with such insight that it feels like a revelation,\u201d the judges\u2019 report said. \u201cAt the moment I don\u2019t know how I could be writing about anything else,\u201d Fitzgerald told Guardian Australia. \u201c[Climate crisis] feels really big and urgent and you can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fitzgerald said working through her own emotional responses to the climate crisis \u2013 from \u201csheer terror\u201d at worst, to trying to think through how to cope \u2013 was a constant preoccupation.

The answer is up to you.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T21:25:21.946Z\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019ll be wrapping up the liveblog for today \u2013 but voting is now fully underway for the final round of Bird of the Year. The slate is wiped clean. These 10 made it this far, they can do anything. At dawn today, the willie wagtail was sitting pretty. It was safe, secure, mentally on holiday, round 2 participant sash draped around the beak. By the end, as the count went dark and the data team scratched in the depths, it was anyone\u2019s game. As we sort of predicted, it came down to the tiny moments. The write-ins, the timestamps, the millisecond margins. We thought it was just the eagle and galah. Then the wagtail was drawn in. The cassowary reached out a single claw. At the finish, the screen flashed and showed them all equal, but that too was gone. The result was so close we were scrambling through the write-ins. In that late, late surge, the galah was three away from the salvation of tenth, five away from the glory of ninth. Then, it was out. By four measly votes. But that\u2019s the past now. Welcome to round 2. Believe it or not, that was just the prelude. The ultimate prize is waiting. The wedge-tailed eagle can reach out with a talon and feel it, the galah, sadly can\u2019t. Who will win? The internal cassowary review into the unloseable election is in: Given the tremendous late surge \u2013 20% \u2013 and the social media buzz, you have to say there was an untapped voter base out there. Why did they leave it so late? 12 more hours would have seen them home. Here is the final result for all 50 birds in the first round, excluding any write-in votes: So what happened? At 8am, when this blog started it was: (#9) Willie wagtail: 1611 (#10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1553 (#11) Galah: 1508 (#12) Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo: 1230 (#13) Southern cassowary: 1186 (#14) Gang-gang cockatoo: 1111 So in the race for 10th, the wagtail started 58 ahead of the eagle, which was itself 45 ahead of the galah. The galah thus was 103 behind 9th. The wagtail added only 98 votes over three hours. The wedge-tailed added 155. The galah piled on 197. Between 12th and 13th, the carnaby\u2019s started 44 ahead of the cassowary. Then the cassowary added a monster 231. The carnaby\u2019s added 40. I\u2019m crunching the numbers. The cassowary vote surged 19.5% in only three hours between 8am and 11am. The galah went up 13% \u2013 compared to the eagle\u2019s 10% and wagtail\u2019s 6%. This graph tells the story of those frantic last few hours. Look at those cassowary and galah surges! Here are the top 15 positions, animated over the entire voting period: Or check it out here if the embed doesn\u2019t load correctly. Note the final surge up the rankings for the Cassowary, and the three-way tussle between the Galah, Wagtail and Wedge-tail. Brad Bird (15 votes) also directed the 2007 film Ratatouille. Perhaps next time there can be alliance between birds and rats. My thoughts: If the Pacific Black Duck got more votes (26) that the main character of the one of the most globally popular games of 2019 (22), perhaps the campaign actually did quite well. Checkmate \u201cdata editor\u201d. Based on total write-in votes, the King Parrot is likely to make an appearance in the next Bird of the Year competition. The parrot had 182 votes via write-in, above the combined total of regular and write-in votes for the least popular bird on the first 50, the Jabiru or Black-necked stork, which came in last with 171 votes. People also had a few votes for a specific bird of the year, including: The Goose from pop culture phenomenon Untitled Goose Game had 22 write-in votes. The cockatoo made famous for removing anti-bird spikes received at least one vote specifically Coles Piping Hot Roast Chicken\u2122 received one vote \u201cBrad Bird\u201d received 15 votes. Were they for noted American voice actor, director and animator Brad Bird? Not sure The write-in campaign for the Pacific Black Duck amounted to a very small [eds note - I would say valiant!] number of votes, with 26 in total Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin received one vote \u201cBin Chicken\u201d received 10 votes Speaking of, here\u2019s the real Nick Evershed, with the top write-ins \u2013 who could now graduate to the top 50 next time. And look at this finch analysis that is almost worthy of our own Nick Evershed \u201cComparing this year to last time (2017), the finch has a bigger share of the initial votes than either of the two leaders from last year - who had national endorsements from Triple J.\u201d Interesting. Magpie supporters are finding other angles to strike back The black-throated finch was in the lead for round one, thousands of votes ahead of the magpie in second. Earlier I asked their spokesperson how confident they are: \u201cI expect the black-throated finch will do very well, but definitely have no presumptions. It could be very close. There\u2019s no secret campaign formula. I just hope to keep people informed and slightly entertained as the vote progresses.\u201d When asked which bird was their biggest competitor, they launched a direct attack on the magpie, last year\u2019s winner. \u201cThe other nine birds against this rare finch are all common and popular birds. So, I\u2019m thinking they\u2019ll all do well, but hoping we don\u2019t have a rerun with the same winner. I like the idea of sharing. Maybe Guardian Australia will consider eliminating the winner for the following year\u2019s poll in future?\u201d The jockeying has begun for round 2. There are the floating votes of 40 unlucky birds, and (write-ins!) out there, looking for a home. The big 10 are campaigning in earnest. I have obtained this concession speech from cassowary spokesdog, First Dog on the Moon. \u201cI will never concede \u2013 we will demand a recount and then off to the court of disputed returns. And while we do that we will also be lobbying for a top 13 as more representative of the desire of decent bird-loving Australians\u201d. But, I understand he has told internal colleagues: \u201cHmm we probably should have started a few days ago\u201d. So before write-ins, the galah was 5 away from as high as ninth. The wagtail was 2 ahead of the eagle, who was only 3 ahead of the galah. Incredible. Voting is now open for the final round. It\u2019s the same link you used before. They are (in no particular order): Superb fairywren, willie wagtail, rainbow lorikeet, magpie, kookaburra, black-throated finch, white ibis, tawny frogmouth, wedge-tailed eagle, suplhur-crested cockatoo. We\u2019ll have more analysis and data on these last, frantic hours up soon. An explanation of the counting process from electoral commissioner Nick Evershed: The final vote count at the close of the poll was very close for the willie wagtail (1710), wedge-tailed eagle (1708) and galah (1705). These totals vary slightly from the final ones published on the site due to delays in publishing the vote totals from the database, and our process for ensuring votes are valid based on the timestamps of the votes received For the final count we exclude votes before and after the poll opens and closes, which alters the totals slightly. Willie wagtail received 15 write-ins, the eagle seven, and the galah six, putting the final vote count as 1725, 1715 and 1711 respectively. This means the galah is knocked out of the final top 10 runoff vote. This is it. After one round, 2 weeks, and more than 50,000 votes, it came down to 4. At the close of polls, with all write-in votes accounted for, the final standings were: (#9) Willie wagtail: 1,725 (#10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,715 (#11) Galah: 1,711 I hereby declare the willie wagtail and the wedge-tailed eagle progress to the final round. Only 14 votes separated ninth and eleventh, meaning we were surely only minutes away from both the eagle and galah soaring through. This one will sting for team galah. Before write-ins, the wedge-tailed eagle was on 1,708 and the galah on 1,705. The wagtail received 15 write-ins, the eagle seven, and the galah six. I have been told that a result is imminent. If we knew counting the votes would take so long \u2013 we could have had some talking heads in the office. Different people from the various bird campaigns, discussing how the night\u2019s going for them. No uncertainty about this result, at least. Trending #1. Some haunting words from 2017, and Ben Raue, who designed the current two round system. A fairer voting system for a bird poll wouldn\u2019t need to be too complicated to be reasonably fair. You could conduct it in two rounds. The first, say, five options...would go through to a second round of voting, with voters then choosing a single winner from that group. Anyone for a runoff round? This morning, some naysayers said my opening paragraph to this blog \u2013 about how small moments can change the course of history \u2013 was a bit too much. I believe I\u2019ve now been proven right. A handful of votes, a few seconds, could be make or break for three different birds. And the knock-on effects could reverberate through the rest. Who will be left wondering, what if? In federal elections, under AEC regulations, a full recount is conducted if the margin between first and second after preferences is less than 100 votes. Electoral analyst Ben Raue: We cannot stress enough that the result is so close, it needs forensic analysis before any declaration. More than 50,000 votes have been cast, over two weeks. At the latest tally, the wagtail was only 2 ahead of the wedge-tailed eagle, which itself was only 12 ahead of the galah. Write-ins were available the whole period and we are counting them now. Refresh your browser, refresh your browser, refresh your browser. This is what you should be seeing. I am being told that not only do write-in votes need to be tallied, but double votes need to be removed. Please disregard inflammatory posts such as this: Here\u2019s what happening. The most important thing is the result is unknown. There\u2019s a lot going on. Our electoral commission of Nick Evershed and Andy Ball have paused voting. The result is so close, with at times, less than 10 votes between three birds going for two spaces (out of over 50,000 votes), that we\u2019re going to need to check again. Votes are still trickling in, data is still refreshing, it all comes down to timestamps, and \u2013 most importantly of all, we\u2019ll have to now manually check all the write-in votes. If you refresh the voting page, you\u2019ll see it has switched to the page for round 2. You may see that the galah is not on this \u2013 but the eagle and wagtail are. This is not an indication of who has won, and voting has been paused on this page currently. Round two was not scheduled to start until 12pm AEDT (in an hour) anyway. The updates here will continue. Some incredible scenes right now. I don\u2019t know quite what to say. Our data team are working furiously right now. Despite the leaderboard showing, at 11am AEDT, that the galah was OUT by a margin of 12 votes, a later refresh has shown all three birds to be equal on 1,709. I\u2019ve been told that it may take a little while to check the votes, millisecond by millisecond, to figure out who is through. I have to stress that this is not the final result, as the data is still being updated. Please refresh your browser, on all bird of the year windows. Stay with us. The galah is 12 behind the eagle and salvation. Wagtail is 2 ahead of the eagle. The powerful account Parrot of the Day is backing the galah. This tweet a minute ago could be the source of the surge TWELVE VOTES now in it between the galah and the eagle. Is this a late run? Wagtail 2 ahead of the eagle, which is 20 ahead of the galah. The cassowary is 300 votes away from all of them. I have gone to First Dog for a concession speech. I think the writing is on the wall. This is the closest the galah has been to 10th all day. Is it enough? 5 minutes left. Still 20 behind. The galah (#11) is 20 votes behind the eagle (#10). From data editor Nick Evershed, here\u2019s this morning in a graph. Look at that cassowary spike. Of course, at the rate this is all moving, it\u2019s already slightly out of date. But wait \u2013 another refresh, and the wagtail is back! It reclaims 9th, now 3 ahead of the eagle. The galah has also added 12 votes in only 4 minutes. It\u2019s only 23 behind the eagle. Don\u2019t trust any predictions, it\u2019s frantic. There we go. The eagle overtakes the wagtail. It hasn\u2019t faltered today, and from starting off in danger, now seems completely safe. A strong, strong late showing for the wagtail means it\u2019s fending off the galah\u2019s advance. But there could yet be another twist in this narrative yet. As at 10.45am AEDT (#9) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,691 (+63 since 10am) (#10) Willie wagtail: 1,689 (+61) (#11) Galah: 1,660 (+68) (#12) Cassowary: 1,369 (+87) As of 10.43 AEDT, the eagle and wagtail are EXACTLY even at 1,683. The galah is still 33 behind both. Full figures coming up soon. In the meantime, the black-throated finch looks set to absolutely clinch number one \u2013 for this first round. Will it hold onto the lead in round two? A spokesman for the finch campaign has thanked supporters, after being interviewed by Guardian Australia earlier this morning. \u201cMinor premiers sounds good!\u201d they said. \u201cTo the BTF voters, I say thank you! You\u2019re caring and commitment inspires hope. Each of you is a crucial vote and you need to stick with us for round 2. And also to the scientists in the BTF recovery team.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows why the BTF is up front. It\u2019s being wiped out to expand fossil fuels whilst a climate emergency is on the boil....This is the only threatened bird in the top ten, so I hope others flock to the cause.\u201d We\u2019ll hear more from them later \u2013 right now, the focus is still on round 1. The galah has not overtaken the eagle once today. They\u2019ve been adding on votes at pretty much the same rate \u2013 though the margin has been cut from around 40 to 30. Votes are pouring in. A minute after that last post, I refresh and there\u2019s 5 more for the wagtail and an equal 5 more for the wedge-tailed. Only 1 more for galah. Right now: Wagtail is 2 ahead of the eagle. Eagle is 30 ahead of the galah. As at 10.30am AEDT (#9) Willie wagtail: 1,666 (+29 since 10am) (#10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,664 (+36) (#11) Galah: 1,638 (+46) (#12) Cassowary: 1,334 (+52) An SOS going out from team willie wagtail. So close to the finish, you\u2019ve got to call in every favour. There will be time to rest and recover in round 2. The slate is wiped clean. THREE VOTES between the willie wagtail and the wedge-tailed eagle. But the wagtail is still 30 ahead of the galah. So many great birds \u2013 some still in the running, others now bowing out. Don\u2019t let the race for 10th obscure their achievements. Panic in camp cassowary. Have they mobilised too late? Still over 300 votes away from 10th. I\u2019ll need them to release their own election autopsy \u2013 how did this happen? At 10.15 (AEDT): (#9) Willie wagtail: 1,650 (+13 since 10am) (#10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,641 (+13) (#11) Galah: 1,612 (+20) (#12) Cassowary: 1,303 (+21) The wagtail has to fight a rearguard action here. But I\u2019m not seeing any campaigners doing anything, there is no late rally. They\u2019re completely blindsided. In the past 7 minutes, the wagtail has added 2 votes, the eagle 3, the galah has surged 7. Wagtail is currently 8 ahead of the eagle. Eagle is 33 ahead of the galah. But the galah has the most momentum in the last hour. The final stretch, and it\u2019s all to play for. This morning, it was eagle or galah. Now it could be both \u2013 and the wagtail out. A huge late cassowary surge is on, but it might not be enough. The standings as of 10am (AEDT): (9) Willie wagtail: 1,637 (+19 since 9am) (10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,628 (+44 since 9am) (11) Galah: 1,592 (+59) (12) Cassowary: 1,282 (+86) The eagle is 42 ahead of the galah \u2013 barely a change since 8am (AEDT). But the galah is now only 55 behind the wagtail. It was 102 behind at 8am. Could this be goodbye wagtail? Just over an 1 hour left. The latest: (9) Willie wagtail: 1,630 (10) Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,617 (11) Galah: 1,575 (12) Southern cassowary: 1,255 (13) Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo: 1,245 The WA cockatoo lovers are trying to mount an urgent campaign Hang on...is the willie wagtail in danger? On the latest figures, a huge upset could be brewing. The high-profile fight between the wedge-tailed eagle and the galah is propelling both up the charts. The wagtail, sitting at 9th, hasn\u2019t seen much love. It\u2019s only 20 above the eagle. And the eagle\u2019s added 35 votes in the last 40 minutes, the galah 38. The wagtail has only added 11 in that time. It\u2019s only 58 votes away from dropping out of round 2 altogether. Watch this space. The cassowary has overtaken the carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo. This is huge. It\u2019s now 5 votes ahead. The stats behind this are incredible, and I\u2019ll crunch them for you soon, but it\u2019ll have to wait a second because... THREE VOTES now between the cassowary and the carnaby\u2019s. There is huge, huge buzz for the cassowary. It\u2019s now only 14 behind the carnaby\u2019s! half an hour ago, it was 38 behind. Social media is lighting up. It\u2019s surging, and it\u2019s coming for 12th. The only issue \u2013 12th is still over 300 votes away from 10th. Is it too little too late? If you\u2019re a parrot or galah voter, email me or tweet on the #birdoftheyear hashtag. I want to know how confident you\u2019re feeling, your last-minute campaign tactics. And, if worst comes to worst, who you will be voting for in round 2 if your candidate doesn\u2019t get up. Spare a thought for the cassowary. Powerful, intimidating, can disembowel you with a toenail. But only 13th? 33 votes behind the carnaby\u2019s, 346 behind galah, 387 behind the eagle? Head of the cassowary\u2019s late stage campaign, resident cartoonist First Dog On The Moon had this to say: \u201c[The birds above the cassowary,] those are stupid birds. Isn\u2019t the rainbow lorikeet feral in some parts of the country? The tawny frogmouth isn\u2019t even a bird \u2013 look at it.\u201d How confident is he of the cassowary making the top 10? \u201c100% confident. But we need to get online and we need to vote now. This is important. Cassowaries never win anything.\u201d Don\u2019t think we\u2019ve forgotten number 12. The carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo, the pride of Western Australia. It\u2019s currently 313 votes behind the galah, and 354 behind the eagle. Is it looking bleak? At least, carnaby\u2019s fans could be happy that their sulphur-crested cousin is up there at #4. But then again, I know plenty of other parrot family voters who are planning to switch to something completely different in round 2. I wouldn\u2019t take the preference flow for granted. We all contain multitudes. As of 9am (AEDT): Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,584 (+32 over past hour) Galah: 1,533 (+25 over past hour) 51 votes in it. In the chasing pack: Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo: 1,234 Southern cassowary: 1,196 The eagle is cruising. Votes are pouring in \u2013 but almost equally for both birds. The gap has now slightly widened to 44. Eagle still ahead. As of this morning, 50,000 votes have been cast. Let\u2019s celebrate this milestone by listening to our latest Full Story podcast \u2013 which features reader call-ins, and will equally make you laugh and cry. The battle for 10th is why we\u2019re here. If you\u2019ve already voted, find a friend who hasn\u2019t. Tell them it\u2019s eagle v galah. They\u2019ll want to pick one. Then, after 11am, tell them to vote again. They have been neck-and-neck this entire vote. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s gone down: The galah was ahead on the morning of day 1, but then eagle overtook in the afternoon. By day 3, the galah was back \u2013 and stayed there for an incredible 8 days. But just yesterday, around noon, it struck, overhauled the galah and has been on top, by 30-40 votes ever since. Here\u2019s the state of play. As of 8am: Black-throated finch: 7,107 Australian magpie: 3,482 Laughing kookaburra: 2,958 Sulphur-crested cockatoo: 2,615 Australian white ibis: 2,437 Superb fairywren: 2,386 Tawny frogmouth: 2,293 Rainbow lorikeet: 1,694 Willie wagtail: 1,610 Wedge-tailed eagle: 1,551 Galah: 1,508 In the second round, voting will go over 6 days. Until Thursday 5pm. Sometimes, a few hours end up defining history. Gavrilo Princip thought he\u2019d missed Franz Ferdinand when, a few hours later outside a deli, the Archduke\u2019s car pulled up in front of him. In 1983, Soviet soldier Stanislav Petrov\u2019s missile warning system malfunctioned. Instead of firing back, he waited a few minutes. In less than three hours, voting for round one of bird of the year will close. You may have missed the memo \u2013 there are two rounds this time. The top 10 birds go through. Then you get to vote again. This makes the race for 10th crucial. And two brilliant, absolutely beautiful birds have been duking it out for weeks. At 12pm yesterday it was the galah by 30. By 1.30pm, the wedge-tailed eagle by 14. And behind them, the carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo and the cassowary, lurking in striking distance. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say the next few hours could decide the whole election. 11th by a hair and you\u2019re out. 10th, and you could win the whole thing. If the galah gets up, that could split the parrot vote in the second round. If the eagle sneaks through, it could pick up votes from the cassowary, peregrine falcon and powerful owl, snowballing to victory. It boils down to this. At 11am (AEDT), we start again. It\u2019s a brave new world, a blank slate for any bird to seize and make their own. Ten birds will emerge, shaking off the dust, blinking in the sun. The question is, which will be there? The answer is up to you.",

The federal court, acting as the court of disputed returns, is hearing whether two signs written in Chinese characters used at polling booths in the electorates of Chisholm and Kooyong at May\u2019s election should lead to the results being voided \u2013 a move that would force the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and MP Gladys Liu to a byelection in those seats. The signs, in the AEC\u2019s purple and white colours, told voters \u201cthe correct voting method\u201d was to put 1 next to the Liberal candidate and then number the rest of the boxes. It had an authorisation at the bottom in small text from the Liberal party, but no logo. The applicants, Kooyong candidate Oliver Yates and climate campaigner Vanessa Garbett, have argued the signs breached section 329(1) of the Electoral Act, which makes it an offence to print material likely to deceive a voter. In previous cases the law has been interpreted narrowly, prohibiting the misleading of voters in relation to the process of casting their vote but not banning otherwise misleading or untruthful material. On the third and final day of hearings on Friday, the barrister for Liu and Frydenberg, Philip Solomon QC, said the petitioners were arguing there was a subsection of Chinese-speaking voters in the two electorates who \u201cattended a polling booth to vote steeled to vote one way, and [based on the sign] determined that they were being commanded when casting their ballot to vote for the Liberal party\u201d. He said the case being put forward by the petitioners was unsustainable. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be dramatic, but that\u2019s laughable.\u201d Solomon\u2019s argument echoed that put forward by the AEC the day before.

On day one of the hearing, the acting Liberal party state director in Victoria at the time of the election, Simon Frost, admitted the corflutes were designed to give the impression they were AEC signs. On Friday, Solmon said Yates and Garbett wanted the judges to rule that the Liberal party should not have used the signs, but the question before the court was simply whether voters were likely to have been deceived by it. \u201cThere was no suggestion to Mr Frost that he was seeking to do that or that he achieved [that],\u201d he said. Solomon argued that even if the petitions were dismissed, the court should not \u201ccriticise\u201d Frost in its judgment, noting that Labor had used signs in similar colours at the Bennelong by-election in December 2017. The Liberal candidates are seeking the dismissal of both cases, with costs awarded to them. The judges reserved their decision.",

The unnamed author, identified only as \u201ca senior official in the Trump administration\u201d, also says that colleagues considered resigning en masse in order to raise alarm about the president\u2019s conduct, but ultimately decided against it, according to the Post. The extracts obtained by the Post are due to appear in A Warning, a book written by the unnamed person who last year wrote a New York Times column critical of the president. They paint Trump as volatile and incompetent, while also describing how he made racist and misogynistic statements in private. In the book, the author describes Trump\u2019s approach to the presidency as \u201clike a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport\u201d. The author also describes how Trump\u2019s impulsive Twitter antics often left senior officials \u201cwaking up in the morning \u2018in a full-blown panic\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him,\u201d the author writes, according to the Post. \u201cYou\u2019re stunned, amused, and embarrassed all at the same time. Only your uncle probably wouldn\u2019t do it every single day, his words aren\u2019t broadcast to the public, and he doesn\u2019t have to lead the US government once he puts his pants on.\u201d The White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham criticized the book and the author\u2019s decision to remain anonymous. \u201cThe coward who wrote this book didn\u2019t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies,\u201d she said on Thursday. She said reporters should \u201ccover the book as what it is: a work of fiction\u201d. The Post said the author decided to publish the work anonymously so as not to distract from the president and the larger issues. \u201cI have decided to publish this anonymously because this debate is not about me,\u201d the official writes. \u201cIt is about us. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this \u2018cowardice\u2019. My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course.\u201d The book includes passages describing Trump allegedly making misogynistic and racist comments behind the scenes, commenting on people\u2019s weight or appearance, and at one point describes the president as trying to affect a Hispanic accent during an Oval Office meeting to complain about migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. In one alleged incident, Trump said: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children. They are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d The unnamed author\u2019s original op-ed in the New York Times, headlined I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration, alleged that some senior White House officials collaborated to protect the country and public from some of Trump\u2019s most dangerous and irresponsible impulses.

The Australian Education Union\u2019s president, Correna Haythorpe, said it was \u201canother slush fund for private schools\u201d on top of the $1.2bn Choice and Affordability fund for Catholic and independent schools, which also included money for drought-affected areas. On Thursday the education minister, Dan Tehan, announced the Coalition would provide \u201c$10m for schools that are impacted by drought so that they can provide relief to families\u201d \u2013 modelled on its response to the Queensland floods \u2013 and an extra $5m for childcare centres. He said the funding would address \u201cthe impact on parents of drought and worrying whether they\u2019ll \u2026 be able to continue to afford to send their children to school\u201d and the toil and hardship parents suffer paying school fees. The education department has specified the $10m is only for non-government schools as a \u201csupplementary financial source for schools\u201d which have \u201cintroduced fee relief and/or curtailed their operations to cope with this drastic situation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The University of Western Australia\u2019s surprise decision to shut down its publishing house has prompted outrage and protest from the Australian literary community. The fate of the 84-year-old publishing house, UWA Publishing, was communicated via a \u201cproposal for change\u201d circulated by the university\u2019s senior management on Tuesday, blindsiding staff. UWAP publishes literary fiction, including works by multiple Miles Franklin award winners, alongside non-fiction, poetry and scholarly works for an academic and general readership. It is known for the diversity of voices on its list. But the proposal from UWA\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor (global partnerships) said that as \u201conly a small proportion of the authors and content published by UWA Publishing relate directly to the university and its work\u201d, the university was planning to embark on a \u201cprogressive close down\u201d of UWAP\u2019s activities from the end of November this year. The objective was to \u201calign the output of this area\u201d to the \u201cstrategic vision\u201d of the university in providing \u201copen and digitised access to information and knowledge in support of the University\u2019s academic writing and research\u201d, the proposal said. The wording echoes University of Melbourne\u2019s arguments regarding the controversial realignment earlier this year of its own publishing house, Melbourne University Publishing, to focus on scholarly works over commercial publishing. That decision prompted a mass resignation of the university publisher\u2019s board and its chief executive, Louise Adler. Five staff at UWAP will either have their contracts terminated or be made redundant as a consequence of the proposed shut down. Publishing director Terri-Ann White said the decision came \u201ccompletely out of the blue\u201d. \u201cIt was really surprising when we found out on Tuesday and we were delivered a document that outlined the next steps and intentions for the future,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. White said that UWAP had been \u201cvery open\u201d to embarking on open-access and digital publishing alongside its print priorities, but that the university\u2019s preference appeared to be to \u201cclose off one path and start another\u201d. White said she was very concerned about the lack of provision in the proposed shutdown for servicing the 350 authors on UWAP\u2019s backlist, and for the future of the 35 books scheduled to be published in 2020. One of UWAP\u2019s most recent successes was Josephine Wilson\u2019s novel, Extinctions, which won the 2017 Miles Franklin award. Wilson\u2019s novel had also won UWAP\u2019s Dorothy Hewett award for an unpublished manuscript two years earlier \u2013 an incentive the publishing house had put in place to excavate and elevate new Australian literature. UWAP also publishes an array of Noongar language books by dual-Miles Franklin award-winner Kim Scott, as part of the Wirlomin Noongar Language and Stories Project. News of the publishing house\u2019s imminent closure began circulating publicly on Thursday night. By Friday morning, a petition had been established and was collecting signatures. Its creator, Melinda Smith, who won the prime minister\u2019s prize for poetry in 2014, called the decision \u201cshort-sighted\u201d. \u201cUWAP under current director Terri-Ann White is a national treasure and its cessation would leave an enormous hole in the Australian literary landscape,\u201d Smith wrote. At the time of publication, the petition had nearly 1,200 signatures. Responses to the news on social media have centred around White, who has been at UWAP for 14 years, calling her \u201cindefatigable\u201d, full of \u201cvision, energy, imagination and intellect\u201d. Academic and editor of Australian Literary Studies, Julianne Lamond, told Guardian Australia she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the news. \u201cUWAP is a small scholarly press that has had a huge impact on Australian literary culture and Australian culture more generally,\u201d Lamond said. Lamond said UWAP had been particularly important for nurturing scholarship on Australian writing, and especially writing from the west. \u201cTerri-Ann White is a brilliant publisher who has done fantastic work both in the big scholarship on Australian literature and in Australian writing.\u201d White has a reputation as a committed supporter of Australian literature. When a number of small poetry presses folded after former arts minister George Brandis removed funds from the Australia Council for the Arts in 2015 to create the short-lived and controversial parallel funding body later named Catalyst, White and UWAP established a poetry series specifically to support those works that would have otherwise gone unpublished. White told Guardian Australia that the response from the literary community had been \u201cheartwarming\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m so delighted that our authors are coming out to support us but also that people we haven\u2019t published are rallying to support us,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had messages from all of the funding bodies, agents, publishers and other people involved in the literary business.\u201d White said the UWAP community planned to fight back hard against the closure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mobilising some key voices to write to the university and put the case, and we are very, very pleased about the petition which has only been up for a short time and is going like the clappers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November to clarify a reference to Melbourne University Publishing\u2019s board resigning",

He pre-baked the Mueller report. He is hard at work on a report that is expected to attack the work of US intelligence agencies on which that report was built. He did not recuse himself from a justice department review of a phone call Trump had with the Ukrainian president, despite being mentioned himself on the call. The review, perhaps not surprisingly, found that the call was, legally speaking, peachy.</p> <p>But there are lines, apparently, that even Barr will not cross. The attorney general <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-william-barr-ukraine-call.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">refused</a> a request by Trump to hold a news conference and declare that no laws were broken in the call, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-wanted-barr-to-hold-news-conference-saying-the-president-broke-no-laws-in-call-with-ukrainian-leader/2019/11/06/16d541ec-ff55-11e9-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html\">Washington Post</a> reported late Wednesday in an account backed up by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-william-barr-ukraine-call.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a>. (Correction: we originally had those news organizations reversed; it was a Post scoop.)</p> <p>Trump is a big believer in the power of press conferences. In 2017 he pressured then FBI director James Comey to go on TV and declare he was not a target in the nascent investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey likewise refused. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a demand by Trump that the Ukrainian president \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of [Joe] Biden and 2016 election interference.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1192336620772417536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump tried to get one government to have a press conference saying he committed no crime for trying to get a different government to have a press release saying that his political opponent did commit a crime. <a href=\"https://t.co/lCFDw26yp9\">https://t.co/lCFDw26yp9</a></p>&mdash; Orin Kerr (@OrinKerr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1192336620772417536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, it looks like the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump will wangle their second witness of the week today \u2013 out of about a dozen subpoenas and requests on the week.</p> <p>Scheduled to testify is Jennifer Williams, a national security aid to vice president Mike Pence who listened to the 25 July call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. </p> <p><em>Also</em> invited to testify today, but apparently not planning to appear, is John Bolton, the former national security adviser. </p> <p>Thanks for joining us!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T14:28:15.125Z\">at 2.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Friday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to utter those three magic words: \u201cinvestigations\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d according to testimony from George Kent, the State Department official responsible for Ukraine affairs. An aide to Mike Pence testified in the impeachment inquiry. Jennifer Williams, who attended a closed-door deposition as planned, was among the officials listening to the July 25 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky. Former New York governor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg is reportedly preparing to join the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Progressive frontrunners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders responded to the news with some light trolling. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions has entered the US senate race, vying to retake his former seat as Alabama senator. Trump was fined $2m for misusing charity funds to boost his presidential campaign. The Washington Post has obtained an advance copy of the book by an anonymous writer who describes themselves as a senior official in the Trump administration. Here are some key excerpts: \u201cIt\u2019s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him\u201d the author wrote. Trump allegedly attempted a Hispanic accent to mock migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children,\u201d Trump said, according to Anonymous. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d Trump apparently wanted to get reduce the number of federal judges: \u201cCan we just get rid of the judges? Let\u2019s get rid of the [expletive] judges,\u201d he reportedly said. As anticipated, the former attorney general has announced that he\u2019s running to retake his former role as a senator from Alabama. Sessions, who earned Donald Trump\u2019s ire for recusing himself from Russia probe, remains a frequent punching bag for the president. In a statement posted on his campaign website, Sessions appears to anticipate blowback from the president with fawning praise for Potus. \u201cHave I said a cross word about President Trump? No.\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you why: first, that would be dishonorable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the President is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs everyone knows, President Trump and I have had our ups and downs. But here\u2019s the important part: the President is doing great work for America.\u201d Trump has said that naming Sessions as the attorney general was the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his presidency. John Kasich said he won\u2019t challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential race In a series of tweets, John Kasich said won\u2019t running for president. The Republican former governor of Ohio said, \u201cAt this point, I continue to believe that, for me, there\u2019s no clear path to prevail that I can see.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to push my supporters, my friends, my family to do something that I don\u2019t think will result in success at this point,\u201d he said. Kasich ran against Trump in 2016. When he dropped out of the race then, he refused to endorse Trump and declined to attend the Republican National Convention that year. Some moderate Republicans had wondered whether he\u2019d pursue a rematch. Donald Trump responds to $2m fine: \u2018No wonder why we are all leaving!\u2019 The president, and now ex-New Yorker was ordered by a judge to pay $2m in damages for illegally diverting funds from his charity to his 2016 presidential election campaign. Still, per his statement, Trump will be complying. In a statement, he said he\u2019s \u201chappy to donate $2 million\u201d to \u201cworthy charities\u201d. This is exactly what Justice Saliann Scarpulla ordered the Trump family to do as part of a settlement with the New York state attorney general\u2019s office after \u201cpersistent\u201d violations\u201d of law and \u201crepeated and willful self-dealing\u201d. Bernie on Bloomberg: \u2018The billionaire class is scared\u2019 Like fellow progressive 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders has responded to news the Michael Bloomberg may be entering the 2020 race with a bring-it-on attitude. Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir also said, in a statement: \u201cMore billionaires seeking more political power surely isn\u2019t the change America needs.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear whether the former New York mayor and billionaire businessman will enter the 2020 primaries. He\u2019s expected to file paperwork this week to enter the primary in Alabama, which has an early deadline. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren has upped her trolling. Her tax calculator for billionaires now features quick links for Bloomberg as well as Bill Gates and Leon Cooperman. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy (my live-blogging buddy today) has some more in-depth analysis from the testimony of State Department official George Kent. Kent, who was responsible for Ukraine policy, provides new details on the reactions inside the State Department to Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meddling: Trump told Zelenskiy on the phone in late July that he wanted him to pursue investigations of his political rival Joe Biden and a 2016 election conspiracy theory, according to a call summary released by the White House. But by early September, after a creep down what another witness has described as a \u201ccontinuum\u201d of \u201cinsidiousness\u201d, the demand had grown more specific. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told fellow diplomats at the time that \u201che, Gordon, had talked to the President \u2013 POTUS in sort of shorthand \u2013 and POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelenskiy to go to a microphone and say \u2018investigations\u2019, \u2018Biden\u2019, and \u2018Clinton\u2019,\u201d Kent testified, according to the new transcripts. Elizabeth Warren welcomes Michael Bloomberg to the 2020 race, with the utmost sincerity: George Kent, the senior State Department official responsible for Ukraine policy testified that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u201chad been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information,\u201d and his \u201cassertions and allegations against former\u201d Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch \u201cwere without basis, untrue, period\u201d. According to the testimony released today, Kent unsuccessfully pressed the State Department to issue a \u201cclear statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch\u201d after a series of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and \u201ctweets by members of the Presidential family.\u201d Yovanovitch, who was herself deposed in the House democrats impeachment inquiry, said she ambassador Yovanovitch says she was told to tweet praise of the president to save her job. Bloomberg is preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary, the New York Times reports. He\u2019s expected to file paperwork designating himself as a candidate in Alabama this week. From the Times: Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, has been privately weighing a bid for the White House for weeks and has not yet made a final decision on whether to run, an adviser said. But in the first sign that he is seriously moving toward a campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has dispatched staffers to Alabama to gather signatures to qualify for the primary there. Though Alabama does not hold an early primary, it has a Friday deadline for candidates to formally enter the race. The billionaire businessman with centrist politics has \u2014 like some other billionaire businessmen \u2014 expressed skepticism at the policies of progressive front-runners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A judge in New York orders Donald Trump to pay $2 million for misusing his charitable foundation. In testimony newly released Thursday, longtime foreign service officer George Kent said Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to say three words \u2013 \u201cinvestigation\u201d, \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d \u2013 to hold up Ukraine\u2019s end of a bargain whose terms were unclear to Kent. A senior aide on the campaign of billionaire Tom Steyer in Iowa has been offering money for endorsements, the AP reported. Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff told Republicans they have until Saturday to suggest impeachment witnesses. Schiff laid out \u201cinquiry parameters\u201d that read to some like draft articles of impeachment. No 1: \u201cDid the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President\u2019s personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President\u2019s political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 U.S. presidential election?\u201d Former national security adviser John Bolton did not show up for a scheduled deposition before the committees. Trump repeatedly attacked reports that attorney general William Barr refused his request to go on television and say there was nothing illegal about a July call between Trump and Ukraine. Donald Trump has been talking with his TV producer pals about life after the presidency and there might be an Apprentice: White House. Pence aide Jennifer Williams, who testified earlier today, told impeachment investigators that she found a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president to be \u201cunusual because it was political in nature,\u201d according to a CNN report citing two sources familiar with the testimony. But Williams did not shed light on what Pence might have known about the Ukraine plot, CNN reports: She was asked by lawmakers in her closed-door deposition what Pence knows and she testified that she never heard him mention anything about investigations of the 2016 election, Burisma -- the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter say -- or the Bidens. Yes, that gentleman who accompanied Pence aide Jennifer Williams to her deposition earlier was in fact exceptionally tall, the internet reveals: Kent\u2019s testimony nails down the broad planks of Trump\u2019s plot in Ukraine familiar from previous testimony: Giuliani and diplomats, especially Sondland and Volker, were chasing Ukraine to announce investigations into Biden, the discovery of which shocked career diplomats as much as did the announcement that \u201cthe acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at the direction of the President had put a hold on all security assistance to the Ukraine.\u201d Notably, Kent turned on his boss, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, after Pompeo sent what Kent thought was an inaccurate letter accusing Congress of attempting to bully, intimidate, and threaten career foreign service officers. \u201cAnd I was one of two career foreign service officers which had received letters from the committees, and I had not felt bullied, threatened, and intimidated,\u201d Kent said. He notified top state department lawyers and the director of the foreign service that what Pompeo said was wrong. Finally, Kent documented the Trump plot unfolding in Ukraine at the time, with a 16 August memo. \u201cI wrote a note to the file saying that I had concerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and the U.S,\u201d Kent said. Here are top lines from the Kent testimony, as selected by the committees: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was recalled because Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman, and others \u201cstarted reaching out actively to undermine Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d Yuriy Lutsenko made a private trip to New York to meet with Rudy Giuliani in order to \u201cthrow mud\u201d at State Department officials, including Mr. Kent and Ambassador Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani was \u201calmost unmissable\u201d as the \u201ccampaign of slander\u201d against Ambassador Yovanovitch and others unfolded in Ukraine and the United States. The State Department reached \u201cthe breaking point of our disillusionment with Yuriy Lutsenko,\u201d the Ukrainian prosecutor general, when they discovered he was \u201cessentially colluding with a corrupt official\u201d to undermine a legitimate investigation into fake passports. Mr. Kent unsuccessfully pressed the State Department to issue a \u201cclear statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch\u201d after a series of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d and \u201cTweets by members of the Presidential family.\u201d Ambassador Gordon Sondland suggested that Ambassador Yovanovitch \u201cdo a video or tweet declaring full support for the foreign policy of President Trump.\u201d The United States \u201chad our Ambassador just removed through actions by corrupt Ukrainians in Ukraine as well as private American citizens back here.\u201d Rudy Giuliani \u201chad been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information,\u201d and his \u201cassertions and allegations against former Ambassador Yovanovitch were without basis, untrue, period.\u201d After Rudy Giuliani attacked Ambassador Taylor, Under Secretary of State David Hale warned him to \u201ckeep my head down and lower my profile in Ukraine.\u201d Ambassador Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry asserted that they \u201chad the mandate to take the lead on coordinating efforts to engage the new Ukrainian leadership.\u201d Ambassador Volker had a private discussion with President Zelensky \u201cto underscore the importance of the messaging that Zelensky needed to provide to President Trump about his willingness to be cooperative.\u201d Ambassador Volker said \u201che planned to start reaching out to\u201d Rudy Giuliani because \u201cit was clear that the former mayor had influence on the President in terms of the way the President thought of Ukraine.\u201d Ambassador Volker was \u201cthinking tactically\u201d about interacting with Rudy Giuliani, but Mr. Kent was \u201cconcerned strategically.\u201d There was \u201cgreat confusion\u201d during a call on July 18, 2019, when an OMB official announced that \u201cthe acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at the direction of the President had put a hold on all security assistance to the Ukraine.\u201d After the call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and said \u201che could not share the majority of what was discussed because of the very sensitive nature of what was discussed.\u201d In August 2019, Mr. Kent had \u201cgrowing concerns that individuals were pushing communications with Ukrainians that had not been discussed and endorsed in the formal policy process.\u201d With respect to President Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Biden, Mr. Kent stated: \u201cI do not believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions.\u201d Asking Ukraine to investigate someone for political reasons \u201cgoes against everything that we are trying to promote in post-Soviet states for the last 28 years, which is the promotion of the rule of law.\u201d After Ambassador Volker raised with a senior aide to President Zelensky that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani were interested in initiating investigations, Mr. Kent said, \u201cthat\u2019s wrong, and we shouldn\u2019t be doing that as a matter of U.S. policy.\u201d In August 16, 2019, Mr. Kent memorialized these conversations in a memorandum, in which he expressed \u201cconcerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both Ukraine and U.S.\u201d In September 2019, according to Ambassador Sondland, \u201cPOTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton.\u201d Ambassador Sondland was \u201cpushing\u201d for President Zelensky to \u201csend a public signal of announcing a willingness to pursue investigations\u201d in order to \u201cclear the way for both the White House visit as well as the resumption or the clearing of the administrative hold on security assistance,\u201d despite claims by Mr. Morrison and Mr. Sondland that they did not believe the issues were \u201clinked\u201d. The State Department delayed in issuing internal instructions to collect documents in response to the Committees\u2019 September 9 or September 23 letters, or the September 27 subpoena. On October 1, 2019, Mr. Kent alerted the Director General of the Foreign Service and the Acting Legal Adviser of the State Department that Secretary Pompeo\u2019s letter to the Committees, sent earlier that day, was inaccurate. On October 3, 2019, Mr. Kent raised concerns with State Department officials about their delay in responding to the Committees\u2019 subpoena and inaccuracies in Secretary Pompeo\u2019s October 1, 2019, letter to the Committees. Mr. Kent produced all relevant documents in his possession to the State Department. Schiff says Kent corroborates \u201cnumerous\u201d other accounts... and he documented it. The impeachment committees have released a transcript of the deposition of George P Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state who was nominally in charge of Ukraine policy under Trump, but who soon found himself sidelined. Kent is said to have objected strongly to the attack on ambassador Yovanovitch and to the use of an irregular policy channel led by Rudy Giuliani to lead US policy in the region. The transcript is here. We\u2019re reading it now. CNN is reporting on an impeachment timeline that\u2019s shaping up in the House. Looks about right to us: NB: Bill Clinton was impeached on 19 December 1998. Donald Trump might have failed to drag Matt Bevin over the line in Kentucky. But he darn well helped Sean Spicer get into the quarterfinals of this season\u2019s Dancing With the Stars. Spicer, a bald liar who used to be the press secretary, has just sent out an email announcing the big news. As Spicer competed \u2013 can we use that word? \u2013 on Monday night, Trump tweeted to ask people to vote for him. It worked, apparently. Or maybe it was the dancing. Williams, the Pence aide, is done testifying, The Hill reports: A judge in New York orders President Donald Trump to pay $2 million for misusing his charitable foundation, the AP reports. In December 2018, a second New York judge signed off on a deal to shut down Trump\u2019s personal charity after a lawsuit exposed a \u201cshocking pattern of illegality\u201d. Trump had used the charity to pay off legal settlements within his business and even to buy a painting of himself to hang in one of his golf clubs. UPDATE: From a press release from the New York attorney general: The award is part of Attorney General James\u2019 lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation and its directors \u2014 Mr. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump... Chiefly, Mr. Trump admits to personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation, and agrees to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General in the event he creates a new charity. The settlements also include mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlements name the charities that will receive the remaining assets of the Trump Foundation as part of its dissolution. \u201cThe Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,\u201d said Attorney General James. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.\u201d Read further: Election Day 2019 is over, but Michelle Obama is still trying to get out the vote, reports the Associated Press: The former first lady announced that Selena Gomez, Liza Koshy, Shonda Rhimes, Megan Rapinoe, Tracee Ellis Ross and Kerry Washington have signed on as co-chairs of the national organization When We All Vote . Obama is already a co-chair, along with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Faith Hill, Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson, and basketball star Chris Paul. When We Vote bills itself as a nonpartisan group dedicated to increasing voter participation. The announcement Thursday marks a year until the date of the 2020 elections, which includes the presidential race. The organization was founded in 2018. Hanks said \u201cregistering new voters is an act of hope and taking part in the American idea.\u201d He added that voting guarantees the blessings of \u201cliberty for the grandkids.\u201d Andrew Yang: parent, patriot, not a politician. The longshot Democratic presidential candidate has a TV ad out. Come for the helicopter shots of the Golden Gate bridge, stay for the villain cameo by Mark Zuckerberg; The impeachment witnesses continue to review their depositions. There are enough memories jogging in DC this week to start a track club. Desperate to ensure the flow of military aid from the United States, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had decided to go on CNN and announce the investigations Donald Trump wanted, but at the last minute the plan was cancelled with the exposure in the United States of the Trump plot, the New York Times reports, drawing on Ukrainian sources: Finally bending to the White House request, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s staff planned for him to make an announcement in an interview on Sept. 13 with Fareed Zakaria, the host of a weekly news show on CNN. Though plans were in motion to give the White House the public statement it had sought, events in Washington saved the Ukrainian government from any final decision and eliminated the need to make the statement. The report adds: In Kiev, there is still a debate about whether Mr. Zelensky caved or held out. \u201cThe Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,\u201d said Mr. Burkovskiy, the analyst. \u201cThey were ready to do this.\u201d But Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister until a change of government on Aug. 29, said there was no telling what Mr. Zelensky would have ended up saying in the interview, as there were so many versions of a statement under negotiation. An entertaining outtake from last night\u2019s Trump rally in Louisiana: Law prof and impeachment expert Ross Garber points out that Schiff\u2019s statement of the parameters of the inquiry, mentioned earlier, read a lot like draft articles of impeachment: Washington Post editor Marty Baron has replied to an attack by Trump on reporters who wrote a story about the attorney general refusing a Trump request to go before cameras and say Trump\u2019s Zelenskiy phone call was totally copacetic, law-wise: Did you catch Donald Trump Jr shilling for his new book this morning on The View? A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa has privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations, the Associated Press reports: The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer\u2019s Iowa campaign, aren\u2019t illegal \u2014 though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There\u2019s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer\u2019s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer\u2019s campaign would think he could buy their support. Tom Courtney, a former Democratic state senator from southeastern Iowa who\u2019s running for reelection to his old seat, told The Associated Press the financial offer \u201cleft a bad taste in my mouth\u201d: Murphy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Alberto Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign press secretary, said Murphy was not authorized to make the offers and that the campaign leadership outside of Iowa was unaware that he was doing so until the issue was raised by The Associated Press. Courtney declined to name Murphy as the Steyer aide who made the offer, but several other local politicians said they received similar propositions, and all confirmed the proposal came from Murphy himself. Most requested anonymity to speak freely about the issue. Another, Iowa state Rep. Karin Derry, said Murphy didn\u2019t explicitly offer a specific dollar amount, but made it clear Derry would receive financial support if she backed Steyer. \u201cIt was presented more as, he has provided financial support to other downballot candidates who\u2019ve endorsed him, and could do the same for you,\u201d she said. Courtney described a similar interaction with Steyer\u2019s campaign. \u201cTom, I know you\u2019re running for Senate. I\u2019m working for Tom Steyer,\u201d Courtney recalled hearing from the aide. \u201cNow you know how this works. ...He said, \u2018you help them, and they\u2019ll help you.\u2019\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018it wouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re talking monetary, there\u2019s no amount,\u2019\u201d Courtney continued. \u201cI don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d Lammers, Steyer\u2019s campaign press secretary, said the candidate hasn\u2019t made any individual contributions to local officials in Iowa and won\u2019t be making any this year. In an email, Lammers said Steyer\u2019s endorsements \u201care earned because of Tom\u2019s campaign message,\u201d and distanced the candidate from Murphy. \u201cOur campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, and anyone who does is not speaking for the campaign or does not know our policy,\u201d Lammers said. The overtures do not appear to have made much of a difference for Steyer. Aside from Murphy\u2019s support, Steyer has received the endorsement of just one Iowan since entering the race in July \u2014 former state Rep. Roger Thomas. In compliance with rules passed last week by the House, Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff has notified Republicans of a Saturday deadline \u2013 11:20am Saturday, to be exact \u2013 to suggest witnesses to participate in public impeachment hearings starting next week. There is plenty of reason to expect that Republicans will seek to call witnesses designed not to illuminate the inquiry but to create a public circus. Trump champion Jim Jordan, who does not sit on the relevant committee (yet), told reporters he wanted to hear from the whistleblower, who was not a direct witness to the alleged misconduct, but who is the target of an attempt by Trump to cast the inquiry as partisan. But in compliance with the rules, Schiff has now informed Republicans that each witness request \u201cmust be accompanied by a detailed written justification of the relevance to the inquiry of the testimony of each requested witness.\u201d Here are the inquiry\u2019s parameters as laid out by Schiff: Did the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President\u2019s personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President\u2019s political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 U.S. presidential election? Did the President \u2013 directly or through agents \u2013 seek to use the power of the Office of the President and other instruments of the federal government in other ways to apply pressure on the head of state and government of Ukraine to advance the President\u2019s personal political interests, including by leveraging an Oval Office meeting desired by the President of Ukraine or by withholding U.S. military assistance to Ukraine? Did the President and his Administration seek to obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people evidence about the President\u2019s actions and conduct? The House intelligence committee has released a statement saying that former national security adviser John Bolton, a no-show for testimony today, informed the committee that he \u201cwould take us to court if we subpoenaed him.\u201d \u201cThe White House instruction that [Bolton] not appear will add to the evidence of the President\u2019s obstruction of Congress\u201d, the intelligence committee said in a statement obtained by BuzzFeed. But the overarching question of whether the impeachment inquiry will feature a Bolton cameo does not appear to be resolved yet. Bolton informed the committee he would be willing to testify if a court clears the way, the Washington Post reports, citing \u201cpeople familiar with his views\u201d: It remains unclear how quickly that could happen \u2014 and whether it would be in time for Bolton to be called as a witness in the public House impeachment hearings, which are scheduled to begin next week. Previous witnesses have testified that Bolton strongly objected to the mixing of US national security objectives in Ukraine with Donald Trump\u2019s domestic political objectives in 2020. Here is a juicy line from the Post report: if he testified, Bolton \u201cis expected to confirm their statements and describe his conversations with Trump.\u201d This public airing of his willingness-in-principle to confirm the most damning testimony against Trump, juxtaposed with his not actually appearing before congress today, scans like a not-so-subtle demonstration by Bolton to Trump of the power Bolton holds here. But what does Bolton want... Facing a crisis of faith in his leadership in the state department after his perceived failure to protect career diplomats from attacks by the president, Rudy Giuliani and others, secretary of state Mike Pompeo has denied a claim by his former aide that he ignored a request for a statement of support for ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Former Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley testified on 16 October that he had approached Pompeo three times about a statement of support for Yovanovitch, who was the target of a smear campaign in Ukraine led by Giuliani, and who was also singled out by Trump in his 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president. Here\u2019s a snippet of McKinley\u2019s testimony including a brief Q&amp;A: In presenting my resignation, I made clear that I was looking to leave the Department, I wasn\u2019t looking to create any news story out of it, but that he should be aware that, of course, part of the reason, people were very aware that I was concerned about what I saw as the lack of public support for Department employees. ... Q: And what was the Secretary\u2019s response when you said that? A: On that subject, he did not respond at all, again. Pompeo, who is in Germany, has just flatly denied McKinley\u2019s sworn testimony, the Washington Post reports: Pompeo has a history of misleading statements in the impeachment inquiry so far. When first asked about the Trump-Zelenskiy call, which he had listened to, Pompeo feigned ignorance. Trump is still rage-tweeting about the Washington Post scoop that attorney general William Barr refused a Trump request to go on TV and say a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president definitely, positively did not rise to the level of criminal conduct. \u201cWe both deny this story, which they knew before they wrote it,\u201d Trump tweeted. Barr appears not to have denied the story, except in the dreamscape of Trump\u2019s Twitter, where anything truly is possible. Here\u2019s more than six minutes of footage of vice president Mike Pence officially throwing Donald Trump\u2019s name in the hat for reelection in New Hampshire. \u201cFour more years,\u201d chant the crowd: A no-show on Capitol Hill this morning: John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Bolton\u2019s testimony was requested though not subpoenaed by congressional committees leading the impeachment inquiry. Other witnesses have told the impeachment committees that Bolton vocally objected to the mixing of US national security priorities in Ukraine with Donald Trump\u2019s political priorities in 2020. Bolton ended one meeting with Ukrainians and ambassador Gordon Sondland abruptly, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t do politics here,\u201d according to testimony. He has been quoted as calling Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s emissary, a \u201chand grenade\u201d, and the plot Giuliani advanced a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d In which Hillary Clinton twice in a row does not say she\u2019s not running for president (and then tweets the footage): She does not even say the line about \u201cwe\u2019ve got a really deep and talented field\u201d. Senator Sherrod Brown, seemingly one of the few Democrats who chose not to run for US president, insists he has no regrets but offers a pointed critique of the candidates. Brown told the Guardian on Wednesday: \u201cI think every one of the Democrats running falls short in talking about the dignity of work and honouring and respecting work and looking at the campaign through the eyes of workers and planning to govern through the eyes of workers, and contrasting that with a president who betrays workers every single day, fighting the minimum wage, fighting the overtime rule, appointing judges putting their thumbs on the scale in support of corporations over workers, and that the White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives.\u201d Brown was speaking at a Capitol Hill screening of American Factory, the first Obama production to premiere on Netflix, which is set in Ohio, a state that has voted for the eventual presidential winner in every election since 1944 except one (1960). Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by eight percentage points but Brown, who represents Ohio, argues that it remains within Democrats\u2019 reach. \u201cI think Ohio is absolutely in play, in part because the president\u2019s made all kinds of commitments to Ohio and he\u2019s betrayed workers day after day after day,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump voters see that, young voters that may not have voted or are just becoming 18 see that in increasing numbers. So it\u2019s a real race in Ohio.\u201d It\u2019s here! It\u2019s here! Emmanuel Macron has said Nato is in the throes of \u201cbrain death\u201d and European countries can no longer rely on the US to defend its allies. \u201cWhat we are currently experiencing is the brain death of Nato,\u201d the French president told the Economist in an interview. \u201cYou have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its Nato allies. None. You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another Nato ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake.\u201d Asked whether he still believed in the \u201ccollective defence\u201d stipulations of article five of Nato\u2019s founding treaty, under which an attack against one member is considered an attack against all members, Macron answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Nato \u201conly works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I\u2019d argue that we should reassess the reality of what Nato is in the light of the commitment of the United States,\u201d he said. Macron\u2019s questioning of Nato\u2019s effectiveness and suggestion European countries in the 29-member alliance should reassess their situation comes ahead of a key summit with leaders including Donald Trump in the UK early next month. Read the full piece here: Will Gordon Sondland \u2013 the former hotelier who donated $1m to Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, and subsequently was made ambassador to the European Union \u2013 fit under a bus? Defenders of Trump have been testing for the better part of a week now whether they can make Sondland the fall guy in the impeachment probe. A National Security Council official, Tim Morrison, proposed in testimony last week that Sondland\u2019s efforts to extort Ukraine for bad news about Joe Biden were all Sondland\u2019s idea. \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,\u201d Morrison said. But can Sondland be successfully painted as the nefarious mastermind who was behind the \u201cirregular channel\u201d guiding US policy in Ukraine? The notion has been credulously reported in the media. And Senator Lindsey Graham gave it a crack on TV last night: Political strategist Liz Mair notes that Graham is running for reelection in 2020 in a staunchly pro-Trump state. Pence aide Jennifer Williams arrived on schedule this morning for her deposition before the impeachment committees. What did Pence know and when did he know it? He attended a 1 September meeting in Warsaw with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Zelenskiy immediately brought up suspended military aid, according to testimony, and after which EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, by his own description, pounced on a Zelenskiy aide to say the military aid was not likely to come without an announcement by Zelenskiy of investigations into Biden. Pence, who of course would prefer not to be linked to what John Bolton called a \u201cdrug deal,\u201d has dodged questions about the quid pro quo. What will Williams, a career foreign service officer who also listened to the 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, have to say? Before Jeff Sessions jumped into the Alabama senate race this week, Trump sent word to him \u201cthrough allies that he would publicly attack him if he ran,\u201d the New York Times reports. Trump blames Sessions, his first attorney general, for the two-year Russia investigation concluding with the Mueller report, from which Sessions recused himself, properly most analysts believe since Sessions was a top adviser on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign which was under investigation. But Sessions has jumped into the senate race anyway. He happily held an Alabama senate seat for 20 years before his ill-fated turn in the Trump administration. And the race to unseat incumbent Democratic senator Doug Jones in 2020 is wide open on the Republican side. Will Trump make good on his threat to attack Sessions? What will Mitch McConnell advise? Republicans would very much like to regain the Alabama senate seat, which could end Democratic dreams of retaking the senate next year. Donald Trump has been talking with his TV producer pals about life after the presidency and what it could hold, the Daily Beast reports. With Trump\u2019s regular attacks on free and fair elections, the rule of law, executive branch norms, the separation of powers and the free press, not to mention his megalomania, it can seem at times as if he has no intention of ever leaving office \u2013 or at least not on account of paltry details such as an election loss or term limits. But the Beast cites \u201cthree people with knowledge of the situation and another source close to Trump\u201d to report: One of the ideas kicked around by Burnett and the president was shooting a new version of the Trump-branded Apprentice, tentatively titled The Apprentice: White House, and to produce it shortly after the president leaves office. This time, however, the TV program would be explicitly politics-themed and take full advantage of Trump\u2019s status as a former president of the United States and a newfound Republican kingmaker. Read further: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a plan to create \u201ca welcoming and safe America for all\u201d on Thursday morning, promising that on his first day as president he would \u201coverturn all of President Trump\u2019s actions to demonize and harm immigrants on the first day of his presidency.\u201d The plan calls for the breaking up of customs and border protection (CBP) and customs enforcement (ICE). Sanders is the first 2020 candidate to take that stand as part of his official campaign platform. The Sanders plan also calls for a moratorium on deportations, stopping \u201call construction of the racist and ineffective wall on the U.S.-Mexico Border,\u201d overturning \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s racist and disgusting Muslim ban,\u201d and ensuring \u201call children who were separated from their families by the United States government are reunited swiftly.\u201d Sanders would also focus on improving labor conditions in agriculture, food service and other industries that depend on an immigrant workforce. Read all about it. A public defender in the Bronx gives it two thumbs up: The president is laying down fire on Twitter in response to reports that he wanted attorney general William Barr to hold a news conference to say Trump\u2019s 25 July call with the Ukrainian president was not criminal by any stretch. Trump has sent out a pair of tweets claiming that \u201cthe degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story.\u201d He does not mention the Times\u2019 corroborating report. Now Trump is going on about the whistleblower whose complaint the White House fought for six weeks to prevent Congress from obtaining \u2013 because Trump had done nothing wrong? \u201cRead the transcript,\u201d Trump concludes, referring to a partial transcript of his call with Zelenskiy in which Trump said \u201cthe United States has been very very good to Ukraine\u201d then asked for the \u201cfavor\u201d of investigations into Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering. Evidence that Trump used the power of his office to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 election goes well beyond the record of the call. That evidence includes the testimony of more than a dozen witnesses before Congress and public statements by Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. But also: Read the transcript! Hello and welcome to our politics live blog coverage. Attorney general William Barr has done a lot for Donald Trump. He pre-baked the Mueller report. He is hard at work on a report that is expected to attack the work of US intelligence agencies on which that report was built. He did not recuse himself from a justice department review of a phone call Trump had with the Ukrainian president, despite being mentioned himself on the call. The review, perhaps not surprisingly, found that the call was, legally speaking, peachy. But there are lines, apparently, that even Barr will not cross. The attorney general refused a request by Trump to hold a news conference and declare that no laws were broken in the call, the Washington Post reported late Wednesday in an account backed up by the New York Times. (Correction: we originally had those news organizations reversed; it was a Post scoop.) Trump is a big believer in the power of press conferences. In 2017 he pressured then FBI director James Comey to go on TV and declare he was not a target in the nascent investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey likewise refused. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is a demand by Trump that the Ukrainian president \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of [Joe] Biden and 2016 election interference.\u201d Elsewhere, it looks like the congressional committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump will wangle their second witness of the week today \u2013 out of about a dozen subpoenas and requests on the week. Scheduled to testify is Jennifer Williams, a national security aid to vice president Mike Pence who listened to the 25 July call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Also invited to testify today, but apparently not planning to appear, is John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Thanks for joining us!",

      "bodyText": "Forensic scientists have given evidence at the murder trial of Grace Millane in Auckland\u2019s high court, and said the blood found in the accused\u2019s hotel room most likely came from the British backpacker. Millane, 22, was on a round-the-world trip when she disappeared on 2 December in New Zealand\u2019s largest city during a date. Her body was found buried inside a suitcase in dense bushland west of the city a week later. A 27-year-old New Zealand man, whose name has been suppressed by the court, is accused of her murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Dianne Crenfeldt, a forensic scientist for ESR New Zealand, on Friday told the court that chemical testing had been used on the accused\u2019s hotel room and evidence of blood was found on the foot of the bed, in footprints walking towards the bathroom and in small splatters on the fridge. She added: \u201cThe shape of the probable blood staining and the presence of blood on the floor provided strong support that clean up of blood had occurred in this area.\u201d The footprints clearly showed someone had walked in blood with their left foot, the scientist said, and \u201ctransferred \u2026 blood around the room\u201d. Turlough Thomas-Stone, a DNA specialist, gave evidence that a statistical analysis of the blood samples showed they were produced by female DNA, and there was \u201cextremely strong scientific support\u201d that the blood was Millane\u2019s because the major profile component of the DNA matched hers. There is no argument from either the prosecution or defence that Millane died in the hotel room on 1 or 2 December 2018. However, the crown alleges the accused murdered Millane and then attempted to conceal his crime by burying her body, while the defence says she died while engaged in a consensual sex act, and that the accused then made a number of poor decisions following her death, due to the stress of the event. Millane died from pressure to her throat and was transported in a suitcase in a hired car to a shallow grave in the Waitakere ranges. ESR forensic toxicologist Diana Kappatos said she was unable to give an accurate finding for Millane\u2019s blood-alcohol level at the time of the death. Millane had been dead for over a week before an autopsy was performed. No drugs were found in Millane\u2019s system, Kappatos said conclusively. The trial continues and will run until early December.",

      "body": "<p>Before Peter Dinklage spent eight years in a leather doublet on Game of Thrones, he was a New York theater actor with an aggressive, maximalist, almost clownish style that still allowed for pathos. Which is to say he is perfectly cast in an imperfect Cyrano at the New Group, adapted by his wife, the director Erica Schmidt, with lyrics by Carin Besser and Matt Berninger and music by Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner of the National.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/17/little-shop-of-horrors-review-musical-off-broadway\">Little Shop of Horrors review \u2013 gory musical blooms again off-Broadway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show follows, in more or less contemporary prose, the plot of Edmund de Rostand\u2019s 1897 verse drama about a cadet with an ungainly nose and an elegant epistolary style (Dinklage\u2019s own nose is unremarkable, but he was born with a form of dwarfism, so the jokes about his nose are a kind of displacement). He loves Roxanne (Jasmine Cephas Jones), a childhood friend, but she loves Christian (Blake Jenner), a hunky recruit who can barely master subject-verb agreement. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid it\u2019s shameful,\u201d Christian says. So Cyrano offers to write Roxanne\u2019s love letters for him. With his brains and Christian\u2019s bod, what could go wrong? Everything. At least this version admits that deceiving a woman \u2013 into love, bed, marriage \u2013 isn\u2019t noble or romantic. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s sleazy.</p> <p>Yet the adaptation often stumbles. It\u2019s never clear where or when we are. (The costumes by Tom Broecker borrow about 300 years of fashion.) Schmidt hasn\u2019t settled on a comfortable vernacular and doesn\u2019t try to replicate De Rostand\u2019s wit, so we hear about how brilliant characters are rather than experiencing it. The pacing sprints, then dawdles so that the cast, choreographed by Jeff and Rick Kuperman, can twirl or fling flour into the air.

      "bodyText": "Before Peter Dinklage spent eight years in a leather doublet on Game of Thrones, he was a New York theater actor with an aggressive, maximalist, almost clownish style that still allowed for pathos. Which is to say he is perfectly cast in an imperfect Cyrano at the New Group, adapted by his wife, the director Erica Schmidt, with lyrics by Carin Besser and Matt Berninger and music by Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner of the National. The show follows, in more or less contemporary prose, the plot of Edmund de Rostand\u2019s 1897 verse drama about a cadet with an ungainly nose and an elegant epistolary style (Dinklage\u2019s own nose is unremarkable, but he was born with a form of dwarfism, so the jokes about his nose are a kind of displacement). He loves Roxanne (Jasmine Cephas Jones), a childhood friend, but she loves Christian (Blake Jenner), a hunky recruit who can barely master subject-verb agreement. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid it\u2019s shameful,\u201d Christian says. So Cyrano offers to write Roxanne\u2019s love letters for him. With his brains and Christian\u2019s bod, what could go wrong? Everything. At least this version admits that deceiving a woman \u2013 into love, bed, marriage \u2013 isn\u2019t noble or romantic. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s sleazy. Yet the adaptation often stumbles. It\u2019s never clear where or when we are. (The costumes by Tom Broecker borrow about 300 years of fashion.) Schmidt hasn\u2019t settled on a comfortable vernacular and doesn\u2019t try to replicate De Rostand\u2019s wit, so we hear about how brilliant characters are rather than experiencing it. The pacing sprints, then dawdles so that the cast, choreographed by Jeff and Rick Kuperman, can twirl or fling flour into the air. The show doesn\u2019t so much end as screech to a stop. The songs, gorgeously played, have a melancholy prettiness, but they typically do the same work, excavating an emotional moment for a character. These moments too often sound the same. Roxanne\u2019s I Want song says, \u201cI\u2019d give anything for someone to say / that they can\u2019t live without me and they\u2019ll be there forever.\u201d A few scenes later, Christian sings, \u201cI\u2019d give anything for someone to say to her / that she\u2019s all I can think about and I can\u2019t live without her.\u201d Maybe this is a way of suggesting that Roxanne and Christian are destined for each other, but that\u2019s not what the play argues, so it reads as a failure to write \u2013 musically and lyrically \u2013 to character.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who saw Monday night\u2019s episode of Q&amp;A would agree it was a wild ride. And we\u2019re not just talking about the swearing, as prolific as it was. To coincide with the feminist ideas festival Broadside, the all-female panel was dominated by Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy, whose comments were liberally sprinkled with \u201cfuck the patriarchy\u201d and who asked at one stage, \u201cHow many rapists must we kill until men stop raping us?\u201d. Senior management at the ABC are concerned the panellists got a little over-excited and weren\u2019t suitably wrangled on the program, which was hosted by Fran Kelly and executive-produced by outgoing veteran journalist Peter McEvoy. Weekly Beast understands the ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, was approached this week to appear on Q&amp;A in Perth later in the month but politely declined. She was unimpressed by Monday night\u2019s antics. One of the panellists, the Muslim feminist Hana Assafiri, felt so strongly that she hadn\u2019t been able to get her views across that she asked producers later in the week to post a video of her explaining her attitudes towards violence, and towards men. It\u2019s no wonder then that the ABC received more than 200 complaints and the independent audience affairs department is investigating whether it breached editorial policies. The provocative episode will not be repeated and has been pulled from iView. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the episode \u201cgenerated significant community concern\u201d, and he welcomed the investigation. The ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, announced the investigation minutes before the Celebrate ABC 2020 launch, held in Studio 22 at Sydney\u2019s Ultimo studios on Thursday. Anderson told Weekly Beast he knew the program was problematic when he watched it go live on Monday. He said he was not worried about what the ABC\u2019s usual critics said about it, but what viewers thought. While swearing is allowed after 9pm, Anderson felt the audience was not sufficiently warned about the content and he was concerned they weren\u2019t given enough context about the challenging nature of the ideas at the Broadside festival at the top of the show. \u201cQ&amp;A has always sought to tackle difficult issues and present challenging and thought-provoking content,\u201d Anderson said in a statement. \u201cHowever, I can understand why some viewers found elements of this episode confronting or offensive.\u201d ABC bangs its own drum But the Q&amp;A probe didn\u2019t dampen Anderson\u2019s excitement about the program launch, which was his first as managing director. He said his predecessor, Michelle Guthrie, wasn\u2019t keen on holding a showbiz-style event in a TV studio, but he was keen to bring it back. \u201cWe are in television after all,\u201d he said as he excitedly explained that he had ordered the suit of the Bluey character, who was strolling around the studio, and how he got the ball rolling for several of the new shows when he was head of television. The event took place on several sets around the giant studio, with ABC personalities Michael Rowland and Lisa Millar, Sarah Ferguson, Annabel Crabb, Shaun Micallef, actor Asher Keddie and author Bruce Pascoe among the celebrities. Missing from proceedings were the new Insiders host, David Speers, and new Q&amp;A host, Hamish Macdonald, two ABC hires who are still contracted to commercial networks Sky and Ten and couldn\u2019t get a day pass to attend. Australia drags News Corp results down under Bad news for Rupert Murdoch, whose global media empire has reported a loss of $US211m in the first quarter of the 2020 financial year, up from US$128m at the same time last year. Total revenues for the first quarter were US$2.34b, 7% down from US$2.52bn in 2018, the company reported. Its chief executive, Robert Thomson, blamed a \u201csluggish\u201d Australian economy and property slump which dragged the US business down. The losses were a result of falling print advertising revenues at News Corp newspapers, which include the Daily Telegraph and the Australian, as well as international mastheads the Times and the Wall Street Journal. Also to blame was the exodus of Foxtel subscribers, although the flow has been partially offset by new subscriptions for News Corp\u2019s streaming offerings Kayo and Foxtel Now. But it\u2019s not all bad news for News Corp, which has struck deals with Apple \u2013 for Apple News Plus in Australia \u2013 and Facebook to pay for its premium content. \u201cWe are pleased to note tangible progress in our efforts to secure payment for our high-quality content from digital platforms, a global cause which News Corp has led for more than a decade,\u201d Thomson said. Why the long face? The anti-Melbourne Cup sentiment seems to be spreading slowly through the media despite the devotion of News Corp Australia to all things racing. Race enthusiast Alan Jones has kept his spirits up, labelling the 7.30 expose of racehorse slaughter a sensationalist result of the \u201coften twisted agendas of a leftwing ABC\u201d. Attendance at the Melbourne Cup was 81,400, the lowest since 1993, and television audiences followed suit. The number of people who watched the race, broadcast on Ten this year, was down significantly. The average figure for Ten\u2019s coverage was 1.3m, down almost a million from 2013, when it was 2.2m. There was a drop of 500,000 from last year alone. As Peter FitzSimons wrote in the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, \u201cattending the Cup is suddenly a bad look\u201d. But the best coverage of the race has to go to news.com.au, which had a stunning scoop shortly after the finish on Tuesday: \u201cHorse storms to victory to claim Melbourne Cup.\u201d Back to Stef? When Nine\u2019s Today show had a problem with its ratings and bad publicity this time last year, management found a solution: get rid of Karl Stefanovic! Stefanovic kept his $2m salary but was pulled off the breakfast program in an attempt to stop the bad publicity he was attracting after splitting from his first wife. Fast-forward 12 months and if reports are to be believed the solution to Today\u2019s current woes is to bring back the highly paid presenter. The rumours about the pairing of Stefanovic and 60 Minutes reporter Alison Langdon have been swirling for months, and were given credence when Langdon was given a key role at the Nine upfronts last month. After Nine dumped Stefanovic last year his co-presenter Georgie Gardner was joined by Deb Knight. The chemistry never worked and the ratings continued to drop. On Friday they hit a low of just 155,000 viewers, beaten by ABC\u2019s News Breakfast with Lisa Millar and Michael Rowland on 159,000. Arch-rival Sunrise, with David Koch and Samantha Armytage, had almost double the numbers on 298,000. Another name that has been thrown around for the role is Nine\u2019s Today Extra host and singer, David Campbell. Nine says no decision has been made on the line-up for next year. Whatever Stefanovic\u2019s apparent sins, he is a very good broadcaster. As Brigid Delaney wrote earlier this year: \u201cHow many people could do three hours a day of live breakfast television, where you are required to segue from the federal budget to weather banter to pet of the day, without breaking a sweat?\u201d Fitz fizzer One journalist whose name has not been suggested as a host for Today is the Sydney Morning Herald columnist and former Today show reporter Peter FitzSimons, who told a funny story against himself in his Andrew Olle address on Friday. In 1992 he was given a chance to co-host Today with Liz Hayes and he thought it went really well. \u201cSadly, the people who agreed with me could be counted on the fingers of one finger: Liz Hayes! \u201cBut the critics were everywhere. When I came off-air after completing my stint, the head of news and current affairs at the time, my friend Ian Frykberg, pulled me aside and said \u2018FitzSimons, that show just put your television career back by five years.\u2019 \u201d Dog fight at Sky Sky News viewers got a live demonstration of what happens if you stray from the party line this week when a former editor of Queensland\u2019s Sunday Mail, Peter Gleeson, slapped down Sky veteran Janine Perrett for disagreeing with him on greyhound racing. Gleeson, who took over from Perrett as the host of Heads Up on Sky News this year, suggested her views were not welcome at the station. \u201cYou know what?\u201d Gleeson asked aggressively when Perrett said she didn\u2019t like the sport. \u201cMaybe you should work at the ABC.\u201d Perrett, who has been with Sky for 10 years, shot back: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re allowed to have a different opinion here, but if you think they should all be on the ABC, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Gleeson showed his trademark lack of subtlety this week in his regular newspaper column, when he compared the Greens to Australia\u2019s worst serial killer, Ivan Milat. \u201cThe problem with the Greens party in this country is that they actually believe they are on the side of the angels,\u201d Gleeson wrote. \u201cLike serial killer Ivan Milat, who went to his grave saying he was innocent, they have convinced themselves they are the font of all knowledge and wisdom. \u201cIt\u2019s selfish, narcissistic and dangerous. According to the Greens, we \u2013 normal people \u2013 are heathens, marching like lemmings to extinction, fuelled by our climate change ignorance. To the Greens, farmers are the anti-Christ, Melbourne Cup day is for animal abusers, and music festivals should just be renamed drug festivals, with pill-testing brought in immediately.\u201d",

Thirty hours later, the nation\u2019s attention was diverted by the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, in which 51 people were killed.</p> <p>Shaw, sporting a black eye, arrived in the city the day after the shootings.</p> <p>He was \u201cemotionally pretty thrown\u201d by the attacks, he said, but New Zealand\u2019s response had been \u201cbrilliant, not perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose kinds of things can tip you into a very dark place, and we didn\u2019t go there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The political, for now, leaves no time for much else.

Analysts speculated on whether Shaw had gambled with his party\u2019s fate at next year\u2019s election. \u2018A Punch and Judy show\u2019 Does the climate change portfolio feel like everyone is perpetually slightly unhappy with him? \u201cIt feels like that every day. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d he says. But with all eyes on New Zealand \u2013 particularly those of other agricultural countries \u2013 the government had to do something. \u201cFor 30 years, we\u2019ve been involved in this Punch and Judy show, and it\u2019s resulted in nothing,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cAnd so one side simply winning over the other, which has been the record of the last three decades, just isn\u2019t going to cut it. We\u2019ve got to get started.\u201d Shaw walks to work when he can; he passed his full driver\u2019s license test this year and still does not like to drive. A violent episode in March, when he was punched in the face on his way to work by a man who had targeted him for his political views, did not deter him from going out alone, a luxury New Zealand\u2019s politicians are rare in being permitted. The assault generated a day of frenzied debate in New Zealand about the safety of its lawmakers. Thirty hours later, the nation\u2019s attention was diverted by the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, in which 51 people were killed. Shaw, sporting a black eye, arrived in the city the day after the shootings. He was \u201cemotionally pretty thrown\u201d by the attacks, he said, but New Zealand\u2019s response had been \u201cbrilliant, not perfect.\u201d \u201cThose kinds of things can tip you into a very dark place, and we didn\u2019t go there,\u201d he says. The political, for now, leaves no time for much else. He draws a blank when asked to name books or music he enjoys; weekends will, if he\u2019s lucky, involve a walk with his wife, Annabel and a craft beer \u2013 \u201cone of my greatest pleasures of modern Wellington\u201d \u2013 when the work he brings home allows it. The table-top role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, always a big part of his life, is on the back-burner. He only keeps up with new episodes of Star Trek: Discovery because he is not allowed to read ministerial papers on aeroplanes. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing particularly about sci fi where you\u2019re imagining possible futures,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so interestingly, there\u2019s a coherence there between what we do here and that.\u201d But he says his move to politics and all has come with it will be worthwhile if \u201cthat was the moment when we got on top of our emissions and started to bring them down.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>1) Liverpool\u2019s inability to lose could be decisive</h2> <p>Apparently there is a game going on in Liverpool on Sunday. Liverpool\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/05/liverpool-genk-champions-league-match-report\">2-1 win over Genk</a> in midweek was very much a continuation of a theme \u2013 since mid-September they have also beaten Chelsea, Leicester, Tottenham and Aston Villa by the same scoreline, and they last won a league game by more than one goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/14/liverpool-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">at home to Newcastle</a> on 14 September. In their last six league games they have a goal difference of only five, yet they have somehow converted that into a mathematically maximal 16 points. The day Liverpool beat Newcastle was also when Manchester City lost at Norwich, but since then the champions have thumped Watford 8-0, put three past Everton and Aston Villa and with the damaging exception of last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/06/manchester-city-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">home defeat to Wolves</a> looked gloriously untroubled. In their own past six games City have accumulated a goal difference of 14, but won only 15 points. Liverpool have often looked of late like a side desperate to lose but somehow unable to, and another demonstration of that kind of resilience on Sunday would give them a very significant advantage in the title chase.<strong> SB</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Liverpool v Manchester City (4.30pm, all times GMT, Sunday)</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/manchester-city-repeat-bus-attack-message-liverpool-fans-social-media\">Manchester City fear repeat of bus attack after message to Liverpool fans</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2) Norwich and Watford to find finishing touches at last?</strong></h2> <p>So far this season Watford have been winless and fairly hopeless, with Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s arrival making them much harder to score against, but also much less likely to score. But it\u2019s not just their players\u2019 form that has fallen apart, it is their actual physical bodies: their best striker, Troy Deeney, has not played since August; their record signing, Isma\u00efla Sarr, has started one league game; Danny Welbeck has a serious hamstring injury and they have been forced into a first-half substitution in each of their past four games. Perhaps this is one slump from which they can now start to emerge, with Deeney \u2013 who made his Watford debut in a televised Friday evening league game against Norwich \u2013 aiming to return to their squad for this game. Though both teams are in dismal goalscoring form, there has been only one goalless draw between them in 35 games at Carrow Road, with the last 10 encounters featuring a bumper 39 goals and six Norwich wins to Watford\u2019s four. <strong>SB</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Norwich City v Watford (8pm, Friday)</em></p> <h2>3) Djenepo magic can aid Saints\u2019 recovery process</h2> <p>It will be an experience that some never forget. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Losing 9-0 at home</a> will do that to you. Craig Forrest, the Ipswich goalkeeper who conceded nine to Manchester United in 1995, said only last week his own experience was still \u201ccrushing\u201d. For the Southampton players that featured two weeks ago against Leicester, returning to that dressing room \u2013 the scene of the autopsy where they most likely contemplated their careers as well as defeat \u2013 will in itself be a mental hurdle to overcome. There will be similar emotions in the stands, as Southampton fans tentatively feel their way back to their seat. The truth is that in the two games since the Leicester drubbing \u2013 two unfortunately-timed league and cup visits to the Etihad \u2013 Saints have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">done themselves relatively proud</a>, showing at least a bit of heart. That alone will not save them from relegation, but Moussa Djenepo might.

What followed was a remorseless skewering: Guernsey-born Len Duquemin, the Channel Islands\u2019 first great footballer, scored in the fifth minute and the 29th, Les Medley in the 24th and 34th, and Sonny Walters got a second-half hat-trick as Spurs won 7-0. Tottenham, in their first season under Arthur Rowe, were developing the \u201cpush and run\u201d style that would bring them the Second Division title that season and win them the First Division a year later, but the defeat was to have a telling effect on the Blades: though they ended that day in 12th their form improved as the season progressed, to such an extent that when they completed their campaign they were in second place and all set for promotion. Unfortunately their city rivals Sheffield Wednesday, one point behind them, had a game still to play: they drew 0-0 and went up because their goal average was superior by a meagre 0.008. So had the Blades conceded only one fewer goal on that day in November they would have gone up instead \u2013 and to make matters worse, Wednesday\u2019s opponents in that final game?

Newcastle\u2019s defensive home form has been excellent with four goals conceded in six league games at St James\u2019 Park this season, and hopes are high for the visit of Bournemouth after last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/west-ham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">3-2 away win at West Ham</a>, where both Ciaran Clark and Federico Fern\u00e1ndez chipped in with goals. With Fabian Sch\u00e4r in line to return alongside Jamaal Lascelles, suddenly Bruce has options for his three-man defence.

Should he take the more attacking option, it would be a demonstration not only of Brighton\u2019s increased confidence but also of Manchester United\u2019s diminished standing.

      "bodyText": "1) Liverpool\u2019s inability to lose could be decisive Apparently there is a game going on in Liverpool on Sunday. Liverpool\u2019s 2-1 win over Genk in midweek was very much a continuation of a theme \u2013 since mid-September they have also beaten Chelsea, Leicester, Tottenham and Aston Villa by the same scoreline, and they last won a league game by more than one goal at home to Newcastle on 14 September. In their last six league games they have a goal difference of only five, yet they have somehow converted that into a mathematically maximal 16 points. The day Liverpool beat Newcastle was also when Manchester City lost at Norwich, but since then the champions have thumped Watford 8-0, put three past Everton and Aston Villa and with the damaging exception of last month\u2019s home defeat to Wolves looked gloriously untroubled. In their own past six games City have accumulated a goal difference of 14, but won only 15 points. Liverpool have often looked of late like a side desperate to lose but somehow unable to, and another demonstration of that kind of resilience on Sunday would give them a very significant advantage in the title chase. SB \u2022 Liverpool v Manchester City (4.30pm, all times GMT, Sunday) 2) Norwich and Watford to find finishing touches at last? So far this season Watford have been winless and fairly hopeless, with Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s arrival making them much harder to score against, but also much less likely to score. But it\u2019s not just their players\u2019 form that has fallen apart, it is their actual physical bodies: their best striker, Troy Deeney, has not played since August; their record signing, Isma\u00efla Sarr, has started one league game; Danny Welbeck has a serious hamstring injury and they have been forced into a first-half substitution in each of their past four games. Perhaps this is one slump from which they can now start to emerge, with Deeney \u2013 who made his Watford debut in a televised Friday evening league game against Norwich \u2013 aiming to return to their squad for this game. Though both teams are in dismal goalscoring form, there has been only one goalless draw between them in 35 games at Carrow Road, with the last 10 encounters featuring a bumper 39 goals and six Norwich wins to Watford\u2019s four. SB \u2022 Norwich City v Watford (8pm, Friday) 3) Djenepo magic can aid Saints\u2019 recovery process It will be an experience that some never forget. Losing 9-0 at home will do that to you. Craig Forrest, the Ipswich goalkeeper who conceded nine to Manchester United in 1995, said only last week his own experience was still \u201ccrushing\u201d. For the Southampton players that featured two weeks ago against Leicester, returning to that dressing room \u2013 the scene of the autopsy where they most likely contemplated their careers as well as defeat \u2013 will in itself be a mental hurdle to overcome. There will be similar emotions in the stands, as Southampton fans tentatively feel their way back to their seat. The truth is that in the two games since the Leicester drubbing \u2013 two unfortunately-timed league and cup visits to the Etihad \u2013 Saints have done themselves relatively proud, showing at least a bit of heart. That alone will not save them from relegation, but Moussa Djenepo might. The striker\u2019s injury has meant he missed nearly two months of football (including Leicester) but the \u00a314m summer signing looks a real handful if his wonderstrike against Sheffield United is anything to go by. How Southampton could do with some of that magic against Everton on their return home.

The Spaniard, who was brought to the club in the summer by Mario Husillos, the under-fire director of football, was at fault for two of Newcastle\u2019s goals last week, with his positioning for Federico Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s looping header laughable, while he has also looked below par against Everton, Sheffield United and in a 4-0 defeat at Oxford United.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has thrown down the gauntlet to John Lewis this year with an all-dancing Christmas advert featuring a signature \u201cshoulder roll\u201d move that it hopes could set dancefloors and social media alight over the festive season. Set to House of Pain\u2019s 1992 hit Jump Around, the ad was made by the British director Jake Nava, best known for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Single Ladies music video. The M&amp;S ad, which launched on Friday, features a cast of dancers \u201cjumping around\u201d in M&amp;S jumpers. The choreography in the M&amp;S\u2019s \u201cGo Jumpers\u201d commercial is less complex than the routine tackled by Beyonc\u00e9 and her backing troupe in Nava\u2019s video, with the retailer offering advice on how to master the simple move (instructions: \u201cadopt a power stance\u201d and then roll your shoulder forward and back \u2013 and repeat). The store chain is hoping shoulder-rollers will then film their efforts and share their videos on social media using the hashtag #gojumpers. Nathan Ansell, M&amp;S\u2019s director of marketing for clothing and home, said the infectiousness of the shoulder roll move had been picked up in focus groups. This week M&amp;S reported a drop in first-half profits after a sharp decline in clothing sales and the retailer hopes the feel-good ad will pull in shoppers. Its chief executive, Steve Rowe, has said a new design team will shed M&amp;S\u2019s reputation for \u201cfrumpiness\u201d. The M&amp;S ad, which unlike last year does not feature its TV presenter fashion muse Holly Willoughby, is designed to throw the spotlight on its knitwear as strong sales of woolies could be key to its financial success this Christmas. M&amp;S has said it expects to shift 6m jumpers and is trying to attract more young families to its stores. The ad features 50 jumpers costing anywhere between \u00a320 and \u00a3150 \u2013 plus a \u00a319.50 patterned jumper for dogs. The festive ad heralds the start of the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d for retailers, when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend \u00a380bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research for VoucherCodes.co.uk. The M&amp;S ad is part of a record \u00a36.8bn festive advertising spree this year as companies try to tempt people to spend after a tumultuous year in which some big names \u2013 most recently Mothercare \u2013 have gone to the wall. John Lewis\u2019s festive advert has become an annual event thanks to its catalogue of emotional ads that have included Monty the penguin and the tale of a lonely man on the moon. Ikea also entered the fray for the first time on Friday with an irreverent ad set to an original grime track voiced by MC D Double E. Some of the retail industry\u2019s biggest names, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and John Lewis, will wait until after Remembrance Day on 11 November for their big reveals. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to include the name of the commissioner of the report by the Centre for Retail Research.",

The IEA, or International Energy Agency, predicts that solar energy will play a big role in supporting the continent\u2019s growing population and industrialisation over the next 20 years. Africa has less than half the solar power installations seen in the UK, despite the sunnier conditions, but the IEA is predicting a solar boom in countries across the continent, which could give hundreds of millions of homes electricity for the first time. The report forecasts that Africa\u2019s appetite for energy will grow at double the rate of the global average in the coming decades as the continent overtakes China and India as the most populated region in the world. Africa\u2019s population is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2040, a rise of 800 million from today or the population equivalent of the US and Europe combined, says the report.
