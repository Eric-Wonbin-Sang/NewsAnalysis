      "body": "<p>The row about female representation at the Brits was rumbling on unabated in the lead-up to the awards ceremony. The most recent contributions included best group nominees D-Block Europe complaining that music remains \u201ca man\u2019s game \u2013 what\u2019s the head of every label?\u201d, while Piers Morgan gamely attempted to blame the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1229560961662480390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1229560961662480390&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinknews.co.uk%2F2020%2F02%2F18%2Fpiers-morgan-brit-awards-nominations-women-sam-smith-normani-miley-cyrus%2F\">situation on transgender people</a>. A variety of presenters and award-winners subsequently mentioned it, from Paloma Faith to Foals, and presenter Jack Whitehall made a surprisingly cutting joke about it: \u201cIn the spirit of sustainability, the Brits have been recycling all sorts of excuses for why there were so few women nominated.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s a sense in which the actual winners of the 2020 Brits represented an attempt to convince the public it was all very much business as usual: nothing to get upset about here, kindly move along. The kind of unscripted events that made last year\u2019s Mercury prize ceremony genuinely interesting for the first time in years \u2013 Slowthai brandishing an effigy of Boris Johnson\u2019s severed head; one of Black Midi running full pelt into a grand piano with a sickening thud, then attempting to style it out while visibly in great discomfort \u2013 were noticeable by their absence.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2020/feb/19/brits-2020-the-best-of-the-red-carpet-and-ceremony-in-pictures\">Brits 2020: the best of the red carpet and ceremony \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There were extravagant set-pieces from Stormzy and Lizzo, and the sight of Billie Eilish enjoying yet another co-sign from an artist of a more mature vintage, this time Johnny Marr, playing guitar on her Bond theme No Time to Die. But it was left to rapper Dave and Tyler, the Creator to provide the solitary edgy moments of the evening. The latter mentioned Theresa May\u2019s successful attempt to have him banned from the country while she was home secretary \u2013 \u201cI bet she\u2019s pissed,\u201d he noted \u2013 while Dave extemporised an extra verse during the evening\u2019s standout performance, a version of his single Black, short on bells and whistles but big on emotional clout, during which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/18/dave-attacks-boris-johnson-in-brit-awards-performance-our-prime-ministers-a-real-racist\">he bluntly called the prime minister a racist</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1bf2a191-c95b-4733-9321-03b418b2b0e2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjNyzYMucd0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Otherwise, shocks of any kind were thin on the ground: you could, if you were absolutely desperate, make a song-and-dance about the fact that Foals won best group rather than the more commercially successful Bastille or Coldplay, but it\u2019s hardly an unknown artist suddenly escaping the margins to snatch victory from beneath the noses of the bookies\u2019 favourites. Elsewhere, there was never really any doubt that Mabel was going to win female solo artist \u2013 Charli XCX and FKA twigs may boast more critical acclaim, but neither of them had a hit as big as Don\u2019t Call Me Up, which spent over six months in the charts \u2013 while Lewis Capaldi, or The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi, as Jack Whitehall insisted on calling him, was a shoo-in for new artist and song from the start: you don\u2019t make the UK\u2019s biggest-selling single and album of the year and go home empty-handed from the Brits.</p> \n<p>In truth, the closest the actual awards came to a genuine surprise was that The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi didn\u2019t win more awards. Essentially predicated on rewarding commercial success, you might have expected the Brits to give him everything, up to and including the on stage autocue, but Dave\u2019s Psychodrama added to its Mercury win by clinching album of the year, a rare moment when you got the feeling the voting academy might have been listening to the music rather than concentrating on the sales figures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34b6c6f0de9d583a7fcee33ceaa1544086748adf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34b6c6f0de9d583a7fcee33ceaa1544086748adf/0_61_3118_1871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An extravagant set piece \u2026 Lizzo\u2019s performance at the Brits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An extravagant set piece \u2026 Lizzo\u2019s performance at the Brits.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For all that, there were times when the Brits made you feel good about the current state of pop music albeit simply by holding up a mirror to the charts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/08/dave-psychodrama-review-best-british-rap-album\">Psychodrama</a> is a great album \u2013 powerful, thoughtful, moving, intense \u2013 that went to No 1 and spawned three Top 10 singles. International female solo artist winner Billie Eilish\u2019s ascendency to imperious teen superstardom has been achieved by making genuinely great music that sounds like the expression of a uniquely skewed personality rather than a craven attempt to make something that the maximum number of people will like. Tyler\u2019s album Igor offered a perfect example of how its author has managed to outrun his initial notoriety, ditching the obnoxious shock value without compromising a desire to experiment.</p> \n<p>As for the ongoing situation regarding female representation, it\u2019s perhaps instructive to look back at the 2016 Brits, where the nominations for female solo artist included Amy Winehouse, who\u2019d died five years previously, the implication being that there were so few female artists worthy of consideration that the awards had to scour the hereafter to make up the numbers. In that respect, too, this year\u2019s awards were business as usual.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The row about female representation at the Brits was rumbling on unabated in the lead-up to the awards ceremony. The most recent contributions included best group nominees D-Block Europe complaining that music remains \u201ca man\u2019s game \u2013 what\u2019s the head of every label?\u201d, while Piers Morgan gamely attempted to blame the situation on transgender people. A variety of presenters and award-winners subsequently mentioned it, from Paloma Faith to Foals, and presenter Jack Whitehall made a surprisingly cutting joke about it: \u201cIn the spirit of sustainability, the Brits have been recycling all sorts of excuses for why there were so few women nominated.\u201d But there\u2019s a sense in which the actual winners of the 2020 Brits represented an attempt to convince the public it was all very much business as usual: nothing to get upset about here, kindly move along. The kind of unscripted events that made last year\u2019s Mercury prize ceremony genuinely interesting for the first time in years \u2013 Slowthai brandishing an effigy of Boris Johnson\u2019s severed head; one of Black Midi running full pelt into a grand piano with a sickening thud, then attempting to style it out while visibly in great discomfort \u2013 were noticeable by their absence. There were extravagant set-pieces from Stormzy and Lizzo, and the sight of Billie Eilish enjoying yet another co-sign from an artist of a more mature vintage, this time Johnny Marr, playing guitar on her Bond theme No Time to Die. But it was left to rapper Dave and Tyler, the Creator to provide the solitary edgy moments of the evening. The latter mentioned Theresa May\u2019s successful attempt to have him banned from the country while she was home secretary \u2013 \u201cI bet she\u2019s pissed,\u201d he noted \u2013 while Dave extemporised an extra verse during the evening\u2019s standout performance, a version of his single Black, short on bells and whistles but big on emotional clout, during which he bluntly called the prime minister a racist. Otherwise, shocks of any kind were thin on the ground: you could, if you were absolutely desperate, make a song-and-dance about the fact that Foals won best group rather than the more commercially successful Bastille or Coldplay, but it\u2019s hardly an unknown artist suddenly escaping the margins to snatch victory from beneath the noses of the bookies\u2019 favourites. Elsewhere, there was never really any doubt that Mabel was going to win female solo artist \u2013 Charli XCX and FKA twigs may boast more critical acclaim, but neither of them had a hit as big as Don\u2019t Call Me Up, which spent over six months in the charts \u2013 while Lewis Capaldi, or The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi, as Jack Whitehall insisted on calling him, was a shoo-in for new artist and song from the start: you don\u2019t make the UK\u2019s biggest-selling single and album of the year and go home empty-handed from the Brits. In truth, the closest the actual awards came to a genuine surprise was that The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi didn\u2019t win more awards. Essentially predicated on rewarding commercial success, you might have expected the Brits to give him everything, up to and including the on stage autocue, but Dave\u2019s Psychodrama added to its Mercury win by clinching album of the year, a rare moment when you got the feeling the voting academy might have been listening to the music rather than concentrating on the sales figures. For all that, there were times when the Brits made you feel good about the current state of pop music albeit simply by holding up a mirror to the charts. Psychodrama is a great album \u2013 powerful, thoughtful, moving, intense \u2013 that went to No 1 and spawned three Top 10 singles. International female solo artist winner Billie Eilish\u2019s ascendency to imperious teen superstardom has been achieved by making genuinely great music that sounds like the expression of a uniquely skewed personality rather than a craven attempt to make something that the maximum number of people will like. Tyler\u2019s album Igor offered a perfect example of how its author has managed to outrun his initial notoriety, ditching the obnoxious shock value without compromising a desire to experiment. As for the ongoing situation regarding female representation, it\u2019s perhaps instructive to look back at the 2016 Brits, where the nominations for female solo artist included Amy Winehouse, who\u2019d died five years previously, the implication being that there were so few female artists worthy of consideration that the awards had to scour the hereafter to make up the numbers. In that respect, too, this year\u2019s awards were business as usual.",

Like Dua Lipa a couple of years back, she papers over some slightly ordinary vocals in Don\u2019t Call Me Up with a ridiculous amount of dancers, and chooses to mime the chorus \u2013 perhaps wise given she doesn\u2019t consistently nail the top notes in the verses. She shows off some admirable core strength as she is held aloft for the climax, but I can\u2019t help but feel this tune is a 7/10 jam that you happily nod along to at 11pm in the club while teenage boys circle nervously around girls who actively disdain them, but you wouldn\u2019t exactly go wild to it at peak time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5eb1a5b856044c943c9a5038a31c10feaa5d61b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5eb1a5b856044c943c9a5038a31c10feaa5d61b/0_0_6442_4295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Off to do a bit of light grouting \u2026 Mabel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off to do a bit of light grouting \u2026 Mabel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JM Enternational/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lewis Capaldi</h2> \n<p>Someone You Loved is a really powerful piece of writing, for its total melodic logic, a top line modulating through relatively stoic resolve before deciding, nope, I\u2019m really sad about this breakup actually.

The Brits lives for a medley. Lizzo emerges at the centre of big lengths of chiffon like a queenly spider, but is quickly down among some twerking dancers. Her ability to flip around a high ponytail while not throwing off her mic skills is quite astonishing, even if it does get her slightly out of breath (noted for my next HIIT class, though I\u2019m not sure it works for bald guys). Some random bloke in the crowd even gets to get on the mic as she goes down into the crowd, dispensing ladles of her infectious charisma to all and sundry. Truth Hurts segues into Good as Hell into Juice into a snatch of Cuz I Love You. Buttocks vibrate at high amplitude. \u201cThank you,\u201d she mouths to the crowd. \u201cBITCH!\u201d</p> \n<h2>Dave</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1bf2a191-c95b-4733-9321-03b418b2b0e2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjNyzYMucd0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Playing piano against blocks of black is a performance of Black, Dave\u2019s ode to needing to work twice as hard, as a black person, to get half as far in life. If Harry Styles had two pianos, Dave one-ups him with a single piano with two keyboards. He plays it himself in the opening half of the endlessly unspooling freestyle, but is joined by a second pianist to allow him to focus on the mic ratchet up the vocal intensity; pain and speed gradually reaching a climax of sheer anger at institutional and historic racism.</p> \n<p>And what a climax. Dave gets off his piano stool to deliver a newly written final freestyle verse that ranks alongside \u2013 no, outpaces \u2013 the similarly electric and political statement from Stormzy when he shouted \u201cwhere\u2019s the money for Grenfell?\u201d in 2018. \u201cThe truth is our prime minister is a real racist\u201d gets aired in the opening lines. He pays tribute to Jack Merritt, a victim of the London Bridge terror attack, but argues \u201ctougher sentences: that\u2019s just papering cracks\u201d; spits fire about the treatment of Meghan Markle, calls out the government regarding Grenfell; and calls for \u201creparations for the time our people spent on plantations\u201d. This is what the Brits stage is made for: forthright political statements that can hopefully move the dial in millions of living rooms nationwide.</p> \n<h2>Billie Eilish</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdbf55aa2b020cec21d7ffcdf271e3923d3ac3d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdbf55aa2b020cec21d7ffcdf271e3923d3ac3d1/0_0_5429_3620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Utterly riveting \u2026 Billie Eilish performing No Time to Die at the Brit awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Utterly riveting \u2026 Billie Eilish performing No Time to Die at the Brit awards.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JM Enternational/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the live debut for No Time to Die, Billie Eilish\u2019s theme for the James Bond film of the same name \u2013 a real coup for the Brits. Her brother Finneas plays brooding piano \u2013 quite the musical theme of this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 and Johnny Marr plays substantial, malevolent guitar licks, including an exceptionally Bond-style imperfect cadence at the end. Hans Zimmer, Bond score composer, conducts the orchestra. But despite the pedigree surrounding her, Eilish is utterly riveting. Her vocal control, swooping between breathy depth, lung-busting mid-range notes and expertly swooping top range is immaculate, but then a lot of blue-chip singers can do that. Her particular genius is to climb right inside your head with every doleful creak and crack in her voice. Bond, a man nursing a busted stiff upper lip, has his perfect musical foil.</p> \n<h2>Celeste</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"270a1de3f9108a2eede9e67f34cb1f6f0ece4154\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/270a1de3f9108a2eede9e67f34cb1f6f0ece4154/0_397_5217_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What a moment \u2026 Celeste on stage at the Brit Awards 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What a moment \u2026 Celeste on stage at the Brit Awards 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Celeste is the winner of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/06/soul-singer-celeste-named-winner-of-brits-rising-star-award\">rising star award</a>, formerly the critics\u2019 choice award, given to those anointed for future greatness by the industry. A certain kind of female vocal, edges cracking and flaking like old paint, has been used to evoke a dilapidated heart ever since Billie Holiday slowed down the blues into indigo decades ago. It was this audible damage that made Amy Winehouse such a sensation, and now Celeste, who sings her spellbinding ballad Strange, a song about the disbelief at someone you loved reverting back to just another human going about their business. Having seen her live last year, up close her voice is truly devastating and it does feel like it belongs in a room where smoke is gathering around the table lamps, but nevertheless she projects it right to the back of the arena here. What a moment for her, and a really excellent decision by the Brits to push forward the next generation of British performers by giving them access to the country\u2019s biggest stage.</p> \n<h2>Stormzy</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de274b336af3b062dff3a04e796a2bc71a5224af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de274b336af3b062dff3a04e796a2bc71a5224af/473_186_5095_3057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Revel in the might \u2026 Stormzy\u2019s finale at the Brit awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revel in the might \u2026 Stormzy\u2019s finale at the Brit awards.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sound the medley klaxon! Stormzy opens with a \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 piano ballad, admittedly with a strong dose of gospel fervour. Don\u2019t Forget to Breathe\u2019s appeal will be proportional to how much you like his naive singing style, but just the very sight of seeing him perform with a mic stand is a mark of how far he\u2019s come: now a pop star with real range who no longer just spits into a mic in his fist.</p> \n<p>He hops back to pure grime for Wiley Flow, surrounded by a squad goading on a bit of scaffolding slightly reminiscent of a bit of his Glastonbury staging. No sign of Wiley himself though, so their beef remains unburied. Then it\u2019s a blast of J Hus\u2019s Fortune Teller \u2013 a nice nod to his fellow UK rap star \u2013 before segueing into his No 1 track Own It, with Burna Boy on the hook, who gets to do some of his own joyous Afro-pop hit Anybody.</p> \n<p>The closing Rainfall, which takes him back round to the gospel of the opening with its Mary Mary sample, sees him surrounded by hundreds of people of colour euphorically jumping and undulating in time, rounding off a celebration of creativity from both sides of the black Atlantic. It partners perfectly with Dave\u2019s necessarily angry performance earlier in the evening: once the anger has been purged and the terms been written, perhaps black Britain can look to the future, and revel in the might of its artistry.</p> \n<h2>Rod Stewart</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725c447cae2b70437bfdf4154b30f7e796fc719e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725c447cae2b70437bfdf4154b30f7e796fc719e/0_218_4930_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closing the show \u2026 Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood perform on stage at the Brit Awards 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Closing the show \u2026 Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood perform on stage at the Brit Awards 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Closing the show is Rod Stewart, looking like a toreador who just can\u2019t resist the finest silk. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this one for your mum, Hillary\u201d \u2013 a reference to a joke Whitehall had made earlier in the evening, that his mother was off giving Rod some mild sexual harassment.</p> \n<p>Well, Rod\u2019s got the Brits 2020 memo, and it\u2019s going to be a sad, sweeping ballad, I Don\u2019t Want to Talk About It. I guess if you\u2019ve hired an orchestra for the night you might as well get the most out of them, and Rod\u2019s in pleasingly husky form. \u201cAny good?\u201d he asks the crowd to whooping affirmation. \u201cThis show might be 40 years old but the Faces are 50 years old ... let me bring up Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones. Here is is, my old mucker!\u201d</p> \n<p>The reunited Faces do Stay With Me, with heavily overdriven blues-rock riffing from Wood. Quick, bring your dad down from brushing his teeth, he\u2019ll like this one! The orchestra works rather well here, swinging rather boozily around Stewart\u2019s lusty belting.</p> \n<p>Overall I could have done with some more pop bangers \u2013 Mabel\u2019s was a little bit of a damp squib to open the show, though Lizzo\u2019s medley was an injection of pure energy. Yet there was some real quality to the endless balladeering \u2013 and Dave\u2019s stern excoriation of British racism was electrifying.</p>",

Dave gets off his piano stool to deliver a newly written final freestyle verse that ranks alongside \u2013 no, outpaces \u2013 the similarly electric and political statement from Stormzy when he shouted \u201cwhere\u2019s the money for Grenfell?\u201d in 2018. \u201cThe truth is our prime minister is a real racist\u201d gets aired in the opening lines. He pays tribute to Jack Merritt, a victim of the London Bridge terror attack, but argues \u201ctougher sentences: that\u2019s just papering cracks\u201d; spits fire about the treatment of Meghan Markle, calls out the government regarding Grenfell; and calls for \u201creparations for the time our people spent on plantations\u201d. This is what the Brits stage is made for: forthright political statements that can hopefully move the dial in millions of living rooms nationwide. Billie Eilish This is the live debut for No Time to Die, Billie Eilish\u2019s theme for the James Bond film of the same name \u2013 a real coup for the Brits. Her brother Finneas plays brooding piano \u2013 quite the musical theme of this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 and Johnny Marr plays substantial, malevolent guitar licks, including an exceptionally Bond-style imperfect cadence at the end. Hans Zimmer, Bond score composer, conducts the orchestra. But despite the pedigree surrounding her, Eilish is utterly riveting. Her vocal control, swooping between breathy depth, lung-busting mid-range notes and expertly swooping top range is immaculate, but then a lot of blue-chip singers can do that. Her particular genius is to climb right inside your head with every doleful creak and crack in her voice. Bond, a man nursing a busted stiff upper lip, has his perfect musical foil. Celeste Celeste is the winner of the rising star award, formerly the critics\u2019 choice award, given to those anointed for future greatness by the industry. A certain kind of female vocal, edges cracking and flaking like old paint, has been used to evoke a dilapidated heart ever since Billie Holiday slowed down the blues into indigo decades ago. It was this audible damage that made Amy Winehouse such a sensation, and now Celeste, who sings her spellbinding ballad Strange, a song about the disbelief at someone you loved reverting back to just another human going about their business. Having seen her live last year, up close her voice is truly devastating and it does feel like it belongs in a room where smoke is gathering around the table lamps, but nevertheless she projects it right to the back of the arena here. What a moment for her, and a really excellent decision by the Brits to push forward the next generation of British performers by giving them access to the country\u2019s biggest stage. Stormzy Sound the medley klaxon! Stormzy opens with a \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 piano ballad, admittedly with a strong dose of gospel fervour. Don\u2019t Forget to Breathe\u2019s appeal will be proportional to how much you like his naive singing style, but just the very sight of seeing him perform with a mic stand is a mark of how far he\u2019s come: now a pop star with real range who no longer just spits into a mic in his fist. He hops back to pure grime for Wiley Flow, surrounded by a squad goading on a bit of scaffolding slightly reminiscent of a bit of his Glastonbury staging. No sign of Wiley himself though, so their beef remains unburied. Then it\u2019s a blast of J Hus\u2019s Fortune Teller \u2013 a nice nod to his fellow UK rap star \u2013 before segueing into his No 1 track Own It, with Burna Boy on the hook, who gets to do some of his own joyous Afro-pop hit Anybody. The closing Rainfall, which takes him back round to the gospel of the opening with its Mary Mary sample, sees him surrounded by hundreds of people of colour euphorically jumping and undulating in time, rounding off a celebration of creativity from both sides of the black Atlantic. It partners perfectly with Dave\u2019s necessarily angry performance earlier in the evening: once the anger has been purged and the terms been written, perhaps black Britain can look to the future, and revel in the might of its artistry. Rod Stewart Closing the show is Rod Stewart, looking like a toreador who just can\u2019t resist the finest silk. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this one for your mum, Hillary\u201d \u2013 a reference to a joke Whitehall had made earlier in the evening, that his mother was off giving Rod some mild sexual harassment. Well, Rod\u2019s got the Brits 2020 memo, and it\u2019s going to be a sad, sweeping ballad, I Don\u2019t Want to Talk About It. I guess if you\u2019ve hired an orchestra for the night you might as well get the most out of them, and Rod\u2019s in pleasingly husky form. \u201cAny good?\u201d he asks the crowd to whooping affirmation. \u201cThis show might be 40 years old but the Faces are 50 years old ... let me bring up Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones. Here is is, my old mucker!\u201d The reunited Faces do Stay With Me, with heavily overdriven blues-rock riffing from Wood. Quick, bring your dad down from brushing his teeth, he\u2019ll like this one! The orchestra works rather well here, swinging rather boozily around Stewart\u2019s lusty belting. Overall I could have done with some more pop bangers \u2013 Mabel\u2019s was a little bit of a damp squib to open the show, though Lizzo\u2019s medley was an injection of pure energy. Yet there was some real quality to the endless balladeering \u2013 and Dave\u2019s stern excoriation of British racism was electrifying.",

It was disappointing not to see more artists take a stand about that as they gave out and collected awards tonight, though slivers of discontent crept in.</p> <p>Still, the moments that will be making headlines tomorrow all concern protests that reach far beyond the music industry: Dave\u2019s ad libs in Black about Grenfell, the Windrush generation, reparations and the media\u2019s treatment of Meghan Markle offered the evening\u2019s most explosive moment.

Stormzy opens with a \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 piano ballad, admittedly with a strong dose of gospel fervour. Don\u2019t Forget to Breathe\u2019s appeal will be proportional to how much you like his naive singing style, but just the very sight of seeing him perform with a mic stand is a mark of how far he\u2019s come: now a pop star with real range who no longer just spits into a mic in his fist.</p> <p>He hops back to pure grime for Wiley Flow, surrounded by a squad goading on a bit of scaffolding slightly reminiscent of a bit of his Glastonbury staging. No sign of Wiley himself though, so their beef remains unburied. Then it\u2019s a blast of J Hus\u2019s Fortune Teller \u2013 a nice nod to his fellow UK rap star \u2013 before segueing into his No 1 track Own It, with Burna Boy on the hook, who gets to do some of his own joyous Afro-pop hit Anybody. From Lanre in the crowd: \u201cStormzy is absolutely crushing it \u2013 his live performance morphs into an Afrobeats rave. Reminiscent of Kanye but you could actually hear what was going on and there wasn\u2019t an errant flamethrower aimed at the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>The closing Rainfall, which takes him back round to the gospel of the opening with its Mary Mary sample, sees him surrounded by hundreds of people of colour euphorically jumping and undulating in time, rounding off a celebration of creativity from both sides of the black Atlantic. It partners perfectly with Dave\u2019s necessarily angry performance earlier in the evening: once the anger has been purged and the terms been written, perhaps black Britain can look to the future, and revel in the might of its artistry.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:52:39.476Z\">at 9.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4c5b3f8f0811db2fafa265\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laura-snapes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:47:29.426Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bmthofficial/status/1229857548980891654\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udf38girl power\ud83c\udf3c <a href=\"https://t.co/eZ3b7OqtXx\">pic.twitter.com/eZ3b7OqtXx</a></p>&mdash; Bring Me The Horizon (@bmthofficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bmthofficial/status/1229857548980891654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 18, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The mystery of the evening\u2019s maddest outfits is solved: Bring Me the Horizon <em>came as the Spice Girls</em>!

A certain kind of female vocal, edges cracking and flaking like old paint, has been used to evoke a dilapidated heart ever since Billie Holiday slowed down the blues into indigo decades ago. It was this audible damage that made Amy Winehouse such a sensation, and now Celeste, who sings her spellbinding ballad Strange, a song about the disbelief at someone you loved reverting back to just another human going about their business. Having seen her live last year, up close her voice is truly devastating and it does feel like it belongs in a room where smoke is gathering around the table lamps, but nevertheless she projects it right to the back of the arena here. What a moment, and a really excellent decision by the Brits to push forward the next generation of British performers by giving them access to the country\u2019s biggest stage.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:33:24.404Z\">at 9.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4c511b8f086a28115ae2f8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:10:30.722Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Billie Eilish's performance reviewed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79780e0d30909c152e79be9b757de74f734beabd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79780e0d30909c152e79be9b757de74f734beabd/0_71_2137_1283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billie Eilish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the live debut for No Time to Die, Billie Eilish\u2019s theme for the James Bond film of the same name \u2013 a real coup for the Brits. Her brother Finneas plays brooding piano \u2013 quite the musical theme of this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 and Johnny Marr plays substantial, malevolent guitar licks, including an exceptionally Bond-style imperfect cadence at the end. Hans Zimmer, Bond score composer, conducts the orchestra. But despite the pedigree surrounding her, Eilish is utterly riveting. Her vocal control, swooping between breathy depth, lung-busting mid-range notes and expertly swooping top range is immaculate, but then a lot of blue-chip singers can do that. Her particular genius is to climb right inside your head, with every doleful creak and crack in her voice. Bond, a man nursing a busted stiff upper lip, has his perfect musical foil.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:33:31.194Z\">at 9.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4c50378f08e13324745c23\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laura-snapes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T21:04:55.770Z\">9.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Group of the year: Foals</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce250f4e931b8f0b3b5a39fc454716227f0f2e6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce250f4e931b8f0b3b5a39fc454716227f0f2e6a/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foals (plus Anne Marie, Hailee Steinfeld and Courtney Love).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As Ben mentioned in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/18/brit-awards-2020-who-will-who-should-win-lewis-capaldi-stormzy-dave-michael-kiwanuka\">Brits preview</a>, Foals stood a double chance in this category \u2013 they released two albums in the past 12 months, which meant that voters could nominate them twice for this category, should they so wish.

There is such a terrific certainly to how hurt he is, and how badly he messed up: the really chilling clarity of having truly lost someone, and it probably being at least partly your fault. The backing vocals are exquisitely mixed, the piano playing perfect, and the dystopian Sandals resort water-feature is the kind of effect this high production value Brits is rightly spending the money on.

      "bodyText": "The era of #BritsSoWhite is long gone: with awards for Stormzy, Mabel and Dave, black British talent is finally getting the credit it deserves \u2013 and not just in specialist categories, but as the pop game-changer it truly is. On the 40th anniversary of the Brits, it\u2019s welcome proof that these creaky old establishments really can change. So they\u2019ve no excuse for their continued under-recognition of female artists: outside of the specific categories for best British and international female, and Celeste\u2019s award for rising star (which was announced in December) no women won in the four mixed gender categories tonight. It was disappointing not to see more artists take a stand about that as they gave out and collected awards tonight, though slivers of discontent crept in. Still, the moments that will be making headlines tomorrow all concern protests that reach far beyond the music industry: Dave\u2019s ad libs in Black about Grenfell, the Windrush generation, reparations and the media\u2019s treatment of Meghan Markle offered the evening\u2019s most explosive moment. Amidst his highlighting of injustice, there was gleeful pleasure in seeing Tyler, the Creator taunt Theresa May \u2013 who as home secretary banned him from entering Britain for five years \u2013 about finally being back here, and back on top. British male: Stormzy British female: Mabel British group: Foals Rising star: Celeste Best new artist: Lewis Capaldi Best song: Lewis Capaldi \u2013 Someone You Loved Best album: Dave \u2013 Psychodrama International male: Tyler, the Creator International female: Billie Eilish Closing the show is Rod Stewart, looking like a toreador who just can\u2019t resist the finest silk. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this one for your mum, Hillary\u201d \u2013 a reference to a joke Whitehall had made earlier in the evening, that his mother was off giving Rod some mild sexual harassment. Well, Rod\u2019s got the Brits 2020 memo, and it\u2019s going to be a sad, sweeping ballad, I Don\u2019t Want to Talk About It. I guess if you\u2019ve hired an orchestra for the night you might as well get the most out of them, and Rod\u2019s in pleasingly husky form. \u201cAny good?\u201d he asks the crowd to whooping affirmation. \u201cThis show might be 40 years old but the Faces are 50 years old ... let me bring up Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones. Here is is, my old mucker!\u201d The reunited Faces do Stay With Me, with heavily overdriven blues-rock riffing from Wood. Quick, bring your dad down from brushing his teeth, he\u2019ll like this one! The orchestra works rather well here, swinging rather boozily around Stewart\u2019s lusty belting. Overall I could have done with some more pop bangers \u2013 Mabel\u2019s was a little bit of a damp squib to open the show, though Lizzo\u2019s medley was an injection of pure energy. And yet, there was some real quality to the endless balladeering \u2013 and Dave\u2019s stern excoriation of British racism was electrifying. Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood are now on stage. This feels like being trapped on a cruise ship that is slowly sinking. Please send help \u2013 or Jane McDonald at the least. The most deserving debut album in the category, and alongside Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s Kiwanuka, perhaps the most likely to endure as well. After shouting out the legends in the building \u2013 Harry Styles, Stormzy, Lewis Capaldi, Billie Eilish and Hans Zimmer \u2013 Dave continues the work he started with his incredible performance earlier on, using his platform to celebrate \u201ceveryone that comes from the place I come from\u201d \u2013 cue a big cheer from Stormzy \u2013 and the \u201cyoung kings and queens that are chasing their dreams.\u201d \u201cI am no different from you,\u201d he says. \u201cI am just a guy. Everything I\u2019m saying is a fact: you can do anything you put your mind to.\u201d He finishes with an acknowledgment of \u201canyone who is inside doing their time\u201d \u2013 including his brother, Christopher: \u201cHold it down, I love you guys.\u201d I\u2019m not sorry to keep talking about it: it\u2019s still a travesty that there were no female artists in this category. In what world is Someone You Loved better than Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus\u2019s ALL-TIME CLASSIC Nothing Breaks Like a Heart? This endlessly disappointing one, apparently. Stormzy, AJ Tracey and Sam Smith all had better songs than Capaldi\u2019s winning track too, but there\u2019s no denying that he was the biggest UK success story of the past 12 months. Apparently this song has been streamed A BILLION times. That\u2019s a lot of heartbreak. He sets his bottle of Bucky on the stand and embarks on a fittingly chaotic speech to cap the night: \u201cA lot of people think this song is about my ex-girlfriend who you can now see every night on Love Island,\u201d he says ruefully, \u201cbut it is actually about my grandmother, who sadly passed away a few years ago, and I hope to god that ITV don\u2019t contact her to be on a reality TV dating show.\u201d Anyway, he says, it\u2019s been the best year of his life. \u201cThanks to my label, thanks to my mum and dad for, I don\u2019t know, making love? Thanks to my grandmother for... dying? I don\u2019t know!\u201d Sound the medley klaxon! Stormzy opens with a \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 piano ballad, admittedly with a strong dose of gospel fervour. Don\u2019t Forget to Breathe\u2019s appeal will be proportional to how much you like his naive singing style, but just the very sight of seeing him perform with a mic stand is a mark of how far he\u2019s come: now a pop star with real range who no longer just spits into a mic in his fist. He hops back to pure grime for Wiley Flow, surrounded by a squad goading on a bit of scaffolding slightly reminiscent of a bit of his Glastonbury staging. No sign of Wiley himself though, so their beef remains unburied. Then it\u2019s a blast of J Hus\u2019s Fortune Teller \u2013 a nice nod to his fellow UK rap star \u2013 before segueing into his No 1 track Own It, with Burna Boy on the hook, who gets to do some of his own joyous Afro-pop hit Anybody. From Lanre in the crowd: \u201cStormzy is absolutely crushing it \u2013 his live performance morphs into an Afrobeats rave. Reminiscent of Kanye but you could actually hear what was going on and there wasn\u2019t an errant flamethrower aimed at the crowd.\u201d The closing Rainfall, which takes him back round to the gospel of the opening with its Mary Mary sample, sees him surrounded by hundreds of people of colour euphorically jumping and undulating in time, rounding off a celebration of creativity from both sides of the black Atlantic. It partners perfectly with Dave\u2019s necessarily angry performance earlier in the evening: once the anger has been purged and the terms been written, perhaps black Britain can look to the future, and revel in the might of its artistry. The mystery of the evening\u2019s maddest outfits is solved: Bring Me the Horizon came as the Spice Girls! I know this phrase is wildly overused but I\u2019ve been working since 6am and my personal standards are slipping: genuinely iconic. STRONG SPOT. ITV are missing a trick if they don\u2019t invite these two chaotic flirts back to host the 2021 show with Jack Whitehall. The chemistry! Come and \u2019ave a go if you think you\u2019re \u2019ard enough! It\u2019s Brits legend Mel C giving the award for best international female artist to Billie Eilish, a noted Spice Girls fan \u2013 albeit one so young she initially thought they were a pretend band invented for Spice World the movie. It\u2019s Billie\u2019s first Brit award, though she looks as pleased to meet Mel C \u2013 \u201cthank you, Sporty!\u201d \u2013 as she does to get the award itself. She shouts out her competition \u2013 \u201cthe only reason I exist\u201d \u2013 and gets candid for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve felt very hated recently, and when I was on the stage and I saw you guys all smiling at me\u201d \u2013 she pauses to catch her breath \u2013 \u201cit genuinely made me wanna cry. I wanna cry right now, so thank you.\u201d And cry she does, and lovely Sporty leads her off stage. Presumably Billie is referring to the backlash against some comments she made about hip-hop in her recent US Vogue cover, which Vulture\u2019s Craig Jenkins distilled here. Celeste is the winner of the rising star award, formerly the critics\u2019 choice award, given to those anointed for future greatness by the industry. A certain kind of female vocal, edges cracking and flaking like old paint, has been used to evoke a dilapidated heart ever since Billie Holiday slowed down the blues into indigo decades ago. It was this audible damage that made Amy Winehouse such a sensation, and now Celeste, who sings her spellbinding ballad Strange, a song about the disbelief at someone you loved reverting back to just another human going about their business. Having seen her live last year, up close her voice is truly devastating and it does feel like it belongs in a room where smoke is gathering around the table lamps, but nevertheless she projects it right to the back of the arena here. What a moment, and a really excellent decision by the Brits to push forward the next generation of British performers by giving them access to the country\u2019s biggest stage. This is the live debut for No Time to Die, Billie Eilish\u2019s theme for the James Bond film of the same name \u2013 a real coup for the Brits. Her brother Finneas plays brooding piano \u2013 quite the musical theme of this year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 and Johnny Marr plays substantial, malevolent guitar licks, including an exceptionally Bond-style imperfect cadence at the end. Hans Zimmer, Bond score composer, conducts the orchestra. But despite the pedigree surrounding her, Eilish is utterly riveting. Her vocal control, swooping between breathy depth, lung-busting mid-range notes and expertly swooping top range is immaculate, but then a lot of blue-chip singers can do that. Her particular genius is to climb right inside your head, with every doleful creak and crack in her voice. Bond, a man nursing a busted stiff upper lip, has his perfect musical foil. As Ben mentioned in his Brits preview, Foals stood a double chance in this category \u2013 they released two albums in the past 12 months, which meant that voters could nominate them twice for this category, should they so wish. Not to take away from what\u2019s been a big year for them \u2013 as most of their 2000s indie peers have died away, they\u2019ve reinvented themselves with two ambitious albums, cementing their legacy in the British rock pantheon. Here\u2019s Yannis Philippakis, never a man lost for words, who seems genuinely bowled over. As well as the standard label/manager/fans stuff, he shouts out his dad for lending them the money to buy the Royal Mail van that they used to tour the country in their earliest days, and winds up his remarks by saying: \u201cHopefully next year we\u2019ll see some more women in this category.\u201d Given that Foals have been talking up the importance of gender equality in the music industry and at festivals all week, I\u2019d hoped for a much stronger statement from them. Playing piano against blocks of black is a performance of Black, Dave\u2019s ode to needing to work twice as hard, as a black person, to get half as far in life. If Harry Styles had two pianos, Dave one-ups him with a single piano with two keyboards. He plays it himself in the opening half of the endlessly unspooling freestyle, but is joined by a second pianist to allow him to ratchet up the vocal intensity; pain and speed gradually reaching a climax of sheer anger at institutional and historic racism. And what a climax. Dave gets off his piano stool to deliver a newly written final freestyle verse that ranks alongside \u2013 no, outpaces \u2013 the similarly electric and political statement from Stormzy when he shouted \u201cwhere\u2019s the money for Grenfell?\u201d in 2018. \u201cThe truth is our prime minister is a real racist\u201d gets aired in the opening lines. He pays tribute to Jack Merritt, a victim of the London Bridge terror attack, but argues \u201ctougher sentences, that\u2019s just papering cracks\u201d; spits fire about the treatment of Meghan Markle, calls out the government regarding Grenfell; calls for \u201creparations for the time our people spent on plantations\u201d; and even gets in a nod for \u201cmore conservation, less deforestation\u201d. This is what the Brits stage is made for: forthright political statements that can hopefully move the dial in millions of living rooms nationwide. \u201cWe\u2019re here to announce a very under represented group tonight, the men!\u201d says co-presenter Paloma Faith, before getting on her knees to hand the award to Tyler, the Creator \u2013 his first Brit award, and the first real left-of-centre winner tonight. Following Dave\u2019s incendiary performance, Tyler injects another shot of politics into the night\u2019s proceedings, with a special shoutout to \u201csomeone who I hold dear to my heart, who made it so I couldn\u2019t come to this country five years ago, and I hope she\u2019s at home pissed off: thank you, Theresa May.\u201d Harry Styles keeps changing outfits and Twitter, which at times resembles a massively mobilised Harry Styles fanclub, is here for it. Strong category \u2013 Harry Styles, Lewis Capaldi, Dave and Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 but really nobody could hold a candle to what Stormzy\u2019s achieved this past year, in pop and beyond. It\u2019s always a joy to see Stormzy picking up these awards \u2013 he must have a serious mantlepiece of them now, but he never seems to get jaded about this stuff. As ever, he shouts out God first, followed by his mum and his #Merky team, and makes a pointed reference to the \u201cincredible females\u201d he works with: \u201cYou lot are the greatest.\u201d Medley! The Brits lives for a medley. Lizzo emerges at the centre of big lengths of chiffon like a queenly spider, but is quickly down among some twerking dancers. Her ability to flip around a high ponytail while not throwing off her mic skills is quite astonishing, even if it does get her slightly out of breath (noted for my next HIIT class, though I\u2019m not sure it works for bald guys). Some random bloke in the crowd even gets to get on the mic as she goes down into the crowd, dispensing ladles of her infectious charisma to all and sundry. Truth Hurts segues into Good as Hell into Juice into a snatch of Cuz I Love You. Buttocks vibrate at high amplitude. \u201cThank you,\u201d she mouths to the crowd. \u201cBITCH!\u201d From Lanre in the crowd: \u201cLizzo is about five times as loud as anything else that\u2019s happened so far. People actually dancing round their tables.\u201d Has anyone told Ronnie Wood he\u2019s still got his marigolds on? This is the one where he admits to \u201cwandering hands\u201d and generally having a rum old time of it during a breakup, over a ruminative piano ballad \u2013 in fact, two pianos, for double sadness points. Come on, Capaldi just did exactly this vibe five minutes ago! I personally would have preferred a slick-heeled slide through Adore You or Lights Up, where he bisexually chats up a series of mixed-gender supermodel backing dancers. But Styles, looking like a cross between David Bowie and Miss Havisham, is the first performer to bring some really A-grade vocals to the Brits. There is such a terrific certainly to how hurt he is, and how badly he messed up: the really chilling clarity of having truly lost someone, and it probably being at least partly your fault. The backing vocals are exquisitely mixed, the piano playing perfect, and the dystopian Sandals resort water-feature is the kind of effect this high production value Brits is rightly spending the money on. Bravo to all! Lizzo is about five times as loud as anything else that\u2019s happened so far. People are actually dancing round their tables. You\u2019d hope the only British woman walking away with an award tonight might take the chance to call out the industry for failing to recognise female talent. Nope! Not beyond a perfunctory acknowledgment of the \u201camazing women in this category\u201d, anyway. Anyway, it\u2019s Mabel\u2019s moment and she can do whatever she wants with it \u2013 namely shouting out her mum Neneh Cherry, her red carpet date, who won two Brits exactly 30 years ago today. The Brit award for best \u201cI\u2019m really pleased for you bbz honest\u201d face goes to competitor Charli XCX. Whitehall acknowledges how awards ceremonies have been taking a stand about environmental issues this year: \u201cIn the spirit of sustainability, the Brits have been recycling all sorts of excuses for why there were so few women nominated.\u201d The Boris jokes and the Rod Stewart/Ronnie Wood jokes go down very well with the audience. Lots of guffaws at Wood being called the \u201chorny scarecrow\u201d. There was absolute silence for the Flack tribute in the arena. This was the one chance for a female artist to win in a mixed-gender category tonight and it\u2019s gone to \u2013 quelle surprise \u2013 Lewis Capaldi, so the Brits have evidently chosen to rip the plaster off early and get all that unfortunate business out of the way as early as possible. It\u2019s Capaldi\u2019s first ever Brit award and first of a possible four tonight. Of course he\u2019s still swigging a Budweiser as he makes his way up to the stage. Once he gets there, he avoids the mic and mugs furiously, pointing, looking humbled, necking some beer, necking a bit more beer \u2013 then as soon as he says something, the bloody ITV audio feed cuts out. Not sure if that means it was rude or a technical error... Ah, thanks to the BBC for filling in the gaps \u2013 Capaldi said: \u201cThank you very much, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d A winner\u2019s speech to go down in history. I have Lewis pegged as getting a clean sweep of his four nominations, and surely he\u2019ll win best song for this: Someone You Loved is a really powerful piece of writing, for its total melodic logic, a top line modulating through relatively stoic resolve before deciding, nope, I\u2019m really sad about this breakup, actually. This is a relatively muted performance of his power ballad, lacking the full snot-encrusted, ice-cream quaffing, ugly-crying holler that he often gives it. Perhaps that\u2019s a result of him have lessons to bolster his vocal strength \u2013 as he told our Alexis last year, he was basically making up singing as he went along, just going hell for leather on everything, and shredding his vocals chords as he did so. Incidentally, this is the first evidence of the Brits\u2019 souped-up live offering this year, where they have three different stages dotted around the O2, achieved by reducing the number of industry bods at tables by 50%. Somewhere, Darren in Universal\u2019s marketing department is fuming. Jack Whitehall\u2019s opening remarks seem pretty gentle considering how barbed he\u2019s been in previous years (Billie Eilish: \u201cthe only teenager in the world who makes Greta Thunberg look lazy\u201d), but perhaps here\u2019s why: he finishes his monologue with a tribute to Caroline Flack, \u201ca member of the Brits family\u201d, who he describes as having \u201can infectious sense of fun\u201d. Close to tears, Whitehall says \u201cshe will be sorely missed\u201d. Lewis Capaldi\u2019s performance of Someone You Loved feels well timed. The Brits\u2019 sole British female nominee in the mixed categories \u2013 for shame! \u2013 opens the show in some Timbalands and pink workwear, like she\u2019s off to do a bit of light grouting on the way to the afters. Like Dua Lipa a couple of years back, she papers over some slightly ordinary vocals in Don\u2019t Call Me Up with a ridiculous amount of dancers, and chooses to mime the chorus \u2013 perhaps wise given she doesn\u2019t consisently nail the top notes in the verses. Admirable core strength as she is held aloft for the climax. I can\u2019t help but feel this tune is a 7/10 jam that you happily nod along to at 11pm in the club while teenage boys circle nervously around girls who actively disdain them, but you wouldn\u2019t exactly go wild to it at peak time. Promising start: Lizzo makes Jack Whitehall polish her flute then spanks him on the butt with it. None of that is innuendo. The warm up DJ is doing a good impression of a guy working the waltzers at a fairground boshing out Sigala Sweet Lovin\u2019 far too loud while industry bods mill about. Dave gets a big cheer when he\u2019s announced, but people absolutely lose it when Billie Eilish is announced, and Lizzo, who is also playing live. Stormzy and Mabel are popular as well; Harry Styles and Lewis Capaldi produce audible squeals from the crowd. No one seems bothered about Rod Stewart. Poor Rod. Ok, so as we approach the start of the show at 8pm, here\u2019s the decidedly phallocentric list of who\u2019s up for what this year. Group of the year Coldplay Foals Bring Me the Horizon D-Block Europe Bastille Female solo artist Mabel Freya Ridings FKA twigs Charli XCX Mahalia Male solo artist Harry Styles Lewis Capaldi Dave Michael Kiwanuka Stormzy New artist Aitch Lewis Capaldi Dave Mabel Sam Fender Song Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber \u2013 I Don\u2019t Care Mabel \u2013 Don\u2019t Call Me Up Calvin Harris and Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man \u2013 Giant Dave ft Burna Boy \u2013 Location Mark Ronson ft Miley Cyrus \u2013 Nothing Breaks Like a Heart AJ Tracey \u2013 Ladbroke Grove Lewis Capaldi \u2013 Someone You Loved Tom Walker \u2013 Just You and I Sam Smith and Normani \u2013 Dancing With a Stranger Stormzy \u2013 Vossi Bop International female solo artist Ariana Grande Billie Eilish Camila Cabello Lana Del Rey Lizzo International male solo artist Bruce Springsteen Burna Boy Tyler, the Creator Dermot Kennedy Post Malone Album of the year Stormzy \u2013 Heavy Is the Head Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 Kiwanuka Lewis Capaldi \u2013 Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Harry Styles \u2013 Fine Line And here\u2019s who I think is going to win, for what it\u2019s worth. The aforementioned Rod is here with his former Faces bandmates Ron Wood and Kenney Jones. Not only is it a chance to trade hair dye tips with Johnny Marr, but word has it that they\u2019ll be closing the show with a reunion performance. Last time they were reunited was in September, when a recently prostate cancer-free Stewart advised the audience at a charity do: \u201cGuys, you\u2019ve got to really go to the doctor \u2026 Finger up the bum, no harm done.\u201d We can but hope for such health advice from the O2 stage tonight. Nothing says true love like mistaking FKA twigs for Charli XCX. Johnny Marr, modelling a hair dye called something like Raven\u2019s Mystery. He\u2019s playing tonight with Billie Eilish, performing the new Bond theme. As a child of the skinny jeans era, everything in my body says Sam Fender\u2019s fit is all wrong and he looks like his parents bought it to grow into for some as-yet hypothetical future wedding. But actually it\u2019s probably really fashion forward. He\u2019s up for best new artist, one year on from winning the rising star award. Joy Crookes told the BBC that she chose her outfit so that \u201cyoung girls can see someone who looks like their mum, their auntie, their gran on the red carpet at the Brits\u201d. She\u2019s also massively laid into the Brits for failing to recognise female artists, not least in the exclusively male best album category. \u201cGrey Area by Little Simz was one of the best albums to come out of last year,\u201d she tweeted last month. \u201cWhat a fucking talented woman. Oh wait, are women not allowed to be in this category?\u201d We stan, etc. And the Brit award for the most fantastically chaotic styling goes to Bring Me the Horizon. Somewhere, Quavo is wondering where he put his glasses down. If AJ Tracey here goes on to win best song tonight, it will be one of the greatest vibes to ever grace this awards do. That feeling when you get up out of the limousine at your girlfriend\u2019s house on the way to the leaver\u2019s ball and her dad is in the doorway shaking his head at you: unbeatable. We love Aitch deeply and if the Brits Academy was replaced with horny women between the ages of 18 and 55, he would win best new artist tonight. FKA twigs was absolutely AdamAnt that she was going to come in new romantics cosplay tonight. And if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s her. (Also, PDA watch: gossip from the NME awards last week was that she and the 1975\u2019s Matt Healy were snogging like teenagers every chance they got. No sign of him yet though.) And here\u2019s your host... when you freeze-frame Jack Whitehall, and he\u2019s had a subtle dalliance with some St Tropez, and he\u2019s done his hair nice, and he assumes the pose of a marionette that is secretly alive and waiting til your back is turned before he murders you, he\u2019s actually very handsome, isn\u2019t he. We have a lot of time for Whitehall at the Brits \u2013 he\u2019s had to improvise through some huge cock-ups with aplomb, made very rude jokes about George Ezra, and has generally kept the whole thing feeling funny and vital rather than the rudderless luvvie-fest it became under James Corden. Unmasked! And apparently... un-pantsed? Mel C is here! Looking ripped as hell. Let\u2019s revisit one of the greatest Brits moments of all time: \u201cLiam, come and \u2019ave a go if you think yer \u2019ard enough!\u201d Rod Stewart here, looking like a dinner lady who cashed in her pension early to indulge her fascination with military history. Could JLS be launching a new assault on the mainstream now that some unpleasantness that shall not be named has passed? Aston looks like he\u2019s had one long unbroken session of tantric sex in the interim. Trend alert two: lottttttta pants and very toned abs on display. Lotta ladies who look very ready for dinner. Or at least a Hershey\u2019s Kiss. TREND ALERT! Apparently rocking the finest Laura Ashley, Paloma Faith joins the pearls-sporting Harry Styles and the lace-draped Celeste in an homage to one of cinema\u2019s greatest scenes, the tarts and vicars party in the first Bridget Jones film. This is a pop star mum appreciation blog now. Here, incidentally, is the extremely cool Neneh Cherry claiming her gong 30 years ago. When Neneh Cherry won best international artist at the 1990 Brits, she melted down her award and turned it into jewellery. No word yet on whether those are the earrings she made (maybe Lanre can find out) \u2013 but if Mabel, up for best British woman and the only woman nominated in any of the mixed gender categories, wins tonight, they could make a matching set. That\u2019d be nice. Harry Styles, visibly dying inside as people presumably shout larky comments about his nan. Jorja Smith, ready to advertise a trance rave near Milton Keynes in 1998. Followed swiftly by Maya Jama. Best hope Stormzy\u2019s safely inside by this point, eh. Yes, Lizzo! None of this bitter 90% cocoa rubbish: milk chocolate all the way. But Hershey\u2019s? Tastes like sick. Docking points for not coming head to toe in regal Cadbury\u2019s purple. While me and Laura are eating biscuits in the office, our culture reporter Lanre Bakare is down at the ceremony itself. \u201cOur table is as far back as you can get, presumably to keep the press away from the action. Here\u2019s a shot of the arena: on stage there\u2019s a faux marble version of the Brit statuette, and a digital one that looks a bit like the Block 9 IICON stage from Glastonbury. Oh, and I\u2019m within spitting distance of Jordan from the Rizzle Kicks and Leigh Francis of Bo Selecta fame who is wearing what looks like a mariachi outfit.\u201d Such glamour already! Lewis Capaldi. Cheeky chappy! Just happy to be there! Can\u2019t believe this is happening to him! Cool as a freaking cucumber, right? No: look at the state of those fingernails. Red raw. Bitten to the quick. The poor wee lad is bricking it. It\u2019s nice that they let the security guards have a turn on the red carpet, eh. Ashnikko looks comfortable, doesn\u2019t she? Major respect to her for turning one of life\u2019s great pleasures, the Bior\u00e9 pore strip, into a ritzy accessory. I\u2019ll have even more respect for her if she peels it off and shows us the blackhead forest underneath later. (Too early? Soz.) It\u2019s that time of year again, where we gather to anoint a bunch of already-successful musicians with a sprinkling of extra success, at an awards show where you have to be successful to even be nominated. Yes, it\u2019s the Brit Awards! This year\u2019s ceremony has been dogged with accusations of gender inequality, and given there\u2019s one British woman in 25 possible nomination slots across best song, album, group and new artist, it\u2019s the kind of accusation that would get turned around in your average magistrates\u2019 court before elevenses. But nevertheless, there are some really, really good pop stars playing at this thing this year: Billie Eilish doing her Bond theme, Dave bumming everyone out, Stormzy ripping the Tories a new one, Harry Styles being simply unfairly good looking, Mabel bringing the pop scorn, Celeste having your mum go who?, and Lizzo probably playing a flute. It\u2019ll be fun.",

Complex needs are identified, unravelled and addressed. Difference is made.</p> <p>John was referred to Checkpoint for hitting his son with a belt; he faces the possibility of a six-month sentence and removal from the family home. Stammering, anxious, ashamed, he can hardly look at his case worker, Lucy, during their initial interview. It is his first offence and took place after a breakdown at work, an overdose and three years of unemployment. He lashed out after his son was sent home from school, where he has \u2013 unsurprisingly, you might say \u2013 been having many problems, for making racist comments.</p> <p>John signs up willingly to his contract and manages everything except attending therapy for his anxiety. Talking about problems is not what his late and much-loved army dad taught him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone else to worry about you.\u201d Lucy has someone \u2013 another man, a little older than John \u2013 come round and talk to him instead.

Exactly what you spend most of your time screaming that these people should be offered while watching other programmes about the police, criminal justice, prison, foster care, education, legal or any other system in this beleaguered, unkind and austerity-led land. The Checkpoint women \u2013 and they are all, probably not coincidentally, women \u2013 roll up their sleeves and get stuck in to unpicking people\u2019s problems and working out what brought them from there to here. Complex needs are identified, unravelled and addressed. Difference is made. John was referred to Checkpoint for hitting his son with a belt; he faces the possibility of a six-month sentence and removal from the family home. Stammering, anxious, ashamed, he can hardly look at his case worker, Lucy, during their initial interview. It is his first offence and took place after a breakdown at work, an overdose and three years of unemployment. He lashed out after his son was sent home from school, where he has \u2013 unsurprisingly, you might say \u2013 been having many problems, for making racist comments. John signs up willingly to his contract and manages everything except attending therapy for his anxiety. Talking about problems is not what his late and much-loved army dad taught him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone else to worry about you.\u201d Lucy has someone \u2013 another man, a little older than John \u2013 come round and talk to him instead. You can almost see weight lift off his shoulders. Most of Checkpoint\u2019s other clients \u2013 many of whom had chaotic childhoods, often marked by bereavement or time in care \u2013 find help, succour and experience some measure of recovery, too. Some don\u2019t. More embedded, chronic problems such as drug addiction are harder to overcome \u2013 although who knows where John (a different one), who is an addict, might be now if someone had intervened earlier in a life that began with him being fostered at six months old. I said that the Checkpoint staff \u201croll up their sleeves and get stuck in\u201d, but that diminishes the skill with which they address varying and often contradictory needs within clients, never mind between them. It also downplays the enormous amount of work \u2013 and negotiating \u2013 it must have taken many others in the policymaking chain to get this initiative off the ground. Its origins were not examined by the programme, but I would have loved to hear about them. Checkpoint is so simple, so sensible and so directly in opposition to the prevailing punitive mood \u2013 to the modern preference for being seen to do something rather than build something new and real \u2013 that long before you see the resulting stats it feels as though you are witnessing something extraordinary. (Those stats show that Checkpoint participants reoffend at a rate of 26%, compared with the standard 60%.) \u201cWe can\u2019t make miracles,\u201d says Rachel, a member of the team. \u201cBut we can believe in someone, we can be real, we can be human.\u201d It sounds miraculous enough.",

After his release from the the Silivri maximum security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul, Kavala was taken by police to an Istanbul hospital for health checks before being formally detained again. The court\u2019s earlier ruling was greeted by applause and cries of disbelief in the courtroom where more than a hundred supporters had waited to see Kavala walk free.

The tournament is being used to blood players but it is not a time to experiment too much. \u201cWe want to win, the players want to win and if we experiment against the USA we\u2019ll get beat,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go out there and use every golf club in the bag, use all the ammunition you\u2019ve got to beat these [three] teams. Japan are preparing for an Olympic Games in their own country. They\u2019ve been picking young players for the last two years for this moment in three months\u2019 time. Spain are a rapidly improving team who were knocked out of the World Cup by the USA by a small margin in the summer. We can\u2019t experiment.\u201d The Everton goalkeeper Sandy MacIver received her second call-up, and there was a first for the centre-back Grace Fisk, who joined West Ham in December having graduated from South Carolina University. England\u2019s Euro 2017 top scorer Jodie Taylor and the Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps are the notable absentees. Building a strong staff to give players the best chance to develop has been key to Neville\u2019s plans since the World Cup.\u201cIt is easy to say they are not performing, they are playing bad, making bad passes. Actually you can look beneath the surface of that and say: \u2018Right, are we giving them the best platform, the best care and support to make sure that when they go out, that mentally, physically, psychologically, they are able to handle anything that is thrown at them?\u2019\u201d Dawn Scott, a two-times World Cup-winning high-performance coach with the USA, has been poached with this in mind. \u201cThis week there has been a massive thing about menstrual cycles [with Chelsea having revealed they plan training around players\u2019 periods]. \u201cDawn implemented that within the US national team. We are implementing it now with our girls. Dawn has already spoken to a lot of the players about it and made a big impact.\u201d The biggest impact is in her tailored profiling of the players. \u201cDawn has a big thing on men aren\u2019t women and women aren\u2019t men,\u201d Neville said. \u201cWe have to tailor our philosophies, profiles, the way we test, strength and condition, and she is making things really bespoke.\u201d Neville described the state of some WSL pitches as a \u201creality check\u201d but was keen to place that in perspective: \u201cClubs are working so hard to make sure the gap is closing and the FA are pledging, committing to that investment. Rather than looking at the negatives and the criticism of certain things that need to be improved \u2026 be totally proud of where we are at, because I would rather have this massive rise and where we are now than where we were probably five years ago when conditions were really bad.\u201d",

They defended with all they had - their defending in the box was incredible. When you are 1-0 down with a team like this who only want this kind of result ... a scoreless draw would have been good for them.\u201d </p> <p>On the subject of Sadio Mane\u2019s withdrawal at the interval: \u201cHe was targeted,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was clear. They wanted to make sure he got a yellow card. It is only half-time but you need to be really strong as a referee in this atmosphere. Already in the first 30 minutes three of their players went to the ground I don\u2019t know what for. Nobody to blame. I am fine, 1-0 down at half time we have the longest half time break and we will use that. Welcome to Anfield.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt was not exactly what should happen but it happened,\u201d he said of Ateltico\u2019s early opener in an interview with BT Sport. \u201cIt was the fight we expected and the atmosphere we expected but I love so many parts of our game. It is only 1-0 down at half time and the second half we play at our stadium.\u201d Asked where his team came up short, he had this to say: \u201cWe lacked in the final third. They defended with all they had - their defending in the box was incredible. When you are 1-0 down with a team like this who only want this kind of result ... a scoreless draw would have been good for them.\u201d On the subject of Sadio Mane\u2019s withdrawal at the interval: \u201cHe was targeted,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was clear. They wanted to make sure he got a yellow card. It is only half-time but you need to be really strong as a referee in this atmosphere. Already in the first 30 minutes three of their players went to the ground I don\u2019t know what for. Nobody to blame. I am fine, 1-0 down at half time we have the longest half time break and we will use that. Welcome to Anfield. It is not over yet.\u201d Andy Hunter was at the Wanda Metropolitano for the Guardian and this is how he saw the events of an interesting evening\u2019s football entertainment unfold. Virgil van Dijk speaks: \u201cWe knew it was going to be a proper battle tonight at their home ground and with their fans behind them,\u201d says Liverpool\u2019s centre-half in an interview with BT Sport. \u201cWe conceded the goal from the corner, first chance for them ... not even a chance ... it was a bit of luck. \u201cWe had the ball most of the game but unfortunately could not create massive opportunities. We still have another 90 minutes to set it right.\u201d Alongside Virgil, Andy Robertson chips in with some uncharitable grumbles about Atletico\u2019s players playacting and \u201cfalling over too easily\u201d. \u201cIt is the way they play,\u201d says Virgil. \u201cIt is a bit of the Spanish football as well and you have to adapt but we knew it and I feel we handled it pretty well.\u201d \u201cThey celebrated as if they won the tie after the game,\u201d says Andy. \u201cThey are coming to Anfield and we know our fans will be there.\u201d Match stats Possession: Atletico 27%-73% Liverpool Shots: Atletico 7-8 Liverpool Shots on target: Atletico 2-0 Liverpool Corners: Atletico 2-8 Liverpool Fouls: Atletico 11-13 Liverpool Meanwhile in Germany: Two goals in eight minutes from the Norwegian boy wonder Erling Haaland, either side of a Neymar strike mean things are nicely poised in the tie between Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain. Advantage Atletico: But not by much. They put in a heroic defensive shift after taking a fourth minute lead through Saul Niguez. With their borderline demented manager calling the shots from inside (and often outside) his technical area, they restricted Liverpool to pot-shots and deliveries into the box from wide. Jordan Henderson had the best opportunity for the visitors, but skimmed his header wide in a game where Ateltico goalkeeper Jan Oblak didn\u2019t have to make a save. Alvaro Morata missed a golden opportunity to double Ateltico\u2019s lead, slipping with the ball at his feet and the goal at his mercy, shortly before going off. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Saul Niguez\u2019s goal from close range inside four minutes separates the sides at half-time in this tie and full-time tonight. It was an attritional game; a dogged defensive performance from Atletico but no less entertaining for all that. This tie is nicely poised ahead of the return leg at Anfield. 90+3 min: Joe Gomez is penalised for barging into Oblak at the set-piece. 90+2 min: Alexander-Arnold tries to pick out Firmino at the far post with a good cross, but an excellent defensive header by Vrsaljko prevents the Brazilian from getting on the end of the delivery. Liverpool win a corner. 90+2 min: Atletico\u2019s fans wave their scarves above their heads, cheering what looks like being their team\u2019s latest 1-0 triumph in Europe. 90+1 min: Diego Costa tries a shot from distance but his low drive is fairly harmless and skids tamely wide of the upright. 90 min: James Milner gives the ball away to Thomas Partey, allowing Atletico to clear their lines. On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp is going completely berserk after Vitolo goes down \u201cinjured\u201d and wins a free-kick. 88 min: Jurgen Klopp gets booked for protesting excessively after the referee played the advantage after a blatant Lodi handball, then not taking play back for the free-kick despite there being no discernible advantage. 86 min: Liverpool get back on the ball, trying to the last to get a shot on target and possibly score an away goal. They\u2019ll be reasonably content with a 1-0 defeat, but taking an away goal back to Anfield for the second leg would make their task so much easier. 85 min: Atletico enjoy a period of possession on the edge of the final third, which comes to an abrupt end when Lodi is flagged for offside. 82 min: Thomas Partey brings down Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the edge of the D outside the Atletico penalty area but Liverpool don\u2019t get a free-kick. 80 min: Meanwhile in Germany, it\u2019s Borussia Dortmund 2-1 PSG. Erling Haaland has got a brace there, with Neymar getting the away goal for the French champions. 78 min: A worrying sight for Liverpool as Jordan Henderson goes down needing treatment, with Fabinho signalling that a substitution will be required. Henderson walks off and James Milner replaces him. Play resumes with Costa heading a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner clear. 77 min: We\u2019re into the final 15 minutes and Liverpool have an appeal for a penalty turned down after a Jordan Henderson delivery into the box appears to striker Partey on the shoulder. No spot-kick is forthcoming. Atletico substitution: Diego Costa on for Angel Correa. 74 min: A good ball into the Atletico penalty area from Origi and Jordan Henderson sends a header skimming a couple of feet wide of the upright. That was Liverpool\u2019s best chance of the game so far, but it\u2019s gone begging. 72 min: Liverpool substitution: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on for Mo Salah. On the Atletico bench, Morata is applying his foot or ankle after kicking himself while slipping with the ball at his feet and the goal at his mercy. 71 min: Outstanding tonight so far, Renan Lodi tries his luck from distance but his effort curls wide of the upright. 70 min: Atletico Madrid substitution: Vitolo on for a disconsolate looking Alvaro Morata. 68 min: A foot or so from the penalty spot, Alvaro Morata slips in the Liverpool penalty area with the goal at his mercy after he\u2019d latched on to a Lodi cross from the left. Another let-off for Liverpool. 67 min: Borussia Dortmund have gone ahead against PSG in Germany, with Erling Haaland opening the scoring in that tie. 66 min: Atletico briefly pin Liverpool back in their own penalty area following excellent hustling and harrying of Joe Gomez by Renan Lodi. 65 min: Angel Correa goes down injured after being caught by a kick on the ankle from Fabinho. He writhes on the ground in agony, like a man with fire ants in his strides 64 min: Liverpool continue to turn the screw, probing and pressing for an opening. They\u2019re completely dominant, but Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak has yet to make a save, so compact has his defence been in front of him. 62 min: Good play from Thomas Partey, as he part-shepherds, part-barges Divock Origi out of play as the Liverpool substitute tries to get in behind him on the byline. Goal kick for Atletico Madrid. 61 min: Rodi and Savic combine to get the ball clear as Liverpool continue their almost relentless assault on the Atletico penalty area. 59 min: Niguez wastes the free-kick, clipping the ball out of play and wide, while trying to pick out a run from Llorente. 59 min: Joe Gomez is booked for a foul on Alvaro Morata in the centre-circle. Free kick for Atletico. 58 min: Mo Salah attempts to dribble through the defence from the right, but is unable to get past the portcullis. 57 min: Liverpool are trying to get the ball into the Atletico box from all angles but Atletico\u2019s defending has been little short of outstanding. To stand resolute in the face of this onslaught must be extremely mentally draining. 55 min: Firmino wins a corner after his delivery in to the Atletico penalty area is blocked by Llorente. Liverpool take the corner short, play it to Fabinho in front of the penalty area and his delivery into the box is blocked. 54 min: Vrsaljko gives away a free-kick after fouling Divock Origi out on the left wing. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery is decent on this occasion, but Atletico clear their lines. 53 min: Joe Gomez sends a cross from deep and this time it\u2019s a good one. Mo Salah skips between two defenders and heads a good scoring opportunity wide. 53 min: Jordan Henderons tries to send in a cross from the right but fails to clear the first defender. Liverpool are being forced wide, but can\u2019t get any quality crosses into the Atletico penalty area. 51 min: Liverpool win a free-kick wide on the right. Alexander-Arnold swings the ball towards the far post, where Llorente heads clear. 50 min: A bundle of energy on the touchline, Diego Simeone exhorts the crowd to get behind the home side. Meanwhile on the pitch, Liverpool concede a free-kick on the edge of the Atletico penalty area. 49 min: Sime Visaljko has the ball pulled his way in the Liverpool penalty area but is unable to sort his feet and fire off a shot in a decent area. 48 min: Fabinho loses the ball to Saul Niguez in midfield and the Atletico midfielder advances into the Liverpool half. Roberto Firmino is back to clear up. 47 min: Liverpool begin the second half as the ended the first, dominating possession and hopeful of doing something no team has ever done before in over 30 attempts - beating Atletico Madrid in a game in which Saul Niguez has scored. 46 min: The second half begins, with Divock Origi on for Sadio Mane in the Liverpool line-up. Marcos Llorente has replaced Thomas Lemar in the Atletico side. I suspect those changes are down to injuries, rather than any tactical reasons. Neither player was particularly poor in the first half. Elsewhere in Europe: It\u2019s scoreless between Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League encounter in Germany. Simon Burnton is keeping an eye on that one. Peep! The players go in for the break, with Atletico leading courtesy of Saul Niguez\u2019s early effort from close range. Liverpool have had more than 70% possession since going behind, but have yet to muster a shot on target. 45 min: The fourth official signals one minute of added time, which doesn\u2019t seem much considering the VAR check after the goal, the amount of time-wasting we\u2019ve had and a couple of pauses for injuries. 44 min: Angel Correa \u201cleaves one in\u201d on Jordan Henderson, earning himself a yellow card for his troubles. 43 min: Thomas Lemar sends Renan Lodi on his way down the left flank, but he runs down a dead end before he can send in a cross. 41 min: Sadio Mane is booked for catching Sime Vrsaljko around the head with an arm as he tussled for the ball with the Atletico right-back. 39 min: Liverpool continue to dominate, despite being behind. One suspects both managers will be happy enough with how things have gone so far, although I foresee a masterclass of the dark arts from Atletico in what remains of this first leg. Diego Simeone is already instructing his players and the stadium ball boys to waste as much time as possible. 36 min: Finally, a cross worthy of the name from Trent Alexander-Arnold, after he\u2019d created an angle for himself by taking a short(ish) corner. He sends the ball fizzing invitingly across the edge of the six-yard box but there\u2019s nobody there to attack it. 34 min: A Mo Salah shot that appeared to be arrowing towards the top corner takes a deflection off the head of Felipe and goes over the bar for a corner. 31 min: Unable to find a way through the massed ranks of Atletico defenders grouped between them and the goal, Liverpool are reduced to taking potshots and trying to get crosses in from the left and right. Atletico will be happy with that, not least because Trent Alexander-Arnold has yet to find his range. 31 min: Fabinho tries a shot from 25 yards out and looks on helplessly as the ball zooms high over the bar. 27 min: Jan Oblak fires a clearance straight to Mo Salah, who is caught by surprise and miscontrols the ball into the path of Roberto Firmino up ahead of him. He passes back to Salah, who fires into the gaping goal, but Firmino was offside upon receiving the ball. A let-off for Atletico. 25 min: Thomas Lemar relieves Alexander-Arnold and gallops down the left flank, before sending in a cross. Virgil van Dijk misjudges the flight of the ball, which comes to Alvaro Morata. He brings a decent save out of Alisson at his near post from a tight angle. That was a very good chance for Atletico to double their lead. 24 min: A Morata barge on Fabinho wins Liverpool a free-kick wide on the right. Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery is atrocious, failing to beat the first man. I think he might have put his boots on the wrong feet tonight - this is not like him at all. 23 min: Lodi appears to handle the ball just outside his own penalty area, but gets away with it. Atletico win a throw-in deep in their own territory, down near the corner flag. 22 min: Nothing comes of Atletico\u2019s second corner, Alisson ending up with the ball safely in his grasp. 20 min: Excellent defending from Robertson, who - facing his own goal - hooks a whipped Lodi cross out of play for a corner while facing his own goal, with Atletico\u2019s strikers either side of him. 18 min: Atletico get a chance to clear their lines as they win a goal kick. Jan Oblak kicks it long and Virgil van Dijk wins the header. 17 min: Liverpool continue to apply pressure, while Atletico have 11 men behind the ball in and around their own penalty area. A cross in to that penalty area from Andy Robertson is headed clear by Renan Lodi, the left-back. 15 min: Having taken an early lead, Atletico seem content to sit back and let Liverpool have the ball, restricting them to sending crosses in from the flanks. 15 min: Robertson gets on the ball out on the left, but his attempted pass to Gini Wijnaldum is cut out by Koke. 14 min: Another high \u201cshot\u201d over the bar from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who I think was trying to send a cross in from the right. 12 min: Stefan Savic heads the ball clear of his own penalty area, intercepting a Mo Salah cross. After a shaky start, Liverpool are starting to find their groove. 11 min: Teed up by Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold shoots high over the bar from about 25 yards out. 9 min: On the touchline, Diego Simeone, dressed from head to toe in trademark black, is ushered back to his technical area by the fourth official after wandering downfield to roar instructions at his strikers. 7 min: Niguez picks out Angel Correa with a free-kick from deep. Darting between two defenders, the striker latches on to the ball and squares the ball across the face of the Liverpool goal. There\u2019s nobody on hand to convert and Correa was offside anyway. Liverpool are asleep. That\u2019s twice they\u2019ve been caught napping inside the opening 10 minutes. 5 min: THere\u2019s a lengthy VAR check for offside but the goal stands. The corner came in from the right, the ball seemed to clank off the shins of Fabinho standing near the six-yard box and roll towards Liverpool\u2019s goal. Niguez was quickest to react, pouncing on the loose ball to fire past Alisson into the bottom left-hand corner from two or three yards out. Atletico go ahead! Saul Niguez stabs home from two yards out to put the home side a goal up. 3 min: Renan Lodi beats Trent Alexander-Arnold on the left flank with a drop of the shoulder and whips a terrific cross into the Liverpool penalty area. Morata gets a touch and the ball goes out for a corner. 2 min: The Wanda Metropolitano is a real cauldron as Virgil van Dijk tries to pick out Trent Alexander-Arnold with a long diagonal from the back. His pass is wayward and the ball is shepherded out of play for a goal kick. 1 min: Liverpool get the ball rolling, their players kitted out in charcoal grey shirts, shorts and socks. Atletico\u2019s wear their usual home kit of red and white stripes, blue shorts and red socks. Not long now: The teams make their way out of the tunnel on to the Wanda Metropolitano stadium, led by referee Szymon Marciniak and his team of match officials. They line up for the last of the pre-match niceties \u2013 a blast of the Champions League anthem and some handshakes \u2013 and kick-off is just a minute away. Jurgen Klopp speaks: \u201cA big fight,\u201d says Liverpool\u2019s manager, when asked what he\u2019s expecting tonight, by BT Sport\u2019s debonair and dishy pitch side reporter, Des Kelly. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone ever played Atleti and expected to get anything out of the game without a big fight. It\u2019s in their DNA, but it\u2019s in also our DNA. They\u2019re really strong, we know that, but we\u2019ve showed that we\u2019re not too bad at that either.\u201d Atletico Madrid: Oblak, Vrsaljko, Felipe, Savic, Renan Lodi, Saul, Koke, Thomas, Lemar, Morata, Correa. Subs: Adan, Gimenez, Llorente, Costa, Vitolo, Carrasco, Hermoso. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Keita, Adrian, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, Origi, Matip. Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) Not much in the way of surprises in Liverpool\u2019s line-up I don\u2019t think I\u2019m speaking out of turn when I say Jurgen Klopp has selected the team most Liverpool fans were expecting. No place in the Atletico side for Costa Angel Correa and Alvaro Morata start up front for the hosts, while Diego Costa has to settle for a place on the bench. Lend us your ears ... Jonathan Wilson, Flo Lloyd-Hughes and yours truly were in the studio alongside host Max Rushden for yesterday\u2019s episode of our Football Weekly podcast, while David Conn, Sid Lowe, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Nicky Bandini contributed from further afield. You can listen here and if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, sign up in all the usual podcast places. Diego Simeone speaks ... \u201cAs you know, we deal with things one game at a time here,\u201d said Atletico\u2019s manager. \u201cWe will cross each bridge when we get there. We are facing a magnificent team, well trained by a coach with a difference. He can play counter, possession, they are strong in the air. I have no doubt this Liverpool side will go down in history as a great team. They are different to teams we have admired in the past. They are intense, adaptable. Jurgen Klopp speaks ... \u201cThis is one of the most difficult fixtures in the life of a football player,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s manager during yesterday\u2019s pre-match press duties. \u201cAtl\u00e9tico are a really well organised, well-oiled machine who are amazing at squeezing results. They are in a transition period, that\u2019s normal, but they are fighting with all they have. It\u2019s really difficult. \u201cIf there\u2019s one team where you have to be at your absolute best, it\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico. They give you absolutely no presents. If you work as hard as possible, you have a chance. If you don\u2019t do that, you have no chance.\u201d An audience with Saul Niguez \u201cWe know how we can hurt Liverpool, their strengths and weaknesses, and we always compete against big teams,\u201d said Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez, in a wide-ranging interview with Sid Lowe. Atl\u00e9tico tackle Liverpool in battle of opposite Diego Simeone approaches this week\u2019s tie against a Liverpool team whose high-tempo pressing style has come to define the modern age finding his methods being seriously questioned for the first time, writes Jonathan Wilson ... Having been on the TOttenham HOtspur side that lost in last season\u2019s final against Liverpool, Kieran Trippier will have to make do with a view from the sidelines as he is currently recovering from groin surgery. The right-back was in St George\u2019s Park undergoing rehab last week, but this game has come too soon for him. Atl\u00e9tico will also be without their \u00a3113m summer signing Joao Felix, who has recovered from a muscle injury but has now been struck down by a virus affecting his tonsils. Hector Herrera is also expected to miss out, while Alvaro Morata and Diego Costa will be assessed ahead of today\u2019s game. Liverpool, by contrast, have practically a full squad to choose from, with Nathaniel Clyne and Xherdan Shaqiri constituting the entirety of their list of lame and halt. Their absence will be of little or no concern to Jurgen Klopp, who almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have considered either player for selection had they been fit. With the Premier League as good is in the bag, not that anyone at the club is prepared to admit it, Liverpool are more or less free to focus on retaining the Champions League title they won at the Wanda Metropolitano last season. They return to the scene of their sixth European triumph to face an Atl\u00e9tico Madrid side that are not in the best of form, fourth in La Liga with just one win in their past seven games in all competitions. Diego Simeone\u2019s side are no mugs, however, and will be hoping to Liverpool\u2019s first defeat in 11 knockout ties under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

Fresh vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and lean meats will all support a strong body.</p> <p>Look into biomarkers: anything that can indicate something about your health. Measuring these markers can help you to better understand your body and recognise when things seem out of balance. Talk to your doctor about starting with a full blood test to look at cholesterol, vitamin counts and organ function.</p> <p>You can also measure some of these markers on your own, and use online personal test and dashboard apps such as <a href=\"https://www.insidetracker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InsideTracker</a> or <a href=\"https://www.i-screen.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">i-screen</a>.

Treat yourself to these preventative therapies regularly for overall body and mind health.</p> <p>The great news is, if you have health insurance, you may be able to get a rebate for all these services. Health insurance covers more than just hospital visits. These days, you can enjoy all kinds of preventative healthcare, such as dental, optical, physio and massage.</p> <p>Just as you expect your devices, apps and fitness gear to work for you, so should your health fund. There are two types of health funds: those run to benefit investors and shareholders, and those run to benefit members. Look for options that put people before profits, and make sure you know how to choose the right fit.</p> <p>Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are designed to give back to members. There are funds for different occupations, regional areas and community groups, and you can find yours through websites such as the <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/find-a-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Members Health Fund Alliance</a>.</p> <p>Regularly assess and review your fund to make sure its focus is to give back to members \u2013 that\u2019s you.

But with so many options, how do you know you\u2019ve found the right fit and how do you know where your money would be best spent? Spend a few minutes to make sure you\u2019re using the best tools and understand the ways you can be supported in achieving your goals. Wear your fitness goals We know that even a few minutes of physical activity is good for us. Wearable tech makes it easier to keep track of how you\u2019re moving, whether you\u2019re getting your heart rate up, and what more you could be doing. Dedicated fitness devices such as Fitbit and Garmin Vivoactive take out some of the manual input, syncing automatically with tracking apps. If you like something fancier, smart watches have loads of features \u2013 and there are so many options you can afford to be choosy. For hardcore adventure, check out the Garmin Fenix series. Serious athletes can opt for a performance tracker and vest, complete with inbuilt GPS. If a brisk walk with your dog is more your style, a luxurious Fossil watch might suit. Today\u2019s best smartwatch models can perform lots of tricks, like searching the internet with your voice, tracking your location with GPS or even monitoring your heart rate to protect your overall health. Photograph: Halfpoint Images/Getty Images. Treat your body well Eating a healthy, balanced diet is vital to a long life. Fresh vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and lean meats will all support a strong body. Look into biomarkers: anything that can indicate something about your health. Measuring these markers can help you to better understand your body and recognise when things seem out of balance. Talk to your doctor about starting with a full blood test to look at cholesterol, vitamin counts and organ function. You can also measure some of these markers on your own, and use online personal test and dashboard apps such as InsideTracker or i-screen. Otherwise, pharmacies often have free blood pressure checks, while your wearable or smart watch probably has a heart rate tracker built in. As an added bonus, a healthy diet is also better for the environment, which is good for everyone. Track your health data over time and monitor your progress with the online i-screen dashboard. Photograph: i-screen. Focus on preventative health measures (and get money back) Getting a massage, going to the physio or getting a chiro treatment shouldn\u2019t just be reserved for when you\u2019re injured. Treat yourself to these preventative therapies regularly for overall body and mind health. The great news is, if you have health insurance, you may be able to get a rebate for all these services. Health insurance covers more than just hospital visits. These days, you can enjoy all kinds of preventative healthcare, such as dental, optical, physio and massage. Just as you expect your devices, apps and fitness gear to work for you, so should your health fund. There are two types of health funds: those run to benefit investors and shareholders, and those run to benefit members. Look for options that put people before profits, and make sure you know how to choose the right fit. Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are designed to give back to members. There are funds for different occupations, regional areas and community groups, and you can find yours through websites such as the Members Health Fund Alliance. Regularly assess and review your fund to make sure its focus is to give back to members \u2013 that\u2019s you. You\u2019ll usually find it means extra money in your pocket. Sleep Cycle analyses your sleep and wakes you up at the most perfect time, feeling rested. Photograph: Sleep Cycle. Track your fitness goals Whatever your healthy lifestyle choices, there\u2019s an app to help you stay focused. Most apps sync with wearables, but if that\u2019s not for you, they also have manual options. If you\u2019re just starting out, apps such as Couch to 5K can ease you into a healthier lifestyle and encourage you along the way. MyFitnessPal is a simple way to monitor food intake, while Sleep Cycle will let you know if you\u2019re getting quality sleep. For a more complete program, opt for an app that covers exercise regimes, food and mental wellbeing. Apple Health allows you to collate and organise all your data (including third party) in one place, around activity, mindfulness, sleep and nutrition. Strava is a popular choice for runners and cyclists, or check out Centr, which has the added bonus of Chris \u201cThor\u201d Hemsworth. The be.come project is holistic, with a focus on loving how you feel. If you\u2019re into weightlifting, Strong will keep you motivated, while Yoga Studio is ideal for those of us who like a good stretch. And if you want something a little different, Zombies, Run! will help you stay fit while you outrun the apocalypse.

Anybody who wants to hire a Lithuanian nanny will have to pay them \u00a3500 a week \u2013 and make sure the taxman knows about it. Welcome to the government\u2019s new points-based immigration system, which will administer the biggest structural change to the UK labour market in decades when it comes into force next year. The new policy represents a break with the past and is highly interventionist. As a member of the European Union, the government was only able to limit migration from non-EU countries. Under the new approach, the UK will be open to highly skilled workers from anywhere in the world, but the door to those with low skills will be closed. Absent from the government\u2019s new strategy document is the idea that migration will be reduced to the tens of thousands, the target Theresa May tried and failed to achieve first as home secretary under David Cameron and then as prime minister herself. Instead, workers from overseas will be welcomed provided they can clear the high bar set for them by the new immigration rules. To be eligible to apply to come to the UK, an overseas citizen will need to secure 70 points and for that they will require a job offer (20 points), be applying for a skilled job (20 points), be able to speak English (10 points) and \u2013 in most cases \u2013 be enjoying a salary of \u00a325,600 or above (20 points). The thinking behind the strategy is that the UK\u2019s economic model needs to change. Real wages \u2013 earnings adjusted for the impact of inflation \u2013 have only just topped the level they were at when Britain slid into recession in 2008. Employment is at record levels but investment and productivity have been exceptionally weak. Ministers think employers would rather employ cheap workers from eastern Europe than invest in the new equipment that would make them more efficient. Employers are not going to like the government\u2019s new policy blueprint for creating \u201ca high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy\u201d. Lobby groups will say that the more stringent approach will affect everything from fruit-picking to distribution centres, from retailing to the care sector. There have already been warnings that the upshot of the new approach will be labour shortages, less good care for the elderly and higher prices for consumers. And the government\u2019s response? \u201cUK businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement, and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points-based system,\u201d the policy document says. \u201cAs such, it is important that employers move away from a reliance on the UK\u2019s immigration system as an alternative to investment in staff retention, productivity and wider investment in technology and automation.\u201d Suck it up, in other words. The squeeze on living standards since the financial crisis has made migration a much more potent issue and was one of the main factors behind the leave vote in the 2016 referendum. The new points-based immigration approach recognises the need to address those concerns, making it clear that the political motivation for the radical change is to deliver on the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto commitment to \u201ctake back control of our borders\u201d following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. But taking back control is not the same as pulling up the drawbridge. Ministers believe voters do not object to immigration as such; they merely want the government to be able to regulate the numbers.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is to close its borders to unskilled workers and those who can\u2019t speak English as part of a fundamental overhaul of immigration laws that will end the era of cheap EU labour in factories, warehouses, hotels and restaurants. Unveiling its Australian-style points system on Wednesday, the government will say it is grasping a unique opportunity to take \u201cfull control\u201d of British borders \u201cfor the first time in decades\u201d and eliminate the \u201cdistortion\u201d caused by EU freedom of movement. But industry leaders immediately accused the government of an assault on the economy warning of \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences with job losses and closures in factories and the high street. Labour and the Liberal Democrats also condemned the plans while Unison, which represents health workers said they \u201cspell absolute disaster for the care sector\u201d. However, ministers argue they are delivering the Brexit demanded by the electorate \u2013 and say it is time for businesses to wean themselves off cheap migrant labour. A 10-page briefing document outlining the new immigration policy states: \u2022 UK borders will be closed to non-skilled workers \u2013 and all migrants will have to speak English. \u2022 Anyone wanting to come to the UK to work must have a job offer with a salary threshold of \u00a325,600 \u2013 though a salary \u201cfloor\u201d of \u00a320,480 will be acceptable in special cases where there might have a skills shortage skills, such as in nursing. \u2022 There will be no route for self-employed people coming into the UK, spelling the end to, for example, Polish plumbers or Romanian builders arriving without a job. \u2022 Border control will no longer accept ID cards from countries such as France and Italy. This, it is understood, is an attempt to clamp down on non-EU workers beating the system with forged or stolen ID cards. \u2022 The skills threshold for foreign nationals wanting to work in the UK will be lowered from degree to A-levels or their equivalent. The cap on the numbers of skilled workers is being scrapped \u2013 and a small number of highly skilled workers will be allowed to come in without a job. \u2022 The right of artists, entertainers, sports people and musicians to enter for performances, competitions and auditions will be retained. The government intends to launch a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d campaign to prepare employers for the transformation in January next year when EU citizens will be treated the same as other nationals. However, the new policy drew immediate criticism from employers, particularly over the addition of waiters, waitresses and \u201celementary\u201d agriculture and fishery workers to the list of low-skilled workers. Industry leaders warned the changes would have a huge impact on food processing factories that rely heavily on EU workers to keep the supermarket shelves full with pre-packed chicken, beef and pork cuts. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said: \u201cJobs the government considers \u2018low-skilled\u2019 are vital to wellbeing and business growth. The announcement threatens to shut out the people we need to provide services the public rely on. \u201cWe need access to workers that can help us look after the elderly, build homes and keep the economy strong.\u201d UKHospitality chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said \u201cruling out a temporary, low-skilled route for migration in just 10 months\u2019 time would be disastrous for the hospitality sector and the British people\u201d and deter investment in the high street. The Confederation of British Industry director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the removal of the cap on the number of skilled workers was \u201cwelcome\u201d, but she warned that in \u201csome sectors, firms would be left wondering how they would recruit the people needed to run their businesses. \u201cWith already low unemployment, firms in care, construction, hospitality, food and drink could be most affected,\u201d she said. The hospitality sector will also be hit with no \u201cbarista visa\u201d for coffee shops, despite warnings from Pret A Manger two years ago that only one in 50 job applicants were British. Also vulnerable are hotels that rely on EU workers for cleaning, kitchen and chambermaid staff, and big business and homes who rely on EU workers for cleaning, security and housekeeping. Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the demand for immigrants to speak English was \u201cdog-whistle stuff\u201d. \u201cMost people who come here to work can already speak English,\u201d she said. \u201cBut are we really going to block maths geniuses whose English isn\u2019t great? It\u2019s inhumane and damaging.\u201d She continued: \u201cUltimately, it will also be very difficult to attract the workers we need at all skill levels while the Tories\u2019 hostile environment is in place. It needs to go.\u201d Partners at the immigration law firm Fragomen urged the government not to close the borders overnight and to reduce the cost of visas for the new era migrant. \u201cIf it comes to a point where it is harder to access labour then don\u2019t turn off the tap overnight. Give people time to adjust. Please make the system cheaper \u2013 it is just ridiculously expensive,\u201d said Ian Robinson, a partner at the firm and a former policy official at the Home Office. But with its 80-strong majority, the government can deliver on its new policy with a immigration bill expected to ease through parliament in the coming months. \u201cUK businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement, and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points-based system,\u201d said the government in a briefing paper.

But even with these migrant employees, there\u2019s still way too few care workers to meet demand.\u201d The UK Homecare Association said care firms would be dismayed by the new policy. \u201cCutting off the supply of prospective care workers will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care. Telling employers to adjust, in a grossly underfunded care system, is simply irresponsible.\u201d Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, said the new policy would \u201ctip some businesses over the edge\u201d and \u201cfailed to provide any strategy to secure and sustain key industries\u201d. He added: \u201cScapegoating migrants and playing to the gallery may get some cheap headlines, but it\u2019s wrong and put whole sectors \u2013 such as social care and food, not to mention the NHS \u2013 at risk.\u201d Mark Harrison, a policy manager at the Food and Drink Federation, said low-paid workers could not be immediately replaced by the use of automation and technology: \u201cThe benefits of such innovations will not be felt overnight and some food chain roles remain challenging to automate.\u201d",

We defended really well. Of course very difficult in Paris because they have world-class players, but I think we can do it. It would mean a lot to go through.

We thought they had defensive problems, but we didn\u2019t create many chances. We weren\u2019t really sharp in the last 20m and we can see a little bit of fatigue.

Just acting like professional football players, as good as we can, and we\u2019ll see in the second leg. Pressure is there every day.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. Borussia Dortmund have a special group of players, a few of whom will presumably be ripped from their clutches in the summer. Enjoy them while you can. Bye! Emre Can talks to BT Sport: Really important. I think it was a big statement from the team, but we know it\u2019s not the end, it\u2019s just half-time. We\u2019ll have a very difficult game in Paris, but we have to continue like that. We didn\u2019t change that much [defensively], just everybody knew what he had to do. We didn\u2019t change anything. We did it very well as a team and if we continue like that it will be very difficult to score against us. A big compliment to the team. Of course [Haaland] is a great footballer and scores a lot of goals, but he\u2019s also a great guy. A little bit crazy I think, funny, and hopefully will continue like that. [To win the tie] I think we have to play like today. It was a good example of how we can play. We defended really well. Of course very difficult in Paris because they have world-class players, but I think we can do it. It would mean a lot to go through. Nobody expects it from us against Paris, but we have a good team and a young team and I hope we will do it in the second game. Andy Brassell was at Signal Iduna Park tonight. Here\u2019s his report: In the third season of Project Paris, it was finally set up for Neymar to be the belle of the Champions League ball. It was supposed to be his night. Yet few can hold back the tide that is Erling Haaland these days. Without transforming the team the Norwegian significantly adjusted Borussia Dortmund\u2019s fortunes and swept them to a heady victory over the returning Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 in classic teenage style, late to rise before injecting the night with drama. Much more here: Thomas Meunier has a chat: It was really difficult, really intense. It was very demanding physically. Obviously, maybe we deserved the draw but Dortmund were very good. They played like a home team, they didn\u2019t lose one game here at home this season and we saw today it is so difficult. We thought they had defensive problems, but we didn\u2019t create many chances. We weren\u2019t really sharp in the last 20m and we can see a little bit of fatigue. We\u2019ve played nearly 15 games since the beginning of January and you saw it tonight. It was really quiet by our side. I think we just have to be focused. Take care of our rest. Just acting like professional football players, as good as we can, and we\u2019ll see in the second leg. Pressure is there every day. That\u2019s professional football and when we have such a team, we just have to prove every game that we are the best. Today it wasn\u2019t really our best game but I have a lot of hope for the second game. An excellent performance from Borussia Dortmund, who look so bright and lively, and in Erling Haaland have a striker in astonishing, record-smashing form. A disappointing performance from PSG, who have enough ability in attack to magic up a goal anyway. 90+3 mins: The corner is headed over the bar, and that\u2019s it! 90+2 mins: Nine seconds of the two minutes to go, and Marquinhos\u2019s shot goes wide. Deflected, says the referee. 90+1 mins: This referee isn\u2019t a fan of stoppage time. There was none at all in the first half, and there\u2019ll be just two minutes in the second. 90 mins: Sancho goes off, apparently with a slight limp, and Marcel Schmeltzer comes on. 89 mins: Another booking, this time Verratti. He and Meunier will both miss the second leg because of their bookings. 87 mins: Thomas Meunier is booked for pulling Reyna down. 87 mins: Borussia give the ball away and Neymar checks onto his right foot and curls in a shot that would probably have gone in had a defender not been standing in the way. 86 mins: Another chance for Dortmund, but Sancho plays in Hakimi, who from an acute angle shoots well wide of the far post. 86 mins: Haaland\u2019s second actually clipped the post on its way in. Tremendous. [Later update after watching further replays: no it didn\u2019t] 84 mins: Can is taken out by Verratti and stays down, forcing a brief stoppage. 83 mins: Sancho beats Verratti, checks back, tries to beat Verratti again and loses the ball. Once was probably enough. 82 mins: Neymar hits the post! A long cross from the left is headed back across goal, is allowed to bobble about a bit, and Neymar latches onto the loose ball and pummels a shot against the outside of the post! 81 mins: That was just outrageous from Haaland. His first was a bit lucky, and converted from about two yards. That, though, was a magnificent strike. And here\u2019s a fine fact: Haaland nearly takes the net off with a left-footed cannonball from 20 yards that gave Navas no chance at all! 77 mins: I\u2019m not sure what that was from Zagadou, but it wasn\u2019t good. Pablo Sarabia has come on for Di Maria. An equaliser! Mbapp\u00e9 sprints into the area, past a really wild challenge from Zagadou that hindered his own teammates rather than his opponent, and slides the ball across goal for Neymar to tap in! 74 mins: An excellent spell of play for Borussia, with Sancho constantly offering himself, teasing opponents and making himself an all-round menace. Eventually Hakimi tries a cross, which deflects to Navas. It\u2019s that man again! A fine move, a good cross from the right, Guerreiro\u2019s shot deflects kindly into the path of Haaland, and he pokes in! 67 mins: At the end of PSG\u2019s best few minutes of the match by a distance Borussia make their first change: Giovanni Reyna comes on, replacing Thorgan Hazard. 67 mins: Neymar\u2019s chipped pass from the left is only just too long for Di Maria, who was bursting unchecked into the area. 66 mins: And another! Mbapp\u00e9 exchanges passes with Neymar and slams a right-footed shot towards goal, which Burki saves! 65 mins: A shot on target! From a PSG player! Mbapp\u00e9 has a pop, but it\u2019s from an impossible angle and Burki gathers at the second attempt. 62 mins: Piszczek gives the ball away to Kurzawa and runs after him for about 50 yards, constantly attempting tactical fouls. The full-back does excellently to hold him off and admirably to stay on his feet, but at the end of all that he hits a wild pass straight into touch. 59 mins: Another booking for a foul on Witsel. This time it\u2019s Neymar, who seems to jab an elbow into the Belgian\u2019s jaw, normally a red-card offence but there is so little force that a sending-off would have been a bit disproportionate. 57 mins: Haaland controls Can\u2019s long, high pass and escapes from his marker, but Marquinhos comes round to cover the danger and clear the ball. 54 mins: PSG have survived the storm, it seems. Gueye however gets booked for a foul on Witsel. 50 mins: And close again! Haaland robs Kimpembe and runs goalwards, but rather than crack a shot with his right foot he tries to cut onto his left, and is crowded out. 50 mins: Close! Sancho taps the ball across goal from just to the right, but it finds a white shirt when anyone in yellow would have had a tap-in. 49 mins: Hakimi flies past Kurzawa and into space on the right. He carries the ball into the area but too close to goal, and Navas comes out to deflect the pull-back out of play. 47 mins: Sancho gives the ball to Mbapp\u00e9 on the halfway line, and for a moment the Frenchman threatens to skip away beyond the defence. But then he doesn\u2019t. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! PSG get the second half under way. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ve particularly dissatisfied with this scoreline, but so far they\u2019ve been much closer to falling behind than to going ahead. The PSG players are back in the tunnel. Thiago Silva appears to be leading an animated discussion about something. 45 mins: Just three seconds of stoppage time at the end of a first half played at a high tempo and with frequent outbreaks of skilfulness, but with little by way of goal threat. Borussia have had more pace and endeavour, and been the more impressive side by a distance. 44 mins: Witsel wins the day\u2019s first yellow card, halting a PSG break with an overly enthusiastic shoulder charge on Di Maria. 40 mins: PSG have done pretty much nothing interesting or useful in the attacking third. Borussia are getting numbers back when required, holding a highish line, compressing play, and the visitors haven\u2019t found a way through the crowd. 36 mins: Another threatening Borussia break. Can roars down the middle, with Haaland to his right and Sancho to his left; he goes left, Sancho crosses and it flicks off the top of Haaland\u2019s head on its way out of play. 35 mins: Another optimistic shot from Borussia, Haaland slapping an effort wide of the near post from just inside the penalty area. 33 mins: Verratti tries another of his chipped through-balls, this time towards Neymar. Hakimi gets back, nips in front of him and ushers the ball out of play, to which Neymar responds by shoving him in the back and then trying to kick him. 31 mins: Hazard tries to cross from the right but hits it straight into Kurzawa. Sancho, on the other side, is another level of dangerous at present. 27 mins: Save! Sancho curls a shot across goal and Navas, at full strength, pushes it away! 25 mins: Can vaguely touches Di Maria in the back, and the Argentinian goes down as if assaulted. He gets a free-kick, but the referee keeps his cards in his pocket. 24 mins: Sancho bursts into the box and cracks in a low cross, but Navas gets down and holds it. Not much by way of goalmouth action and a little too much free-kick shopping, but this has been a promising first quarter. 21 mins: Penalty shout! Hakimi pulls the ball back to Can, in space on the edge of the area, but he takes an imperfect touch and Verratti gets back to stick a leg out and poke the ball away from him. Can goes down, but there was no foul. 19 mins: Zagadou wins the ball, carries it elegantly into midfield and then, under no pressure, passes straight to a white shirt. Then Can brings down Neymar, who rolls around a lot. 14 mins: Chance for Borussia! PSG have a corner, but Haaland heads it clear and suddenly the home side break. A few seconds later it\u2019s five against three, but rather than pass to one of his teammates Sancho carries it to the edge of the area and then scuffs a shot wide. 13 mins: Guerreiro has Borussia\u2019s first shot. It\u2019s from 30 yards out, and it\u2019s pretty useless, but it\u2019s a start. 11 mins: Neymar takes the free-kick, but curls it a yard or so wide of the near post. 10 mins: Neymar carries the ball from left to right, and after a mistimed challenge comes in he goes down. Quite a long time after. He clearly wasn\u2019t brought down in any reasonable interpretation of the phrase, but the referee buys it. 7 mins: Dortmund push up, and Verratti tries to punish them by chipping the ball through to Mbapp\u00e9, but the striker is narrowly offside. 4 mins: Di Maria tries to dispossess Can with a sliding tackle, but never gets within two yards of either man or ball. It really is as pointless an attempted challenge as you\u2019ll ever see. 2 mins: Haaland passes back to Sancho from the halfway line and then sprints forward, and for a moment a pass beyond the defence would have released him, but the ball instead goes right to Hakimi. Haaland is unimpressed. 1 min: An early reducer from Kurzawa, who slides in from behind to bring Hakimi down, wide on Borussia\u2019s right. 1 min: Peeeeeep! The home side get the game started! They\u2019re out, hands have been shaken and coin tossed. It\u2019s football time! Well, very nearly. The players are in the tunnel! Kick-off in five minutes or somesuch. \u201cThe Question: Is Marquinhos the new Marcel Desailly?\u201d ponders Christopher Faherty, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe this and anticipate him to be playing centre half regularly before the next World Cup.\u201d I do enjoy a late-career positional shift. Marquinhos is no Paul Warhurst, but still, good effort. Here, meanwhile, is their handy illustration of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s starting line-up: Uefa\u2019s official teamsheet has PSG in a 4-3-3 formation, thus: Thomas Tuchel has confirmed that PSG will not be playing 4-4-2 tonight, though whether they line up as 3-4-3 or 4-3-3 remains to be seen. There\u2019s definitely a front three. I think. The night\u2019s first key question: does Rio Ferdinand always have such a glittery beard? Some Borussia-based news from earlier: the club announced the permanent signing of Emre Can, who has agreed a four-and-a-half-year contract. He had joined on loan from Juventus last month with an option to buy for \u00a321m. The team sheets are in, and the names upon them are these: Borussia Dortmund: Burki, Piszczek, Hummels, Zagadou, Hakimi, Can, Witsel, Guerreiro, Sancho, Haland, Hazard. Subs: Dahoud, Gotze, Schulz, Akanji, Schmelzer, Reyna, Hitz. Paris Saint-Germain: Navas, Meunier, Thiago Silva, Kimpembe, Kurzawa, Gueye, Marquinhos, Verratti, Di Maria, Mbappe, Neymar. Subs: Kehrer, Cavani, Sergio Rico, Icardi, Sarabia, Draxler, Nianzou Kouassi. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz. Hello world! Will this finally be the year for Paris Saint-Germain?

In the opening moments \u00c1ngel Correa slipped away from Andy Robertson on the Atl\u00e9tico right and the impressive Renan Lodi did likewise to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the left. Dangerous crosses followed from both and, though Virgil van Dijk headed Lodi\u2019s delivery away from \u00c1lvaro Morata, he conceded an avoidable corner when Atl\u00e9tico returned the ball into the Liverpool area. Koke took it, Morata missed it, but the midfielder\u2019s cross struck Fabinho on the shins and rolled perfectly for Sa\u00fal to convert beyond Alisson from close range. A lengthy VAR check threatened to spoil the wild celebrations but with Van Dijk playing Sa\u00fal onside, the goal stood. An early, slender advantage was sufficient for Atl\u00e9tico to retreat and invite Liverpool to play round their compact 4-4-2 formation. The visitors\u2019 composure and performance inevitably improved yet the home side continued to cut through Liverpool\u2019s defence with ease. Robertson had to produce an acrobatic and vital interception to prevent Morata converting at the back post after Lodi threaded a superb cross behind Liverpool\u2019s central defenders. The former Chelsea striker was then released in space down the left and, having cut back inside Fabinho for a low angled shot, he was denied by the legs of Alisson. Liverpool dominated possession as the first half progressed \u2013 they were allowed to \u2013 but were contained by a disciplined Atl\u00e9tico rearguard. The visitors\u2019 first chance came from a miskick by Jan Oblak straight to Mohamed Salah. The Egypt forward exchanged passes with Roberto Firmino before scoring but the Brazilian was clearly offside when receiving the ball and the equaliser was disallowed. Robertson shot wide from 20 yards with his right foot as Liverpool resorted to trying their luck from distance and, when Salah did find space inside the Atl\u00e9tico area, his drive was headed over by Felipe. Man\u00e9, booked moments before the interval after a tussle with Sime Vrsaljko, failed to reappear for the second half as Klopp introduced Divock Origi into an arena he will always cherish. Simeone made an interval switch too, replacing Thomas Lemar with Marcos Llorente, and the Atl\u00e9tico substitute almost made an immediate impact when creating an excellent chance for Vrsaljko. The right-back was unmarked, Llorente\u2019s assist was inviting, but the ball somehow squirmed under the defender\u2019s foot and Liverpool were reprieved. Salah was close to punishing the miss when he ghosted in between Vrsaljko and Stefan Savic to connect with an excellent Joe Gomez cross. He found power with a header but not accuracy and the effort flew wide of Oblak\u2019s right-hand post. Morata missed a better chance to extend the home side\u2019s lead when teed up by Lodi. The striker was perfectly placed for the left-back\u2019s cross but lost his footing as he shaped to shoot. Jordan Henderson almost levelled with a late volley wide but Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s victory was merited. It was celebrated wildly too although, as Klopp was quick to point out, this is not over. With Liverpool it never is.",

      "body": "<p>Lewis Ludlam is nothing if not passionate. Whether you consider his military metaphors before England\u2019s Calcutta Cup victory to be inappropriate or innocuous, malice was not his motivation. Rather, Ludlam wears his heart on his sleeve, belting out the national anthem and, as he admits, buzzing with excitement the moment he learns he has made the starting lineup.</p> <p>If the backlash against his comments was part of his learning curve off the field, he continues his swift progress on it. Against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/murrayfield-atmosphere-rising-noise-bile-spite-rugby-union-six-nations-england-scotland\">Scotland</a> Ludlam made only his fourth England start and his first in the Six Nations, but he made his considerable presence felt in a callow back-row alongside the 23-year-old Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, 21. They combined to get the edge at the breakdown and ultimately get England\u2019s Six Nations campaign back on track.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/18/wales-expect-france-to-at-the-scrum-says-wyn-jones\">Wales expect France to cheat at the scrum, says prop Wyn Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eddie Jones has clearly been taken by the all-action Ludlam, having been so impressed by him last summer when he was a late call-up to the England squad preparing to face the Barbarians. The feeling seems mutual judging by the flanker\u2019s willingness to echo his coach\u2019s fighting talk. You get the sense that Ludlam has this week been advised not to mention the war but his enthusiasm again shines through when addressing Ireland\u2019s visit to Twickenham on Sunday for a contest that looks certain to define England\u2019s Six Nations season.</p> <p>Victory keeps their title hopes alive \u2013 all the more so if Wales do them a favour against France 24 hours earlier \u2013 and Ludlam is convinced it is within England\u2019s grasp. \u201cAs a team and as players we are always looking at hunting other teams down and scraping out wins and that has always been my mindset,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to impose ourselves on other teams and we will try and do that as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if England can still win what would be their first Six Nations title since 2017, Ludlam adds: \u201cAbsolutely, yes. We back ourselves. We always back ourselves, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be out there. We have full belief in the team. It would be a hard thing to do but we\u2019re aware of the ability we have in the team.\u201d</p> <p>Having made his mark against Scotland, Ludlam will be hoping to keep his place on Sunday. Jones, mindful of the Scots\u2019 breakdown threat, opted to effectively go with three openside flankers and while Courtney Lawes could return against Ireland, or Ben Earl may be given a first start, Ludlam would be unfortunate if he were to drop to the bench.</p> <p>\u201cI get revved up as soon as I know the team,\u201d Ludlam says. \u201cAfter it\u2019s announced I\u2019m buzzing and ready. I\u2019m thinking about situations and being involved in the game. But the moment I get really pumped up is during the anthems. That\u2019s when my emotions are really high. The hairs stand up on the back of my neck and that\u2019s when you really know you\u2019re in it. That\u2019s when it gets surreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/18/brian-odriscoll-accuses-eddie-jones-scaremongering-six-nations-england-ireland\">Brian O'Driscoll accuses Eddie Jones of 'scaremongering' in Six Nations barb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, but there\u2019s a fine line between being excited and having the emotion drain you. I haven\u2019t felt drained in games yet but I\u2019m fully aware that the lads who have played in the shirt for a long time have learned how to control their emotions and how to switch them on and off. I\u2019m excited early on but I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on.\u201d</p> <p>The back-row challenge awaiting whichever trio Jones opts for is formidable, all the more so with Curry still learning on the job at No 8 in the absence of the injured Billy Vunipola. Indeed, Ireland\u2019s CJ Stander has been among the best performers of the championship so far, particularly against Wales when he excelled in unison with Josh van der Flier and Peter O\u2019Mahony.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you play the game \u2013 to challenge yourself against the best,\u201d says Ludlam. \u201cTom was awesome in Edinburgh. It just goes to show what a great player he is. He received a lot of criticism for the France game but has worked really hard to get things right. To put out that performance at the weekend is testament to him, so I\u2019m really happy for him. He\u2019s hungry to learn.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lewis Ludlam is nothing if not passionate. Whether you consider his military metaphors before England\u2019s Calcutta Cup victory to be inappropriate or innocuous, malice was not his motivation. Rather, Ludlam wears his heart on his sleeve, belting out the national anthem and, as he admits, buzzing with excitement the moment he learns he has made the starting lineup. If the backlash against his comments was part of his learning curve off the field, he continues his swift progress on it. Against Scotland Ludlam made only his fourth England start and his first in the Six Nations, but he made his considerable presence felt in a callow back-row alongside the 23-year-old Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, 21. They combined to get the edge at the breakdown and ultimately get England\u2019s Six Nations campaign back on track. Eddie Jones has clearly been taken by the all-action Ludlam, having been so impressed by him last summer when he was a late call-up to the England squad preparing to face the Barbarians. The feeling seems mutual judging by the flanker\u2019s willingness to echo his coach\u2019s fighting talk. You get the sense that Ludlam has this week been advised not to mention the war but his enthusiasm again shines through when addressing Ireland\u2019s visit to Twickenham on Sunday for a contest that looks certain to define England\u2019s Six Nations season. Victory keeps their title hopes alive \u2013 all the more so if Wales do them a favour against France 24 hours earlier \u2013 and Ludlam is convinced it is within England\u2019s grasp. \u201cAs a team and as players we are always looking at hunting other teams down and scraping out wins and that has always been my mindset,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to impose ourselves on other teams and we will try and do that as much as possible.\u201d Asked if England can still win what would be their first Six Nations title since 2017, Ludlam adds: \u201cAbsolutely, yes. We back ourselves. We always back ourselves, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be out there. We have full belief in the team. It would be a hard thing to do but we\u2019re aware of the ability we have in the team.\u201d Having made his mark against Scotland, Ludlam will be hoping to keep his place on Sunday. Jones, mindful of the Scots\u2019 breakdown threat, opted to effectively go with three openside flankers and while Courtney Lawes could return against Ireland, or Ben Earl may be given a first start, Ludlam would be unfortunate if he were to drop to the bench. \u201cI get revved up as soon as I know the team,\u201d Ludlam says. \u201cAfter it\u2019s announced I\u2019m buzzing and ready. I\u2019m thinking about situations and being involved in the game. But the moment I get really pumped up is during the anthems. That\u2019s when my emotions are really high. The hairs stand up on the back of my neck and that\u2019s when you really know you\u2019re in it. That\u2019s when it gets surreal. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, but there\u2019s a fine line between being excited and having the emotion drain you. I haven\u2019t felt drained in games yet but I\u2019m fully aware that the lads who have played in the shirt for a long time have learned how to control their emotions and how to switch them on and off. I\u2019m excited early on but I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m working on.\u201d The back-row challenge awaiting whichever trio Jones opts for is formidable, all the more so with Curry still learning on the job at No 8 in the absence of the injured Billy Vunipola. Indeed, Ireland\u2019s CJ Stander has been among the best performers of the championship so far, particularly against Wales when he excelled in unison with Josh van der Flier and Peter O\u2019Mahony. \u201cThat\u2019s why you play the game \u2013 to challenge yourself against the best,\u201d says Ludlam. \u201cTom was awesome in Edinburgh. It just goes to show what a great player he is. He received a lot of criticism for the France game but has worked really hard to get things right. To put out that performance at the weekend is testament to him, so I\u2019m really happy for him. He\u2019s hungry to learn.\u201d",

Just hours after the seven men and five women of the jury began deliberating their verdict on Tuesday, they began asking the judge at the New York supreme court a series of detailed questions. They wanted to see copies of all emails where \u201ccertain women\u2019s names are highlighted in red\u201d. The request was likely to have been directed particularly at Annabella Sciorra, the Sopranos actor who is one of the central witnesses in the case. She is key to the most serious charge that the Pulp Fiction producer is facing \u2013 that he engaged in \u201cpredatory sexual assault\u201d against more than one woman, which carries a potential life sentence. Over the course of the five-week trial, the court heard that Weinstein had run a \u201cred-flag\u201d list of women who he feared might go public with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Emails presented to the jury showed that Sciorra appeared on the list with her name highlighted in red. Weinstein, 67, instructed an investigator who he employed to look into potential accusers: \u201cThe red flags are the first to call.\u201d The jury has also asked to see a floor plan of Weinstein\u2019s Soho apartment where he is alleged to have forced oral sex on another key witness, Miriam Haley. A former Project Runway production assistant, Haley has accused the disgraced film producer of luring her to the apartment in 2006 where he allegedly forced oral sex on her. The seven men and five women on the jury have a formidable decision to make in considering whether or not to find Weinstein guilty of rape and sexual assault. Their verdict, which must be unanimous, could have monumental consequences. If they find Weinstein guilty he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. If they acquit, the failure to secure a conviction against a man who has been accused of alleged sexual misconduct by more than 100 women will send waves of shock, anger and dismay throughout the fledgling #MeToo cause that was largely triggered by revelations involving Weinstein in 2017. The jury\u2019s inquiry about the red-highlighted names and the footprint of Weinstein\u2019s apartment suggest they are following the judge\u2019s instructions and beginning with the first of the five counts the defendant is facing: predatory sexual assault. For a conviction on this count, the jury would have to find Weinstein guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of sexually attacking both Haley and Sciorra. Sciorra gave harrowing testimony in which she described allegedly having her hands pinned above her head as she was held down on a bed and violently raped in her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter of 1993-94. If the jury finds Weinstein not guilty on the Sciorra part of the charge, they will then go on to consider Haley\u2019s allegations on their own merits, and can convict Weinstein for attacking her under count two \u2013 criminal sexual act. That carries a maximum sentence of 25 years. Once Haley\u2019s testimony is deliberated, the jury has been instructed to move on to the rape allegations raised by the second of the two main accusers in the case. This relates to a witness who the Guardian is not naming because her wishes over identification are not known. She alleges she was raped by Weinstein in a New York hotel, for which he has been charged with rape in the first and third degrees, which carry a maximum sentence of 25 years. Once again, the jury will begin by considering the woman\u2019s rape accusations alongside those of Sciorra. If Weinstein is found guilty of both, the jury will convict him on count three \u2013 another charge of predatory sexual assault. If Sciorra\u2019s allegations fall, then again jurors will move on to consider the unnamed woman\u2019s rape claims on their own merits. In counts four and five, Weinstein could be found guilty either of rape in the first or the third degree. The charge sheet makes for complicated parsing. Within an hour of being sent out of the courtroom to begin deliberations, the jury was brought back in again, having sent a series of questions to Burke seeking clarification. Before the jury was brought into court on Tuesday, a furious row erupted between the two teams of lawyers. A prosecutor accused Weinstein\u2019s lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, of jury tampering by publishing an opinion article in Newsweek over the weekend. In the article, Rotunno repeated the complaint made by the defense several times in the course of the trial: that the proceedings were rigged against the defendant. She railed at hostile media coverage, including mockery of Weinstein\u2019s arriving in court each day leaning on a walking frame. In a highly unusual move, Rotunno went on to address individual members of the Weinstein jury directly. \u201cI implore the members of this jury to do what they know is right and was expected of them from the moment they were called upon to serve their civic duty in a court of law,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHarvey Weinstein is innocent.\u201d The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, ripped into Rotunno. \u201cIt is completely, 100%, inappropriate behavior that borders on tampering with the jury,\u201d she said. Rotunno, who has made a number of extremely controversial comments in the course of the trial and has been admonished by the judge on numerous occasions not to speak to the media, insisted that her article was \u201cnot a letter to the jury, it is an op-ed of my feelings about the jury system as a whole\u201d. The judge presiding over the trial at the New York supreme court, James Burke,\ufefftold Rotunno pointedly: \u201cI would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut.\u201d In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at Rainn.org.

The company expects its total carbon emissions to fall by 30% in the next 15 years as it gradually produces less coal due to the \u201cnatural depletion\u201d of its coal reserves. Glencore promised investors last year it would cap its coal production, and said on Tuesday that production was expected to fall as its Colombian mines close.

This adds to a<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F12351-005\">body</a> of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/04/567762087/tylenol-may-help-ease-the-pain-of-hurt-feelings\">literature</a> showing that acetaminophen (paracetamol in the UK) dampens emotional pain better than taking nothing at all.</p> <p>Researchers at UCLA followed 42 participants over a three-week period, who took either a placebo, no treatment or paracetamol twice a day and answered a questionnaire about their feelings. The results showed that \u201chighly forgiving\u201d individuals saw an 18.5% reduction in \u201csocial pain\u201d over three weeks if they were taking acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/14/paracetamol-may-dull-emotions-as-well-as-physical-pain-new-study-shows\">Paracetamol may dull emotions as well as physical pain, new study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are holes in this study. First of all, not everyone can be highly forgiving. Second, the researchers note themselves that the sample size is tiny; and third, it is possible that the participants were reporting back on different types of social pain \u2013 as researchers did not ask what they were feeling down about.</p> <p>But it does add to a body of research that shows that acetaminophen dulls emotional pain \u2013 potentially because similar brain circuitry is engaged when we feel physical pain. Which leads to the question \u2013 if you <em>can </em>use pain medication to deal with emotional pain, does it follow that you <em>should?</em></p> <p>Silvia Dutchevici, a therapist from New York, warns against it: \u201cLet\u2019s say you have a break-up and you have a broken heart, I think you should be sad! That\u2019s human!\u201d she says.</p> <p>But what if you get your heart broken on the same day as an exam? Is taking a painkiller for heartache really that different from taking it for a headache?</p> <p>Dutchevici says that such scenarios might be a good example of when it actually makes sense to take a painkiller to dull pain. But, she warns, you have to be honest with yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s over-the-counter so people can access it whenever. Which means they really need to ask \u2013 is it just going to be one day? Or is it something you are going to start doing every week? We shouldn\u2019t forget that amany people who ended up addicted to opioids in the US started out looking for a quick fix.\u201d Tylenol isn\u2019t addictive like opioids, but it has detrimental effects on the liver \u2013 it is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/02/paracetamol-poisonings-have-jumped-44-in-10-years-we-must-change-how-its-sold\">top cause of acute liver failure in the western world</a>. Many people have accidentally overdosed or been poisoned by Tylenol in the last few years, including 95,000 related hospitalisations in Australia between 2007 and 2017.</p> <p>Dutchevici also points to a common double standard that people have around physical versus emotional pain. If you were taking painkillers for a headache for three days we might think that\u2019s OK, but most of us would go to the doctor if we were still doing it a week later.

      "bodyText": "Nothing quite hurts like a broken heart. But it turns out something could help: over-the-counter pain medication. On Tuesday, Forbes reported on a new study showing that taking painkillers can reduce the severity of emotional pain caused by rejection. This adds to a body of literature showing that acetaminophen (paracetamol in the UK) dampens emotional pain better than taking nothing at all. Researchers at UCLA followed 42 participants over a three-week period, who took either a placebo, no treatment or paracetamol twice a day and answered a questionnaire about their feelings. The results showed that \u201chighly forgiving\u201d individuals saw an 18.5% reduction in \u201csocial pain\u201d over three weeks if they were taking acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol. There are holes in this study. First of all, not everyone can be highly forgiving. Second, the researchers note themselves that the sample size is tiny; and third, it is possible that the participants were reporting back on different types of social pain \u2013 as researchers did not ask what they were feeling down about. But it does add to a body of research that shows that acetaminophen dulls emotional pain \u2013 potentially because similar brain circuitry is engaged when we feel physical pain. Which leads to the question \u2013 if you can use pain medication to deal with emotional pain, does it follow that you should? Silvia Dutchevici, a therapist from New York, warns against it: \u201cLet\u2019s say you have a break-up and you have a broken heart, I think you should be sad! That\u2019s human!\u201d she says. But what if you get your heart broken on the same day as an exam? Is taking a painkiller for heartache really that different from taking it for a headache? Dutchevici says that such scenarios might be a good example of when it actually makes sense to take a painkiller to dull pain. But, she warns, you have to be honest with yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s over-the-counter so people can access it whenever. Which means they really need to ask \u2013 is it just going to be one day? Or is it something you are going to start doing every week? We shouldn\u2019t forget that amany people who ended up addicted to opioids in the US started out looking for a quick fix.\u201d Tylenol isn\u2019t addictive like opioids, but it has detrimental effects on the liver \u2013 it is the top cause of acute liver failure in the western world. Many people have accidentally overdosed or been poisoned by Tylenol in the last few years, including 95,000 related hospitalisations in Australia between 2007 and 2017. Dutchevici also points to a common double standard that people have around physical versus emotional pain. If you were taking painkillers for a headache for three days we might think that\u2019s OK, but most of us would go to the doctor if we were still doing it a week later. Why not the same for emotional pain? \u201cThere is a lot of stigma around mental health that tells us we shouldn\u2019t get help \u2013 but why not?\u201d she says. For Dutchevici, human pain is part of the healing process. Importantly, when we numb pain, we numb our chances of healing. \u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a breakup. You take a pill, now you feel better and guess what? You\u2019re gonna repeat the same thing. You miss the opportunity to really learn what a healthy relationship should look like,\u201d she says. Instead of reaching for a pill, we should remember that pain is sometimes necessary to instigate change, she says. \u201cPain reminds us of things we need to work on. It drives us to change ourselves and the world.\u201d So what to do when you next have a broken heart? Dutchevici recommends talking \u2013 and not necessarily with a professional. In fact, Dutchevici says that anyone \u2013 friends, a religious leader, your local bartender \u2013 are good options when trying to work through emotional pain. There is just one key ingredient: introspection. \u201cIt\u2019s within human relationships that you get to work out some of your issues. But that is not gonna happen with a pill,\u201d she says.",

The latest EU negotiating mandate says those level playing field provisions should further develop \u201cover time\u201d.</p> <p>Frost went on to suggest that Brussels should offer a trade deal similar to that given to Canada, which avoided any European court of justice supervision of standards or demands on \u201calignment\u201d with Brussels.</p> <p>Barnier\u2019s response, and that of other EU officials, was one of polite fury. Sources said the EU negotiator had privately suggested to MEPs that the UK was backsliding on the political declaration on the future relationship signed last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity not like Canada, not like South Korea and not like Japan,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cVery particular. We are ready to propose and work very quickly with Britain on the basis of the political declaration, which was agreed with Boris Johnson.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier has rejected British demands for a Canada-style trade deal that would free the UK from EU rules as he made a thinly-veiled warning to Boris Johnson not to break his word. Speaking in response to a landmark speech by David Frost, Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Barnier said such an offer was not on the table and noted that the prime minister had agreed only six months ago to stick to the EU\u2019s state aid rules and current social and environmental regulations after the transition period. Asked if Frost was right in his speech on Monday night to say that agreeing to such alignment in a trade deal would be undemocratic, Barnier told reporters: \u201cTruly not. It is a sovereign decision of the EU, it is a sovereign decision of the UK to cooperate \u2026 That is what Boris Johnson wrote in the political declaration.\u201d Within hours of Barnier\u2019s comments, the British government seized upon a change to the EU\u2019s draft negotiating mandate, leaked to the Guardian, which sources in Downing Street suggested was an attempt to win back the Parthenon marbles for Athens. The latest draft of the EU\u2019s negotiating position calls for both sides to \u201caddress issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin\u201d. \u201cThis is just not happening,\u201d a Downing Street source said with reference to suggestions that the language referred to the return of the ancient marble sculptures to Athens. \u201cAnd it shows a troubling lack of seriousness about negotiations on the EU side.\u201d The Downing Street intervention came despite both Greek and EU officials insisting that the clause, proposed by Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Greece, was not related to the marbles held by the British museum but merely to a desire to stop the fraudulent movement of antiquities around Europe. One senior EU source likened the row as throwing a \u201cdead cat\u201d on the table to divert attention from the fallout from Frost\u2019s comments. The explosion of rhetoric on both sides of the Channel offers little hope that the next 11 months of talks will be smooth. In his speech on Monday night, Frost had set a tough line on EU demands by claiming the consent of the British public would \u201csnap dramatically and finally\u201d if the UK continued to be bound to the EU rulebook after December 2020. The latest EU negotiating mandate says those level playing field provisions should further develop \u201cover time\u201d. Frost went on to suggest that Brussels should offer a trade deal similar to that given to Canada, which avoided any European court of justice supervision of standards or demands on \u201calignment\u201d with Brussels. Barnier\u2019s response, and that of other EU officials, was one of polite fury. Sources said the EU negotiator had privately suggested to MEPs that the UK was backsliding on the political declaration on the future relationship signed last year. \u201cWe have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity not like Canada, not like South Korea and not like Japan,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cVery particular. We are ready to propose and work very quickly with Britain on the basis of the political declaration, which was agreed with Boris Johnson. We stand ready to propose this agreement, if the UK wants it.\u201d Speaking separately, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, warned that the UK would bear \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its choices. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a level playing field and they don\u2019t seem to want it,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big worry for many of the manufacturing sectors in the UK. If they want to diverge from the existing rules and regulations, we are going to have problems. And the more they diverge from the existing EU law and regulations, the more problems we\u2019ll have.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, a senior MEP and former prime minister of Belgium, who has led the European parliament\u2019s approach to Brexit, said the UK was approaching the negotiation as if the sides were \u201cliving on two different planets\u201d. He added that it would be a \u201chell of a job\u201d to secure a successful outcome from the negotiation given the British approach. In response to the row over the Parthenon marbles, a spokesman for the British Museum noted the Greek government\u2019s denial that it would pursue the statues during the trade negotiations with the UK. The spokesman said: \u201cThe British Museum welcomes this mandate and is committed to fighting the trade in illicit antiquities across the world. \u201cWe work in partnership with law enforcement agencies to identify and help to return objects that come into the UK illegally. The Parthenon sculptures were legally acquired and help us to tell the story of human history presented at the Museum. They are accessible to the 6 million global visitors the museum receives each year.\u201d",

TJN\u2019s financial secrecy index, which ranks countries on the size and secretiveness of their financial sectors every two years, showed the UK edged closer to the top 10 most secretive financial systems in the world.

The TJN is now calling for sanctions against countries including the UK, US and the Cayman Islands for \u201cbacksliding\u201d on transparency since 2018, just as other countries around the world became more open due to reforms such as automatic sharing of information about non-resident taxpayers.

Its food business proved more resilient, with sales of its Extra Special range growing 5% year-on-year. However, this was not enough to stop a 1.3% fall in total sales, excluding petrol.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as unseasonable weather. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The update was included in a statement released by Asda\u2019s parent company, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer.

The supermarket chain\u2019s clothing line, George, was hit particularly hard. Its food business proved more resilient, with sales of its Extra Special range growing 5% year-on-year. However, this was not enough to stop a 1.3% fall in total sales, excluding petrol. The update was included in a statement released by Asda\u2019s parent company, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer. It confirms that all the big supermarket chains had a tough Christmas, which is their most important trading period. Morrisons reported a 1.7% dip in sales, Sainsbury was down 0.7% and Tesco shed 0.2%. Like the rest of the big four supermarkets, Asda is under pressure from the rise of Aldi and Lidl. Asda blamed challenging market conditions for the decline. \u201cWhile customers were enthusiastic for Christmas, they were more mindful in their spending,\u201d said Roger Burnley, the chief executive. \u201cMany chose to pare back gift lists and focus presents on kids rather than adults and extended family.\u201d He said consumers remained \u201chighly budget conscious\u201d. Online sales were a bright note, rising more than 10% on 2018 levels in the fourth quarter. The chain extended same-day delivery to 284 stores in the three-month period. The company also trialled a one-hour click-and-collect service in two shops, and the service is to be rolled out across the entire network from this week. Asda said its core food business showed more stability across the period, known as the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d because it includes Black Friday and Christmas. The grocer has started trials with new concession partners including Sushi Daily and Claire\u2019s Accessories. Last year, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s were forced to call off a \u00a37bn merger after the plans were quashed by the Competition and Markets Authority. Walmart subsequently said that it was \u201cseriously considering\u201d a stock market flotation but warned the preparation could take years.",

In warning in this way Apple has neatly summed up the knock to global growth stemming from both reduced output and consumption. </p> <p>Firstly, how anyone is surprised by this is beyond me. Clearly there is going to be a hit to both output and consumption in the world\u2019s second largest economy and the world\u2019s growth driver. This is bound to hit earnings of companies exposed \u2013 Apple being the bellwether. </p> <p>Most of Apple\u2019s products are made in China, while the country accounts for about 16% of global revenues. </p> <p>The $4bn spread in the original guidance was already as wide as a barn door, reflecting uncertainty at the time of the Q1 results at the back end of January. </p> <p>The warning points to the two key ways the outbreak will impact growth. First output: Apple says iPhone supply will be constrained due to a slower ramp in production following the late return following the new year holiday. Two, consumption: demand for all products in China has been sharply hit. </p> <p>Apple warned about China a little over a year ago and after the stock initially sold off, investors soon shrugged it off.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our latest story on the coronavirus\u2019s growing impact on the global economy: In New York, shares are drifting lower too following Apple\u2019s warning that it won\u2019t meet its quarterly revenue target on account of the coronavirus crisis in China. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.86% or 252 points at 29,145. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The warning from the tech giant spooked traders as it is probably a sign of what is to come from other companies that have exposure to China \u2013 which is a very long list. The health crisis is causing major disruption to businesses in the second-largest economy in the world, so traders are ducking out of equities. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed 51 points lower at 7,382, a drop of 0.7%. HSBC led the fallers, down 6.5% after posting lower profits and announcing sweeping job cuts. Miners also had a bad day. Brazil\u2019s economy is also going to hit by the coronavirus crisis, economists fear, due to its export links to China: The boss of Tata Motors, JLR\u2019s parent company, also warned that parts from China are in short supply. Guenter Butschek told reporters: \u201cWe are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March. Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March? Unfortunately...not.\u201d Don\u2019t panic.... but carmaker Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s UK factories could run out of parts from China in a couple of weeks. According to Reuters, JLR chief executive Ralf Speth has said that Jaguar Land Rover has enough parts from China to maintain its British production for the next two weeks but not beyond that at the moment. Speth also told reporters that sales were not currently happening in China. The Financial Times have a great story about Apple\u2019s problems in China, which explains why production levels are much lower than expected. They\u2019ve learned that Foxconn is struggling to get enough workers onto the iPhone assembly line at its huge factory complex at Zhengzhou, in China\u2019s Henan province. It\u2019s because workers from outside the city are being forced into a quarantine period, for up to 14 days, to prevent them spreading Covid-19. That self-quarantine period is taking place in a Foxconn dormitory room, which normally houses eight people! So there aren\u2019t enough to go round. The FT explains: The rooms, which usually pack in eight workers, had quickly filled, causing Foxconn to halt the return of additional staff, explained a Zhengzhou-based factory recruiter, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough room,\u201d the recruiter said, adding that workers could now sign up and wait for quarantine availability. \u201cThere\u2019s no one snoring. There\u2019s no one bothering you. The internet is finally fast,\u201d said one worker of the comfortable conditions in quarantine. The seven other bunks in his dorm room \u2014 consisting of only wood planks without mattresses \u2014 were empty. More here. This 2.8% decline knocks around $40bn off Apple\u2019s valuation. That sounds like a lot, but it means the tech giant is still worth $1.38 trillion, down from $1.42trn. Newsflash: Shares in Apple have fallen by 2.8% at the start of trading on Wall Street. New York traders are showing concern about last night\u2019s revenue warning. But this fall isn\u2019t as sharp as feared this morning, when Apple was down 5% in Frankfurt. This suggests there\u2019s some optimism that the coronavirus problems will be short-lived. The coronavirus crisis could drag Italy\u2019s economy into a recession this year, fears Capital Economics. Jack Allen-Reynolds, Senior Europe Economist, told clients that: After Italy\u2019s economy shrank at the end of last year, it looks set to continue to struggle in 2020. In fact, there is a clear risk that it falls back into recession for the fourth time since 2008. Allen-Reynolds has spotted that while Italy is only half as dependent on sales to China as Germany, it is MORE reliant on imports from China. So the closure of Chinese factories could hurt Italian manufacturers, if they can\u2019t get the parts they need to complete their own products. Last night\u2019s warning from Apple is a wake-up call for investors, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: China is a big market for Apple \u2013 accounting for around one-sixth of its global revenues \u2013 and is the source of most of its products. The coronavirus represents both a demand and a supply shock to the company. Apple\u2019s statement to investors represented something of a reality check to the financial markets, which have been blithely assuming that the coronavirus would represent only a short-lived hit to China and to the wider global economy. To be sure, Apple says that production will return to normal but stresses that the process is taking longer than expected. This is far more serious than the outbreak of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and its timing could hardly have been worse.... More here: Just in. Factories in the New York state have reported their biggest increase in new orders in a year. The New York Fed\u2019s Empire State business conditions index, just released, rose 8.1 points to 12.9 in February. That\u2019s the best reading since last May - defying forecasts of a drop to 4.0. The index of new orders rose 15.5 points to 22.1 in February, the highest level in over a year, while the shipments index jumped 10.3 points to 18.9. This is an encouraging signal for the health of the US economy, at an important moment given the problems in China. Rupert Harrison of Blackrock tweets: US tech stocks could be in for a rough day, thanks to Apple. Chipmakers Qualcomm and Broadcom, who supply technology for the iPhone, are both down around 2% in pre-market trading. Apple\u2019s now off 2.5%. The wider market is also likely to dip. Swiss bank UBS have created some neat charts showing how economic activity in China has (understandably) flatlined in recent weeks. As you can see, coal consumption, property sales and traffic congestion are all much weaker than usual: HSBC has revealed it could be forced to take $600m in additional provisions against loan losses if the Coronavirus outbreak isn\u2019t tackled before the middle of 2020. Reuters has the details: Chief financial officer Ewan Stevenson said on Tuesday HSBC has modelled several scenarios for the impact of the virus on its business, and in the more extreme of those in which it carries on, the lender would have to assume bad loans rising to that amount. \u201cThere will be revenue impacts which will become progressively more acute if the coronavirus was to continue beyond the next month to six weeks,\u201d Stevenson told analysts on a conference call. Stevenson had earlier indicated that HSBC would update the markets on the coronavirus impact at the end of April (when Beijing would hope to have the situation firmly under control). Back in London, the FTSE 100 has touched a fresh two-week low. The blue-chip index is down 1.05%, or 78 points, at 7,354. There\u2019s a clear coronavirus impact, with mining companies among the top fallers. Fashion chain Burberry is down 3.3% too. It\u2019s suffering from Apple\u2019s warning of weak iPhone sales in China, and the cancellation of Chanel\u2019s Beijing show. Callum D\u2019Ath, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, suggests Apple\u2019s management may be criticised for putting so much reliance on Chinese manufacturing. He writes: This is Apple\u2019s second sales warning in 12 months where the company has blamed China-related issues. Previously it was the US/China \u2018trade war\u2019 and now it is the Coronavirus. As Apple supposedly has one of the best supply-chain systems in the world coupled with a very big physical presence in China, investors may question the quality of management going forward. \u201cLooking ahead for Apple, this is probably a transitory impact to numbers as global supply-chain issues will dissipate. In addition, while this is clearly a hardware issue, the jury is still out on whether Apple is a hardware company or successful in transitioning to becoming a high-quality consumer staple company with a growing software business.\u201d China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has insisted that the country\u2019s economy won\u2019t be derailed by the coronavirus crisis, and can still hits its growth targets. Reuters has the details: China can meet its economic growth target in 2020 despite the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying on Tuesday. Xi said the economy remained resilient as efforts to control the outbreak reached a critical stage. Beijing had been aiming for 6% growth in 2020, before the outbreak began in Wuhan. Many economists have trimmed their forecasts since, but there\u2019s a theory that the economy could bounce back later this year... if the Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed fairly soon. The coronavirus is the third-biggest \u2018tail risk\u2019 keeping fund managers awake at night, according to Bank of America\u2019s monthly survey. The top worry -- the US presidential election. Many in the markets expect Donald Trump to be re-elected for a second term. So a progressive Democrat could surprise Wall Street -- with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both pledging tighter bank regulation and higher taxes on the wealthiest. Just in: US supermarket titan Walmart has missed sales and profit expectations, and issued weaker-than-expected earnings forecasts. Walmart made $1.38 per share in adjusted earnings in the last quarter, shy of forecasts of $1.44. Sales rose by 1.9%, missing forecasts of 2.4%. It also expects to make between $5 and $5.15 per share in the coming financial year -- Wall Street had expected $5.22 per share. Walmart says it has NOT included any potential financial hit from the coronavirus -- suggesting it is reacting to a slowdown in its domestic market. Neil Wilson of Markets.com reckons investors will soon shake off their worries about Apple, even though its shares are having a bad day. He writes: Apple says it won\u2019t hit its Q2 revenue guidance of $63-67bn due to the Covid-19 outbreak in China. In warning in this way Apple has neatly summed up the knock to global growth stemming from both reduced output and consumption. Firstly, how anyone is surprised by this is beyond me. Clearly there is going to be a hit to both output and consumption in the world\u2019s second largest economy and the world\u2019s growth driver. This is bound to hit earnings of companies exposed \u2013 Apple being the bellwether. Most of Apple\u2019s products are made in China, while the country accounts for about 16% of global revenues. The $4bn spread in the original guidance was already as wide as a barn door, reflecting uncertainty at the time of the Q1 results at the back end of January. The warning points to the two key ways the outbreak will impact growth. First output: Apple says iPhone supply will be constrained due to a slower ramp in production following the late return following the new year holiday. Two, consumption: demand for all products in China has been sharply hit. Apple warned about China a little over a year ago and after the stock initially sold off, investors soon shrugged it off. I\u2019d anticipate a similar reaction to this Apple\u2019s share are down over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, as early-bird traders prepare to head to Wall Street. This chart from Bloomberg TV shows why the turmoil in China is bad for Apple\u2019s revenues - meaning it will miss sales targets this quarter. But Apple\u2019s stock is still nearly double its level last year: Chanel has cancelled a fashion show scheduled for May in Beijing, due to coronavirus angst - another sign of the economic cost of the crisis. The French fashion house said last night: \u201cConsidering the current situation and following the guidance of Chinese authorities, Chanel has decided to postpone its project of a replica of the Paris \u2013 31 Rue Cambon 2019/20 M\u00e9tiers d\u2019art collection in May in Beijing to a later and more appropriate moment.\u201d Chanel added that the \u201chealth and well-being of its teams and clients\u201d are its primary concern at this time. The AFP newswire has more details: The \u201c31 Rue Cambon\u201d show was first held in Paris in December, inspired by the studio and workshop of founder Coco Chanel. The decor was created by the film director Sofia Coppola. Scores of similar events have already been cancelled in China, and beyond - with Barcelona\u2019s Mobile World Congress being cancelled last week. CNBC\u2019s Julianna Tatelbaum says the slump in German investor confidence is much worse than expected -- as sign that the coronavirus is causing real alarm: Hopes of green shoots in Germany are turning into brown weeds, warns Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl of Allianz: But Aila Mihr of Danske Bank argues that the impact is \u2018muted\u2019 so far: ZEW president Achim Wambach says: \u201cThe feared negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic in China on world trade have been causing a considerable decline of the indicator of economic sentiment for Germany. Expectations regarding the development of the export-intensive sectors of the economy have dropped particularly sharply.\u201d NEWSFLASH: German investor confidence has taken a nosedive, hit by coronavirus turmoil and recession fears. The ZEW Institute\u2019s measure of German economic sentiment has tumbled to just 8.7, down from January\u2019s 26.7 (which was a four-year high). It blamed the \u201cnegative effects\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak in China - with export-intensive sectors of the German economy particularly affected. Recent weak economic data has also hurt -- with German GDP stagnating in the final three months of last year. ZEW\u2019s current conditions measures slumped to -15.7, from -9.5, in a clear indication that the economy is under pressure.... Back in the markets, Apple\u2019s shares are still under pressure in Frankfurt. The tech giant is down around 3.66%, so it\u2019s clawed back a BIT of its early selloff. But that still suggests Wall Street is going to see some heavy selling later today. On the upside, Apple\u2019s shares have been on a huge tear recently - soaring by 86% in 2019. So one day\u2019s losses shouldn\u2019t hurt..... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has squashed fears that the budget could be delayed following the shock departure of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. It\u2019s still on for 11 March, he just tweeted: Here\u2019s some reaction to today\u2019s jobs report from the Resolution Foundation think tank: And from Pawel Adrjan of jobs site Indeed.com: Good news! Pay in Britain has finally hit its pre-crisis levels, once you adjust for inflation and strip out bonuses. That\u2019s according to today\u2019s unemployment report, which says: Real regular pay increased by 1.8% to \u00a3474 between December 2018 and December 2019. This was the first time that real regular pay exceeded the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3473 recorded in March 2008. However, the annual rate of growth of both total and regular pay slowed down in recent months. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s employment rate has hit a new record high, but wage growth has slowed. The Office for National Statistics has reported that the UK employment rate rose to 76.5% in the October-December quarter-- up from 76.1% in the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, its lowest since Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government of 1974. There are more vacancies too --some 810,000 in the last three months, up from 807,000 in the previous quarter. But there\u2019s bad news too -- average basic earnings growth fell to 3.2% per year, from 3.4%. Total pay (including bonuses) only rose by 2.9%, down from 3.2% a month ago. That\u2019s a blow, but it\u2019s compensated by the fact that inflation dropped to a three-year low in January. Most major European stock markets are in the red today, as investors digest the implications of Apple\u2019s revenue warning last night. Russ Mould of stockbroker AJ Bell says the markets have been \u201cfar too complacent\u201d about the impact of the coronavirus on China\u2019s manufacturing industry, and global supply chains. If factories are closed, are running at partial capacity, or are struggling to get raw materials to make goods, then it is no wonder that supplies will be disrupted. \u201cApple\u2019s retail stores will have also been affected by the health incident in China and surrounding areas in Asia as there will have been fewer people shopping. \u201cCompanies try to avoid tying up cash by having large stockpiles, even though that would help them to continue operating as normal at such times of supply chain disruption. Instead, they prefer to have the smallest amount of inventory possible in the hope that the supply chain always runs smoothly. That leaves little room for error, as Apple has now discovered. Germany\u2019s DAX index has dropped 0.75% in early trading, losing 105 points to 13,678. Industrial groups are leading the fallers, hit by fresh concerns about China\u2019s economy and the impact of Covid-19. Semiconductor-maker Infineon Technologies, another iPhone supplier, are down 2%. Carmaker Daimler has lost 1.9%, with tire manufacturer Continental off 1.4% and cement producer Heidelberg down 1.3%. Oil, a handy barometer of economic optimism, is falling too. Brent crude has shed 1.6% to $56.73 per barrel, down $1 overnight. Tech companies aren\u2019t the only ones suffering. Shares in small UK manufacturer Tekmar have plunged by almost 40%, after it warned that the coronavirus is hurting business. Tekmar makes protective coverings for subsea cables, such as power links to wind farms and oil rigs. It told the City this morning: \u201cChina\u2019s necessary and prudent response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, including the restriction of travel in the country, is affecting the Group\u2019s performance materially in a number of ways. Cardiff-based iPhone supplier IQE have slumped 6% in early trading -- another casualty of last night\u2019s warning. Over in Frankfurt, shares in Apple are taking a thumping in early trading. Apple\u2019s stock is down 5% at \u20ac285, as European traders react to last night\u2019s warning that revenue targets will be missed. Apple is worth around $1.4 trillion dollars. So this fall would wipe around $70bn off its market capitalisation! We\u2019ll see if Apple\u2019s New York-listed shares take a similar plunge when Wall Street opens in six hours time. Shares in STMicroelectronics, who also supply chips to Apple for the iPhone, are down 2.5%. Overall, tech stocks are the worst-performing sector across Europe this morning - down some 1.3%. European tech companies are being buffeted at the start of trading, thanks to Apple\u2019s warning last night. Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor has plunged 6%, It supplies various technology for the iPhone, including power management systems. Another iPhone supplier, AMS, are down 4.5%. It provides optical sensor systems used in the 3D facial recognition features on iPhones. Oof! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen 1%, or 72 points, at the start of trading to 7362. That\u2019s a two-week low, as Apple\u2019s virus warning sends a shiver through the City of London. HSBC is the biggest faller, after reporting a 33% drop in profits earlier today and outlining plans to shrink its investment bank. Mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting worries that the global economy will suffer from the outbreak. Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Glencore have all lost at least 1.5% -- with BHP\u2019s warning about exports to China not helping the mood either... Banking giant HSBC has added its voice to the growing chorus of concerns over the coronavirus. HSBC\u2019s interim chief executive, Noel Quinn said there had been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong. Speaking after announcing a tumble in profits, Quinn said: \u201cDepending on how the situation develops, there is the potential for any associated economic slowdown to impact our expected credit losses in Hong Kong and mainland China.. \u201cLonger term, it is also possible that we may see revenue reductions from lower lending and transaction volumes, and further credit losses stemming from disruption to customer supply chains. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d Mining giant BHP Billiton has also warned that the coronavirus is threatening its operations. BHP told shareholders that it will revise down its expectations for economic and commodity demand unless the outbreak is \u201cdemonstrably well contained within the March quarter\u201d. The company added that it expects a net loss in demand for oil in the near term, due to the coronavirus disease. Overnight data has confirmed that Chinese imports of iron ore have fallen in the last week: Britain\u2019s accountancy watchdog has warned UK companies not to be shy about spelling out the impact of coronavirus on their businesses. The Financial Reporting Council said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage companies to consider carefully what disclosures they might need to include in their year-end accounts relating to these events.\u201d So if you\u2019ve been expanding in China, or rely on a Wuhan factory for parts, you\u2019d better mention it now..... Here\u2019s the damage in the Asia-Pacific markets today, after Apple became the highest profile market victim of the virus impact so far. Japan\u2019s Nikkei: down 329 points, or 1.4%, at 23,193 China\u2019s CSI 300: down 19 points or 0.5% at 4,057 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng: 394 points or 1.4% at 27,568 South Korea\u2019s KOSPI: down 5 points or 1.6% at 297 South Korea has warned it faces an economic \u2018emergency\u2019 from the coronavirus, in another sign that the outbreak is causing deeper damage to the global economy. President Moon Jae-in told a cabinet meeting in Seoul that the economy is in an emergency situation, and needs stimulus to lift domestic demand. Moon also called for \u201call possible measures\u201d to support South Korea\u2019s economy, fuelling speculation that his government could launch a stimulus package soon. He told cabinet ministers: \u201cWe should take every possible measure we can think of... The current situation is more serious than we thought . . . we need to take emergency steps in this time of emergency.\u201d South Korea\u2019s tourism sector is suffering from the travel restrictions in China, while its high-tech industry will suffer supply chain problems from the closure of Chinese factories. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Alarm bells are ringing in the markets this morning after Apple warned it won\u2019t hit key financial targets, due to the escalating coronavirus crisis. Late last night, the tech giant admitted that it will fail to reach sales targets set just last month -- the clearest sign yet that Covid-19 is having a serious impact on the global economy. Apple warned that coronavirus is hurting both supplies, and demand. Chinese factories are taking longer than expected to ramp up their iPhone production levels, having been closed for an extended period after the Lunar New Year due to the virus. This means it will have fewer iPhones available for sale around the world. It warned: \u201cWork is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter.\u201d That\u2019s being compounded by retail closures across China. Given the health emergency, fewer Chinese consumers are venturing out to buy phones even if their local store is open. That\u2019s a blow to Apple, as China provides a sixth of Apple\u2019s revenue. It warned: All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic. We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.\u201d Apple insists that the disruption is only temporary. But clearly the situation has deteriorated sharply in the last few weeks. And if Apple are suffering, surely other companies -- including its own suppliers -- will be struggling too? On Monday, airline group Cathay Pacific issued its own warning, and we could easily see more today. Asian investors have reacted swiftly, by hammering the sell button . The Chinese, Japanese and Hong Kong stock indices have all fallen, and European markets are likely to follow. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says Apple have put the markets on edge: Even though Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner facilities resumed activity last week, China hasn\u2019t managed to get back to a normal rhythm just yet, and the latter could take a couple of more weeks, if not months. The risk appetite remains fragile and gains in equity markets remain vulnerable to coronavirus related news.

Northerners and the north appear to have inherited this ostracisation from \u201cthe unruly Scots\u201d \u2013 the latter having, in a broadcasting context, either stormed the BBC\u2019s metropolitan bastion, or simply tholed their assizes. Viz the terse opening of Tom Leonard\u2019s 60s poem Six O\u2019Clock News: \u201cthis is thi / six a clock / news thi / man said n / thi reason / a talk wia / BBC accent / iz coz yi / widny wahnt / mi ti talk / aboot thi / trooth wia / voice lik / wanna yoo / scruff. if / a toktaboot / thi trooth / lik wanna yoo / scruff yi / widny thingk / it wuz troo\u2026\u201d Leonard\u2019s subtlety and irony are conveyed through his use of the very Glaswegian dialect he pretends to disdain. What chance of Ian McMillan, I\u2019m sure happily familiar with the original, unearthing or instigating a northern follow-up as entertaining as it is sharp-edged? Stewart Conn Edinburgh \u2022 Just to put things right.

Naruhito and Masako were due to greet well-wishers from a palace balcony three times on Sunday, along with the crown prince and his family.</p> <p>\u201cWe made the decision to cancel the public event at the palace, which is attended every year by many people in close proximity, after considering the risk of the virus spreading,\u201d Kenji Ikeda, the vice grand steward of the agency, said at a press conference, according to the Kyodo news agency. The last time the emperor\u2019s birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, amid a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru.</p> <p>The agency\u2019s decision to scrap the celebrations comes after Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said people should avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. \u201cWe want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings,\u201d Kato said. \u201cWe want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4b490f8f0811db2faf9980\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-18T02:27:31.862Z\">2.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hong Kong increases emergency fund to HK$25bn</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has boosted the funds available to tackle the coronavirus outbreak to HK$28bn (US$3.60bn) from HK$25bn pledged previously to ease the impact on the city\u2019s battered economy. </p> <p>Lam last week had said the government would give one-off payments to businesses across the city and the hospital authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a3604fc27666ec6fc8230cc0dd627c913f7163d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a3604fc27666ec6fc8230cc0dd627c913f7163d/0_0_4247_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"hk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One person has died from the virus in Hong Kong and 60 people have been infected.</p> <p>The numbers are very small compared with China but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/06/hong-kong-faces-double-devastation-as-coronavirus-and-civil-unrest-take-toll\">the city is facing an economic crisis</a> with the double hit of the virus and last year\u2019s street protests. <strong>Visitor numbers have fallen off a cliff. </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidInglesTV/status/1229227620627173376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you&#39;ve hated Hong Kong&#39;s crowded streets, now is the time to come.

The suspension will be for Chinese citizens entering Russia for employment, private, educational and tourist purposes. The suspension will be temporary, the statement said. If you\u2019re just catching up, here is a quick rundown of the latest global coronavirus developments over the past few hours: There have been nearly 100 cases of human-to-human spread outside China, but WHO said there is little \u201csustained local transmission\u201d. A Wuhan hospital director has died from the virus, as authorities launched more forceful measures to round up patients. A British couple on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship said they had tested positive for the virus, but questioned the results. Meanwhile, another Briton who had been on the ship announced he is being discharged from hospital tomorrow after testing negative for the coronavirus. A British family in a French ski resort have also left hospital after beating the disease. Boris Johnson has spoken to China\u2019s president about the outbreak, offering his sympathies to those affected. Prada has postponed a fashion show due to take place in Tokyo in May, while Chanel has delayed a Beijing show. Officials in Hubei province, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, will adopt more thorough and forceful measures to find patients with fever, state media reported today. Records of all fever patients who have visited a doctor since 20 January will be checked, as well as the records of those who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications in shops and online, Xinhua reported. People will get health check-ups and, if necessary, be placed in quarantine or taken to hospital, the report added, citing a notice from the province\u2019s epidemic control headquarters. China reported on Tuesday the smallest number of new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said the data should still be viewed with caution. Dozens more countries across Africa and the Americas will be able to test citizens for coronavirus by the end of the week, the World Health Organization said today. Over the coming days, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are expected to have the ability to detect the Covid-19 virus. Previously, many countries sent samples to other nations for testing in a process which can take days. Now they will be able to generate results in 24-48 hours. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, said personal protective equipment has been sent to 21 countries and more will be sent to another 106 in the coming weeks. Chinese medical workers who die fighting the coronavirus outbreak will be designated as martyrs, CNN reports. Over 1,700 healthcare workers have become infected during the battle to contain the virus and several have died, with Chinese authorities coming under criticism for the pressure it is putting on staff. The deaths have included Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who tried to warn of the virus in December, and Liu Zhiming, director of Wuchang hospital in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Kristie Lu Stout, a CNN correspondent in Hong Kong, reported: China says it will designate all of them \u2014 the frontline doctors, nurses and medics who died while fighting the virus \u2014 as martyrs of the epicenter of the outbreak. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks, as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hits firms across countries and industries. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker joined major global companies such as Apple in warning of the impact of the virus on supply chains, Reuters reports. Fiat Chrysler said last week it had temporarily halted output at its Serbian plant, the first such suspension by an automaker in Europe in response to the coronavirus crisis. Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the virus outbreak \u2013 is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. The JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth, said: We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing. We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK. Production at the firm\u2019s Chinese factory would recommence on 24 February and was \u201csafe for the very first week\u201d, he added. The new coronavirus has killed over 1,900 people in China and infected around 72,000, confining millions to their homes, disrupting businesses and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. Speth said sales in China, the world\u2019s biggest auto market, had been hit. The knockback comes after JLR had enjoyed a recovery in sales there, helping it to return to profitability in recent quarters. \u201cThat\u2019s completely stopped. It\u2019s zero,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss.\u201d A British man who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan will be discharged from hospital tomorrow. Alan Steele, who announced the news on Facebook, said he will wait in the country until he can be reunited with his wife, Wendy, and they can travel home together. The couple, who were celebrating their honeymoon on the ship, were separated on 7 February when Alan was diagnosed with the virus and taken to a nearby hospital. Although the ship\u2019s quarantine officially ends on Wednesday, new guidelines mean anyone who shared a cabin with a person who has tested negative for the virus will face another two weeks on board. Alan has now tested negative for the virus, and says he is looking forward to eating at the McDonald\u2019s near the cruise terminal. The are 92 cases in 12 countries outside China of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization chief has said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have data to make a meaningful comparison to China cases,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus clarified. Speaking at a press conference, he added: We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said \u201cclearly there has been more transmission than expected\u201d on the cruise ship. He said Japanese authorities are adjusting to reality and taking necessary public health measures to evacuate people and deal with their follow-up care. Two Irish citizens have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Independent.ie has reported. More than 100 people have been tested in Ireland for the disease, but none have tested positive. There are six Irish nationals on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship. The two who have tested positive share dual citizenship with another EU member state and are not normally resident in Ireland. They are being treated at a hospital in Japan. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said: We are also in close contact with those who remain in quarantine on the ship. We are working with our EU partners and other like-minded countries regarding options for their return. A British family who contracted coronavirus at a French ski resort have been discharged from hospital, the French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said. The British nationals, including a nine-year-old child, caught the virus from Steve Walsh, a British man who traveled to the Contamines-Montjoie resort from a conference in Singapore, where he got the coronavirus. The family were hospitalised in Grenoble, and CNN reports V\u00e9ran as saying: All of the patients that were hospitalised in Grenoble were able to leave the hospital. Thus the family that were infected, an English family, the father and his son were able to leave the hospital in Grenoble. They are no longer considered to be sick or carriers of the virus. The health minister also said a third French national had tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. French fashion company Chanel has postponed a show in Beijing, following on from Prada\u2019s decision to delay a show due to be held in Japan in May. Chanel said in a statement that following the guidance of Chinese authorities it had decided to postpone its Beijing replica of a catwalk display held in Paris last December \u201cto a later and more appropriate moment\u201d. The company is monitoring the situation closely, the statement said, adding: \u201cAt the foremost are the health and wellbeing of its teams and clients.\u201d No new date was given for the event. As the UK government makes plans to bring home the British nationals trapped on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, here\u2019s a quick summary of some the other countries which have taken similar measure, compiled by Reuters. Australia will evacuate more than 200 of its citizens and an unspecified number of New Zealand citizens onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The passengers will depart on Wednesday and will be required to be quarantined for another 14 days. Taiwan said today it would charter a plane to evacuate its citizens from the Diamond Princess. It evacuated 247 of the estimated 500 Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan on 3 February. A plane chartered by Canada has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals aboard the virus-hit cruise ship off Yokohama. After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine. After evacuating 215 people earlier, the country flew back 185 Canadians from Wuhan on 11 February. All evacuees are quarantined on the Trenton, Ontario, base for two weeks. The United States flew back over 300 Americans who had been stuck on the Diamond Princess. They will face two more weeks of quarantine, after spending the previous 14 days docked in Japan. The US also authorised the voluntary departure of its government employees and their family members from Hong Kong on 11 February. On 6 February, two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly US citizens, took off from Wuhan for the United States. Hong Kong said it would send an aircraft to Japan to bring back passengers from the Diamond Princess, which has seen the most coronavirus infections outside of China. The Italian luxury fashion house Prada has postponed a fashion show due to take place in Japan in May. In a statement, the company said: Due to the current uncertainty related to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Prada Resort fashion show originally scheduled for 21 May in Japan will be postponed. Prada added the decision was a precautionary measure as well as \u201can act of responsibility and respect\u201d for all those working on and planning to attend the show. The statement continued: \u201cJapan remains one of Prada\u2019s strategic markets and relevant events will be scheduled in the country at a more appropriate moment.\u201d Both Japan and South Korea have reported entering a \u201cnew phase\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, saying the situation is changing \u201cminute-by-minute\u201d in the country. The number of cases in Japan now stands at 607, with 542 on the stranded Princess Diamond cruise ship and 65 elsewhere in the country. There has been one reported death. Most worryingly, there has been an increase in the number of cases where the Japanese health ministry has been unable to figure out the origin of the transmission. The Mainichi newspaper reports that a spate of new cases is being linked to a New Year\u2019s party for taxi drivers held on a river tour boat in the capital. It reports that as of 16 February, 11 attendees and boat employees were infected with coronavirus. Repatriating passengers from the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan is not without risks, a medical expert has said. Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Considerable care needs to be made to ensure that the passengers do not transmit infection between themselves or to cabin crew during the flight home and once back on home soil they do not act as a focus for the spread of the disease into their home countries \u2013 any returning passengers may be put in quarantine on their return. He noted that while the quarantine seems to have been effective at stopping the spread of infection around the world as passengers return home or continue their travels, it hasn\u2019t stopped the coronavirus passing between passengers and crew. It is well known that certain infections such as influenza and norovirus can spread rapidly on board cruise ships. Cruise ships take passengers and crew from all over the world, often passengers are relatively elderly, they spend most of their time on board indoors mixing with others. The most likely [infection] route is direct person-to-person transmission when people are close to an infected person, but with currently publicly available information it is not possible to rule out other issues at this stage. Many countries, including the US, Canada and Australia have either evacuated their citizens or are in the process of doing so. The UK government has said it is in the process of organising a flight to bring back British nationals as soon as possible. Boris Johnson has spoken with the president of China about the coronavirus outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said: The prime minister spoke to President Xi of China this morning. He offered his sympathies for those affected by the outbreak of coronavirus in China. President Xi thanked the UK for its support and in particular welcomed the donation of vital medical equipment to China. The prime minister and president agreed on the importance of the UK-China relationship and resolved to work together across a range of issues including strengthening the economic partnership, to benefit the people of both China and the UK. The spokesman added that ahead of COP26 in Glasgow and the Convention on Biological Diversity Summit in China, the two leaders pledged to would work closely together on the issue of climate change. They agreed that biodiversity and climate change are two sides of the same coin and must be addressed in tandem if we\u2019re to protect the planet for future generations. A social media campaign in Australia is urging people eat at Chinese restaurants, to combat disinformation and racialised stigma surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. The #IWillEatWithYou campaign hopes to boost struggling Chinese businesses in the country, with many owners reporting a drop in sales caused by coronavirus fears. On the campaign page, set up by Australian political activist group GetUp!, a call to action reads: As misinformation about coronavirus spreads across social media, local Chinese restaurants and stores are paying the price - with some losing up to 50% of their revenue. While other restaurants and public spaces are still buzzing, it is the Chinatown restaurants and Asian grocers that stand empty. Panic around the virus is unfairly impacting Chinese and Asian communities. If we don\u2019t take action \u2013 people will lose their jobs, and their livelihoods. Can you take the pledge to defeat baseless fears and support these businesses in their time of need? The Foreign Office has the \u201cutmost concern\u201d for the British people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, two of whom may have tested positive for the virus. In an updated statement, a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: We have the utmost concern for the British people currently on the cruise ship. We are ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan and are organising a flight back to the UK for other British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. The UK accounting watchdog has called on all British businesses to flag up the full extent of the risks posed by the coronavirus outbreak to their companies, PA Media reports. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said companies had a duty to make \u201cup-to-date and meaningful\u201d disclosures to investors on the potential impact of the disease. PA Media also reported that the FRC is in talks with accountancy firms over the potential effect that coronavirus could have on their ability to sign off accounts, given travel restrictions in China. UK firms with Chinese subsidiaries can only review audit files within the country, as Chinese data protection laws prevent this being done remotely. An FRC spokesman said: Given the potential for rapid spreading of the virus, required disclosures will likely change over time as more information about the epidemic emerges. Companies will need to monitor developments and ensure they are providing up-to-date and meaningful disclosures to their shareholders when preparing their year-end reports. Thirty doctors in Brighton are currently in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus, the Argus reported. A frontline clinician told the local paper: \u201cThere are 30 doctors in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus at the CCG meeting. Public Health England told them to self-isolate. This is a risk. \u201cThere would have been a day or two in between them coming into contact with the GP with coronavirus and being traced and told to self-isolate.\u201d A spokesman for Brighton and Hove CCG said there have been no new cases in the city for more than a week. He added: \u201cAll doctors and other primary care health workers in Brighton and Hove who were advised to \u2018self-isolate\u2019 as a precaution are expected to be returning to work this week.\u201d The two-week quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship ends on Wednesday, with thousands of passengers and crew set to disembark over the next several days in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. But a number of scientists told the Associated Press that the ship could have served as an incubator for Covid-19 instead of a quarantine facility that was meant to prevent the worsening of the outbreak. \u201cI suspect people were not as isolated from other people as we would have thought,\u201d said Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, in England. \u201cObviously the quarantine hasn\u2019t worked, and this ship has now become a source of infection,\u201d said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an outbreak expert at King\u2019s College London. She said the exact mechanism of the virus\u2019s spread was unknown. \u201cWe need to understand how the quarantine measures onboard were implemented, what the air filtration onboard is like, how the cabins are connected and how waste products are disposed of,\u201d MacDermott added. A small number of Irish people are onboard two cruise ships where coronavirus has been detected, the Irish government has said, according to a report by PA Media. Simon Coveney said his foreign affairs department was in contact with citizens on the Diamond Princess in Japan and the Westerdam off Cambodia. He told RT\u00c9\u2019s Morning Ireland: It\u2019s a small number though, and we\u2019re dealing with each individual case. There is a second cruise ship off Cambodia, we\u2019re working with Irish nationals on both of those ships to make sure they\u2019re safe. And if they\u2019re in quarantine, to make sure those conditions are safe. The department said in a statement: We are closely following the events concerning the Diamond Princess and we are in contact with the Irish citizens concerned. We are continuing to liaise closely with like-minded countries, EU partners, and the health authorities in Japan and here in Ireland concerning the best course of action. Hundreds of people have tested positive for the virus onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess. The Associated Press has reported the latest breakdown of the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 73,000 people worldwide. Here are the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority as of Tuesday morning (UK time): Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death Macao: 10 Japan: 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death Singapore: 77 cases Thailand: 35 South Korea: 31 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 22 cases, 1 death Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 cases France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 cases United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 cases Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Another 88 passengers onboard the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the new coronavirus, ABC News reports. The son of the British couple who tested positive for the coronavirus while on board the Diamond Princess described the government\u2019s response as \u201cappalling\u201d. David and Sally Abel, who published video diaries from a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan, said they have tested positive for the new coronavirus. Their son, Steve, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cMy assessment of the government treatment to them \u2026 appalling. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything. They probably are behind the scenes, which is great if they are, but no one is communicating with us. The FCO have got my number, my wife\u2019s number, my brother\u2019s number, my sister\u2019s number and they haven\u2019t got back to us on anything. We\u2019ve been calling them every day for about four or five days.\u201d David Abel, from Oxfordshire, announced on Facebook that he and Sally had tested positive for the new virus. In a later post, however, he said he doubted his diagnosis. \u201cFrankly I think this is a setup! We are NOT being taken to a hospital but a hostel. That\u2019s where partners are sent waiting out their quarantine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo phone, no wifi and no medical facilities. I really am smelling a very big rat here! Waiting for the transfer now.\u201d Asked in the comments below one of his posts whether he was sure the test was positive, he replied: \u201cI doubt it was positive. If it was, we would be in hospital.\u201d Philippines\u2019 tourism and travel industry is projected to lose billions of peso with the temporary travel ban imposed on travellers from China, in the aftermath of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Apple has announced it could miss its revenues target in the first quarter of 2020 because of the coronavirus outbreak. European shares dropped as a revenue warning from the iPhone maker sent \u201cshockwaves through the tech sector\u201d. Reuters reports: The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.8% by 0803 GMT, having ended at a record high on Monday after China outlined fresh stimulus measures to mitigate the virus\u2019 economic impact. However, Apple\u2019s warning that it would miss its March quarter sales outlook due to the outbreak, along with news of a slower-than-expected recovery in the firm\u2019s Chinese factories swiftly culled any optimism. Apple\u2019s Frankfurt-listed shares dropped more than 6%, while those of STMicroelectronics NV and Dialog Semiconductor PLC, which supply components to Apple, fell 4% and 4.9%, respectively. The technology-heavy German stock index plunged 0.9%, while the European tech subindex fell 1.5%. David and Sally Abel, a British couple onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have tested positive for coronavirus, a day before passengers who tested negative were due to start leaving the ship after spending two weeks in quarantine. Abel, who has uploaded daily videos from the couple\u2019s cabin on social media, said in a Facebook post on Tuesday afternoon (local time): \u201cThere is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all xxx.\u201d The Abels\u2019 diagnosis came as the British government said it was preparing to send a plane to Japan to repatriate about 70 British nationals from the ship, which has been moored off Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February. The vessel, originally carrying 3,700 passengers and crew, was quarantined after a previous passenger tested positive for Covid-19 at the end of last month. Abel has used his video posts to apply pressure on Britain to evacuate its citizens. The US has evacuated more than 300 citizens, while Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Canada have said they will follow suit. The Foreign Office said: \u201cGiven the conditions onboard, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately.\u201d Japanese health authorities said on Tuesday they had collected samples from everyone on the ship and that the planned evacuation of passengers who tested negative would begin as scheduled on Wednesday and be completed by the end of the week. By Monday, 454 people on the ship had tested positive, but the final number of infections onboard has not been announced. Four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan, according to the latest official figures. Among the remaining passengers and crew, those whose tests come back negative will be allowed to leave, while those found to be infected will be treated at hospitals in Japan. However, people who had close contact with those who have tested positive will have their quarantine reset to the date of their last contact with an infected person. The large number of cases onboard the Diamond Princess has prompted criticism of Japan\u2019s decision to keep everyone on the ship throughout the two-week quarantine. But the government\u2019s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters on Tuesday the measure had been \u201cappropriate\u201d. The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Tuesday there was a \u201ccredible risk\u201d the coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic, Reuters reports. \u201cThis is both a working assumption and a credible risk,\u201d Veran told France Info radio, when asked about the possibility of the coronavirus spreading globally. He said France was ready to deal with all the possibilities and its health system was sufficiently robust and well-equipped. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or tweet me at @aamnamohdin I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing from travellers who have booked flights to China and are currently in limbo. Taiwan has urged the World Health Organization not to be \u201ckidnapped\u201d by China, as the self-ruled island fights its label as an infected area. Taiwan has reported 22 cases, compared with China\u2019s figure of more than 72,400, but the island shares the agency\u2019s classification of China as \u201cvery high risk\u201d since the WHO considers Taiwan as part of China. \u201cTaiwan is not ruled by China and certainly should not be labelled as an infected area,\u201d the foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told a news conference, according to a report by Reuters. \u201cWe urge the WHO to be professional and neutral: break away from China\u2019s unreasonable claim. Don\u2019t be kidnapped by China.\u201d Taipei is already in dispute with Beijing over its exclusion from the WHO because of objections by China, which considers Taiwan its own territory and has blocked the island\u2019s membership of many international bodies. Countries including El Salvador, Mongolia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have adopted travel curbs for people who have visited Taiwan, while the island\u2019s largest airline is included in an Italian ban on flights from China. Ou said the WHO should immediately correct its \u201cinappropriate label\u201d for the island, which was continuing to press Italy to resume flights. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the live blog from Martin Farrer. Britons David and Sally Abel, who are on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, have tested positive for Covid-19. Abel, who has been posting regular video updates from the quarantined ship, said on Facebook: \u201cThere is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all.\u201d The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it is \u201cworking to organise\u201d a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the ship who have tested negative. The department has come under increasing pressure to fly home the 74 Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US repatriated 340 of its citizens. The department said in a statement: Given the conditions onboard, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately. On Monday, a No 10 spokesman said those onboard the ship docked near Yokohama, Japan, were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. Shanghai\u2019s government says the city\u2019s schools, which have been closed for three weeks, will remain closed and will begin teaching primary and secondary school students online from 2 March. Lu Jing, head of the Shanghai education committee, revealed the decision at a briefing on Tuesday, according to reports. No date has been given for the proper reopening of schools. I\u2019m about to hand over to my colleagues in London so here are the main developments of the last eight hours or so: China has recorded 98 more deaths from the Covid-19 outbreak, taking the number of victims to 1,868. Health officials confirmed another 1,886 new confirmed infections , bringing the total on the mainland to 72,436. More than 12,000 have recovered. A senior hospital doctor in Wuhan has died from the virus. A \u201cdragnet-style\u201d operation has been launched in Wuhan to roundup all people infected with the virus. The UK government is evacuating its citizens from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. South Korea, Canada and Australia gave more details of similar operations. Japan, which has 454 cases of the virus, is to trial HIV retroviral drugs on infected people. Hong Kong is to boost its Covid-19 emergency fund from HK$28bn (US$3.60bn) from HK$25bn. Singapore Airlines is cutting flights to major cities such as London, Frankfurt and Los Angeles as the virus continues to impact international travel. Asian stock markets have suffered losses after Apple said the factory shutdowns in China was causing a shortage of iPhones. Apple\u2019s announcement on Monday night that the Covid-19 outbreak was causing a shortage of iPhones has hit tech stocks in Asia. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 1.4% for the day on Tuesday and Seoul finished down by a chunky 1.5%. The South Korean president Moon Jae-in said earlier that the economy faced an \u201cemergency\u201d situation because of the virus and the government would be making an all-out effort to boost growth. They\u2019re still trading in China where the Shanghai Composite is off 0.14% while the Hang Seng has fallen 1.35%. The FTSE100 is expected to shed 0.6% at the opening this morning and on Wall Street the Dow Jones is looking at a similar fall after having Monday off for President\u2019s Day. \u201cApple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,\u201d Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters. \u201cIf Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.\u201d HSBC, the international bank based in Hong Kong and London, has reported a fall 30% fall in profits for the last financial year. HSBC said its 2019 pre-tax profits fell by a third on year to $13.3 billion as interim chief Noel Quinn warned that the global banking giant was \u201cnot delivering acceptable returns\u201d. Most of the loss was a \u201cgoodwill impairment\u201d on its business in Europe. In his comments, chairman Mark Tucker said the \u201cmacroeconomic environment\u201d was uncertain and that the bank had lowered its growth forecast for Asia because of the Covid-19 outbreak. As a result of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, we have lowered our expectations for growth in the Asian economy in 2020. The main impact will be in the first quarter, but we expect some improvement as the virus becomes contained From Justin McCurry in Tokyo: Japan is to trial HIV antiretroviral drugs to treat people with coronavirus, the government said on Tuesday, as the number of infections in the country reached 520, including 454 cases onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, said the government was \u201ccurrently conducting preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible\u201d. Suga said he couldn\u2019t comment on how long it would take for the new drug to be approved. Doctors in Thailand said they appeared to have had some success in treating severe cases of the coronavirus with a combination of influenza medication and HIV antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir. Thai doctors used an lopinavir-ritonavir combination along with the flu drug oseltamivir - also known as Tamiflu - to treat a Chinese coronavirus patient in her 70s, the Thai ministry of public health said in a report this month, according to Japan\u2019s Nikkei Asian Review. The woman\u2019s condition had not improved 10 days after she was diagnosed, but she recovered within 48 hours of being treated with the combination of HIV and flu drugs, the report said. A senior doctor treating patients in Wuhan has died from the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cLiu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang hospital, died at 10.30am this morning after resuscitation efforts failed,\u201d reported the China Central Television\u2019s microblog. A hospital director in Hubei province has also died of the virus, it was confirmed, as the authorities in the city step up their attempts to roundup everyone infected. My colleague Verna Yu has the full story here: Singapore Airlines is following Cathay Pacific and other airlines by temporarily cutting flights across its global network in the three months until May, it said on Tuesday, blaming the Covid-19 outbreak. The main affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo. \u201cSingapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary.\u201d Earlier I posted on the development of what appears to be an app-based health checking system in China. A reader has been in touch to tell me that such a system has been in place in the southern city of Shenzhen for a couple of weeks. It has worked like this. QR codes were put up on the bulletin boards of residential communities with people advised to scan the codes and then visit a website and enter their phone numbers, after which they would receive a text message confirming their movements. Once they\u2019d done this, residents could then register with the local administration and be allowed a transit pass to get back into their own communities. Since 1 February, movement has been greatly restricted in Guangdong. On Saturday the province introduced \u201creal name\u201d verification just to ride the metro. More from the Australian minister\u2019s press call. He was asked if those passengers on the ship were angry at having to be placed in quarantine despite already having been isolated on the ship for two weeks. Health minister Greg Hunt says he understands their frustration and a mental health hotline and counselling service has been set up for them. But because of ongoing infections on the ship where 454 people have been infected, \u201cthere was no choice\u201d. Hunt says: The medical advice from theAustralian Health Protection Principals Committee was clear and categorical, that an additional period of 14 days would be required. They have our deep sympathy. It must have been a very, very difficult time. And for many it would be frustrating. But we need to protect and support those Australians who have been on the ship, whilst protecting and supporting the entire containment arrangement in Australia. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is also at the briefing and he\u2019s asked if it\u2019s possible that the passengers \u2013 because of the growing number of cases on the ship \u2013 are more contagious than the Wuhan evacuees. Prof Murphy says it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d but adds that all the evacuees have tested negative and have also had a \u201cproper throat swab sent to the lab and they\u2019ll all have a health screen. We suspect that the risk for most of them is very low. But because some of them may have been exposed, we\u2019re doing this quarantine. So, potentially there might be a slightly higher risk, but if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re absolutely well-prepared for it. Australia health minister, Greg Hunt, is giving details about how its citizens are going to be evacuated from the Diamond Princess. Speaking in Darwin in the Northern territory, Hunt says the government is \u201ctalking to all of the Australian passengers on the Diamond Princess today\u201d and it expects to have about 200 people on board an evacuation flight. \u201cIt could be less. It could be a few more. But at this stage foreign affairs is going through the process of contacting everybody. And once we have final numbers, we\u2019ll provide them immediately.\u201d Once they arrive back in Australia, Hunt says, they will be quarantined at Howard Springs for 14 days. The last 36 people quarantined on Christmas Island \u2013 people who were evacuated from Wuhan two weeks ago \u2013 will be moved tomorrow, Hunt says, after 242 were repatriated on Monday. \u201cIt was a really great example of the Australian spirit. Those who were quarantined, those who were taking care of them. And I understand it was a very emotional time at the departure, and they bonded and went very well. The remaining 36 are due to leave tomorrow. Then it takes some time to prepare the facility in case more - there are more people required to fill the spaces.\u201d The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said on Tuesday morning that it would evacuate citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and urged travellers who wish to be flown home to contact officials, writes Rebecca Ratcliffe, our south-east Asia correspondent. More than 450 passengers onboard the ship have now been infected with the virus - the biggest cluster of cases outside of mainland China. In a statement, the FCO said: Given the conditions on board, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately. The British government has come under mounting pressure to fly citizens back from the UK, with several other countries already announcing plans to do so. The US flew more than 300 American citizens out on Sunday, 14 of whom tested positive for the virus before getting on the plane. Passengers onboard the ship have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February. Affected British nationals should call the British Embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100, the FCO said. Alibaba, the huge Chinese technology company, appears to be rolling out a health check app which will help authorities keep track of the virus as people return to work. Beginning in Alibaba\u2019s base city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, its subsidiary Alipay \u2013 China\u2019s Paypal \u2013 will \u201cprovide development support for a national health code system\u201d which will track people\u2019s self-quarantine based on basic health information and travel history, according to the website Technode. People will be required to self-report their health and travel history over the past few weeks into the app. So as people return to work, companies will be asked to keep track of their employees\u2019 health and allow the government to monitor people who they think could be at risk of being infected, perhaps from knowledge of proximity with an infected person. Once registered \u2013 it\u2019s not clear if the system is mandatory or not \u2013 a resident would receive a coloured code. Residents with a green code means they are allowed to move around the city freely. Yellow means a seven-day quarantine, and red requires a 14-day quarantine. This tweet suggests what it looks like: I\u2019m indebted to a reader, Drew Gough, for spotting this. Drew lived in Hangzhou for two years while working for Alibaba. He says that a friend in Shanghai has received a text message \u2013 along with all other residents of the city \u2013 saying that it is mandatory to wear a face mask at all times while outside, and failure to do so was breaking the law and punishable by up to 10 days being detained. The Alipay health code is also being rolled out in Shanghai, according to Technode. South Korea is sending the presidential jet to evacuate its citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, according to the Yonhap news agency. Speaking in Seoul on Tuesday, president Moon Jae-in said the economy faced an \u201cemergency\u201d situation because of the virus and the government would be making an all-out effort to boost growth. \u201c(The government) shouldn\u2019t quibble over whether anything is unprecedented or not, rather, we should take every possible measure we can think of on the table to deploy them,\u201d Moon said in a cabinet meeting, Reuters reports. Last week, the governor of the Bank of Korea said the central bank was working on financial aid packages for those sectors directly affected by the spreading coronavirus. The carmakers Hyundai and Kia were forced to suspend production at their plants because of a lack of components from China although output has been resumed after parts were sourced from elsewhere in Asia and some Chinese factories reopened. The local Kospi stock market index has taken a decent hit today. It is down 1.35%. In Japan, our correspondent Justin McCurry reports on how the outbreak has disrupted the planned celebrations of the emperor\u2019s 60th birthday. Justin writes: Birthday celebrations for Japan\u2019s new emperor have become the latest victim of the coronavirus outbreak. The imperial household agency said Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako would not appear in public to mark his 60th birthday on Sunday due to concerns over the possible spread of the virus among large groups of people. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the imperial palace in Tokyo. Naruhito\u2019s birthday address would have been his first since he ascended the Chrysanthemum throne on 1 May after his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese emperor to abdicate in more than 200 years. The emperor\u2019s birthday is a rare opportunity for the public to see senior members of the imperial family at the palace. Naruhito and Masako were due to greet well-wishers from a palace balcony three times on Sunday, along with the crown prince and his family. \u201cWe made the decision to cancel the public event at the palace, which is attended every year by many people in close proximity, after considering the risk of the virus spreading,\u201d Kenji Ikeda, the vice grand steward of the agency, said at a press conference, according to the Kyodo news agency. The last time the emperor\u2019s birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, amid a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. The agency\u2019s decision to scrap the celebrations comes after Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said people should avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. \u201cWe want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings,\u201d Kato said. \u201cWe want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places.\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has boosted the funds available to tackle the coronavirus outbreak to HK$28bn (US$3.60bn) from HK$25bn pledged previously to ease the impact on the city\u2019s battered economy. Lam last week had said the government would give one-off payments to businesses across the city and the hospital authority. One person has died from the virus in Hong Kong and 60 people have been infected. The numbers are very small compared with China but the city is facing an economic crisis with the double hit of the virus and last year\u2019s street protests. Visitor numbers have fallen off a cliff. After a very strong day yesterday when they were buoyed by more central bank stimulus, China\u2019s stock markets have dipped a bit today. The Shanghai Composite is off 0.2% although the Shenzhen Composite, which is more tech heavy, has just gone back into positive territory. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng is down 1%. Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, losses have widened from the last time I updated the scoreboard. The Nikkei is down 1% now and the Kospi in Seoul is off 1.3%. Sydney is still down 0.2%, but no doubt saved from further falls by publication of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia today which painted a gloomy picture of the economy, especially on consumer demand. Policymakers are ready with more stimulus, which investors just love. Bad news is good news, folks. The bank also warned about downside cornavirus risks. In China, the fight to contain the virus is continuing despite encouragement that the number of new cases has fallen below 2,000 for the first time since January. The Global Times newspaper reports that a \u201cdragnet style\u201d operation is under way in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to make sure all those infected are \u201crounded up\u201d. The operation was ordered by the city\u2019s new party chief, Wang Zhonglin, on Sunday and aims to be completed in three days. Big data and AI would be used to assist the operation. Here is what the news outlet reported yestedray: The three-day campaign aims to fulfill five objectives: have all suspected victims receive nucleic acid tests; round up all infected patients; check all patients with fever; put under quarantine anyone who has had close contact with patients; and ensure all communities and villages implement 24-hour closed-off management measures. It is not all gloom and doom in the economics department. It seems that in Hong Kong, where toilet paper is running short, some manufacturers are doing quite well. The Hong Kong-listed paper maker Vinda has seen its shares rise 41% this year. This follows an armed raid on a truck load of toilet rolls in Hong Kong amid panic-buying of necessities. A flight has left Canada to evacuate its citizens aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer has said in the last hour. Dr Theresa Tam said Canada would evacuate asymptomatic Canadians and they would undergo a 14-day quarantine at Cornwall airbase in Ontario. It follows similar moves by the US and Australia to evacuate people from the ship on which 454 people have been infected with the virus. Asian stock markets have seen a dip this morning after Apple\u2019s announcement that the outbreak was causing shortages of the iPhone and that it would fail to meet its revenue target for this quarter. The Nikkei in Tokyo fell 0.6% this morning and the ASX200 was down 0.2% in Sydney. Seoul was down 0.56%. Chinese and Hong Kong markets open shortly. Apple\u2019s announcement follows a profit waring from Cathay Pacific on Monday. The Hong Kong-based airline, already hit hard by the city\u2019s protest movement, has cancelled 40% of its flights this month and next because of the virus. BHP, the world\u2019s biggest mining company, said that it might have to cut its growth forecasts for the year if the outbreak is not contained in the March quarter. But ... stock markets have weathered the coronavirus outbreak without too much alarm because investors have bet that central banks, led by China, will pump enough stimulus back into their economies to make sure things stay on an even keel. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates last year and that has helped fuel a boom in the US economy which is also helping to shrug off fears about a China slowdown. There are rumbling concerns that passengers who were allowed to leave the cruise ship MV Westerdam in Cambodia may yet be infected with the virus. UK officials are trying to contact Britons who disembarked after experts said the checking process may not have been handled properly. One person tested positive after leaving the vessel, which was refused by five countries due to concerns that passengers were infected. Mark Harris, a professor of virology at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cIf you have got people who are infected at an early stage they might not test positive, they might not show any symptoms but they could go on to develop full-blown disease.\u201d Check out our full story here: The latest figures show that more than 12,000 people have recovered from the infection out of a total of more than 73,000 who have contracted it. We have to assume that many more will recover if we factor in the latest comments by the head of the World Health Organization. Speaking in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said data from China had helped form a \u201ca clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d and that it appeared that four out of five people infected would recover. It was not as deadly as Sars or Mers, he said, adding: More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,. The risk of death increases the older you are. Our health editor, Sarah Boseley, has the full story here: Those national health commission figures have been released in the last few minutes. 98 new fatalities were recorded on Monday, the commission said on Tuesday morning, taking the death toll in mainland China rose to 1,868. There were 93 deaths in Hubei, 72 of them in the capital Wuhan where the outbreak started. Across mainland China, there were 1,886 new confirmed infections on Monday, bringing the total so far to 72,436, the commission said. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the Covid-19 outbreak, which we can start by relaying the latest figures from the health commission in Hubei. It said on Tuesday morning that 93 more deaths were recorded on Monday, taking the total in the stricken province to 1,789. Another 1,807 cases were added as well for a total in the province of 59,989. Those numbers are lower than the figures from Sunday (100 deaths and 1,933 new cases) so will give some encouragement to China\u2019s efforts to lockdown its citizens and contain the spread. But these are, of course, only the figures from the health commission and must be treated with some caution. We haven\u2019t got the national figures from China yet but we expect them to be out soon. The other key developements are The WHO says the virus causes only mild disease in 80% of people and has a markedly greater imnpact on older people. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said data from China had helped form a \u201ca clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d. UK officials are trying to track Britons who left the MV Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia amid fears the virus could have spread more widely than thought. Another 99 people have tested positive on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess Apple has warned of a shortage of iPhones due to factory closures in China. Germany\u2019s central bank has warned about the risk to the country\u2019s economy amid already slowing orders from China. China is considering delaying its annual people\u2019s congress, set for 5 March in Beijing. The Tokyo Marathon has been scaled down to just elite runners.",

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has warned it could run out of car parts at its British factories at the end of next week, as the coronavirus halts supplies from China. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker added its voice to a chorus of companies counting the cost of the outbreak, as the epidemic weighs heavily on international business and trade. \u201cWe are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have \u2026 parts missing,\u201d said the JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth. He added: \u201cWe have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK.\u201d Speth added that the company was currently making no sales in China, one of its most important markets. Apple cut its sales forecasts on Monday and could be set for further pain after its major iPhone supplier said quarantine protocols meant it was struggling to squeeze as many workers into its factory dormitories as usual. Elsewhere, the Parisian fashion house Chanel said it had shelved a forthcoming Beijing fashion show over coronavirus fears. As the ecomonic fallout spread, a series of companies and politicians conceded that disruption to day-to-day operations was inescapable: HSBC said it expected its sizeable Asian operations to take a financial hit in 2020 The world\u2019s largest miner, BHP, said global demand could slow South Korea proposed emergency steps to protect its economy Wall\u2019s and Richmond sausages company Kerry Group warned on revenues The UK accounting watchdog told UK firms to assess the impact of the virus on their business Energy services group Tekmar slashed its profit forecasts. Speth said JLR had enough parts from China to maintain its British production for the next two weeks but not beyond. The firm has three UK plants \u2013 Halewood on Merseyside, and Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the Midlands \u2013 but did not say if they might have to close or reduce production. \u201cIf you think back to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, there were critical parts coming from Japan, so Japanese producers shut down in the UK,\u201d said Prof David Bailey, of Birmingham Business School. \u201cIt depends whether they have second sourcing agreements to get parts elsewhere and whether they can flex those.\u201d Apple has been among the hardest hit of the world\u2019s major companies. The smartphone maker said on Monday that the coronavirus may have shaved billions of dollars off global sales. Apple said it may not hit its sales forecast of between $63bn (\u00a348bn) and $67bn for the quarter ending this June, citing uncertainty caused by the epidemic. Its key iPhone supplier, Foxconn, has switched some of its production to making surgical masks instead of smartphones, but is reportedly struggling to get its production lines back up to speed. It usually fits eight workers into each dormitory at its factory in Zhengzhou but quarantine measures mean each now has to have their own room, the Financial Times reported. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe said Apple\u2019s forecast was \u201clikely the first of many profit warnings as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in the world\u2019s second largest economy\u201d. Analysts have suggested that Apple\u2019s South Korean rival Samsung could benefit from the US firm\u2019s supply chain issues. But the South Korean domestic economy is far from isolated from the outbreak\u2019s effects. A day after economic forecasters warned Japan was facing a recession due to regional disruption to trade, South Korea\u2019s president, President Moon Jae-in, told members of his administration that the country needed to take \u201cemergency\u201d steps. George Magnus, associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre, said: \u201cThe knock-on effects from Chinese demand grinding to a halt are most acute for Hong Kong, but also for Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore \u2013 and Brazil as a commodity producer.\u201d He said affected economies would recover from the impact quickly if restrictions imposed by Beijing were lifted within a few months. \u201cBut if it turns out that China sustained the clampdown regime into the early summer or beyond, then the cumulative effects would increase significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cA Chinese recession \u2013 unheard of \u2013 would send shockwaves through the world economy. Hopefully though that\u2019s a low-probability scenario.\u201d The coronavirus has already had a complex effect on global trade, hitting tourism and retail sales in the huge Chinese market. It has also caused the cancellation of industry events such as the tech sector\u2019s annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The latest global name to cancel its plans was Chanel, whose models were due to show off its latest designs at a show in Beijing in May. Chanel said the 31 rue Cambon 2019/20 M\u00e9tiers d\u2019art collection, which has already been shown in Paris, would be displayed at a \u201clater and more appropriate moment\u201d, but did not give a new date. \u201cAt the foremost are the health and well-being of its teams and clients,\u201d the company said. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK\u2019s accounting watchdog, has told the UK\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d auditors to ensure they have plans in place to analyst the effect of the outbreak on firms with operations in China. A string of companies offered updates alongside their financial results. Uncertainty about the length of the crisis is one of the largest hurdles, according to HSBC, which said on Tuesday that disruption for staff, suppliers and customers could hurt profits in 2020. Group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said: \u201cWe expect to take additional loan loss provisions as a result of the coronavirus and the weakened outlook for the Hong Kong economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a call on how long does it take to contain the virus, and certainly some of the latest data has given us more optimism on that over the last week or so.\u201d The chief executive of BHP, the world\u2019s largest mining group, said the company could be affected by falling demand if the virus is not contained by the end of March. As a major supplier of raw materials, BHP\u2019s fortunes are affected by economic growth patterns, particularly in large economies such as China. Irish food ingredients company Kerry Group, which makes Richmond sausages, said its Chinese revenues were likely to slump by 30% in the first quarter of the year. It has five factories in China and has been operating with a skeleton staff, it said. Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels Group has closed or partially closed 160 out of its 470 hotels in mainland China and said it expects a short-term hit from the outbreak. The company said in January that it would allow customers to change or cancel stays in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan up to 3 February, at no additional cost. Shares in Tekmar, a tech firm that serves offshore energy projects in China, fell by more than 20% after it cut profit forecasts, citing disruption to its shipments and supply chain. China accounts for 10% of its expected revenues. Chairman Alasdair MacDonald said the effect on the business had been \u201cunpredictable and rapid\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2020 because an earlier version said that Kerry Group made Wall\u2019s Ice Cream, whereas it is a Unilever product.",

      "body": "<p>Unknown T, until recently one of the brightest prospects in the UK drill scene, has been cleared of murdering a university student at New Year\u2019s Eve party in London.</p> <p>The rapper, real name Daniel Lena, 20, had been accused of knifing Steve Narvaez-Jara, 20, in the heart at a house party near Old Street, Islington, in the early hours of 1 January 2018.</p> <p>Mr Narvaez-Jara, an engineering student at the University of Hertfordshire, was dragged to the floor after Mohammed Musse \u2013 who was charged alongside Lena and another man, Ramani Boreland \u2013 allegedly tried to chat up a guest\u2019s girlfriend.</p> <p>A Snapchat video taken by a party-goer capturing the fatal attack, captioned \u201cbeef got crackin\u201d, was played during the trial at the Old Bailey. It showed attackers wielding large wooden objects in the middle of a crowded room. A witness, who cannot be named, told the court that there were around 100 people at the party when the fight broke out, also involving a machete.</p> <p>Lena rose to fame in the months following the murder with hit track Homerton B, one of the definitive tracks of the British rap subgenre UK drill. Its video has been viewed more than 20m times on YouTube, and he performed the track at London\u2019s 20,000-capacity O2 Arena during a guest appearance at a Drake concert. He has also collaborated with Brit-nominated rapper AJ Tracey. Lena was arrested and charged with murder last July, days after performing at the Wireless festival in Finsbury Park.</p> <p>Giving evidence, Lena had insisted he had nothing to do with Narvaez-Jara\u2019s death, that he did not punch anyone and had no knowledge of anyone armed with a machete at the party.</p> <p>Lena and Boreland were cleared of murder, but Boreland was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to two. Another man, Mohammed Musse, was convicted of violent disorder. Musse and Boreland will be sentenced at a later date.</p> <p>In 2017, aged 17, Lena was cleared of hiding a 4mm revolver and ammunition under his bed after claiming the gun was foisted upon him by a stranger.</p> <p>His murder charge made him the latest British rapper to be accused of knife-related crime in the recent past. Brit and Mercury-nominated rapper J Hus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/14/j-hus-jail-knife\">was sentenced to eight months</a> in prison in 2018 for carrying a knife, while the most successful rapper from the drill scene, Headie One, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/08/uk-drill-rapper-headie-one-jailed-for-six-months-for-carrying-knife\">is currently serving a six-month term</a> for a similar offence. Loski, who had one of drill\u2019s biggest hits with the track Forrest Gump, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/rapper-loski-tells-court-death-threats-forced-him-carry-gun\">currently on trial for allegedly carrying a loaded gun</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/28/drill-artist-unknown-t-the-energy-is-crazy-mans-on-top-of-the-world\">Speaking to the Guardian in 2018</a>, Lena complained that the drill scene \u2013 long the subject of criticism in the media \u2013 was being unfairly attacked. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the music, it\u2019s about what\u2019s behind the music. You can\u2019t blame the music, or say you\u2019re giving a helping hand with no aid. They\u2019re pointing the finger at us but forgetting there\u2019s three fingers pointing back.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unknown T, until recently one of the brightest prospects in the UK drill scene, has been cleared of murdering a university student at New Year\u2019s Eve party in London. The rapper, real name Daniel Lena, 20, had been accused of knifing Steve Narvaez-Jara, 20, in the heart at a house party near Old Street, Islington, in the early hours of 1 January 2018. Mr Narvaez-Jara, an engineering student at the University of Hertfordshire, was dragged to the floor after Mohammed Musse \u2013 who was charged alongside Lena and another man, Ramani Boreland \u2013 allegedly tried to chat up a guest\u2019s girlfriend. A Snapchat video taken by a party-goer capturing the fatal attack, captioned \u201cbeef got crackin\u201d, was played during the trial at the Old Bailey. It showed attackers wielding large wooden objects in the middle of a crowded room. A witness, who cannot be named, told the court that there were around 100 people at the party when the fight broke out, also involving a machete. Lena rose to fame in the months following the murder with hit track Homerton B, one of the definitive tracks of the British rap subgenre UK drill. Its video has been viewed more than 20m times on YouTube, and he performed the track at London\u2019s 20,000-capacity O2 Arena during a guest appearance at a Drake concert. He has also collaborated with Brit-nominated rapper AJ Tracey. Lena was arrested and charged with murder last July, days after performing at the Wireless festival in Finsbury Park. Giving evidence, Lena had insisted he had nothing to do with Narvaez-Jara\u2019s death, that he did not punch anyone and had no knowledge of anyone armed with a machete at the party. Lena and Boreland were cleared of murder, but Boreland was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to two. Another man, Mohammed Musse, was convicted of violent disorder. Musse and Boreland will be sentenced at a later date. In 2017, aged 17, Lena was cleared of hiding a 4mm revolver and ammunition under his bed after claiming the gun was foisted upon him by a stranger. His murder charge made him the latest British rapper to be accused of knife-related crime in the recent past. Brit and Mercury-nominated rapper J Hus was sentenced to eight months in prison in 2018 for carrying a knife, while the most successful rapper from the drill scene, Headie One, is currently serving a six-month term for a similar offence. Loski, who had one of drill\u2019s biggest hits with the track Forrest Gump, is currently on trial for allegedly carrying a loaded gun. Speaking to the Guardian in 2018, Lena complained that the drill scene \u2013 long the subject of criticism in the media \u2013 was being unfairly attacked. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the music, it\u2019s about what\u2019s behind the music. You can\u2019t blame the music, or say you\u2019re giving a helping hand with no aid. They\u2019re pointing the finger at us but forgetting there\u2019s three fingers pointing back.\u201d",

When it happens to me, sometimes I can ignore it. But I felt the other week that actually I have a responsibility to all of the African Caribbean women coming in behind me.

But if you haven\u2019t got anybody in the room who can identify Dawn Butler as different from Marsha de Cordova, then you need to have somebody in the room who can, so you need to make that adjustment \u2026 It was not about making a mistake, it is about making an effort.\u201d</p> <p>Butler has previously spoken of racist incidents in parliament in which she was asked to get out of an MPs\u2019 lift because she was assumed to be a cleaner and another in which a police officer had to apologise after escorting her out of the MPs\u2019 tearoom.</p> <p>She said she had a habit of reciting the words from Labi Siffre\u2019s Something Inside so Strong at meetings, hustings, and even in the House of Commons because it had previously been her private theme tune to say to herself whenever she was entering a hostile room.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I will stand in the doorway of the room, and I will own the room before I walk in it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that when people are attacking me, or when people are dismissive of the fact that I am an MP or dismissive of the fact that I\u2019ve earned my right to be in the room, I know I\u2019ve already owned the room so that they\u2019re less likely to undermine who I am. My dad was a musician and so my politics comes from music. And I think every resistance movement, every uprising, has its own soundtrack.\u201d</p> <p>She said as a black woman in politics: \u201cI am judged more harshly and suffer more racial abuse because I am black and because I am a woman and because I don\u2019t just hide away in a corner and not say anything when I\u2019m being racially abused.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was \u201cshocking, but it\u2019s not surprising\u201d that Labour had not had a black person in a leadership position before \u201cbecause there\u2019s been so few minority MPs\u201d. But she said this should change given the influx of black, Asian and minority ethnic MPs in the last few years.</p> <p>Butler said she had thought about standing for the leadership because of encouragement from colleagues but felt her campaign would have lagged behind because she had not prepared.</p> <p>She also hit out at the structure of the leadership campaign, saying it favoured wealthy candidates and put those from working class backgrounds at a disadvantage.</p> <p>\u201cIt is stressful and expensive. I am completely overdrawn because you have to fund everything yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThe system itself is weighted against people who are working class and who haven\u2019t got the trade union backing or family with money \u2013 which is bad for the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>She said candidates had to fund their own travel and hotel when going round the country to persuade local parties to back them, and suggested Labour should help bear the cost to even the playing field.</p> <p>Butler made it through the second round by gaining the support of more than 70 local parties but suggested the whole process should be streamlined to just put candidates straight to a vote of the membership.</p> <p>Asked if she would scrap the 2018 reforms to the process that introduced new hurdles, she said: \u201cGranted, this could be kind of biased because I\u2019m in the midst of it right now, but yes, 100% I would scrap this process. And I do think that if as MPs we are committed enough and brave enough to put ourselves forward, then the members should just decide.\u201d</p> <p>Butler is considered on the left of the party but has won support from local parties in combination with all of the different leadership candidates from Rebecca Long-Bailey to Lisa Nandy.</p> <p>In terms of her views on the deputy role, she said a reorganisation of party structures was needed to give regions more independence, more technology in campaigning and Labour MPs should be clear that if they defect to another party, they must resign their seat.</p> <p>Referring to MPs who left the Labour party partly over Corbyn\u2019s leadership, she said: \u201cIf we have MPs who have decided that they are going to resign because they don\u2019t like who the members have selected [as leader], they should be subject to a byelection. It\u2019ll be a contract of employment almost.\u201d</p> <p>However, she stopped short of endorsing Long-Bailey\u2019s call for open selection of MPs, meaning they effectively have to reapply for their jobs at every election.</p> <p>She said she would like a citizens\u2019 assembly-style group to consider it but said careful attention must be paid to whether such a \u201csystem that may discriminate against women or black Asian minority ethnic people\u201d.</p> <p>Her very strong pro-trans rights position during the contest has caused some criticism from commentators, including her assertion that children are not born with a biological sex. But Butler said of the debate overall that she was sure there was \u201ca way that we can talk through the issues and come to a solution in a way that ensures everybody\u2019s rights are protected \u2013 not trans women\u2019s rights against other women\u2019s rights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe also have to be mindful that attacks against trans women have gone up exponentially over the last three years because of the Gender Recognition Act and so this is not an anti--women agenda. This is a pro-women agenda and our battles are not with each other.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy leadership candidate defended the party\u2019s 2019 manifesto, while acknowledging it had too many policies like a \u201cToby Carvery\u201d where too much is piled on the plate at once. And she warned that Labour must be careful in its position on Brexit and attempts to win back northern heartlands not to neglect its London and other metropolitan heartlands at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cI had somebody say to me, Dawn, I want you to be deputy leader because you visibly represent some of Labour\u2019s heartlands,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we often feel during the debate, that we are invisible and that we don\u2019t matter. And that our vote\u2019s being taken for granted.\u2019 So we have to be careful that we don\u2019t ignore other bits of Labour\u2019s heartlands. Because people can vote when they want to vote. And when somebody said that to me \u2026 I thought, yeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>",

And she warned that Labour must be careful in its position on Brexit and attempts to win back northern heartlands not to neglect its London and other metropolitan heartlands at the same time. \u201cI had somebody say to me, Dawn, I want you to be deputy leader because you visibly represent some of Labour\u2019s heartlands,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we often feel during the debate, that we are invisible and that we don\u2019t matter. And that our vote\u2019s being taken for granted.\u2019 So we have to be careful that we don\u2019t ignore other bits of Labour\u2019s heartlands. Because people can vote when they want to vote. And when somebody said that to me \u2026 I thought, yeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d",

The case against Britta Nielsen has shaken the self-image of a state that has for years been regarded as having the lowest rate of corruption in the world. State prosecutor Kia Reumert called the case \u201cone of the gravest instances of financial crime in Danish history\u201d. Nielsen was employed for 40 years as a case worker at Socialstyrelsen, Denmark\u2019s social services board, distributing funding to people in need. As recently as 2017 she was rewarded for her faithful services with the country\u2019s silver medal of merit. Allegations that Nielsen had siphoned away funds amounting to more than 121m kroner over the course of 25 years first emerged in August 2018. After being sacked from her job, Nielsen fled to South Africa but was arrested and extradited to Denmark in November 2018. During the course of her trial it emerged that Nielsen had embezzled funds by creating fictitious projects \u2013 one of them called \u201chelp for self-help\u201d \u2013 that she had then linked to her own bank accounts. Her defence has argued that the safeguards around welfare were too lax, and that both management and her colleagues knew how easy it was to siphon off money.

The Home Office has admitted that the phone access problems began on 13 January although it didn\u2019t begin distributing new sim cards until 5 February. Detention Action argues that potentially hundreds of detainees have been affected by a lack of access to justice as a result of this problem, not just those earmarked for last week\u2019s charter flight to Jamaica. Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said after the court hearing: \u201cWe had originally been told by the government they planned to appeal against the court of appeal\u2019s order last week which prevented some people from boarding the flight. We found out today that the Home Office abandoned that plan. \u201cWe took the opportunity to press for answers about whether the phone problems have been fixed and whether anyone has been removed without their right to access to justice upheld. The government now has to give us those answers by the end of this month.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What a coincidence. While the government threatens the existence of the BBC, forcing it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/24/bbc-newsnight-and-today-show-face-cuts-as-part-of-savings-drive\" title=\"\">cut back its news division</a>, along comes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/17/times-radio-hires-deputy-bbc-political-editor-john-pienaar\" title=\"\">news competitor</a> in the shape of Times Radio. Before we leap to the conclusion that the two initiatives represent a coordinated pincer movement against the corporation by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the Times\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch, let\u2019s stand back for a moment.</p> \n<p>Years ago, when Johnson\u2019s Downing Street ambitions looked less than likely, Murdoch\u2019s News UK chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, was already thinking about how to diversify its print operation. In 2016, when she oversaw the acquisition of a broadcasting outfit, the Wireless Group, she <a href=\"https://www.news.co.uk/2016/09/news-uk-announces-the-completion-of-wireless-group-acquisition/\" title=\"\">hinted at the strategy</a> by saying: \u201cIt will allow us to bolster our products by sharing the best journalistic content.\u201d</p> \n<p>So, Times Radio had a long gestation period before last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/28/the-times-to-launch-talk-radio-station-to-challenge-bbc-radio-4-times-radio-rupert-murdoch\" title=\"\">announcement</a> that the digital station is to be launched later this year, possibly before autumn. According to its launch director, Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement and former managing editor of the Sun, it will offer continuous news and current affairs coverage. Imagine BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, broadcast for three hours each weekday and two on Saturday, running for an anticipated 20-hour stretch.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/17/times-radio-hires-deputy-bbc-political-editor-john-pienaar\">Times Radio hires deputy BBC political editor John Pienaar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On face value then, it is fair to say that there is no explicit link between the arrival of Times Radio and the arrival of Johnson at No 10. But you don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see the political serendipity for a prime minister determined to bring the BBC to heel and a media mogul with a long history of antagonism towards the corporation. Way back in 1989, soon after his launch of Sky Television, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart lecture, in which he made his position clear. Public service broadcasting\u2019s role needed to be \u201cscaled down\u201d in favour of a market-led system.</p> \n<p>He has taken many opportunities ever since to underline his opposition to the \u201cdominance\u201d of the BBC. By happy chance, successive editors at his main newspapers, the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, have felt the same way as their boss, running continual anti-BBC propaganda.</p> \n<p>As for Johnson, he has been particularly critical of the BBC, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/statist-defeatist-biased-bbc-wrong-wavelength/\" title=\"\">once arguing</a> that \u201cthe prevailing view of Beeb newsrooms is, with honourable exceptions, statist, corporatist, defeatist, anti\u2013business, Europhile and, above all, overwhelmingly biased to the left\u201d. On <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/journalists-bbc-went-strike-news/\" title=\"\">another occasion</a>, illustrating his well-known ability to express mutually incompatible views at the same time, he managed to laud the BBC as \u201ca great national institution\u201d while contending that its news output drove him so mad he no longer bothered to watch or listen to its main bulletins or current affairs programmes.</p> \n<p>While Johnson muses over whether to scrap the broadcasting licence fee, and therefore put the BBC\u2019s future in jeopardy, he has emphasised his hostility to its news division by refusing to allow ministers to appear on the Today programme or BBC2\u2019s Newsnight. Appearances on the other mainstream news broadcasters are also restricted. However, will he treat Times Radio in similar fashion? It would not surprise me if a Johnson interview was lined up for launch day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51584d17-5803-4b8e-938c-e6c59047e87b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AXvbVqloKt8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is doubtful, however, that Times Radio will attempt to do for Johnson what Murdoch\u2019s rightwing US cable channel, Fox News, has done for Donald Trump. Not only would Britain\u2019s current broadcasting rules make that unfeasible, it would ruin the Times\u2019s brand, which harks back to the time when it purported to be the paper of record (notwithstanding its partisan backing for Johnson during the election campaign). Its aim, as Abell has stated, is to engage the current Times print and online readership while hoping to lure the audience now served by the BBC\u2019s news programmes across its various channels, notably Radios 4 and 5 Live. Its central objective is to attract subscribers.</p> \n<p>To that end, it has made lucrative offers to BBC news staff. Its first major recruit was Tim Levell, a former Radio 5 live editor, who will run the channel as programme director. Its second, announced this week, was John Pienaar, the BBC\u2019s able deputy political editor. Given that Pienaar is already paid more than \u00a3160,000, it\u2019s likely he was offered much more to jump ship after almost 20 years with the BBC.</p> \n<p>It would therefore appear that Brooks is investing very heavily in the project. More hirings from established broadcasters are evidently likely. Some Times writers will also be expected to perform and will, presumably, seek extra payment for the task.</p> \n<p>Times Radio will be free for people to access through a range of platforms, \u2013 DAB, online, app and smart speaker \u2013 and will not have advertising breaks. I understand there will \u201csponsorship opportunities\u201d for what are regarded as \u201cthe right partners in the right parts of the schedule\u201d, but the cost to News UK will surely be substantial. Although Abell, an accomplished broadcaster with LBC and Sky, as well as presenter of Radio 4\u2019s own Front Row arts show, believes it is a golden era for audio, with several competing national outlets and an increasing audience for podcasts, Times Radio is still something of a gamble.</p> \n<p>Within News UK, there will be memories of its failed attempt to extend its largest-selling print product into radio. In 2009, the company launched SunTalk, a radio show delivered through the Sun\u2019s website for three hours a day. It was shut down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/15/suntalk-shut-down\" title=\"\">after just 15 months</a>. The reason given was the need \u201cto focus on core operations\u201d. Times Radio represents the alternative view.</p> \n<p>Some Times readers do not appear overly happy about the current move. Several, expressing their continuing support for the BBC, commented sarcastically in the thread below the paper\u2019s online announcement. One wrote: \u201cThe Times complains endlessly about the BBC overreaching itself. Apparently, it\u2019s OK for the Times to do the same.\u201d Others worried about the possible advent of rightwing radio.</p> \n<p>In fairness, the Times\u2019s largely impartial stance during the run-up to the EU referendum and its fairly even-handed coverage in the following years of Brexit debate do not suggest that Times Radio will act as some kind of UK outpost for Fox News. But perception, as everyone in the media is aware, is often more important than reality. Since phone hacking, since the film and TV exposures of life at Fox News, since Trump was elected as president, Murdoch\u2019s public profile has become synonymous with the far right. In addition, we have a prime minister who is a sort of Trump-lite character.</p> \n<p>If Times Radio is to make its mark as a genuine alternative to the BBC, it will need to persuade the population that it is devoid of Murdochian influence and free from Johnsonian patronage. Having entered into broadcasting territory, that might well prove a difficult trick to pull off.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University and a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "What a coincidence. While the government threatens the existence of the BBC, forcing it to cut back its news division, along comes a news competitor in the shape of Times Radio. Before we leap to the conclusion that the two initiatives represent a coordinated pincer movement against the corporation by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the Times\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch, let\u2019s stand back for a moment. Years ago, when Johnson\u2019s Downing Street ambitions looked less than likely, Murdoch\u2019s News UK chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, was already thinking about how to diversify its print operation. In 2016, when she oversaw the acquisition of a broadcasting outfit, the Wireless Group, she hinted at the strategy by saying: \u201cIt will allow us to bolster our products by sharing the best journalistic content.\u201d So, Times Radio had a long gestation period before last month\u2019s announcement that the digital station is to be launched later this year, possibly before autumn. According to its launch director, Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement and former managing editor of the Sun, it will offer continuous news and current affairs coverage. Imagine BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, broadcast for three hours each weekday and two on Saturday, running for an anticipated 20-hour stretch. On face value then, it is fair to say that there is no explicit link between the arrival of Times Radio and the arrival of Johnson at No 10. But you don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see the political serendipity for a prime minister determined to bring the BBC to heel and a media mogul with a long history of antagonism towards the corporation. Way back in 1989, soon after his launch of Sky Television, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart lecture, in which he made his position clear. Public service broadcasting\u2019s role needed to be \u201cscaled down\u201d in favour of a market-led system. He has taken many opportunities ever since to underline his opposition to the \u201cdominance\u201d of the BBC. By happy chance, successive editors at his main newspapers, the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, have felt the same way as their boss, running continual anti-BBC propaganda. As for Johnson, he has been particularly critical of the BBC, once arguing that \u201cthe prevailing view of Beeb newsrooms is, with honourable exceptions, statist, corporatist, defeatist, anti\u2013business, Europhile and, above all, overwhelmingly biased to the left\u201d. On another occasion, illustrating his well-known ability to express mutually incompatible views at the same time, he managed to laud the BBC as \u201ca great national institution\u201d while contending that its news output drove him so mad he no longer bothered to watch or listen to its main bulletins or current affairs programmes. While Johnson muses over whether to scrap the broadcasting licence fee, and therefore put the BBC\u2019s future in jeopardy, he has emphasised his hostility to its news division by refusing to allow ministers to appear on the Today programme or BBC2\u2019s Newsnight. Appearances on the other mainstream news broadcasters are also restricted. However, will he treat Times Radio in similar fashion? It would not surprise me if a Johnson interview was lined up for launch day. It is doubtful, however, that Times Radio will attempt to do for Johnson what Murdoch\u2019s rightwing US cable channel, Fox News, has done for Donald Trump. Not only would Britain\u2019s current broadcasting rules make that unfeasible, it would ruin the Times\u2019s brand, which harks back to the time when it purported to be the paper of record (notwithstanding its partisan backing for Johnson during the election campaign). Its aim, as Abell has stated, is to engage the current Times print and online readership while hoping to lure the audience now served by the BBC\u2019s news programmes across its various channels, notably Radios 4 and 5 Live. Its central objective is to attract subscribers. To that end, it has made lucrative offers to BBC news staff. Its first major recruit was Tim Levell, a former Radio 5 live editor, who will run the channel as programme director. Its second, announced this week, was John Pienaar, the BBC\u2019s able deputy political editor. Given that Pienaar is already paid more than \u00a3160,000, it\u2019s likely he was offered much more to jump ship after almost 20 years with the BBC. It would therefore appear that Brooks is investing very heavily in the project. More hirings from established broadcasters are evidently likely. Some Times writers will also be expected to perform and will, presumably, seek extra payment for the task. Times Radio will be free for people to access through a range of platforms, \u2013 DAB, online, app and smart speaker \u2013 and will not have advertising breaks. I understand there will \u201csponsorship opportunities\u201d for what are regarded as \u201cthe right partners in the right parts of the schedule\u201d, but the cost to News UK will surely be substantial. Although Abell, an accomplished broadcaster with LBC and Sky, as well as presenter of Radio 4\u2019s own Front Row arts show, believes it is a golden era for audio, with several competing national outlets and an increasing audience for podcasts, Times Radio is still something of a gamble. Within News UK, there will be memories of its failed attempt to extend its largest-selling print product into radio. In 2009, the company launched SunTalk, a radio show delivered through the Sun\u2019s website for three hours a day. It was shut down after just 15 months. The reason given was the need \u201cto focus on core operations\u201d. Times Radio represents the alternative view. Some Times readers do not appear overly happy about the current move. Several, expressing their continuing support for the BBC, commented sarcastically in the thread below the paper\u2019s online announcement. One wrote: \u201cThe Times complains endlessly about the BBC overreaching itself. Apparently, it\u2019s OK for the Times to do the same.\u201d Others worried about the possible advent of rightwing radio. In fairness, the Times\u2019s largely impartial stance during the run-up to the EU referendum and its fairly even-handed coverage in the following years of Brexit debate do not suggest that Times Radio will act as some kind of UK outpost for Fox News. But perception, as everyone in the media is aware, is often more important than reality. Since phone hacking, since the film and TV exposures of life at Fox News, since Trump was elected as president, Murdoch\u2019s public profile has become synonymous with the far right. In addition, we have a prime minister who is a sort of Trump-lite character. If Times Radio is to make its mark as a genuine alternative to the BBC, it will need to persuade the population that it is devoid of Murdochian influence and free from Johnsonian patronage. Having entered into broadcasting territory, that might well prove a difficult trick to pull off. \u2022 Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University and a Guardian columnist",

Over two-thirds of migrants fleeing Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador suffered the murder, kidnapping or disappearance of a loved one before leaving, according to Doctors Without Borders.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders railed against his fellow Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg during his first 2020 campaign visit to Washington state, as the billionaire continues to rise in the polls despite mounting criticism over his past remarks about women and minorities. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published on Tuesday showed Sanders leading in the Democratic primary contest at 31% support nationally, with Bloomberg surging into second place with 19% support. But the two put forward starkly different visions for the future of the Democratic party, and a post-Trump America. More than 17,000 attendees packed into the arena in Tacoma, a city south of Seattle, on Monday evening to see Sanders, who took aim at Bloomberg\u2019s much criticised stop-and-frisk policy during his tenure as New York mayor. Sanders called the programme \u201cracist\u201d and said it \u201ccaused communities of colour, African Americans and Latinos, to live in fear and humiliation in New York City\u201d. Speaking about inequality in America, he also called out Bloomberg\u2019s wealth (he is estimated to be one of the 10 richest people in the world), which has repeatedly been a point of contention for many of his Democratic opponents. \u201cWe have a corrupt political system which enables billionaires to buy elections,\u201d he said. \u201cSo today we say to those billionaires who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to support candidates who represent the rich and the powerful; today we say to Mayor Bloomberg: we are a democracy, not an oligarchy.\u201d Bloomberg has said he will not take political donations and is expected to work for only $1 a year if elected to the presidency. The media mogul has also received recent criticism for comments he made four years ago in which he seemingly questioned the intelligence of American factory and farm workers, as well as comments he made in 2013, in which he compared local members of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and New York\u2019s teachers union to the gun lobbying group the National Rifle Association (NRA). According to Politico, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman, Stu Loeser, responded to the comments by saying, \u201creference to the [teachers union] was something Mike said in the heat of the moment that he now regrets.\u201d Sanders said: \u201cAs a United States senator, I truly appreciate the power of the corporate elites and the 1%; they have endless and I mean endless amounts of money. They own, to a large degree, the media; they have tremendous control over our economy; they are very, very powerful. But at the end of the day, we are the 99%.\u201d Sanders\u2019 extremely positive showings in Iowa and New Hampshire boosted his chances of winning the Democratic nomination and ultimately beating Donald Trump.

The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, were right behind, with about $1.6m and $1.5m raised respectively. Trump has brought in over $2.7m from the state. Despite Sanders\u2019 criticisms of Bloomberg, several of his supporters said they would still vote for the billionaire if he wins the nomination. \u201cI would be sorry to turn my back on a president who has manipulated and bought in order to get the position to go to somebody who would be a passable middle-of-the-road Republican, who also buys and barters for the position instead of turning to the people,\u201d said Dusty Collings, 68, a Sanders supporter from Poulsbo, a small city north-west of Seattle. But when asked during the rally whether she would support Bloomberg if he won the Democratic nomination, she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI would vote for the Congress of tropical birds to get rid of Trump,\u201d said Collings, an artist who was a Sanders caucus delegate for Washington state\u2019s Kitsap county in 2016. \u201cIf that\u2019s who we nominate, that\u2019s who I will vote for.\u201d Ryan Hull, 20, said he supports Sanders primarily because of his stance on the environment. But the sophomore at Clark College, in Vancouver, Washington, who drove about two hours for the rally with his mom and sister, said if Bloomberg wins the nomination, he would ultimately vote for him. \u201cHe shares enough of the same ideals for me that it\u2019s not too big of a movement,\u201d said Hull. But he said he would also just like to see Trump leave the White House, so \u201cwhoever\u2019s going to win for the Democrats, that\u2019s who I want,\u201d he said. However, not everyone at the rally shared that same sentiment. Leanne Young, 28, a Seattle resident, called Bloomberg \u201cbasically the Democratic version of Trump\u201d, and said she would probably not vote for him if he\u2019s the nominee because she doesn\u2019t \u201csee him being much better than Trump\u201d. Bloomberg, who launched his presidential campaign in November, will appear in Wednesday\u2019s televised presidential debate in Las Vegas alongside Biden, Sanders, Warren Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign said it was seeing a groundswell of support across the country and that qualifying for Wednesday\u2019s debate is the latest sign that Bloomberg\u2019s plan is resonating with more Americans. The primetime event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg\u2019s highly choreographed campaign. He has poured more than $300m into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism. Associated Press contributed to this report",

Harald Ebner, a member of the German Parliament Bundestag, said the LPT laboratory \u201chas obviously delivered the desired results and swept unpleasant results under the carpet\u201d. All LPT scientific work must now be investigated, including the studies submitted to help support glyphosate approvals in Europe, he said. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment says it is monitoring the situation but sees no reason to question the overall assessment of glyphosate safety given the 24 GLP studies were part of more than 900 other studies or papers that were part of the European glyphosate evaluation. News of the laboratory fraud allegations comes at a time of growing fears among consumer and environmentalists that corporate-driven \u201cscience\u201d is doing much to protect corporate profits but little to protect public health and safety. When corporations pay for the research, invariably the findings seem to support the safety of whatever products the corporations are trying to sell. Hundreds of studies done by US contract laboratories in the 1970s, 80s and 90s were found to be fraudulent, including some tests used by Monsanto in representations to the US Environmental Protection Agency regarding the company\u2019s glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide. The allegations of fraud at the German lab also add to evidence of Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018, influencing scientific studies into the safety of their products. Internal Monsanto files obtained in litigation show multiple tactics were employed by the company and industry allies to manipulate scientific papers about its products, including using ghost-writing research papers and secret funding front groups to support regulatory approvals. Surely one need not be a cynic to recognize that corporate-funded science is likely to be biased in favor of corporate product approvals \u2013 even if that bias might come at the expense of public safety. It\u2019s foolish to pretend otherwise, in light of the examples of deception and fraud that have accumulated over the years. The German laboratory in question is set to close down later this month. But the larger problem persists. It is well past time for reform of a badly broken system that lacks both truth and transparency. We must be able to trust the integrity of scientific research as we work to protect our families, our communities and our planet. Regulatory bodies should reform their practices of relying on industry-funded studies, and when fraud is found \u2013 be it in the laboratory or in ghostwritten research papers \u2013 punishment should be swift and unforgiving. Science should never be for sale. Carey Gillam is a journalist and author and a public interest researcher for US Right to Know, a not-for-profit food industry research group.

MPs and council leaders in flood-stricken areas said the government\u2019s refusal to call an emergency Cobra meeting had obstructed the response in some towns and delayed the release of vital funds to recover from Storms Ciara and Dennis. Holly Lynch, the Labour MP for Halifax, said that more than 1,000 homes, businesses and schools had been damaged by the hurricane-force winds and flooding last week yet there had been no support from government beyond the Bellwin scheme, which reimburses some of the costs faced by local authorities.

More than 300 flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Britain, including eight warning of danger to life in England and south Wales, as Johnson faced a second day of political pressure over his response to the storms. Evacuations were under way along the River Severn in Shropshire and 33 people were rescued from a care home in Herefordshire as rainfall from Storm Dennis continued to cause widespread damage and disruption. One of the severe flood warnings centred on the historic town of Ironbridge, near Telford in Shropshire, where residents were being evacuated over concerns that the swollen river would soon top a 6.8-metre temporary flood barrier on Tuesday night.

And it uses a lot of energy. In 2014 AWS committed to using only renewable energy to power its data centres, but it seems to have fallen far short. In 2018 the company as a whole announced it had reached 50% renewable energy usage, but in the same year Greenpeace claimed that, in the state of Virginia, AWS was using renewable energy for only 12% of its total needs. If Amazon is so keen to hear from people about saving the planet, why did it recently threaten to fire employees who had spoken out about the company\u2019s stance on energy matters? Amazon Employees for Climate Justice is continuing its protests, which in the past have included attempts to a push for a shareholder resolution to set a climate change plan. As one employee said: \u201cThe climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face, and the only way we can find solutions is by protecting people\u2019s right to speak freely and disrupting the status quo.\u201d Where there\u2019s muck there\u2019s brass. And where there is an oligopolistic global giant changing the way we shop there are ethical concerns. This is the paradox at the heart of philanthropy. It is a fine thing to give. But how did you make your money? The dreadful concept of \u201cgiving something back\u201d exposes the truth: if you feel the need to give something back perhaps it means you took too much in the first place. It is better to have $10bn invested in the attempt to save the planet than not. Bezos will have done a lot of good if scientific research bears (sustainable, non-carbon and water-intensive) fruit. And who knows, maybe this investment is partly inspired by a wish to get back at one of the world\u2019s biggest sources of fossil fuels, Saudi Arabia, with which he seems to have experienced a little difficulty lately. But Bezos could also see to it that Amazon pays and treats its staff better, and expends less energy being \u201ctax efficient\u201d, paying its dues to state coffers around the world, in all those countries where the company is making so much money. \u2022 Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre",

One of the most freeing revelations of my life was that you do not always need to explain. \u201cFriday night doesn\u2019t work\u201d is a complete sentence. Your need to take care of yourself is as legitimate as an athlete\u2019s need to eat more, or a new mother\u2019s wish to keep her phone on in the meeting. The question isn\u2019t how to do it without seeming a certain way but how to stop worrying about how we seem. Sometimes we feel compelled to offer explanations when we feel ashamed of our preferences or needs. We start imagining that everybody around us is disappointed and wants to hear a justification. They don\u2019t; our mind has just turned them into ventriloquist dummies for its deepest internal impatiences. The solution is not to perfect the explanations we offer. It\u2019s to turn inwards and make sure our preferences seem authoritative to ourselves. This is not a matter of thinking more. It\u2019s a matter of doing; of making your choice and then just gliding, with the unselfconscious assuredness of someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

No specific request was made.\u201d The Aurora Australis, in operation since 1989, will carry out its final voyage for the Australian Antarctic program in March, travelling to Macquarie Island, and will be replaced later this year by the custom-built $529m RSV Nuyina. Habib said she was currently scheduled to work on that voyage.",

Albanese\u2019s speech says his mother, Maryanne, who raised her son as a single parent in Sydney council housing, remains a driving force behind his views. \u201cHaving seen what my Mum went through in her later years, I want to be able to make a difference for older Australians now, and the older Australians of the future,\u201d his speech said. \u201cMum raised me on her own. She was a strong woman with a great mind and a huge heart. She gave so much. \u201cBut she experienced years of sickness and struggle. She died too young at just 65. If Mum had got the care she needed, her later years would have been so much better. \u201cI can\u2019t go back in time to fix things for Mum. But with planning, vision and a pinch of the spirit that defines our older Australians, we can take care of the future.\u201d",

New figures obtained by the Australian National University researcher Elise Klein add more weight to critics\u2019 claims that the card has not reduced reports of family violence about three years after welfare recipients were placed on to the card. Western Australia police data released under FOI laws in 2018 had shown family violence-related assaults and police attendances in the East Kimberley communities of Wyndham and Kununurra rose after the card was introduced in April 2016. \u201cThere are some questions about the data but it does still show it\u2019s definitely not decreasing \u2026 and there is some increase,\u201d Klein, who has studied the card\u2019s impact in the Kimberley, told Guardian Australia. \u201cYou can look at those numbers and say, something\u2019s up here,\u201d she added. While she did not view the card as a \u201ccausal factor\u201d for family violence, she said it was \u201can added factor of stress and hardship in families which may then lead to violence\u201d. \u201cThey [the government] should be researching this area and not proposing extending the cashless debit card until we know what\u2019s happening more clearly,\u201d Klein said, describing the proposal as \u201cshameful\u201d. Police in Western Australia changed the way they recorded family violence incidents after July 2017, and the data obtained by Klein says \u201ccomparisons of offence statistics prior to July 2017 with those for later periods should be made with caution\u201d. However, treating the data separately, the figures show that post July 2017 to April 2019, there has been no clear reduction in serious family assaults and general family assaults. It follows a clear increase in family violence assaults in the pre-July 2017 data, which appears to begin when the card was introduced in the East Kimberley. It comes as the government pushes for a nationwide rollout of the controversial policy, which quarantines 80% of a person\u2019s welfare payments on to a card that cannot be used to withdraw cash or buy certain prohibited items. The government is currently seeking to win support from the independent senator Jacqui Lambie to expand the card into the Northern Territory. Welfare recipients in the NT were placed on a similar form of income management, known as the Basics Card, during the Intervention. Beverley Walley, a community leader and Noongar Ballardong woman in Kununurra, said the card had not reduced antisocial behaviour in her community while also making it more difficult for people to budget. \u201cI myself have noticed the increase in youth crime, domestic violence, drinking, smoking, drugs, anxiety and depression, no wraparound services as promised,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not making things any better,\u201d Walley added. \u201cIt is not slowing down the alcohol intake and drug taking. They find a way around it.\u201d Guardian Australia has previously reported concerns about the card and its potential effect on domestic violence survivors. One woman, Jocelyn Wighton, from Ceduna, South Australia, told an event in 2018 she would not have been able to escape her abusive marriage under the income management scheme. A spokeswoman for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the government had heavily invested in domestic violence programs, including specific support and prevention strategies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. \u201cThe causes of domestic violence are complex and varied,\u201d she said. \u201cEvidence indicates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children continue to experience disproportionally high rates of violence.\u201d The spokeswoman added the government had commissioned the University of Adelaide to undertake an evaluation of the cashless debit card trial sites. \u201cWe expect results from three of the sites to be available in the first half of this year,\u201d she said.

They told the jury his first version was more coherent and credible. The trial is expected to conclude this week.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> The scrunch test.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Two and a bit. First introduced <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/theatre-company-brings-in-scrunch-tests-on-audience-snacks-a3712001.html\">in December 2017</a>.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Very welcome.</p> <p><strong>And </strong><strong>what the hell is it?</strong> A test on the packaging of food and drink sold in theatres. If it\u2019s too scrunchy, it\u2019s banned.</p> <p><strong>Who were the spoilsports who introduced this puritanical code?</strong> The commendable theatre-lover that announced it was Nimax, which owns six theatres in the West End of London. But the real star of the anti-scrunch movement is the actor Imelda Staunton, who has launched a fusillade against noisy, food-and-drink-obsessed theatregoers in an interview in this week\u2019s Radio Times.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s her problem? </strong>Being heard above the noise of people in the stalls gorging, basically. \u201cWhy are you selling crisps!!!!?,\u201d she asks theatre companies with a suitably rhetorical flourish. \u201cI just do not get it. None of us can be without food for five minutes. And the drinks! Plastic glasses falling on the floor when there\u2019s a quiet moment.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I seem to recollect </strong><strong>Staunton has been banging on about this for a while.</strong> You are clearly an avid reader of the Stage. She made similar comments in 2016, again wondering why theatregoers were incapable of getting to the interval without consuming a trayful of burgers and a couple of bottles of warm white wine. And when she appeared in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at the Harold Pinter theatre in 2017, the theatre asked patrons not to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39126467\" title=\"\">eat during the performance</a>.</p> <p><strong>Will her crusade succeed?</strong> Almost certainly not. Theatregoers now insist on talking, eating and using their mobile phones as if they were binge-watching Netflix in their living room. Any notion of the sanctity of live performance has been lost.</p> <p><strong>But weren\u2019t the groundlings at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe raucous and partial to pork pies, oysters and the odd flagon of mead? </strong>An interesting historical point. There is indeed archaeological evidence that Elizabethan and Jacobean <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">theatregoers ate and drank copiously</a>, but that was before plastic packaging. Jumbo-sized packets of Doritos would have driven Shakespeare crackers.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with: </strong>The equally annoying people who eat in cinemas and have to be drowned out by ear-splitting, headache-inducing sound levels. And people with coughs at classical concerts who think they are doing everyone else a favour by noisily unwrapping cough sweets.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cUnquiet meals make ill digestions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cDost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: The scrunch test. Age: Two and a bit. First introduced in December 2017. Appearance: Very welcome. And what the hell is it? A test on the packaging of food and drink sold in theatres. If it\u2019s too scrunchy, it\u2019s banned. Who were the spoilsports who introduced this puritanical code? The commendable theatre-lover that announced it was Nimax, which owns six theatres in the West End of London. But the real star of the anti-scrunch movement is the actor Imelda Staunton, who has launched a fusillade against noisy, food-and-drink-obsessed theatregoers in an interview in this week\u2019s Radio Times. What\u2019s her problem? Being heard above the noise of people in the stalls gorging, basically. \u201cWhy are you selling crisps!!!!?,\u201d she asks theatre companies with a suitably rhetorical flourish. \u201cI just do not get it. None of us can be without food for five minutes. And the drinks! Plastic glasses falling on the floor when there\u2019s a quiet moment.\u201d I seem to recollect Staunton has been banging on about this for a while. You are clearly an avid reader of the Stage. She made similar comments in 2016, again wondering why theatregoers were incapable of getting to the interval without consuming a trayful of burgers and a couple of bottles of warm white wine. And when she appeared in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at the Harold Pinter theatre in 2017, the theatre asked patrons not to eat during the performance. Will her crusade succeed? Almost certainly not. Theatregoers now insist on talking, eating and using their mobile phones as if they were binge-watching Netflix in their living room. Any notion of the sanctity of live performance has been lost. But weren\u2019t the groundlings at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe raucous and partial to pork pies, oysters and the odd flagon of mead? An interesting historical point. There is indeed archaeological evidence that Elizabethan and Jacobean theatregoers ate and drank copiously, but that was before plastic packaging. Jumbo-sized packets of Doritos would have driven Shakespeare crackers. Not to be confused with: The equally annoying people who eat in cinemas and have to be drowned out by ear-splitting, headache-inducing sound levels. And people with coughs at classical concerts who think they are doing everyone else a favour by noisily unwrapping cough sweets. Do say: \u201cUnquiet meals make ill digestions.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cDost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>BIG CUP IS BACK, BABY!</strong></h2> <p>Like a hoof in the unmentionables from Harry Maguire, Big Cup is back with an eye-watering bang on Tuesday, as the first couple of last-16 ties get under way. If you were on the edge of your seat for a group stage which took a total of 96 matches to send 15 preposterously rich clubs and this season\u2019s plucky minnows Atalanta through to the knockout rounds, well \u2026 The Fiver is going to go out on a limb and guess you must have been wearing a massive rucksack.</p> <p>As is customary in February, Big Cup becomes far less predictable, each game coming with its own kind of jeopardy. Last season alone, such high-profile European aristocrats as Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Ajax, not to mention the humble, put-upon, church mice of the people that are Manchester City were among those to have their noses violently bloodied in entertaining style before Liverpool hoisted the trophy at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/jurgen-klopp-wants-liverpool-to-show-worth-as-european-contenders\">\u2018We want to be in Istanbul': Klopp urges Liverpool to meet Atl\u00e9tico head on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Reds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/jurgen-klopp-wants-liverpool-to-show-worth-as-european-contenders\">have returned to the scene</a> of that particular triumph, this time to face an Atl\u00e9tico who, even in their recent pomp, would have had their work cut out to beat the champions over two legs. Fourth in La Liga having won just one of their past five games, they are currently an entirely unconvincing Spanish equivalent of Chelsea, except with a far more streetwise manager who might turn out to have a couple of tricks up his sleeve. \u201cCriticism is necessary and it helps us to improve,\u201d seethed Diego Simeone, who has not ruled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/17/liverpool-up-there-with-great-brazil-and-ajax-teams-says-diego-simeone\">sounding Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s $hithouse klaxon</a> and handing Diego Costa a return after a knack spell on the sidelines. \u201cWe are where we are and we have a tough opponent in front of us.

      "bodyText": "BIG CUP IS BACK, BABY! Like a hoof in the unmentionables from Harry Maguire, Big Cup is back with an eye-watering bang on Tuesday, as the first couple of last-16 ties get under way. If you were on the edge of your seat for a group stage which took a total of 96 matches to send 15 preposterously rich clubs and this season\u2019s plucky minnows Atalanta through to the knockout rounds, well \u2026 The Fiver is going to go out on a limb and guess you must have been wearing a massive rucksack. As is customary in February, Big Cup becomes far less predictable, each game coming with its own kind of jeopardy. Last season alone, such high-profile European aristocrats as Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Ajax, not to mention the humble, put-upon, church mice of the people that are Manchester City were among those to have their noses violently bloodied in entertaining style before Liverpool hoisted the trophy at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid. The Reds have returned to the scene of that particular triumph, this time to face an Atl\u00e9tico who, even in their recent pomp, would have had their work cut out to beat the champions over two legs. Fourth in La Liga having won just one of their past five games, they are currently an entirely unconvincing Spanish equivalent of Chelsea, except with a far more streetwise manager who might turn out to have a couple of tricks up his sleeve. \u201cCriticism is necessary and it helps us to improve,\u201d seethed Diego Simeone, who has not ruled out sounding Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s $hithouse klaxon and handing Diego Costa a return after a knack spell on the sidelines. \u201cWe are where we are and we have a tough opponent in front of us. Our stadium will help us a lot and the only thing that counts is what happens on the pitch.\u201d In the night\u2019s other match, Borussia Dortmund have first dibs on getting to put a comedy end to PSG\u2019s latest hopes of winning that elusive Big Cup their football-crazy Qatari owners have craved since the beginning of that long and historic association with the club back in 2011. In what may or may not be a boost for the mega-rich French club that has exited the tournament at this stage in each of the past three seasons, Neymar is expected to start in Germany after four matches out with protracted birthday celebrations rib-ouch. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2-2 Liverpool in Big Cup, while Simon Burnton will be on hand for Dortmund 2-1 PSG. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a panto and there\u2019s always someone that\u2019s got to tick the box of certain characters and we seem to have had to tick the box of the villain of the piece and the one people like to beat\u201d \u2013 Salford City manager Graham Alexander on why League Two teams like to get the better of a club owned by billionaire Peter Lim and a group of multi-millionaire former Manchester United players. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires is on \u2026 holiday, but he\u2019s still turned this in. You can buy it here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cHarry Gregg was my hero back when I was an aspiring goalie for my village\u2019s pick-up games. Note in the picture (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day), making a sideways horizontal save, he isn\u2019t wearing gloves, at a time when the ball on a rainy day weighed something like half a tonne, and he would probably land in a foot deep sea of goo as the goalmouth got churned up. And to think Manchester United signed him from Doncaster for a record fee of \u00a323,000. He was probably paid about a tenner a game\u201d \u2013 Maurice Mandale. \u201cCongratulations should be extended to Dean Smith for his marvellous ability to make VAR seem like a principled and upstanding member of the community (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). Undoubtedly Mr Smith was right that \u201842,000 people in the stadium did not have a problem with [the referee\u2019s] decision\u2019, but could the fact that the vast majority of those 42,000 were fanatical Aston Villa fans \u2013 none of whom had a view as clear as the VAR in Stockley Park \u2013 in any way colour the judgment of such a thumping majority?\u201d \u2013 Colin Reed. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Colin Reed. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS A consultants\u2019 report written for the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi stated that the Abu Dhabi government, not Etihad airlines, was \u201ccovering\u201d the sponsorship of Manchester City in 2010, according to a 2015 US aviation industry document. FC Cincinatti coach Ron Jans has resigned in the midst of an MLS investigation into allegations he used the n-word. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is in a bit of a huff after losing to fellow nostalgia-appointee Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r for the third time this season. Invoking the dreaded V-word, Lampard said goalscorer Harry Maguire should have been sent off: \u201ca universally wrong decision,\u201d he reckons. Not that Solskj\u00e6r had a completely trouble-free day. Moments before kick-off, fabled Mr 20% Mino Raiola took to Social Media Disgrace Twitter to lay into the United boss over his treatment of Paul Pogba and further crank up the longstanding tension between player and club. Real Madrid have shelled out \u20ac30m on teenage Flamengo midfielder Reinier. \u201cIt is our obsession to look for players who could be the big stars of tomorrow,\u201d cheered Florentino P\u00e9rez. Phil Neville has taken time out from restocking his fridge to unveil a squad littered with young players for the Lionesses\u2019 defence of the SheBelieves Cup. They kick off against USA! USA!! USA!!! on 6 March. And yet more good news at Spurs HQ, where Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s only fit senior centre-forward can no longer be described as such. Son Heung-min is knacked with arm-snap and could be done for the season. Time for an emergency Martin Braithwaite move? STILL WANT MORE? Jonathan Wilson on FLC\u2019s Frank Lampard and why the excuses for a mediocre Chelsea team will soon run out. \u201cDoes a regime serially defying a United Nations arms embargo in Libya \u2013 according to the UN\u2019s own reports \u2013 strike you as the sort that places a high premium on bureaucratic process?\u201d \u2013 here\u2019s Jonathan Liew on why Manchester City\u2019s owners won\u2019t take Uefa\u2019s ban lying down. Manchester United\u2019s midfield has felt like a metaphysical puzzle: if it doesn\u2019t do anything, can it actually be said to exist? Enter Bruno Fernandes. Sid Lowe\u2019s La Liga blog features Real Madrid, Celta Vigo and a picture of Zizou being booted in the face.

NHS bosses are trying to find out if any patients have been harmed after 28,563 letters detailing discussions at outpatient appointments were not sent because of a mistake by Cerner, an IT company. The letters should have been sent by doctors at Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals in north London to GPs after consultations with 22,144 patients between June last year and last month. However, a \u201cclinical harm review\u201d is under way after it was found they had not been dispatched. The 22,144 patients live in the London boroughs of Camden, Islington, Haringey, Barnet and Enfield. The incident has prompted concern among GPs and patient representatives. \u201cPatients who have attended these two hospitals will now be very worried about whether their care might have been compromised by this IT bungle\u201d, said Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association. \u201cWe know that sharing information to join up patient care is a major weakness of the NHS, so it is very disappointing to see that this failure took over six months to be detected.

It was sent on 7 February by Caroline Clarke, the chief executive of the Royal Free London group of hospitals, which include Barnet and Chase Farm. In the memo Clarke says the 28,563 letters were not sent because of \u201ca technical error, which happened when our IT partner, Cerner, implemented a customised update on the system we use for distributing outpatient summary letters\u201d. The Royal Free decided the failure to inform GPs by letter about what patients discussed with their consultants about their diagnosis and treatment involved such a clear risk that it constituted a patient safety \u201cserious incident\u201d. It also reported the mistake to NHS England, the national body that oversees the health service, and NHS Improvement, which scrutinises patient safety. \u201cWe have set up a clinical task and finish group, chaired by Dr Alan McGlennan, the medical director of Chase Farm hospital, to carry out a clinical harm review.

      "body": "<p>It is common for people to scoff at tears as a behaviour and a subject of investigation. Tears are, they say, feminine, self-indulgent and melodramatic. It is not hard to notice, in those beliefs, the patriarchal assumptions about what should be valued and what should be mocked. Writing teachers will instruct students not to show their characters\u2019 sadness through crying, calling it cheap. On the other hand, there are those who proclaim the necessity of \u201ca good cry\u201d, who indignantly defend weeping of all varieties and who see tearfulness almost as an identity. \u201cI\u2019m a crier,\u201d they declare, praising its soul-cleansing effects. \u201cGet over it,\u201d their opponents instruct, demanding the shift toward progress and action that they believe crying prevents.</p> <p>But rather than looking at tears with a predetermined belief in their value, or away from them in embarrassment or disgust, it can be clarifying to look through, into or around tears, to trace the small and large patterns that they create and reveal.</p> <p>Not all tears are alike. The human body produces three kinds: basal, which form an oily layer over the eyeball to keep it from drying out; reflex, which appear when an eye is bothered by cutting onions or a speck of dust and needs to flush the irritant away; and psychogenic, which are shed for emotional reasons. Notably, emotional tears have a higher protein level than basal and reflex tears, which makes them thicker and causes them to fall more slowly.</p> <p>This thickness intrigues me. The longer it takes for these tears to travel down a cheek, the greater the chance that they will be noticed by another person and their message perceived. Tears are a social signal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Emotional tears fall more slowly, increasing the chance that they will be noticed. They are a social signal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some people disagree, arguing that humans also cry alone. But even without a witness, tears streak outwards, seeking care. That message can be socially directed toward the self; sometimes a solitary crier will wrap their arms around themselves, creating their own soothing embrace. One might, in those moments, think of the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/rimbaud-and-verlaines-london-home-should-have-its-blue-plaque-now\" title=\"\">Arthur Rimbaud</a>\u2019s declaration: \u201cI is an other.\u201d Sometimes, a person is the sender and the recipient of the crying signal.</p> <p>What the social signal of tears makes happen varies from culture to culture and depends on the identities, access to power and beliefs of the crier and their witnesses. Think of the \u201cschool resource officer\u201d who was called to the classroom of a crying seven-year-old African American boy and <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/qualified-immunity-for-police-officer-who-handcuffed-7-year-old.html\" title=\"\">put the child in handcuffs</a>. Think of the white police officer who cried in court when she spoke of killing an African American man in his home, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/amber-guyger-case-judge-defends-hugging-former-police-officer\" title=\"\">the hug she later received from the African American judge</a>.</p> <p>Tears often serve as a lubricant in the wheels of white supremacy.

      "bodyText": "It is common for people to scoff at tears as a behaviour and a subject of investigation. Tears are, they say, feminine, self-indulgent and melodramatic. It is not hard to notice, in those beliefs, the patriarchal assumptions about what should be valued and what should be mocked. Writing teachers will instruct students not to show their characters\u2019 sadness through crying, calling it cheap. On the other hand, there are those who proclaim the necessity of \u201ca good cry\u201d, who indignantly defend weeping of all varieties and who see tearfulness almost as an identity. \u201cI\u2019m a crier,\u201d they declare, praising its soul-cleansing effects. \u201cGet over it,\u201d their opponents instruct, demanding the shift toward progress and action that they believe crying prevents. But rather than looking at tears with a predetermined belief in their value, or away from them in embarrassment or disgust, it can be clarifying to look through, into or around tears, to trace the small and large patterns that they create and reveal. Not all tears are alike. The human body produces three kinds: basal, which form an oily layer over the eyeball to keep it from drying out; reflex, which appear when an eye is bothered by cutting onions or a speck of dust and needs to flush the irritant away; and psychogenic, which are shed for emotional reasons. Notably, emotional tears have a higher protein level than basal and reflex tears, which makes them thicker and causes them to fall more slowly. This thickness intrigues me. The longer it takes for these tears to travel down a cheek, the greater the chance that they will be noticed by another person and their message perceived. Tears are a social signal. Some people disagree, arguing that humans also cry alone. But even without a witness, tears streak outwards, seeking care. That message can be socially directed toward the self; sometimes a solitary crier will wrap their arms around themselves, creating their own soothing embrace. One might, in those moments, think of the poet Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s declaration: \u201cI is an other.\u201d Sometimes, a person is the sender and the recipient of the crying signal. What the social signal of tears makes happen varies from culture to culture and depends on the identities, access to power and beliefs of the crier and their witnesses. Think of the \u201cschool resource officer\u201d who was called to the classroom of a crying seven-year-old African American boy and put the child in handcuffs. Think of the white police officer who cried in court when she spoke of killing an African American man in his home, and the hug she later received from the African American judge. Tears often serve as a lubricant in the wheels of white supremacy. Many people (including Brittney Cooper and Ruby Hamad) have written about the harm of white women\u2019s tears \u2013 how they have contributed to a long history of violence towards black people, indigenous people and people of colour. Doctors have their own precise frames in which to interpret people\u2019s tears. They can hang little paper tabs from a patient\u2019s eyes to measure tear production, the slim rectangles slowly changing colour as the body does its work. When a psychiatrist is working to diagnose depression, she will ask a patient to describe his or her crying, offering a range of possibilities from: \u201cI do not cry any more than I used to,\u201d to: \u201cI cry over every little thing,\u201d before ending in numb dryness: \u201cI feel like crying, but I can\u2019t.\u201d I am reminded of hypothermia, the growing, shivering pain that transforms just before death into a surprising warmth. My depression has yet to reach that dry state. Instead, when an episode is at its worst, I can find myself shaking with cries for an hour after something as simple as dropping a knife to the floor. I am learning to say these things with what I hope is neither pride nor shame. But tears have a habit of magnifying and distorting.

If what Johnson really wants is for Brussels to trust him, that will take more than smooth talking. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I can\u2019t wait for my holiday,\u201d a colleague told me. \u201cI\u2019m going to get so much work done!\u201d At the time, I wasn\u2019t shocked. Many professionals I know use their holidays as an opportunity to work. I have to admit that when I\u2019m on holiday, I wake up early so I can do some sneaky work before the rest of the family appear and demand I \u201crelax\u201d.</p> <p>Now this trend of working on holidays has been given a name: leavism. Prof Cary Cooper and his colleagues at Manchester University <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Hesketh2/publication/273080838_Leaveism_and_public_sector_reform_will_the_practice_continue/links/54f6d1d40cf21d8b8a5dadbd.pdf\" title=\"\">first identified leav</a><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Hesketh2/publication/273080838_Leaveism_and_public_sector_reform_will_the_practice_continue/links/54f6d1d40cf21d8b8a5dadbd.pdf\" title=\"\">ism in 2014</a>. They surveyed staff in a large UK police force during prolonged job cuts and found that more than one third of the officers had taken leave or holiday when they were sick or injured. Cooper soon realised that using annual leave instead of sick leave was part of a wider phenomenon where <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/64/3/146/1439077\" title=\"\">holidays became a time to work</a>.</p> <p>A follow-up study <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/health-and-well-being-at-work_tcm18-40863.pdf\" title=\"\">by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development </a><a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/health-and-well-being-at-work_tcm18-40863.pdf\" title=\"\">in 2018</a> found that 72% of respondents had observed \u201cleavism\u201d and 37% reported people taking annual leave (rather than sick leave) when they were ill. More than 30% of those surveyed reported people took leave to catch up on work. An even more <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/17/forget-presenteeism-leavism-new-bane-workers-lives-study-finds/\" title=\"\">recent study </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/17/forget-presenteeism-leavism-new-bane-workers-lives-study-finds/\" title=\"\">found</a> that up to half of employees surveyed were taking work home and claiming they were on holiday.</p> <p>Cooper thinks employees take time off to work because our workplaces have become increasingly competitive and employees are overburdened. Working on holiday helps us keep up. Another reason is technology. The ubiquity of smartphones means work is constantly with us. Even when we are hiking in the mountains, a smartphone tethers us to what is happening in the office.</p> <p>I think there are two other reasons we take holiday to work. First, most modern workplaces have become the last place where you can get work done. There are often so many pointless disruptions and distractions. Going on holiday becomes a desperate means of finding distraction-free time to work.</p> <p>Another overlooked reason we take holidays to work is this: working is often more comfortable and easier than the rest of our lives. By hiding in our work when on holiday, we are able to ignore personal relationships, family dynamics and our own feelings. Working on holiday is a defence mechanism. It helps us avoid facing up to the troubling prospect that we might not have a life outside work.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I can\u2019t wait for my holiday,\u201d a colleague told me. \u201cI\u2019m going to get so much work done!\u201d At the time, I wasn\u2019t shocked. Many professionals I know use their holidays as an opportunity to work. I have to admit that when I\u2019m on holiday, I wake up early so I can do some sneaky work before the rest of the family appear and demand I \u201crelax\u201d. Now this trend of working on holidays has been given a name: leavism. Prof Cary Cooper and his colleagues at Manchester University first identified leavism in 2014. They surveyed staff in a large UK police force during prolonged job cuts and found that more than one third of the officers had taken leave or holiday when they were sick or injured. Cooper soon realised that using annual leave instead of sick leave was part of a wider phenomenon where holidays became a time to work. A follow-up study by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in 2018 found that 72% of respondents had observed \u201cleavism\u201d and 37% reported people taking annual leave (rather than sick leave) when they were ill. More than 30% of those surveyed reported people took leave to catch up on work. An even more recent study found that up to half of employees surveyed were taking work home and claiming they were on holiday. Cooper thinks employees take time off to work because our workplaces have become increasingly competitive and employees are overburdened. Working on holiday helps us keep up. Another reason is technology. The ubiquity of smartphones means work is constantly with us. Even when we are hiking in the mountains, a smartphone tethers us to what is happening in the office. I think there are two other reasons we take holiday to work. First, most modern workplaces have become the last place where you can get work done. There are often so many pointless disruptions and distractions. Going on holiday becomes a desperate means of finding distraction-free time to work. Another overlooked reason we take holidays to work is this: working is often more comfortable and easier than the rest of our lives. By hiding in our work when on holiday, we are able to ignore personal relationships, family dynamics and our own feelings. Working on holiday is a defence mechanism. It helps us avoid facing up to the troubling prospect that we might not have a life outside work.",

She didn\u2019t promote an Instagram-style picture-perfect lifestyle, she was real and this resonated with me and my friends.

I follow her on Twitter and Instagram and, yes, I definitely think that because she was very open and would often share her vulnerability and emotions that made me feel closer to her and made her very relatable as a woman. I believe there is probably a bit of Caroline in many of us, including the parts that she kept hidden. I admired her \u2013 flaws and all.

The lender would not comment on potential branch closures in the UK but said it was keeping the network \u201cunder review\u201d. The group employs about 40,000 staff in the UK.</p> <p>Despite the planned job cuts, HSBC said it had set aside \u00a33.3bn in bonuses, down nearly 4% compared with last year. Quinn, who took over as interim chief executive after the ousting of John Flint in August last year, was paid nearly \u00a32m including a \u00a3665,000 bonus. The bank\u2019s group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, who joined in January 2019, was handed a \u00a31m bonus as part of his \u00a34.9m pay package.</p> <p>Union officials called for urgent talks with HSBC on the planned cutbacks. </p> <p>Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, Dominic Hook, said: \u201cDespite HSBC still making billions of dollars of profit, once again hardworking and dedicated staff have woken up to the news that their job could be at risk.</p> <p>\u201cUnite is seeking urgent discussions with senior management to understand the serious impact of this announcement and what it will mean for our members in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The UK cutbacks are part of a wider restructuring across the bank\u2019s European operations, where it aims to cut costs by 25%. HSBC is also targeting its US division, which will involve closing a third of its 224 branches, and said technology and automation would mean job losses across the bank as a whole. Apart from the cost-cutting, it also plans to shed $100bn worth of assets by the end of 2022.</p> <p>The bank also issued a warning over the coronavirus outbreak in Asia, which makes up the bulk of its profits, saying it could have an impact on its performance in 2020.</p> <p>HSBC said there had already been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong, and it was monitoring the situation closely.</p> <p>But if the outbreak continues to spread throughout the second half of the year, HSBC could be forced to set aside as much as $600m to deal with the business fallout. Stevenson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year.\u201d</p> <p>Provisions for coronavirus would help cover bad debts if customers start to default on their loans. Individual borrowers could fall ill, while corporate customers could face financial difficulty if supply chains are disrupted due to trade restrictions or factory closures, particularly in China.</p> <p> Stevenson said: \u201cWe expect to take additional loan loss provisions as a result of the coronavirus and the weakened outlook for the Hong Kong economy. I think it\u2019s really a call on how long does it take to contain the virus, and certainly some of the latest data has given us more optimism on that over the last week or so.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the bank would have further details on the impact of the virus on its full-year results when it releases first-quarter earnings on 28 April.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has said it will slash 35,000 jobs over three years as part of a major shake-up as it issued a warning over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Asia. The interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, confirmed on Tuesday that plans to cut $4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn) worth of costs would involve slashing about 15% of the group\u2019s global workforce. \u201cWe would expect our headcount to decrease from the current level of 235,000 to be closer to 200,000 in 2022,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThis represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programmes in our history.\u201d HSBC, which operates in 64 countries, said there would be \u201cmeaningful job cuts here in the UK\u201d, mainly affecting its head office operations as well as its global banks and markets business, which are largely London-based. The lender would not comment on potential branch closures in the UK but said it was keeping the network \u201cunder review\u201d. The group employs about 40,000 staff in the UK. Despite the planned job cuts, HSBC said it had set aside \u00a33.3bn in bonuses, down nearly 4% compared with last year. Quinn, who took over as interim chief executive after the ousting of John Flint in August last year, was paid nearly \u00a32m including a \u00a3665,000 bonus. The bank\u2019s group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, who joined in January 2019, was handed a \u00a31m bonus as part of his \u00a34.9m pay package. Union officials called for urgent talks with HSBC on the planned cutbacks. Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, Dominic Hook, said: \u201cDespite HSBC still making billions of dollars of profit, once again hardworking and dedicated staff have woken up to the news that their job could be at risk. \u201cUnite is seeking urgent discussions with senior management to understand the serious impact of this announcement and what it will mean for our members in the UK.\u201d The UK cutbacks are part of a wider restructuring across the bank\u2019s European operations, where it aims to cut costs by 25%. HSBC is also targeting its US division, which will involve closing a third of its 224 branches, and said technology and automation would mean job losses across the bank as a whole. Apart from the cost-cutting, it also plans to shed $100bn worth of assets by the end of 2022. The bank also issued a warning over the coronavirus outbreak in Asia, which makes up the bulk of its profits, saying it could have an impact on its performance in 2020. HSBC said there had already been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong, and it was monitoring the situation closely. But if the outbreak continues to spread throughout the second half of the year, HSBC could be forced to set aside as much as $600m to deal with the business fallout. Stevenson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year.\u201d Provisions for coronavirus would help cover bad debts if customers start to default on their loans. Individual borrowers could fall ill, while corporate customers could face financial difficulty if supply chains are disrupted due to trade restrictions or factory closures, particularly in China. Stevenson said: \u201cWe expect to take additional loan loss provisions as a result of the coronavirus and the weakened outlook for the Hong Kong economy. I think it\u2019s really a call on how long does it take to contain the virus, and certainly some of the latest data has given us more optimism on that over the last week or so.\u201d He said the bank would have further details on the impact of the virus on its full-year results when it releases first-quarter earnings on 28 April. HSBC\u2019s profits before tax for 2019 dropped 33% to $13.3bn, substantially below analysts\u2019 forecasts. The coronavirus outbreak is the latest challenge HSBC has had to face in Asia. It was also affected by anti-government protests in Hong Kong and tensions over the US-China trade war last year. However, Quinn said the lender remains committed to China, which represents a significant opportunity for growth despite recent disruptions. \u201cAbsolutely, we need to deal with the coronavirus situation in the short term but we do not see that changing the long-term strategic attractiveness of China,\u201d he said. HSBC\u2019s shares fell 6.2% in afternoon trading to 553p.",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of 3 January, Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, frantically phoned his advisers. \u201cSomething big has happened,\u201d he said, summoning them to a meeting in his office. \u201cYou need to come now.\u201d Like their boss, the advisers had heard the boom of the explosions that crunched into the airport road just after 1am, and their phones had been ringing incessantly. Each call had brought the unthinkable closer to shocking reality: Qassem Suleimani, the revered commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force and the most powerful man in Iraq, had been killed, and so had nearly all of his closest aides. Throughout 17 years of post-Saddam Hussein bedlam across the Middle East, there had been little to rival this moment. Interviews with seven people familiar with the immediate aftermath of the deadly US airstrike, including officials in Iran and Baghdad, have revealed a scene of chaos and dysfunction as the identities of those killed were revealed. \u201cThere were 11 bodies pulled from the wreckage,\u201d said one official privy to the panicked conversations that swirled through the corridors of power that morning. \u201cWe are talking about the entire inner sanctum of the Quds Force. This wasn\u2019t just Hajj Qassem [Suleimani] and Abu Mahdi [al-Muhandis].

In the 40-day mourning period to mark the Iranian general\u2019s death, which ended last Thursday, the fallout in Iraq has barely subsided. If anything, its impact has become more acute there, as well as in Suleimani\u2019s homeland of Iran, and elsewhere in a region he had come to dominate like no other figure. From the bunkers of south Beirut to the battlefields of northern Syria and the combustible streets of Iraq, the loss of Suleimani and his entourage has derailed much of Iran\u2019s momentum in the region and exposed to rare vulnerability the opaque Quds Force it has used to project its influence over two decades. The assassination has also shone a light on the complicated relationship between the Iranian leadership and the Iraqi government, senior members of which have scrambled ever since to resurrect Suleimani\u2019s core regional projects located as far away as the Lebanese capital and Damascus. The reckoning started as soon as the dead were buried.

      "body": "<p>Science has proved what theatre and concert-goers have long known. When it comes to emotional impact, watching a live performance is so much more thrilling than a version on screen.</p> <p>Scientists from University College London (UCL) measured heart rates and sweat glands of audience members as they watched both theatre productions and films. They found that heart rates go up and down with the narrative arc of a story and that the highs are highest and lows lowest at a live show. Heart rate levels changed approximately twice as much among those watching live theatre than in people viewing a film.</p> <p>Joseph Devlin, professor of cognitive neuroscience at UCL, told the Guardian: \u201cA big part of the live performance is that we are fundamentally a social species. Any time you go to a live performance, whether it\u2019s a concert or a show, people often talk about the energy or the buzz of it. Everyone knows what you\u2019re talking about, but what is it exactly?</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have found is that part of it is people\u2019s hearts starting to synchronise within the group, and you feed off the response of the people around you. You hear their emotional responses, their gasps, their claps, their laughs, or their horror, depending on what it is you\u2019re watching. You mirror that in yourself and that amplifies your own personal experience.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable but, when you have that shared experience that\u2019s being driven by a particular performance, you start to see people\u2019s heart rates go in and out of synchrony with each other, particularly in more emotionally compelling areas.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/01/dreamgirls-savoy-observer-review\">Dreamgirls review \u2013 soulful rage brings whoops of joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UCL study compared the responses of audiences to Dreamgirls, an award-winning stage musical, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/04/musicals.musicdocumentary\">film adaptation</a>, which was \u201creally close to the theatre version, so you\u2019re comparing apples and apples\u201d, Devlin said.</p> <p>Dreamgirls is about a fictional 1960s girl group, the Dreams, and their rise from Detroit talent shows to platinum-selling superstars. Loosely inspired by Diana Ross and the Supremes, its West End premiere came about 35 years after it became a multi-award-winning Broadway smash.</p> <p>Devlin said the fact that the variance in heart rates was largest in the theatre audience and lowest in the individuals watching the movie was consistent with the idea of \u201cemotional amplification\u201d. \u201cBeing at a live show in a big audience generates a lot of energy and people respond more strongly to the show in those circumstances, feeding off the energy of the performance and the crowd. This leads to greater audience engagement and produces the higher highs and the lower lows,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe same effect is present when watching a movie with an audience, but to a small degree. That is, one\u2019s excitement or engagement is still enhanced by the presence of others but, by virtue of a smaller crowd, this is reduced relative to a big West End theatre audience. It\u2019s still more engaging, though, than watching the same video on your own.\u201d</p> <p>Almost 70 people between the ages of 18 and 65 took part in the UCL study. They wore an Empatica E4 wristband, a medical-grade device that measures heart rates and electrodermal activity.</p> <p>Devlin said: \u201cYour sweat glands, that\u2019s what it\u2019s literally measuring, the conductance on your skin, which is affected by really small changes in perspiration. It\u2019s remarkably sensitive to your emotional state \u2026 It cannot tell positive from negative emotions \u2013 elation from fear, for instance \u2013 but it can measure overall emotional arousal levels.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists also found that the size of the audience had an impact on emotional responses. Devlin said: \u201cIn the Savoy [theatre], the seating is for about 1,100 people. Even big cinemas probably have only 100 to 200 people. The size of the audience seems to matter.\u201d</p> <p>While data analysis continues, further experiments will follow. Devlin sees the potential for using such technology one day to shape productions according to what gets heart rates going. It could even be used in political rallies, he suggests.</p> <p>The research followed a 2017 study in which UCL measured audience reactions to the Dreamgirls production at the Savoy theatre and found that watching live theatre can stimulate the cardiovascular system as much as doing 28 minutes of healthy cardio exercise.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Science has proved what theatre and concert-goers have long known. When it comes to emotional impact, watching a live performance is so much more thrilling than a version on screen. Scientists from University College London (UCL) measured heart rates and sweat glands of audience members as they watched both theatre productions and films. They found that heart rates go up and down with the narrative arc of a story and that the highs are highest and lows lowest at a live show. Heart rate levels changed approximately twice as much among those watching live theatre than in people viewing a film. Joseph Devlin, professor of cognitive neuroscience at UCL, told the Guardian: \u201cA big part of the live performance is that we are fundamentally a social species. Any time you go to a live performance, whether it\u2019s a concert or a show, people often talk about the energy or the buzz of it. Everyone knows what you\u2019re talking about, but what is it exactly? \u201cWhat we have found is that part of it is people\u2019s hearts starting to synchronise within the group, and you feed off the response of the people around you. You hear their emotional responses, their gasps, their claps, their laughs, or their horror, depending on what it is you\u2019re watching. You mirror that in yourself and that amplifies your own personal experience.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable but, when you have that shared experience that\u2019s being driven by a particular performance, you start to see people\u2019s heart rates go in and out of synchrony with each other, particularly in more emotionally compelling areas.\u201d The UCL study compared the responses of audiences to Dreamgirls, an award-winning stage musical, and the film adaptation, which was \u201creally close to the theatre version, so you\u2019re comparing apples and apples\u201d, Devlin said. Dreamgirls is about a fictional 1960s girl group, the Dreams, and their rise from Detroit talent shows to platinum-selling superstars. Loosely inspired by Diana Ross and the Supremes, its West End premiere came about 35 years after it became a multi-award-winning Broadway smash. Devlin said the fact that the variance in heart rates was largest in the theatre audience and lowest in the individuals watching the movie was consistent with the idea of \u201cemotional amplification\u201d. \u201cBeing at a live show in a big audience generates a lot of energy and people respond more strongly to the show in those circumstances, feeding off the energy of the performance and the crowd. This leads to greater audience engagement and produces the higher highs and the lower lows,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same effect is present when watching a movie with an audience, but to a small degree. That is, one\u2019s excitement or engagement is still enhanced by the presence of others but, by virtue of a smaller crowd, this is reduced relative to a big West End theatre audience. It\u2019s still more engaging, though, than watching the same video on your own.\u201d Almost 70 people between the ages of 18 and 65 took part in the UCL study. They wore an Empatica E4 wristband, a medical-grade device that measures heart rates and electrodermal activity. Devlin said: \u201cYour sweat glands, that\u2019s what it\u2019s literally measuring, the conductance on your skin, which is affected by really small changes in perspiration. It\u2019s remarkably sensitive to your emotional state \u2026 It cannot tell positive from negative emotions \u2013 elation from fear, for instance \u2013 but it can measure overall emotional arousal levels.\u201d The scientists also found that the size of the audience had an impact on emotional responses. Devlin said: \u201cIn the Savoy [theatre], the seating is for about 1,100 people. Even big cinemas probably have only 100 to 200 people. The size of the audience seems to matter.\u201d While data analysis continues, further experiments will follow. Devlin sees the potential for using such technology one day to shape productions according to what gets heart rates going. It could even be used in political rallies, he suggests. The research followed a 2017 study in which UCL measured audience reactions to the Dreamgirls production at the Savoy theatre and found that watching live theatre can stimulate the cardiovascular system as much as doing 28 minutes of healthy cardio exercise.",

The domus, considered to be among the jewels of the ancient city that was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79, was discovered in 1933 with its second floor and decorations almost completely preserved. The building was closed for repair following the Irpinia earthquake in 1980, which killed almost 3,000 people. The restoration was completed as part of the EU-funded Great Pompeii Project, which since 2012 has allowed the archaeological park to undertake wide-ranging restoration works and carry out new excavations. The Italian culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said the reopening of the domus is \u201ca story of rebirth and redemption\u201d and \u201ca model for all of Europe in the management of EU funds\u201d. The name of the house, which dates back to the first century BC, was derived from a Latin inscription to the right of its entrance that translates as: \u201cLovers like bees pass a sweet life like honey. I wish it were so.\u201d The home\u2019s impeccably preserved frescoes contain images representing life and landscapes. Two other restored homes \u2013 House of the Europa Ship and House of the Orchard \u2013 have also been reopened. In addition, works to make the site more secure have been completed. \u201cPompeii is now completely safe and so the loss of further archaeological material can be avoided,\u201d said Massimo Osanna, the park\u2019s superintendent. Pompeii, which attracts almost 4 million visitors a year, has come a long way since 2013, when Unesco threatened to place it on its list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation. The threat followed several incidents over the previous years, including the collapse of the House of Gladiators and a several walls. Other shortcomings included a lack of qualified staff, structural damage and vandalism. The Great Pompeii Project also involved excavations at Regio V, a 21.8-hectare site to the north of the archaeological park. Work wrapped up towards the end of last year but over 18 months dozens of new discoveries were made, with one of the last major finds being a fresco depicting fighting gladiators. Human remains were also found, including the skeletons of two women and three children huddled together in a villa, as well as the remains of a harnessed horse and saddle. Meanwhile, the House of the Bicentenary, an ancient Roman domus at the archaeological site of Herculaneum, a town close to Pompeii that was also buried by Vesuvius, was reopened to the public in October after restoration works that lasted 35 years.",

      "body": "<p>The list of Andrew Weatherall\u2019s achievements as DJ, musician, songwriter, producer and remixer could fill a hefty volume. His career took him from working as an acid house DJ in the late 1980s to being a celebrated remixer of tracks by Happy Mondays, New Order and Primal Scream. His production work on Primal Scream\u2019s album Screamadelica (1991), creating a revolutionary mix of indie, hard rock, house and rave, helped the record to win the inaugural Mercury music prize the following year, and remains Weatherall\u2019s most memorable calling card to a mainstream audience.</p> <p>Then he moved on to an assortment of collaborative projects such as Blood Sugar, Two Lone Swordsmen and the Asphodells. More recently he had released a sequence of solo albums including Convenanza, Consolamentum (both 2016) and Qualia (2017).</p> <p>Weatherall, who has died of a pulmonary embolism aged 56, was regarded as a figurehead and major influencer of electronic and techno music, but was also a widely read man with whom a conversation might range from the 13th-century Albigensian Crusade to obscure mystics from the 20s. He possessed a scalpel-sharp sense of the absurd that enabled him to maintain a wry scepticism about his own abilities. \u201cI never meant this to be a career,\u201d he said in 2012. \u201cIt was just a job that paid for new clothes and records.\u201d</p> <p>Weatherall cited Donna Summer\u2019s Love to Love You Baby (1975), produced by the electro-pop pioneer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/28/giorgio-moroder-his-20-greatest-songs-ranked\" title=\"\">Giorgio Moroder</a>, as a record that helped fire his enthusiasm for music. His parents, Robert, a businessman, and Carol usually preferred middle-of-the-road pop, but were big fans of Summer\u2019s record. \u201cI like that there was something risque about it ...

      "body": "<p>Richly variegated and utterly plausible, with a distinctively weak \u201cr\u201d, the voice of the actor John Shrapnel, who has died aged 77 after suffering from cancer, was instantly recognisable on stage or screen over the past 50 years. He was therefore much in demand for voiceover work on documentaries or television adverts. He always sounded warm and urgent.</p> <p>But his glory was on the stage, often with the Royal Shakespeare Company or the National Theatre, for whom he played leading and prominent supporting roles from 1968 onwards, including a clutch with Laurence Olivier\u2019s NT company at the Old Vic \u2013 Banquo in Macbeth, Pentheus in the Bacchae and Orsino in Twelfth Night \u2013 between 1972 and 1975.</p> <p>His NT debut came as Charles Surface in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/sir-jonathan-miller-obituary\" title=\"\">Jonathan Miller</a>\u2019s remarkable, grimily realistic 1972 production of The School for Scandal. He worked well and often with Miller: as a notable, sweating Andrey in Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters at the Cambridge theatre in 1976; and in Miller\u2019s BBC television Shakespeare series of the 1980s, when he played Alcibiades opposite Jonathan Pryce\u2019s Timon of Athens, Hector in Troilus and Cressida and Kent to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-michael-hordern-1618094.html\" title=\"\">Sir Michael Hordern</a>\u2019s gloriously distracted King Lear, saddled with the equally senescent Fool of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/11/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Frank Middlemass</a>.</p> <p>Shrapnel was always interesting in these \u201csolid\u201d roles because he played them with such force and intelligence. He oozed gravitas and could make dullness seem virtuous, as he did with Tesman in a 1977 Hedda Gabler with Janet Suzman at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre in 1977, or, late on, as a tremendous Duncan in the Kenneth Branagh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jul/06/macbeth-branagh-manchester-review\" title=\"\">Macbeth</a> for the 2013 Manchester international festival.</p> <p>Unusually, he was marvellous as both Brutus (Riverside Studios, 1980) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/apr/21/theatre\" title=\"\">Julius Caesar</a> (for Deborah Warner, at the Barbican, 2005) in the same play. And he made a final indelible impression as an archbishop in the 2017 televised version of Mike Bartlett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/11/king-charles-iii-review-shakespearean-tragedy-phone-hacking-tim-pigott-smith\" title=\"\">King Charles III</a>, starring his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/09/tim-pigott-smith-obituary\" title=\"\">Tim Pigott-Smith</a> in his last TV appearance, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14e1e546a050da3cac4e9bdebc77aa93b771f70d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14e1e546a050da3cac4e9bdebc77aa93b771f70d/0_25_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Shrapnel, left, as the archbishop, with Tim Pigott-Smith in the title role of the TV film King Charles III, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Shrapnel, left, as the archbishop, with Tim Pigott-Smith in the title role of the TV film King Charles III, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Drama Republic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shrapnel was born in Birmingham, the elder son of the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary correspondent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/02/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Norman Shrapnel</a> and his wife Myfanwy (nee Edwards). One of his ancestors, Lt Gen Henry Shrapnel, invented the exploding cannonball and gave his name to the shards of metal produced in the impact. John was educated at Mile End school, Stockport, Greater Manchester, and, when the family moved south, the City of London school, where he played Hamlet.</p> <p>He took a degree at St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and made a professional debut as Claudio in Much Ado Nothing at the new Nottingham Playhouse in 1965.</p> <p>His major film debut was in Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) starring Suzman and Michael Jayston, and he scored a string of big successes on television as the Earl of Sussex in Elizabeth R (1971) with Glenda Jackson \u2013 he would be Lord Howard to Cate Blanchett\u2019s Gloriana in Shekhar Kapur\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/02/drama.romance\" title=\"\">Elizabeth: The Golden Age</a> in 2007 \u2013 as Sir Percival Glyde in The Woman in White (1982) with Diana Quick and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/10/guardianobituaries.broadcasting\" title=\"\">Ian Richardson</a>, and as Semper in Tony Palmer\u2019s Wagner (1983) alongside Richard Burton in the title role and the great German actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/08/guardianobituaries.germany\" title=\"\">Ekkehard Schall</a> as Franz Liszt.</p> <p>An intensity of presence on the stage, as well as a forbidding authority, made him a natural Claudius in Hamlet, but he added something else in Miller\u2019s production of that play (with Anton Lesser) at the Donmar in 1982: a moving and almost sympathetic study of a man seriously under-endowed with imagination.</p> <p>This ability to convey psychological layers in powerful figures served Shrapnel well both in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/18/john-barton-obituary\" title=\"\">John Barton</a>\u2019s 10-play epic, The Greeks, at the Aldwych in 1980, when he doubled a laconically wry Agamemnon with an imperious Apollo; and, especially, as the monstrously unflinching King Creon in Sophocles\u2019 Oedipal Theban trilogy, a role he played twice \u2013 first, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/20/broadcasting.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Don Taylor</a>\u2019s BBC television adaptation in 1986 (Juliet Stevenson as Antigone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/22/news.obituaries\" title=\"\">John Gielgud</a> as Tiresias), and then for the RSC in Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s version directed by Adrian Noble in 1992.</p> <p>In the second of these his purple-suited tyrant, with a face of granite and a voice of liquid gravel, became strangely battered and susceptible to emotional pleading.

      "bodyText": "Richly variegated and utterly plausible, with a distinctively weak \u201cr\u201d, the voice of the actor John Shrapnel, who has died aged 77 after suffering from cancer, was instantly recognisable on stage or screen over the past 50 years. He was therefore much in demand for voiceover work on documentaries or television adverts. He always sounded warm and urgent. But his glory was on the stage, often with the Royal Shakespeare Company or the National Theatre, for whom he played leading and prominent supporting roles from 1968 onwards, including a clutch with Laurence Olivier\u2019s NT company at the Old Vic \u2013 Banquo in Macbeth, Pentheus in the Bacchae and Orsino in Twelfth Night \u2013 between 1972 and 1975. His NT debut came as Charles Surface in Jonathan Miller\u2019s remarkable, grimily realistic 1972 production of The School for Scandal. He worked well and often with Miller: as a notable, sweating Andrey in Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters at the Cambridge theatre in 1976; and in Miller\u2019s BBC television Shakespeare series of the 1980s, when he played Alcibiades opposite Jonathan Pryce\u2019s Timon of Athens, Hector in Troilus and Cressida and Kent to Sir Michael Hordern\u2019s gloriously distracted King Lear, saddled with the equally senescent Fool of Frank Middlemass. Shrapnel was always interesting in these \u201csolid\u201d roles because he played them with such force and intelligence. He oozed gravitas and could make dullness seem virtuous, as he did with Tesman in a 1977 Hedda Gabler with Janet Suzman at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre in 1977, or, late on, as a tremendous Duncan in the Kenneth Branagh Macbeth for the 2013 Manchester international festival. Unusually, he was marvellous as both Brutus (Riverside Studios, 1980) and Julius Caesar (for Deborah Warner, at the Barbican, 2005) in the same play. And he made a final indelible impression as an archbishop in the 2017 televised version of Mike Bartlett\u2019s King Charles III, starring his friend Tim Pigott-Smith in his last TV appearance, too. Shrapnel was born in Birmingham, the elder son of the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary correspondent Norman Shrapnel and his wife Myfanwy (nee Edwards). One of his ancestors, Lt Gen Henry Shrapnel, invented the exploding cannonball and gave his name to the shards of metal produced in the impact. John was educated at Mile End school, Stockport, Greater Manchester, and, when the family moved south, the City of London school, where he played Hamlet. He took a degree at St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and made a professional debut as Claudio in Much Ado Nothing at the new Nottingham Playhouse in 1965. His major film debut was in Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) starring Suzman and Michael Jayston, and he scored a string of big successes on television as the Earl of Sussex in Elizabeth R (1971) with Glenda Jackson \u2013 he would be Lord Howard to Cate Blanchett\u2019s Gloriana in Shekhar Kapur\u2019s Elizabeth: The Golden Age in 2007 \u2013 as Sir Percival Glyde in The Woman in White (1982) with Diana Quick and Ian Richardson, and as Semper in Tony Palmer\u2019s Wagner (1983) alongside Richard Burton in the title role and the great German actor Ekkehard Schall as Franz Liszt. An intensity of presence on the stage, as well as a forbidding authority, made him a natural Claudius in Hamlet, but he added something else in Miller\u2019s production of that play (with Anton Lesser) at the Donmar in 1982: a moving and almost sympathetic study of a man seriously under-endowed with imagination. This ability to convey psychological layers in powerful figures served Shrapnel well both in John Barton\u2019s 10-play epic, The Greeks, at the Aldwych in 1980, when he doubled a laconically wry Agamemnon with an imperious Apollo; and, especially, as the monstrously unflinching King Creon in Sophocles\u2019 Oedipal Theban trilogy, a role he played twice \u2013 first, in Don Taylor\u2019s BBC television adaptation in 1986 (Juliet Stevenson as Antigone, John Gielgud as Tiresias), and then for the RSC in Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s version directed by Adrian Noble in 1992. In the second of these his purple-suited tyrant, with a face of granite and a voice of liquid gravel, became strangely battered and susceptible to emotional pleading. Creon does not cave in, and nor did Shrapnel, but he always found colour and humanity in his inhumanity. He played a jovial Samuel Pepys in Palmer\u2019s television film England, My England (1995), written by Charles Wood and John Osborne, and starring an unlikely duo of Michael Ball as Henry Purcell and Simon Callow as King Charles II; a non-speaking, dog-hunting taxidermist in the 101 Dalmatians film (1996) starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil; Julia Roberts\u2019s British press agent in Roger Michell\u2019s Notting Hill (1999); and another Greek worthy, old Nestor, in Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s all-action, highly enjoyable Troy (2004) starring Brad Pitt as Achilles. He was a Russian admiral in K-19: The Widowmaker (2001), Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s gripping movie, with Harrison Ford, about the Russian nuclear submarine malfunction. One of Shrapnel\u2019s sons, Lex, also appeared in that film, but their blood relationship was more fruitfully and indeed movingly mined in a 2015 Young Vic revival of Caryl Churchill\u2019s A Number. In this poignant, poetic piece about cloning and parenting, John played a father turning to a scientist who is meddling with genetic material, in order to clone his son Bernard, played by Lex. Later in the same year Shrapnel rejoined Branagh in his season at the Garrick, playing a powerful Camillo in The Winter\u2019s Tale and a mutinous old actor laddie in Terence Rattigan\u2019s Harlequinade. He was the sort of actor any manager or producer wanted in his company; first name on the team sheet. Outside his work, Shrapnel loved mountaineering, skiing and music. He is survived by his wife, Francesca Bartley, a landscape designer (and a daughter of Deborah Kerr), whom he married in 1975, by their three sons, Joe, Lex and Thomas \u2013 and by his younger brother, Hugh. \u2022 John Morley Shrapnel, actor, born 27 April 1942; died 14 February 2020 \u2022 This article was amended on 20 February 2020. In Caryl Churchill\u2019s A Number, John Shrapnel did not play \u201cthe crazy scientist meddling with genetic material\u201d but a father who turns to the scientist to clone his son.",

That\u2019s primarily down to 1991\u2019s indie-dance ur text Screamadelica and, by proxy, Andrew Weatherall. Yes, you\u2019ve surely heard Loaded a million times by now. If <em>compos mentis</em> (not necessarily a given), you can probably anticipate every part\u2019s arrival: the bongos, the lightning-bolt riffs, the girl-group harmonies, each hiccup of the loping bassline, a defiant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnGzl-OEyGE\">Peter Fonda</a> igniting a conga line that\u2019s snaked nonstop for 30 years. While Alan McGee was <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/primal-scream-74-1287526\">doling out ecstasy pills</a> and Inner City to a proselytising Bobby Gillespie, a still green Weatherall was behind the desk, making it all gel. Even if Andy had hung up his headphones after Screamadelica, his legend would have been enshrined.</p> <h2>Saint Etienne \u2013 Only Love Can Break Your Heart (Andrew Weatherall\u2019s A Mix In Two Halves Remix) (1990)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdeKMXdWIE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/utdeKMXdWIE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Weatherall was a master of tension and release, whose latter-day sets would stretch for hour after hour, then often continue semi-announced in a nearby pub the next day. Even so, resting on little more than a rumbling bassline and some muffled speech for half the runtime of this languorous Saint Etienne remix was a bold move. The track is cleaved in two by a brief speech about spliffs (typical) before kicking into action, but you find yourself pining to run the bloodshot buildup from the edge. That chest-rattling bass is the star; never was Weatherall closer to King Tubby, one of his all-time favourites, than here.</p> <h2>Two Lone Swordsmen \u2013 Glide By Shooting (1996)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR7uMAbEITs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mR7uMAbEITs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Though Weatherall turned in just the third ever BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix back in 1993, his 1996 entry is usually held up as not only his own best, but one of the finest in the series\u2019s history, a masterclass in depth and poise.

Released under the copyright-winking Bocca Juniors with Hugo Nicolson also at the desk, Raise shows off a somewhat messy synergy that stands up surprisingly well. It has a similar attitude to Weatherall and Paul Oakenfold\u2019s Club Mix of Happy Mondays\u2019 Hallelujah, but balances the cocksure strut with Anna Haigh\u2019s commandeering vocals and a hip-housey rap interlude (hey, it <em>was </em>1990). That nagging piano line was another of Weatherall\u2019s canny nabs, pinched from Thrashing Doves\u2019 Je$u$ on the Payroll, though banged out on a grand piano that FFRR records had paid \u00a31,000 to rent for the day.

Adding extra grit to the taut, claustrophobic, occasionally circuit-fried machine funk that the Swordsmen nailed on their 2000 standout LP Tiny Reminders, this twitchy cut demonstrates that the duo could make nicotine-stained basement bangers with the best of them.

Sabresonic (1993) and Sabresonic II (1995) function like a map of club music, encompassing bleep and bass, depth-charge dub techno, progressive house epics, trance via Goa and Frankfurt, and even downtempo detours into the chillout room. Inter-Lergen-Ten-Ko II manages to get everything under a nine-minute roof with an almost symphonic approach, a breaksy soundsystem punisher that features live percussion and oddball effects to send you west. Though a committed psychonaut in the mid-90s, Weatherall still had an acute sense of when something was <em>a little</em> <em>too much</em>. The dramatic rave vocal treads a fine line of naffness, but is ultimately anchored by the reinforced steel of the production undergirding it. A hair-raiser, then and now.</p> <h2>Hardway Brothers \u2013 Mania Theme (Andrew Weatherall Remix) (2012)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuqoysvbSLQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UuqoysvbSLQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Over time, Weatherall evolved into a global ringleader of a slo-mo dance music we might call the Chug: daring, but a dark art if you can master it.

To offset the risk of playing at lower speeds to crowds who were, as Weatherall would often laugh, on loads of drugs, he would go for records with unassailable presence. This edit of Hardway Brothers \u2013 a group including Sean Johnston, his partner in club night A Love from Outer Space \u2013 was particularly lysergic, wielding a gurgling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/tadao-kikumoto-roland\">303</a> that could induce cold sweats from 10 paces. At just 103bpm, it would be compliant with ALFOS\u2019 imposed ceiling of 122bpm tops, while carrying enough character to blast away songs twice as fast.</p> <h2>Ricardo Villalobos \u2013 Dexter (Two Lone Swordsmen Mix) (2004)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeDxhr0BIJ0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zeDxhr0BIJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Part of Weatherall\u2019s enduring appeal was just how far out he stood. The incongruity of this salt\u2019n\u2019pepper-bearded, chain-smoking, vaguely vaudevillian figure, and an audience of saucer-eyed young ravers conditioned to expect something different as their DJ hero of the weekend, was part of the fun. This disjunct could be a lot of fun in his output, too. Ricardo Villalobos\u2019s Dexter is a minimal techno classic, with a sour central refrain known to instantly melt fields of addled ravers into floods of tears. It\u2019s the kind of tune it\u2019s usually forbidden to touch, let alone retool. So you imagine Villalobos, himself no stranger to a wayward remix, would have raised a smile when he received the test pressing from Two Lone Swordsmen and found his scene-defining hit had been reborn as a cousin of the Cure\u2019s A Forest.</p> <h2>My Bloody Valentine \u2013 Soon (Andy Weatherall Mix) (1990)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOBn50HHbRs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yOBn50HHbRs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>My Bloody Valentine\u2019s strength lay not just in their noise \u2013 fearsome, but ultimately replicable \u2013 but their ability to procure beauty out of it.

      "bodyText": "Primal Scream \u2013 Loaded (1990) No matter how many dodgy rootin-tootin\u2019 singles or car-crash gigs they get through, Primal Scream have limitless goodwill in the bank. That\u2019s primarily down to 1991\u2019s indie-dance ur text Screamadelica and, by proxy, Andrew Weatherall. Yes, you\u2019ve surely heard Loaded a million times by now. If compos mentis (not necessarily a given), you can probably anticipate every part\u2019s arrival: the bongos, the lightning-bolt riffs, the girl-group harmonies, each hiccup of the loping bassline, a defiant Peter Fonda igniting a conga line that\u2019s snaked nonstop for 30 years. While Alan McGee was doling out ecstasy pills and Inner City to a proselytising Bobby Gillespie, a still green Weatherall was behind the desk, making it all gel. Even if Andy had hung up his headphones after Screamadelica, his legend would have been enshrined. Saint Etienne \u2013 Only Love Can Break Your Heart (Andrew Weatherall\u2019s A Mix In Two Halves Remix) (1990) Weatherall was a master of tension and release, whose latter-day sets would stretch for hour after hour, then often continue semi-announced in a nearby pub the next day. Even so, resting on little more than a rumbling bassline and some muffled speech for half the runtime of this languorous Saint Etienne remix was a bold move. The track is cleaved in two by a brief speech about spliffs (typical) before kicking into action, but you find yourself pining to run the bloodshot buildup from the edge. That chest-rattling bass is the star; never was Weatherall closer to King Tubby, one of his all-time favourites, than here. Two Lone Swordsmen \u2013 Glide By Shooting (1996) Though Weatherall turned in just the third ever BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix back in 1993, his 1996 entry is usually held up as not only his own best, but one of the finest in the series\u2019s history, a masterclass in depth and poise. There are four cuts in the tracklist from Two Lone Swordsmen \u2013 his then recently formed group with Keith Tenniswood, which proved the most durable and creatively rewarding of all Weatherall\u2019s many alliances \u2013 including an introductory airing to the classic Glide By Shooting. With a subaquatic melody, an undercurrent of wibbling noise and a haunted air about it, it is pretty strange for a deep house song. It also slaps, and sounds even more robust as it hurtles past early on in the mix \u2013 a testament to Weatherall\u2019s ability to constantly improve on source material even when it was his own. Bocca Juniors \u2013 Raise (1990) For all the grand mythologising around Boy\u2019s Own and its role in inducing a Balearic culture shock to the British Isles, the reason Weatherall, Pete Heller and Terry Farley worked so well as a production unit can be broken down fairly simply: Heller and Farley brought the soul, Weatherall brought the edge.

When a character is found to be an avid reader, we are told, his shelf only contains \u201ctwo or three detective stories: he can\u2019t have been enamoured of the latter, as he hadn\u2019t bought any more\u201d.</p> <p>Yet while Simenon may not have taken his detective books as seriously as bleak masterpieces such as The Snow Was Dirty, that doesn\u2019t mean that we should underestimate Maigret and the Man on the Bench. That final chapter may well have taken Simenon less time to write than it took me to read, but there\u2019s also something about its rushed and heedless nature that works, the false note that rings in your ears long after the music fades. It\u2019s also an ideal fit for the state of mind of the novel\u2019s protagonist. Maigret doesn\u2019t really care who has murdered Louis Thouret. He regards the killer as inconsequential and unpleasant. The criminal is one of those nasty facts of life that can\u2019t be avoided, but shouldn\u2019t be allowed to take over too much headspace. Maigret doesn\u2019t want to waste time on him \u2013 so why should we?</p> <p>Besides, the real interest isn\u2019t in the conventional detective narrative surrounding a murderer and their victim. It\u2019s in working out how this particular victim came to be in a position that resulted in his death. Why was Thouret found wearing fancy brown \u201cgoose poo shoes\u201d when his wife said he left the house wearing black ones? Was there something she didn\u2019t know? Of course there was \u2013 and in working out what that may have been, Simenon takes us deep into the life of a disappointed man.</p> <p> We can intuit all kinds of emotional details about Thouret in the descriptions of his home, his old colleagues, the places he has been choosing to spend his time, the clothes he wears and when he wears them. Simenon tried to explain how he did it in that same Paris Review interview where he was so disparaging of commercial art:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I try to do with prose, with the novel, what generally is done with poetry. I mean I try to go beyond the real, and the explainable ideas, and to explore the man \u2013 not doing it by the sound of the words as the poetical novels of the beginning of the century tried to do. I can\u2019t explain technically but \u2013 I try to put in my novels some things which you can\u2019t explain, to give some message which does not exist practically \u2026 \u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s this hovering around the edge of the intangible that gives Maigret and the Man on the Bench its power. We get the sense we are approaching the biggest and most inscrutable mystery of them all: the workings of someone else\u2019s mind. Compared to that, the sordid details of a killing seem almost immaterial. And if that also leads the book to have a strange and sudden ending, so be it.</p>",

How is it fair or democratic that they should be denied freedom of movement because of an election they couldn\u2019t even participate in? My Spanish partner and I enjoy travelling a lot and it is going to be just ridiculous for us to have to pass through different passport controls.

I seem to remember thinking at the time that, however shameful the debate leading up to the referendum was, the fact that so many of the Brits living/working in Europe and all of the Europeans living /working in the UK were excluded from voting was even more shameful \u2013 so any small actions we can take to redress the balance would be welcome. <strong>Iain Buchanan, 70+, retired, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I want my children to have the same access I enjoyed growing up\u2019</h2> <p>This would perhaps go some way towards appeasing people who voted remain.

It would be optional, so people in favour of a hard Brexit will not be \u2018forced\u2019 to be part of the EU, but equally I won\u2019t be \u2018forced\u2019 to be entirely disassociated from something I wish we could stay a part of.

She is bold in having a dancer (Marcelino Samb\u00e9) embody the cello itself, kneeling in front of Du Pr\u00e9 (a radiant Lauren Cuthbertson), arm raised like the neck of the instrument as the cellist draws her hand across the air holding an invisible bow.</p> <p>This picture spirals off into something more expansive, but they return to the motif. Mostly it seems to work, although there are cumbersome moments of pas de deux, not least due to the awkwardness of the cellist\u2019s wide-legged stance.

Aware of the music\u2019s importance, Marston crowds the scene, with the imperious Ball dancing off the podium, an orchestra of dancers rising and falling and Cuthbertson changing from bright innocent girl to woman in love as we watch. It\u2019s arguably an overload, although more generally the whirlwind of motion evokes exactly the giddy joy and genius shown in Christopher Nupen\u2019s film The Trout, featuring Du Pr\u00e9 and Barenboim in their youthful prime.</p> <p>Struck while cruelly young by multiple sclerosis, Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s vitality is drained by her illness and, perhaps more profoundly, by her inability to play. There are multiple strands of relationships to unpick (Kristen McNally as Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s mother is particularly good) but with Samb\u00e9\u2019s warm presence like a spirit, lover and guardian in one, The Cellist is most effective as a portrait of a woman\u2019s deep love affair with music.</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/the-cellist-dances-at-a-gathering-details\">Royal Opera House, London</a>, until 4 March.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 danced with her cello. In concert footage, her body sighs and sways as her music soars. But it\u2019s a leap from lyrical presence on the podium to transposing Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s tragically short life into dance, a challenge taken up by choreographer Cathy Marston in her first main stage commission for the Royal Ballet. The Cellist comes in a double bill with Jerome Robbins\u2019 1969 Dances at a Gathering \u2013 Chopin piano, dreamy pastels, choreography of conversational nuance and lovely, subtle dancing \u2013 but it\u2019s Marston\u2019s ingenuity we\u2019re all here to see. She is bold in having a dancer (Marcelino Samb\u00e9) embody the cello itself, kneeling in front of Du Pr\u00e9 (a radiant Lauren Cuthbertson), arm raised like the neck of the instrument as the cellist draws her hand across the air holding an invisible bow. This picture spirals off into something more expansive, but they return to the motif. Mostly it seems to work, although there are cumbersome moments of pas de deux, not least due to the awkwardness of the cellist\u2019s wide-legged stance. But there\u2019s also the easy flow of bodies entwined, the way artist, instrument and music become one. Composer Philip Feeney weaves extracts from Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s rep into his score and Marston has Du Pr\u00e9 and conductor Daniel Barenboim (Matthew Ball) fall in love on the concert stage, locking eyes over Elgar\u2019s Cello Concerto. Aware of the music\u2019s importance, Marston crowds the scene, with the imperious Ball dancing off the podium, an orchestra of dancers rising and falling and Cuthbertson changing from bright innocent girl to woman in love as we watch. It\u2019s arguably an overload, although more generally the whirlwind of motion evokes exactly the giddy joy and genius shown in Christopher Nupen\u2019s film The Trout, featuring Du Pr\u00e9 and Barenboim in their youthful prime. Struck while cruelly young by multiple sclerosis, Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s vitality is drained by her illness and, perhaps more profoundly, by her inability to play. There are multiple strands of relationships to unpick (Kristen McNally as Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s mother is particularly good) but with Samb\u00e9\u2019s warm presence like a spirit, lover and guardian in one, The Cellist is most effective as a portrait of a woman\u2019s deep love affair with music. At the Royal Opera House, London, until 4 March.",

      "bodyText": "During his tenure as mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg oversaw one of the most discriminatory surveillance programs in our nation\u2019s history. His police department\u2019s \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d mapped out Muslim American communities and infiltrated and spied on everything from kebab shops to Muslim student whitewater rafting trips. Not only was the program offensive to American values \u2013 even the then New Jersey Republican governor, Chris Christie, an ally of President Trump\u2019s, was outraged upon learning of it \u2013 it did nothing to keep New Yorkers safe. The Demographics Unit\u2019s work did not generate a single terror lead. But Bloomberg himself has always been unapologetic, insisting the program was justified. During the 2016 Democratic national convention, Bloomberg was given a primetime speaking role. Working with a colleague, I interviewed many key Democrats \u2013 from members of Congress to representatives of the Clinton campaign \u2013 and asked them if Bloomberg should at least apologize for overseeing this program. Almost no Democrat I talked to would call on Bloomberg to apologize \u2013 foreshadowing his growing power over the party. Bloomberg has come under fire from activists for his role in implementing the stop and frisk program, where police were directed to stop, question and pat down hundreds of thousands of innocent people, mostly African American and Latino, as part of the mayor\u2019s signature gun control program. There\u2019s plenty of other reasons for Democrats to be skeptical of Bloomberg. For one, he is only a part-time member of their party, having served as a Republican mayor of New York City.

And yet at the very same time, he is facing very little criticism from the Democratic party\u2019s establishment. \u201cI think that his involvement in this campaign will be a positive one,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, one of the country\u2019s most powerful Democratic party figures. Not long after the stop and frisk controversy resurfaced, a slew of African American politicians endorsed Bloomberg. The reason Bloomberg is able to float above criticism is because he\u2019s the eighth richest person in the country. In 2018, he spent $100m backing various House Democrats in their congressional races. One of his gun control groups spent $4.5m electing Lucy McBath, the African American Georgia congresswoman who endorsed Bloomberg in the midst of the latest stop and frisk controversy. Some of those who have supported Bloomberg recently were not even shy about why they were so forgiving of his record on policing issues. Calvin Butts, a Harlem pastor who came to Bloomberg\u2019s aid in February, admitted that Bloomberg gave him money for his economic development operation. \u201cHe used his money, which is one of the reasons I continue to support him, to express his sincerity,\u201d Butts said bluntly. Bloomberg\u2019s ability to buy silence presents a challenge not only to the Democrats, but to democracy itself, because while American democracy can\u2019t be snuffed out by brute force, it can be drowned by money. Bloomberg has spent over $350m on his presidential campaign so far, deploying a barrage of television ads and endorsements that has rocketed him to third place in national polls.

      "body": "<p>Denny Hamlin won his second straight Daytona 500 and third overall, beating Ryan Blaney in a photo finish marred by a terrifying crash that sent Ryan Newman to hospital on Monday.</p> <p>Newman had surged into the lead on the final lap when Blaney\u2019s bumper caught the back of his Ford and sent Newman into the wall.

      "body": "<p>A mass grave containing the remains of dozens of victims of the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/black-death\">Black Death</a> offers chilling new evidence of the speed and scale of the devastation the plague brought to rural England, according to archaeologists.</p> <p>The grave, discovered in a remote corner of rural Lincolnshire, has been dated to the 14th century, almost certainly to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death_in_England\">earliest and deadliest medieval outbreak</a> of the disease in 1348-9.</p> <p>It contained the bodies of at least 48 men, women and children who were laid in a sandy pit within days of each other. DNA tests on the bodies found the plague pathogen, confirming how they died.</p> <p>About half the population of England was wiped out within 18 months by the 1348-9 pandemic. Perhaps surprisingly, however, direct archaeological evidence for the Black Death is extremely rare, according to <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/archaeology/people/willmott\">Hugh Willmott</a>, senior lecturer in European historical archaeology at the University of Sheffield, who led the excavation.</p> <p>While a small number of plague mass graves have been <a href=\"https://www.mola.org.uk/black-death-cemetery-east-smithfield-london\">excavated in London</a>, he said, nothing comparable has ever been found in a rural context, making this a discovery of national importance. Analysis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/30/black-death-mass-burial-pit-abbey-lincolnshire-skeletons-dna-plague\">the find</a>, made in 2013, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2019.213\">has been published for the first time in Antiquity</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the assumptions in the past has been that perhaps you get mass graves in towns where you have a higher density of people, [whereas] in villages people were being buried as normal in the parish churchyard,\u201d said Willmott.</p> <p>\u201cBut actually what this suggests is that this was a rural community that couldn\u2019t cope, and when the Black Death arrived, the normal system for doing things broke down.\u201d</p> <p>The grave was discovered by chance during a survey of the now-ruined Augustinian priory of <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/thornton-abbey-and-gatehouse/\">Thornton Abbey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thornton+Abbey,+Ulceby+DN39+6TU/@53.6549963,-1.4304107,8z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487894015e6b1bf7:0xf462ccd1c01e9a9f!8m2!3d53.6549963!4d-0.3098053\">close to Immingham </a>in north Lincolnshire, on the east coast of England. Nearby, archaeologists found the site of a medieval hospital attached to the priory, suggesting the dead or dying had been brought there in desperation as the plague struck, overwhelming the canons who were then forced to bury them together.</p> <p>\u201cPeople couldn\u2019t be buried in the parish graveyard \u2013 perhaps the priest or the gravedigger has died \u2013 [so] you turn to the church, the canons at the abbey down the road. This is a snapshot of a not often seen rural catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>While the layout of the bodies showed they had all been buried within a period of days, said Willmott, they had not been flung without ceremony into a shared pit.

      "bodyText": "A mass grave containing the remains of dozens of victims of the Black Death offers chilling new evidence of the speed and scale of the devastation the plague brought to rural England, according to archaeologists. The grave, discovered in a remote corner of rural Lincolnshire, has been dated to the 14th century, almost certainly to the earliest and deadliest medieval outbreak of the disease in 1348-9. It contained the bodies of at least 48 men, women and children who were laid in a sandy pit within days of each other. DNA tests on the bodies found the plague pathogen, confirming how they died. About half the population of England was wiped out within 18 months by the 1348-9 pandemic. Perhaps surprisingly, however, direct archaeological evidence for the Black Death is extremely rare, according to Hugh Willmott, senior lecturer in European historical archaeology at the University of Sheffield, who led the excavation. While a small number of plague mass graves have been excavated in London, he said, nothing comparable has ever been found in a rural context, making this a discovery of national importance. Analysis of the find, made in 2013, has been published for the first time in Antiquity. \u201cOne of the assumptions in the past has been that perhaps you get mass graves in towns where you have a higher density of people, [whereas] in villages people were being buried as normal in the parish churchyard,\u201d said Willmott. \u201cBut actually what this suggests is that this was a rural community that couldn\u2019t cope, and when the Black Death arrived, the normal system for doing things broke down.\u201d The grave was discovered by chance during a survey of the now-ruined Augustinian priory of Thornton Abbey, close to Immingham in north Lincolnshire, on the east coast of England. Nearby, archaeologists found the site of a medieval hospital attached to the priory, suggesting the dead or dying had been brought there in desperation as the plague struck, overwhelming the canons who were then forced to bury them together. \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t be buried in the parish graveyard \u2013 perhaps the priest or the gravedigger has died \u2013 [so] you turn to the church, the canons at the abbey down the road. This is a snapshot of a not often seen rural catastrophe.\u201d While the layout of the bodies showed they had all been buried within a period of days, said Willmott, they had not been flung without ceremony into a shared pit. Instead, the victims \u2013 more than half of whom were children \u2013 were shrouded and laid carefully side by side. \u201cThey are trying to treat them as respectfully as possible, because in the middle ages it\u2019s very important to give the dead a proper burial. Even though it is the height of a terrible disaster, they are taking as much care as they can with the dead.\u201d",

Christensen said he had sent a letter to Johnson in which he noted that the prime minister had recently admitted that Britain\u2019s extradition treaty with the US was \u201cimbalanced\u201d following the rejection of an extradition request for Anne Sacoolas, the woman accused of causing the the death of motorcyclist Harry Dunn. Christensen said: \u201cI am a big fan of Trump, I am a big fan of Bojo [Boris Johnson] but I\u2019ll tell you what I value more: free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of Australians on the right and left who think that Julian Assange is a rat bag, that I am a rat bag, but that he should be brought home.\u201d \u201cI hope that Boris Johnson withdraws this case that is before the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a problem here \u2026 What if it was a British journalist or an outspoken British citizen who went on holiday to another country that has an extradition treaty with China, and China wanted to extradite that British citizen?\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is expected to visit Assange in prison on Wednesday. The first part of the hearing next week at Woolwich crown court will cover arguments that the extradition is politically motivated and an abuse of process. A decision is unlikely to be handed down for several months - and even then, it is likely the losing side would appeal. The Australian MPs\u2019 appearance in London before the start of an extradition hearing next week came as a letter by a group of doctors representing 117 physicians and psychologists from 18 nations called for an end to what they described as \u201cthe psychological torture and medical neglect of Julian Assange\u201d. The letter, which was published in the medical journal the Lancet and has also been sent to the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, expresses concern over Assange\u2019s fitness to take part in the legal proceedings. The letter, which echoes the concerns raised by the UN special rapporteur on torture, Nils Melzer, on Assange\u2019s health, adds: \u201cShould Assange die in a UK prison, as the UN special rapporteur on torture has warned, he will have effectively been tortured to death. \u201cMuch of that torture will have taken place in a prison medical ward, on doctors\u2019 watch. The medical profession cannot afford to stand silently by, on the wrong side of torture and the wrong side of history, while such a travesty unfolds.\u201d Assange\u2019s father, John Shipton, told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday: \u201cThe ceaseless anxiety that Julian\u2019s been under for now 10 years, it has had a profoundly deleterious effect. I can\u2019t speculate on to his state of mind, but I imagine that he will be really worried because being sent to the United States is a death sentence.\u201d Assange is being held in Belmarsh prison in south-east London. A US grand jury has indicted him on 18 charges \u2013 17 of which fall under the Espionage Act \u2013 around conspiracy to receive, obtaining and disclosing classified diplomatic and military documents.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a profound psychological transformation that happens upon becoming a mother. Many women turn to their own mothers to glean insight, sometimes feeling a deepening of connection, or at the very least a more well-rounded understanding of their maternal lineage. But if your mother has passed away, or if the relationship is too damaging to hold on to, nascent motherhood can be laced with a new kind of grief.</p> <p>In the absence of that connection, the transition to motherhood might take on different meaning altogether. Some women find they have a new appreciation for the complexities of what their own mothers endured; they may begin to feel more strongly bonded to them even in their absence. Others may experience a sense of isolation, pangs of envy or fits of anger. Adjusting to motherhood without a mother as a touchstone can make for a complex and poignant period.</p> <p>Being motherless amid the experience of pregnancy and new motherhood spurs a series of unanswerable questions, almost immediately. \u201cWhat was my mom\u2019s pregnancy like with me?\u201d \u201cWas I like this as a baby?\u201d \u201cWas nursing this painful for her?\u201d \u201cWould she be able to help me figure out <em>how to be a mom</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Arriving in the role of mother \u2013 a role that previously belonged to her and her alone \u2013 can cause a painful awareness that though we may remember what it was like to be mothered by our moms, we didn\u2019t know them as a woman for whom motherhood was a new, foundation-rocking identity rather than an innate status.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve started to realize I never got the chance to deeply know my mother,\u201d says Shishi Rose, 30, who is pregnant and whose mother died when she was 18. \u201cI\u2019ve begun grieving again, I think, more for never really knowing her.\u201d</p> <p>That grief \u2013 which may be resurfacing for the first time in years \u2013 can deepen the already common sense of isolation new moms often experience. Those harder, fraught emotions lead to another difficult unanswerable question: \u201cDid she feel these feelings?\u201d</p> <p>Brittany Logue, 28, lost her mother in 2016, and her son was born two years later. She recalls a moment in the first weeks of his life: \u201cI found myself sitting on my couch with this beautiful, perfect baby. And I was just in tears,\u201d she says. Logue longed for her mother\u2019s support \u2013 and, perhaps, confirmation that this was normal and that her mother had experienced this vulnerability, too.</p> <p>A new kind of grief may begin to percolate even before the first positive pregnancy test. After Logue\u2019s mother died, the thought of trying to conceive at all seemed like a betrayal. \u201cI felt guilty that I was trying to conceive right after my mom died. It felt wrong,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lauren, 33 (who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy) is pregnant, and has been estranged from her mother for 16 years. \u201cI have found pregnancy to be an incredibly isolating experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll have a symptom and I want my mom. I find it so strange that you can have a hard relationship with a parent, but still think <em>I just want my mom.</em>\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I find it so strange that you can have a hard relationship with a parent, but still think I just want my mom</p> <footer> <cite>Lauren</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rose felt similarly. \u201cBeing pregnant without a mother stepped me back into a grieving process that I mistakenly thought I had already healed from,\u201d she says. Grief and longing can also make us feel detached, dissociated even, complicating the corporeal experience of pregnancy.</p> <p>\u201cI was so close to my mother, the idea of becoming a mother and not having my own was unacceptable to me,\u201d says Anna Overballe, 28, whose mother died last year.</p> <p>\u201cAt times,\u201d Overballe adds, \u201cI even felt resentful that my baby had literally invaded my space and forced me to think about something other than my mom. I was concerned I\u2019d neglect my grief because of my pregnancy.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a profound psychological transformation that happens upon becoming a mother. Many women turn to their own mothers to glean insight, sometimes feeling a deepening of connection, or at the very least a more well-rounded understanding of their maternal lineage. But if your mother has passed away, or if the relationship is too damaging to hold on to, nascent motherhood can be laced with a new kind of grief. In the absence of that connection, the transition to motherhood might take on different meaning altogether. Some women find they have a new appreciation for the complexities of what their own mothers endured; they may begin to feel more strongly bonded to them even in their absence. Others may experience a sense of isolation, pangs of envy or fits of anger. Adjusting to motherhood without a mother as a touchstone can make for a complex and poignant period. Being motherless amid the experience of pregnancy and new motherhood spurs a series of unanswerable questions, almost immediately. \u201cWhat was my mom\u2019s pregnancy like with me?\u201d \u201cWas I like this as a baby?\u201d \u201cWas nursing this painful for her?\u201d \u201cWould she be able to help me figure out how to be a mom?\u201d Arriving in the role of mother \u2013 a role that previously belonged to her and her alone \u2013 can cause a painful awareness that though we may remember what it was like to be mothered by our moms, we didn\u2019t know them as a woman for whom motherhood was a new, foundation-rocking identity rather than an innate status. \u201cI\u2019ve started to realize I never got the chance to deeply know my mother,\u201d says Shishi Rose, 30, who is pregnant and whose mother died when she was 18. \u201cI\u2019ve begun grieving again, I think, more for never really knowing her.\u201d That grief \u2013 which may be resurfacing for the first time in years \u2013 can deepen the already common sense of isolation new moms often experience. Those harder, fraught emotions lead to another difficult unanswerable question: \u201cDid she feel these feelings?\u201d Brittany Logue, 28, lost her mother in 2016, and her son was born two years later. She recalls a moment in the first weeks of his life: \u201cI found myself sitting on my couch with this beautiful, perfect baby. And I was just in tears,\u201d she says. Logue longed for her mother\u2019s support \u2013 and, perhaps, confirmation that this was normal and that her mother had experienced this vulnerability, too. A new kind of grief may begin to percolate even before the first positive pregnancy test. After Logue\u2019s mother died, the thought of trying to conceive at all seemed like a betrayal. \u201cI felt guilty that I was trying to conceive right after my mom died. It felt wrong,\u201d she says. Lauren, 33 (who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy) is pregnant, and has been estranged from her mother for 16 years. \u201cI have found pregnancy to be an incredibly isolating experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll have a symptom and I want my mom. I find it so strange that you can have a hard relationship with a parent, but still think I just want my mom.\u201d Rose felt similarly. \u201cBeing pregnant without a mother stepped me back into a grieving process that I mistakenly thought I had already healed from,\u201d she says. Grief and longing can also make us feel detached, dissociated even, complicating the corporeal experience of pregnancy. \u201cI was so close to my mother, the idea of becoming a mother and not having my own was unacceptable to me,\u201d says Anna Overballe, 28, whose mother died last year. \u201cAt times,\u201d Overballe adds, \u201cI even felt resentful that my baby had literally invaded my space and forced me to think about something other than my mom. I was concerned I\u2019d neglect my grief because of my pregnancy. And I was worried that losing my own mother would make me a worse mother.\u201d Overballe\u2019s daughter was stillborn, so these questions remain for her. When a newborn does enter the picture, the circuitousness of grief can take a toll on the ensuing bonding process. Sarah Komers, 38, is now a mother of three, but had difficulty nurturing her relationship with her firstborn. Her mother struggled with mental health issues, and she was so terrified of being a \u201cbad\u201d mom that she actively overdid it in an attempt to be \u201cperfect\u201d. As a result of this preoccupation, her hypervigilance \u2013 born out of trauma and fear \u2013 was limiting her ability to truly connect with or enjoy her new baby. \u201cIt took about six months for us to bond,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t confident in my abilities as a mom the first time around, whatsoever.\u201d These periods of disconnection can resurface the same way grief often does: intermittently, without warning. Logue, for example, has found it hard to spend time with her own child on Mother\u2019s Day. \u201cMy husband tries to do things for me, but the whole day all I want to do is sit in bed and cry. I don\u2019t want to celebrate myself when I can\u2019t celebrate her.\u201d These experiences of mothering without a map may create a panoply of emotions \u2013 often ones that aren\u2019t associated with the idyllic maternal energy we may aspire to. Instead we may feel envy, anger, resentment. Overballe often feels frustrated. \u201cI will never know if my mother would have agreed with the way I honor my lost daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother was always my biggest guide, so not having her can make me doubt my choices in my own version of motherhood.\u201d Logue, to her own chagrin, finds she sometimes has difficulty around her sister-in-law\u2019s family. \u201cSeeing them together \u2013 mother, daughter, granddaughter \u2013 can bring up resentment and a little bit of jealousy in me,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Group of the year Coldplay Foals Bring Me the Horizon D-Block Europe Bastille Speaking from the venal, artistically disinterested, industry-beancounter point of view that is appropriate for the Brits, groups are nothing compared with solo artists in 2020. None of the acts up for group of the year has received any other nominations; it\u2019s only the second time ever that no group has been up for album of the year, and none are scheduled to play live tonight. Which is a shame because there is some middling-to-good talent here. Coldplay are perhaps too big to fail, with their album Everyday Life a spirited, adventurous and \u2013 by their standards \u2013 politically engaged record. But given Academy members could give two votes to Foals, for each of their two robust albums last year, Chris Martin et al are likely to lose out. Bastille continue to slip down the zeitgeist like a lubed toboggan, and D-Block Europe, while a heartening independent British success story, rely too much on trap cliche. Bring Me the Horizon deserve this \u2013 their album amo was a towering confection of pop, emo and hard rock, like a cloud of black candy floss. Will win: Foals Should win: Bring Me the Horizon Female solo artist Mabel Freya Ridings FKA twigs Charli XCX Mahalia There are so few women on this year\u2019s ballots that you half expected the Brits to try and put a shaved Ed Sheeran forward for this category. Much ink has been spilled here on this topic but suffice to say, it is shameful that Mabel is the only British woman to appear elsewhere. It\u2019s likely she will win after a year in which she broke through into proper pan-demographic pop success (even if she hasn\u2019t yet matched Finders Keepers), though FKA twigs deserves it \u2013 and in a perfect world, album of the year \u2013 for her emotionally forthright Magdalene. Mahalia deserves her nod but will make better records; Freya Ridings doesn\u2019t deserve her nod and will perhaps make less awful records. The evergreen Charli XCX, meanwhile, has that particularly horrible kind of fame that means you\u2019re so famous to your fans that they feel they own you, while you remain totally unknown to nearly everyone else. Will win: Mabel Should win: FKA twigs Male solo artist Harry Styles Lewis Capaldi Dave Michael Kiwanuka Stormzy As the BPI\u2019s chairman tried to spin it, these shortlists are merely what voters, who are nearly 50% women, went for. Well, yes, but Academy members were given 26 women to pick from in British female, versus 84 men in this British male category \u2013 an imbalance that could be addressed immediately by the Brits, and more profoundly by labels who should be bringing more female talent through to make it to the longlist (which is currently dictated by chart success). All that said, there is some formidable male artistry at this year\u2019s awards and every kind of good male charisma: lawful-good from social consciences Michael Kiwanuka and Dave, neutral-good from statesmanlike sex magnets Stormzy and Harry Styles, and chaotic-good from larky emotional wreck Lewis Capaldi. Will win: Lewis Capaldi Should win: Lewis Capaldi New artist Aitch Lewis Capaldi Dave Mabel Sam Fender As if to prove the efficacy of the major-label assembly line that is the Brit awards, one former rising star award winner (Sam Fender) and two former nominees (Mabel, Lewis Capaldi) make it to the big leagues. Capaldi has this sewn up: he had the biggest-selling album of last year in the UK, topped the singles charts in the US and UK, and did it all with the demeanour of a substitute teacher who can\u2019t really be arsed. In a Britain that is allergic to pretension and addicted to really sad ballads, Capaldi is our god. Aitch will have to console himself with a new award at the Brits this year, the Ben Beaumont-Thomas Memorial Award for Troublingly Childlike Rappers Who My Girlfriend Would Nevertheless Risk It All For. Will win: Lewis Capaldi Should win: Lewis Capaldi Song Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber \u2013 I Don\u2019t Care Mabel \u2013 Don\u2019t Call Me Up Calvin Harris and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man \u2013 Giant Dave ft Burna Boy \u2013 Location Mark Ronson ft Miley Cyrus \u2013 Nothing Breaks Like a Heart AJ Tracey \u2013 Ladbroke Grove Lewis Capaldi \u2013 Someone You Loved Tom Walker \u2013 Just You and I Sam Smith and Normani \u2013 Dancing With a Stranger Stormzy \u2013 Vossi Bop Over the last few years mainstream pop songs have gone from being galumphing EDM brutes crashing on to the dancefloor with a tray of J\u00e4gerbombs to sleek wallflowers slipping through the crowd with an espresso martini.

However, they\u2019re up against Billie Eilish, a fount of pop invention who makes it feel like the wind has changed whenever she comes on the radio. Will win: Billie Eilish Should win: Billie Eilish International male solo artist Bruce Springsteen Burna Boy Tyler, the Creator Dermot Kennedy Post Malone A much less predictable but no less high quality field here. Tyler, the Creator rightly won a Grammy for his album Igor, but he remains a much more cult artist in the UK; Burna Boy is British pop\u2019s brilliant sideman du jour but is yet to have a solo breakthrough in the UK beyond the Afro-swing faithful.

The strip mall space had aviator sunglasses painted on the wall across from a \u201cRestore\u201d \u201cRebuild\u201d and \u201cUnite\u201d slogan, key tenets of the former vice-president\u2019s nostalgia-driven campaign.</p> <p>Having suffered embarrassing losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden\u2019s narrative of electability desperately needs reviving in Nevada. The former vice-president polls well in communities of color. Both Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 where he finished in fourth and fifth places, respectively \u2013 are over 90% white. But whether Nevada\u2019s diverse Democratic base will rescue his claim to viability is as uncertain as splitting aces on a cold blackjack table.</p> <p>Lucy, a retired letter carrier said she likes Biden\u2019s \u201coverall good view of the American people\u201d. \u201cHis empathy is something we need to bring back to our communities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A woman named Maria defended Biden\u2019s controversial touchy-feeliness as proof of his compassion, while adding: \u201cHe knows what to do when he gets to the White House. He has dignity, and he is a family man.\u201d</p> <p>Allan, wearing a military veteran\u2019s hat, said he liked Biden \u201cbecause I think he can beat Trump\u201d. Those sentiments were repeated.

Williamson has worked with vulnerable populations throughout his career. He was a licensed foster parent, and served as a court-appointed special advocate to look out for the best interests of children in abuse and neglect cases. Before that, he cared for people in residential and inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the appeals of Warren is that that\u2019s<em> </em>the focus of her work: let\u2019s do the most we can for people who have the least advantage. We have a lot of systemic things that need to be fixed.\u201d</p> <p>He likes that Warren approaches policy in an \u201covertly nerdy but evidence-based way\u201d.

      "bodyText": "At a strip mall across the street from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, several Bernie Sanders volunteers stared at their phones, pretending to be disinterested in politics. Fellow volunteers walked over to them, and pitched the Vermont senator\u2019s solutions to the student debt crisis and rising college tuition costs. Handing over clipboards, they offered volunteer information and urged their pretend-targets to commit to supporting Bernie. Then both groups traded roles, and those who played the distracted UNLV students practiced delivering Sanders\u2019 plans for reform. This was mid-January, and Sanders was already leading the organizing race in Nevada, the third presidential primary contest of the 2020 calendar. Nevada voters are headed to the polls on 22 February at noon, and the race is a crucial test case for the appeal of the Democratic presidential hopefuls among a diverse coalition of Democrats. The caucus format of the \u201cfirst in the west\u201d vote tends to favor the campaign with the strongest ground support. Nevadans who don\u2019t vote early have to arrive at designated caucus precincts by 12pm to stand in their preferred candidate\u2019s corner. Loyalty, in the raucous scene, can be tested. And tensions developed during debates and through paid and unpaid media may be on display. Nevadans working on the Las Vegas Strip who want to vote will be able to step away from their card tables, beverage stations, kitchens and housekeeping carts and join fellow staff in ballrooms reserved to caucus inside the MGM Grand, Bellagio, Wynn and other resorts. A Las Vegas Review-Journal and AARP Nevada poll released on Friday showed Sanders with 25% support, followed by former vice-president Joe Biden with 18%, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren at 13%, businessman Tom Steyer at 11%, and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg tied with Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar at 10%. In addition to a burgeoning army of volunteers, the Sanders campaign employs 250 people in the silver state, more than double the staff of Pete Buttigieg, the second-largest campaign at 100. Lourdes Esparza, 38, said she volunteers for Sanders because her mother and grandmother can\u2019t afford adequate healthcare and are forced to ration medicine and pass on doctor\u2019s appointments to avoid co-pays. Esparza canvasses door-to-door despite also working weekdays at a teachers union and weekends hostessing at a restaurant. \u201c\u2018How much is it going to cost?\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be the first words that come out of my grandmother\u2019s mouth when she gets sick,\u201d Esparza said. Austreberto Hernandez, a 26-year-old immigrant rights advocate, said he will support Sanders for his \u201cdeliberate\u201d approach to progressivism. \u201cI feel like Bernie Sanders normalized the idea of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants [in 2015] because he said it a million times on the campaign trail.\u201d \u201cAll that stuff \u2013 universal healthcare, a $15 minimum wage \u2013 Bernie just pounded to death and now they\u2019ve become household names.\u201d Late last month, at a Joe Biden campaign field office in North Las Vegas, a dozen supporters had gathered to be trained as precinct captains. The strip mall space had aviator sunglasses painted on the wall across from a \u201cRestore\u201d \u201cRebuild\u201d and \u201cUnite\u201d slogan, key tenets of the former vice-president\u2019s nostalgia-driven campaign. Having suffered embarrassing losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden\u2019s narrative of electability desperately needs reviving in Nevada. The former vice-president polls well in communities of color. Both Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 where he finished in fourth and fifth places, respectively \u2013 are over 90% white. But whether Nevada\u2019s diverse Democratic base will rescue his claim to viability is as uncertain as splitting aces on a cold blackjack table. Lucy, a retired letter carrier said she likes Biden\u2019s \u201coverall good view of the American people\u201d. \u201cHis empathy is something we need to bring back to our communities,\u201d she said. A woman named Maria defended Biden\u2019s controversial touchy-feeliness as proof of his compassion, while adding: \u201cHe knows what to do when he gets to the White House. He has dignity, and he is a family man.\u201d Allan, wearing a military veteran\u2019s hat, said he liked Biden \u201cbecause I think he can beat Trump\u201d. Those sentiments were repeated. But some supporters admitted to having wavered to and from other candidates. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who\u2019s indecisive, but not really indecisive because nobody jumps out as the most whatever,\u201d said DeeAnn Bear, a retired teacher. \u201cLike this gentleman, I want someone who\u2019s able to beat Trump. Someone who has knowledge, and is honest, and doesn\u2019t just act like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that no matter how good your ideas are, you\u2019re never going to convince everybody,\u201d said Linda Ogleby, an activist since the 1960s. \u201cEven if Medicare for All is the ultimate great idea, it\u2019s going to take, like water, slowly to get there.\u201d Law school student Justin Williamson saw Elizabeth Warren as a kindred spirit. Williamson has worked with vulnerable populations throughout his career. He was a licensed foster parent, and served as a court-appointed special advocate to look out for the best interests of children in abuse and neglect cases. Before that, he cared for people in residential and inpatient psychiatric treatment. \u201cOne of the appeals of Warren is that that\u2019s the focus of her work: let\u2019s do the most we can for people who have the least advantage. We have a lot of systemic things that need to be fixed.\u201d He likes that Warren approaches policy in an \u201covertly nerdy but evidence-based way\u201d. Alluding to the Massachusetts senator\u2019s career as a law professor, Williamson noted: \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018I have done this research and looked at this problem and originally I started from this position, and was like, what is wrong with these people? Then I studied it and realized the system is set up to screw the people with the least ability to deal with it.\u2019\u201d Reflecting on what makes the state unique, Williamson said, \u201cNevada represents a lot of what is going on in the country that often gets missed.

      "body": "<p>When sex enters America\u2019s national politics, it\u2019s almost always the result of assault or scandal. The current president is a self-avowed perpetrator who defended the alleged pedophile Roy Moore and was buddies with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton faced a scandal over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and was accused of sexual assault by several women. The former New York congressman Anthony Weiner was convicted of sending dick pics to a minor.</p> <p>More often, though, sex isn\u2019t allowed to enter our politics at all. In a small but revealing moment last month, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign canceled a fundraiser at a gay bar because the owner refused to remove a dance pole from the premises. The campaign\u2019s demurral captured a criticism that many people in the queer community have made of the first viable out-of-the-closet candidate for the US presidency: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/11/pete-buttigieg-gay-democrats-poll-reaction\">he\u2019s just not queer enough</a>. But the reality is it would be hard to imagine <em>any</em> candidate holding a fundraiser at a strip club. No matter what their positions were on living wage laws, parental leave, abortion access or any other policies that could improve women\u2019s lives, they would be pundited right out of the polls.</p> <p>That\u2019s because there\u2019s a bigger issue at play here and in American politics writ large: our corrosive sexual shame. So many of us believe that the work of our genitals is far less noble than the work of our minds; that our desires make us bad, or lesser, or unclean. This shame not only diminishes us as individuals, it also works to undermine the collective political power of those who want a freer and more equal America \u2013 one that\u2019s not dominated by those (primarily men) who use sex as a weapon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/girls-sex-rapper-ti-hymen-tests-misguided\">We need to teach girls that sex is something to be enjoyed \u2013 not feared | Flo Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You might be wondering why sex even matters in a campaign season loaded with such urgent issues as income inequality, universal healthcare and the climate emergency. Everyone understands that we are a deeply divided nation, yet no one understands what we can do about it. But this is precisely where sexual desire can be one of our most revolutionary political tools. Acknowledging each other\u2019s desires is more radical and more democratizing than almost anything else candidates are doing on the campaign trail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed7d5121f8ae6bd23ca8749ed022e194b2f2056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed7d5121f8ae6bd23ca8749ed022e194b2f2056/0_447_3472_2083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One way to fight this trickle-down sexual shame is by insisting our politicians talk frankly and positively about sex.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One way to fight this trickle-down sexual shame is by insisting our politicians talk frankly and positively about sex.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Broker/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The revolutionary power of sex is something the queer community has tried to teach America. Sex brought us queers together in alleyways and underground toilets, where we found we weren\u2019t alone. Then it brought us together in bars and bathhouses, where our numbers grew. Then it took us \u201cout of the closet and into the streets\u201d, where we won elected positions. The battles we fought for the right to love and have sex with whoever we want however we want gave this country one of its most significant civil rights victories.</p> <p>Desire\u2019s apolitical nature is oddly its political asset. Sex brings people together regardless of race, class and even politics. Love can do this too, but sex \u2013 and especially queer sex \u2013 accomplishes it in a way that is more transformative because queers recognize that no one\u2019s desire is more or less shameful than another\u2019s. As Michael Warner writes in The Trouble with Normal:</p> <blockquote> <p>In those circles where queerness has been most cultivated, the ground rule is that one doesn\u2019t pretend to be above the indignity of sex \u2026 Sex is understood to be as various as the people who have it. It is not required to be tidy, normal, uniform, or authorized by the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>In contrast, sexual shame attempts to police that variety and assign value to some forms over others. In the political realm, it inevitably favors the cis-gendered, heterosexual patriarchy under which we all live, with the accompanying cruelties of capitalism under which most of us labor. In addition to homophobia, think of the ways slut-shaming has been used as an effective <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/27/someone-posted-photos-young-councilwoman-her-underwear-she-called-it-slut-shaming/\">weapon in excluding women</a> from political and economic power.</p> <p>Business and politics as usual promote networking, which is exclusionary and consolidates power within groups, whereas sex and the places we have it \u2013 not just bedrooms and sofas, but porn theaters, public toilets, cruising areas \u2013 promote contact, which fosters encounters across classes and groups, the writer Samuel R Delany points out. \u201cGiven the mode of capitalism under which we live,\u201d Delaney writes, \u201clife is at its most rewarding, productive, and pleasant when large numbers of people understand, appreciate, and seek out interclass contact and communication conducted in a mode of goodwill.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Desire\u2019s apolitical nature is oddly its political asset. Sex brings people together regardless of race, class, and even politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, the act of sex isn\u2019t always about contact, and shaming isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Donald Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape didn\u2019t show us his sexuality, it showed his belief in men\u2019s domination over women. Sexual assault, in all its forms, is one way men have asserted this dominance, and this is what the #MeToo movement has insisted we talk about. We will no longer excuse or ignore these abuses. Anyone whose sexuality disregards consent <em>should</em> be shamed and punished, because shame corrects behavior that violates our values.</p> <p>\u201cA democratic morality should judge sexual acts by the way partners treat one another,\u201d the anthropologist Gayle Rubin wrote in her pathbreaking essay, Thinking Sex:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2026 the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide. Whether sex acts are gay or straight, coupled or in groups, naked or in underwear, commercial or free, with or without video should not be the ethical concerns.</p> </blockquote> <p>If the people united will not be divided, then shaming our consensual forms of sex and sexuality is the best way to prevent this most poignant form of union. We don\u2019t have to buy into it, however, and one way to fight this trickle-down sexual shame is by insisting our politicians talk frankly and positively about sex. A tall order, I know \u2013 some of us may recall how long it took Ronald Reagan to even say the word \u201cAids\u201d in public \u2013 so in the meantime, we need to lead the conversations ourselves. Call out your politicians when they reproduce attitudes of sexual shame. Ask them potentially uncomfortable questions about birth control, comprehensive sex education and decriminalizing sex work.</p> <p>The point isn\u2019t to invade anybody\u2019s privacy. I don\u2019t need to know which sexual positions the presidential candidates prefer. The sex that politicians have is their business. But that politicians have sex, and that they overcome their shame or neuroses about it, is all of our business, because it can do so much to move our unhealthy culture toward the future we want for it.</p> <p><em>Dave Madden is the author of If You Need Me I\u2019ll Be Over There and The Authentic Animal: Inside the Odd and Obsessive World of Taxidermy; he\u2019s currently writing a book on sex and shame</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When sex enters America\u2019s national politics, it\u2019s almost always the result of assault or scandal. The current president is a self-avowed perpetrator who defended the alleged pedophile Roy Moore and was buddies with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton faced a scandal over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and was accused of sexual assault by several women. The former New York congressman Anthony Weiner was convicted of sending dick pics to a minor. More often, though, sex isn\u2019t allowed to enter our politics at all. In a small but revealing moment last month, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign canceled a fundraiser at a gay bar because the owner refused to remove a dance pole from the premises. The campaign\u2019s demurral captured a criticism that many people in the queer community have made of the first viable out-of-the-closet candidate for the US presidency: he\u2019s just not queer enough. But the reality is it would be hard to imagine any candidate holding a fundraiser at a strip club. No matter what their positions were on living wage laws, parental leave, abortion access or any other policies that could improve women\u2019s lives, they would be pundited right out of the polls. That\u2019s because there\u2019s a bigger issue at play here and in American politics writ large: our corrosive sexual shame. So many of us believe that the work of our genitals is far less noble than the work of our minds; that our desires make us bad, or lesser, or unclean. This shame not only diminishes us as individuals, it also works to undermine the collective political power of those who want a freer and more equal America \u2013 one that\u2019s not dominated by those (primarily men) who use sex as a weapon. You might be wondering why sex even matters in a campaign season loaded with such urgent issues as income inequality, universal healthcare and the climate emergency. Everyone understands that we are a deeply divided nation, yet no one understands what we can do about it. But this is precisely where sexual desire can be one of our most revolutionary political tools. Acknowledging each other\u2019s desires is more radical and more democratizing than almost anything else candidates are doing on the campaign trail. The revolutionary power of sex is something the queer community has tried to teach America. Sex brought us queers together in alleyways and underground toilets, where we found we weren\u2019t alone. Then it brought us together in bars and bathhouses, where our numbers grew. Then it took us \u201cout of the closet and into the streets\u201d, where we won elected positions. The battles we fought for the right to love and have sex with whoever we want however we want gave this country one of its most significant civil rights victories. Desire\u2019s apolitical nature is oddly its political asset. Sex brings people together regardless of race, class and even politics. Love can do this too, but sex \u2013 and especially queer sex \u2013 accomplishes it in a way that is more transformative because queers recognize that no one\u2019s desire is more or less shameful than another\u2019s. As Michael Warner writes in The Trouble with Normal: In those circles where queerness has been most cultivated, the ground rule is that one doesn\u2019t pretend to be above the indignity of sex \u2026 Sex is understood to be as various as the people who have it. It is not required to be tidy, normal, uniform, or authorized by the government. In contrast, sexual shame attempts to police that variety and assign value to some forms over others. In the political realm, it inevitably favors the cis-gendered, heterosexual patriarchy under which we all live, with the accompanying cruelties of capitalism under which most of us labor. In addition to homophobia, think of the ways slut-shaming has been used as an effective weapon in excluding women from political and economic power. Business and politics as usual promote networking, which is exclusionary and consolidates power within groups, whereas sex and the places we have it \u2013 not just bedrooms and sofas, but porn theaters, public toilets, cruising areas \u2013 promote contact, which fosters encounters across classes and groups, the writer Samuel R Delany points out. \u201cGiven the mode of capitalism under which we live,\u201d Delaney writes, \u201clife is at its most rewarding, productive, and pleasant when large numbers of people understand, appreciate, and seek out interclass contact and communication conducted in a mode of goodwill.\u201d Of course, the act of sex isn\u2019t always about contact, and shaming isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Donald Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape didn\u2019t show us his sexuality, it showed his belief in men\u2019s domination over women. Sexual assault, in all its forms, is one way men have asserted this dominance, and this is what the #MeToo movement has insisted we talk about. We will no longer excuse or ignore these abuses. Anyone whose sexuality disregards consent should be shamed and punished, because shame corrects behavior that violates our values. \u201cA democratic morality should judge sexual acts by the way partners treat one another,\u201d the anthropologist Gayle Rubin wrote in her pathbreaking essay, Thinking Sex: \u2026 the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide. Whether sex acts are gay or straight, coupled or in groups, naked or in underwear, commercial or free, with or without video should not be the ethical concerns. If the people united will not be divided, then shaming our consensual forms of sex and sexuality is the best way to prevent this most poignant form of union. We don\u2019t have to buy into it, however, and one way to fight this trickle-down sexual shame is by insisting our politicians talk frankly and positively about sex. A tall order, I know \u2013 some of us may recall how long it took Ronald Reagan to even say the word \u201cAids\u201d in public \u2013 so in the meantime, we need to lead the conversations ourselves. Call out your politicians when they reproduce attitudes of sexual shame. Ask them potentially uncomfortable questions about birth control, comprehensive sex education and decriminalizing sex work. The point isn\u2019t to invade anybody\u2019s privacy. I don\u2019t need to know which sexual positions the presidential candidates prefer. The sex that politicians have is their business. But that politicians have sex, and that they overcome their shame or neuroses about it, is all of our business, because it can do so much to move our unhealthy culture toward the future we want for it.

What can we learn from it? | David Renton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In this leadership election, the three remaining candidates understand that this is a self-defeating strategy. They recognise that Labour\u2019s membership has two priorities: to preserve the core policies of the Jeremy Corbyn era, and to defeat the Tories to secure power. Members see no contradiction between these two aims, and indeed <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corybn-labour-policies-toxic-general-election-2019-leadership-latest-a9279946.html\" title=\"\">polls support that view</a>.</p> \n<p>The question haunting the race is: are the candidates genuinely committed to those policies, or are they saying what members wish to hear, only to pivot rightwards when the crown is secured? Those close to Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaigns speak with frustration at Keir Starmer\u2019s adoption of a \u201cclassic frontrunner strategy\u201d: of playing it safe, saying little and avoiding any excessive scrutiny. But last week Starmer\u2019s team released \u201c<a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\" title=\"\">10 pledges</a>\u201d which commit him to maintaining core policies such as hiking tax on the top 5% and big business, public ownership, tuition fees, reversing anti-union laws and opposing illegal wars.</p> \n<p>After Starmer was interviewed in a room that boasted a set of drapes familiar to the shadow chancellor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/status/1228988763264684032\" title=\"\">John McDonnell quipped</a> it was \u201cContinuity McDonnell. I am pleased that the leadership candidates are largely following my policies but replicating my curtains as well demonstrates total hegemony.\u201d The commitments provoked pushback, both publicly from centrist commentators and privately from some of Starmer\u2019s backers. The attitude towards Starmer from the right of the parliamentary Labour party ranges from goodwill \u2013 partly relief at the Corbyn project facing internal defeat \u2013 to deep cynicism, which has only been heightened by the pledges.</p> \n<p>Starmer\u2019s team are emphatic that the pledges are both an attempt to reassure members and an authentic expression of his politics. But while they emphasise a breadth of support \u2013 ranging from the Old Labour right to two-time Corbyn voters \u2013 that could forge some desperately needed unity, it does raise questions about whether this is an unwieldy coalition. Someone will surely have to be disappointed: the question is, who, and how quickly? Starmer\u2019s opponents argue that while his support is broad, it is also soft and lacking enthusiasm. There is also exasperation from the rival camps that while the two women in the race are being criticised for their unabashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/15/trans-rights-labour-leadership-candidates\" title=\"\">support for trans rights</a>, the sole man isn\u2019t facing detailed scrutiny on the issue.</p> \n<p>While Starmer\u2019s team believe there is a general consensus on policy within the party, the Labour right may not be so easily disregarded. Much depends on who Starmer appoints to his shadow cabinet, which remains entirely unclear. While his campaign emphasises that he would appoint a shadow chancellor in accordance with his own views \u2013 pointing to the departure of Sajid Javid as evidence of what happens when the top two posts are not working as one \u2013 the left fear the appointment of someone like Yvette Cooper.

      "bodyText": "Chuka Umunna\u2019s description of the Labour party \u201cbehaving like a petulant child who has been told you can\u2019t have the sweeties in the sweet shop\u201d in the summer of 2015 was a somewhat crude summation of what became the prevailing attitude of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s internal opponents. While they would happily accept that thumbing their noses at the public for rejecting Labour was counterproductive, they never applied the same logic to their own party\u2019s membership, too often regarding them as a delusional, ideologically crazed cult. In this leadership election, the three remaining candidates understand that this is a self-defeating strategy. They recognise that Labour\u2019s membership has two priorities: to preserve the core policies of the Jeremy Corbyn era, and to defeat the Tories to secure power. Members see no contradiction between these two aims, and indeed polls support that view. The question haunting the race is: are the candidates genuinely committed to those policies, or are they saying what members wish to hear, only to pivot rightwards when the crown is secured? Those close to Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaigns speak with frustration at Keir Starmer\u2019s adoption of a \u201cclassic frontrunner strategy\u201d: of playing it safe, saying little and avoiding any excessive scrutiny. But last week Starmer\u2019s team released \u201c10 pledges\u201d which commit him to maintaining core policies such as hiking tax on the top 5% and big business, public ownership, tuition fees, reversing anti-union laws and opposing illegal wars. After Starmer was interviewed in a room that boasted a set of drapes familiar to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell quipped it was \u201cContinuity McDonnell. I am pleased that the leadership candidates are largely following my policies but replicating my curtains as well demonstrates total hegemony.\u201d The commitments provoked pushback, both publicly from centrist commentators and privately from some of Starmer\u2019s backers. The attitude towards Starmer from the right of the parliamentary Labour party ranges from goodwill \u2013 partly relief at the Corbyn project facing internal defeat \u2013 to deep cynicism, which has only been heightened by the pledges. Starmer\u2019s team are emphatic that the pledges are both an attempt to reassure members and an authentic expression of his politics. But while they emphasise a breadth of support \u2013 ranging from the Old Labour right to two-time Corbyn voters \u2013 that could forge some desperately needed unity, it does raise questions about whether this is an unwieldy coalition. Someone will surely have to be disappointed: the question is, who, and how quickly? Starmer\u2019s opponents argue that while his support is broad, it is also soft and lacking enthusiasm. There is also exasperation from the rival camps that while the two women in the race are being criticised for their unabashed support for trans rights, the sole man isn\u2019t facing detailed scrutiny on the issue. While Starmer\u2019s team believe there is a general consensus on policy within the party, the Labour right may not be so easily disregarded. Much depends on who Starmer appoints to his shadow cabinet, which remains entirely unclear. While his campaign emphasises that he would appoint a shadow chancellor in accordance with his own views \u2013 pointing to the departure of Sajid Javid as evidence of what happens when the top two posts are not working as one \u2013 the left fear the appointment of someone like Yvette Cooper. That would instantly signal a return to technocratic Brownism and a strong departure from existing policies. If Starmer triumphs, as is likely, the left will undoubtedly treat the 10 pledges as sacred red lines the leadership cannot cross. If a rightward shift takes place, it would be self-defeating, leaving the new leader looking weak, unprincipled and cynical. Nandy started her campaign with a strong set of media performances and is the only candidate who held out against a second referendum. The message her campaign has been keen to promote is of not tacking left or right, of avoiding a tokenistic shopping lists of policies, and of encouraging a sort of grassroots participation that her campaign believes Corbyn did not pull off effectively.

Her rival teams viewed this as an attempt to fill the space vacated by Jess Phillips and to peel off Starmer supporters disillusioned by his commitment to core Corbyn policies. Nandy\u2019s allies rebut this \u2013 protesting that she is firmly of the left, just wishing to make radical policies workable. None of that makes it clear what her manifesto would look like. Long-Bailey\u2019s team are acutely aware that it\u2019s the middle third of the Labour membership they need to persuade: those who backed Corbyn, who are traumatised by defeat and have been persuaded by Starmer\u2019s camp that he is more electable. Their task is threefold: to present Long-Bailey as the most trustworthy custodian of Labour\u2019s policies, pointing to her work on the green new deal; to rebut claims she lacks charisma, sharing clips of her being relatable and jokey in interview clips and rallies; and to present her as well placed to win back Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d seats because she was someone who wasn\u2019t an architect of the party\u2019s second referendum policy. The latter is a particular challenge: most Labour members remain convinced the party was correct to shift on Brexit.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "A British couple who published video diaries from a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan say they have questioned a positive test for the coronavirus, as the UK government announced plans to evacuate citizens from the ship. David Abel wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cThere is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all xxx.\u201d In a later post, however, Abel, from Oxfordshire, said he doubted his diagnosis. \u201cFrankly I think this is a setup! We are NOT being taken to a hospital but a hostel. That\u2019s where partners are sent waiting out their quarantine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo phone, no wifi and no medical facilities. I really am smelling a very big rat here! Waiting for the transfer now.\u201d The Abels \u2013 David and his wife, Sally \u2013 have given regular updates to the media about conditions onboard the Diamond Princess, which has been quarantined off Japan since 3 February after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. Asked in the comments below one of his posts whether he was sure the test was positive, he replied: \u201cI doubt it was positive. If it was, we would be in hospital.\u201d The Abels\u2019 reported positive diagnosis came as Japanese health authorities confirmed an additional 88 coronavirus infections on the Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 542. The ship accounts for the biggest cluster of cases outside mainland China, where there are 72,436 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. China has recorded 1,868 deaths. Two Irish passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, the foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has confirmed, and are being treated in hospital in Japan. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, on Tuesday said that the Diamond Princess had been the one example of sustained human-to-human spread of the coronavirus outside of China. Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said \u201cclearly there has been more transmission than expected\u201d on the cruise ship. The Abel\u2019s son, Steve Abel, said his parents were \u201cnot getting any communication\u201d from the UK. \u201cThey are very high-spirited people,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast, but added: \u201cThere are cracks in the armour and they are getting down. My mum breaks down in tears frequently, my dad is short-tempered. They are not getting any communication from our country, so they are in the dark and feeling very unloved.\u201d Steve Abel told BBC Radio 5 live he was concerned that his father, who is diabetic, was not eating the right food, and called for his parents to be allowed to return home. \u201cWhatever they have to go through next I would rather it be on UK soil,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could be flown back asap and do whatever\u2019s necessary here in a controlled environment. That\u2019s what our family want.\u201d The virus causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, according to the World Health Organization, which said on Monday that analysis of data from Chinese authorities relating to 44,000 cases of Covid-19 \u2013 the name the disease has been given \u2013 in Hubei province suggested that 2% of cases were fatal. The British government, which has come under mounting pressure to fly citizens home, said on Tuesday morning it was \u201cworking to organise a flight\u201d to evacuate citizens stranded on the Diamond Princess. David Abel is among those who have criticised the UK government\u2019s response, and had appealed to Richard Branson to help evacuate British citizens. The US flew more than 300 US citizens out on Sunday, while Canada, Australia, Italy, South Korea and Israel have all made plans to evacuate their citizens. For the past two weeks, passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins, where meals are brought to them by staff in masks and protective clothing. Experts are still racing to understand the ease with which the virus has spread, but some have raised concerns that quarantine conditions imposed on the ship appeared to be backfiring. The British Foreign Office said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cGiven the conditions onboard, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. \u201cOur staff are contacting British nationals onboard to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately.\u201d On Monday, a Downing Street spokesman said those onboard the ship, which is docked near Yokohama, were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. It is not clear if those evacuated will be required to self-isolate once they return home, though on Monday a Holiday Inn at Heathrow airport was block-booked to be used as a quarantine facility in anticipation of more potential coronavirus cases arriving in the UK. In a YouTube video on Monday, David Abel had spoken about the mental strain that the crisis had placed on those affected. \u201cIt\u2019s all getting to us now \u2013 not just me, other passengers as well. It\u2019s the not-knowing factor that is the real challenge,\u201d he said. He said he had packed a bag just in case he was confirmed to have the virus, adding that he had heard that another passenger simply got a knock on her cabin door and was \u201cfrogmarched off\u201d to hospital. A British man who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the ship will be discharged from hospital tomorrow. Alan Steele, who announced the news on Facebook, said he will wait in the country until he can be reunited with his wife, Wendy, and they can travel home together. The couple, who were celebrating their honeymoon on the ship, were separated on 7 February when Alan was diagnosed with the virus and taken to a nearby hospital. At least three other Britons confirmed to have the virus are receiving hospital treatment in Japan.",

I want people now to understand their value.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer, now 40, is no longer playing for her country but, from where she sits, looking after her nine-month-old daughter, Mae, not a great deal has changed.

Rather less of the marketing budget has been spent on promoting the women\u2019s Six Nations fixture between the same countries in Doncaster on the same day.

With the gap widening between the centrally contracted England side and some of their less well-funded Celtic neighbours she also argues the women\u2019s tournament could do with a radical makeover. \u201cAs much as this might not be a popular view I think we need to break away.

Should the women\u2019s game be structured in the same traditional way simply because that is how the men have always preferred it? How much more media attention and extra fans would it win if, for example, it were scheduled on the men\u2019s \u201cfallow\u201d weekends?</p> <p>In Spencer\u2019s experience \u201cdouble headers\u201d are not always the answer. \u201cWhen the women have played after the men at Twickenham, the men are all in their dinner gear getting ready for the post-match function. Sometimes we were not even on the ticket. I remember someone from a women\u2019s magazine coming to watch our game after the men at Twickenham and having real problems getting into the stadium. The stewards didn\u2019t even know the women\u2019s game was happening. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s happening now but I think it is to a certain extent.\u201d</p> <p>At least those in charge of the game\u2019s future direction now have a decent handbook. Having played 63 times for England, captained her country and featured in two World Cup finals, Spencer has written an honest, revealing and trail-blazing book \u2013 Mud, Maul, Mascara \u2013 which should be required reading for anyone whose knowledge of women\u2019s rugby might need expanding.</p> <p>The positive response has encouraged her to believe times may finally be changing. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would have been such a good reaction even five years ago.

      "bodyText": "Even now there are days when Catherine Spencer looks back with a mixture of incredulity and anger. \u201cI felt like a second-class citizen for most of my rugby life,\u201d she says flatly, recalling her time as one of England\u2019s most prominent women\u2019s rugby players. \u201cEven when I did interviews as England captain I felt I was having to say thank you for the smallest things and be overly grateful. I want people now to understand their value.\u201d Spencer, now 40, is no longer playing for her country but, from where she sits, looking after her nine-month-old daughter, Mae, not a great deal has changed. Everyone is aware England\u2019s men are due to be playing Ireland at Twickenham this Sunday. Rather less of the marketing budget has been spent on promoting the women\u2019s Six Nations fixture between the same countries in Doncaster on the same day. The latter fixture is due to kick off at 12.45pm, just when most TV viewers are either en route to the men\u2019s game or thinking about their lunch. It is just another snapshot of the daily battles still faced by rugby\u2019s warrior women. There is no prize money in the women\u2019s Six Nations and Spencer\u2019s sense of inequality \u2013 \u201cI feel we are in the shadows of the men\u201d \u2013 is easy to understand. With the gap widening between the centrally contracted England side and some of their less well-funded Celtic neighbours she also argues the women\u2019s tournament could do with a radical makeover. \u201cAs much as this might not be a popular view I think we need to break away. It\u2019s a tournament that\u2019s steeped in history and always gets the juices flowing. I hope it remains that way but I think it\u2019s thwarting our development a little bit. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do what the men are doing. We need to do what\u2019s right for our game. It either needs to be fully integrated \u2013 we play at the same stadiums at the same times with more resources to market the games and more media attention \u2013 or we go the other way and maybe have two divisions and teams like Spain involved.\u201d With the biggest women\u2019s clash \u2013 France v England \u2013 having already taken place in round one, this delicate debate could yet overshadow the remainder of the competition. Should the women\u2019s game be structured in the same traditional way simply because that is how the men have always preferred it? How much more media attention and extra fans would it win if, for example, it were scheduled on the men\u2019s \u201cfallow\u201d weekends? In Spencer\u2019s experience \u201cdouble headers\u201d are not always the answer. \u201cWhen the women have played after the men at Twickenham, the men are all in their dinner gear getting ready for the post-match function. Sometimes we were not even on the ticket. I remember someone from a women\u2019s magazine coming to watch our game after the men at Twickenham and having real problems getting into the stadium. The stewards didn\u2019t even know the women\u2019s game was happening. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s happening now but I think it is to a certain extent.\u201d At least those in charge of the game\u2019s future direction now have a decent handbook. Having played 63 times for England, captained her country and featured in two World Cup finals, Spencer has written an honest, revealing and trail-blazing book \u2013 Mud, Maul, Mascara \u2013 which should be required reading for anyone whose knowledge of women\u2019s rugby might need expanding. The positive response has encouraged her to believe times may finally be changing. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would have been such a good reaction even five years ago. I think that demonstrates where the sport is going but it still needs to go further.\u201d When it comes to promoting the women\u2019s game she believes the volume needs turning up: \u201cWe should be shouting from the rooftops about it. We should be saying to everyone: \u2018It\u2019s OK to be a woman and play sport. It\u2019s OK to be female and strong. It\u2019s OK to be a woman and play rugby.\u2019\u201d Increasing crowds is the next step but Spencer, whose company Inspiring Women also seeks to promote female leadership, is not among those who believe playing with a slightly smaller ball would help. \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of keeping it the same size. The amount of times people say to women\u2019s players: \u2018Do you tackle? Is it the same size pitch?\u2019 To be able to say \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s exactly the same sport\u2019 is really important.

Top of the list is \u201cmore meaningful matches for emerging nations with a view to removing the current tier system and allowing the game to grow\u201d.

However powerless we feel under an executive that is unfettered by oversight, that\u2019s nothing compared to how powerless we will be once any deal is signed. Sovereignty, huh? Who knew it would be such hard work? \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

He said last month: \u201cNothing is official [with Madrid]. There is no contract. That is the situation. That has not changed throughout the season. I don\u2019t want to choose.

Manchester United have a contract with the defender until June 2022, with the option to extend for a further year, and so could still command a hefty fee for the 30-year-old.</p>",

Naturally, they have turned to former Middlesbrough flop Martin Braithwaite, who managed nine goals in two years for the Championship club but is playing at relegation-threatened Legan\u00e9s. The Danish forward would cost \u20ac20m, and could well be the difference between them going up and down. Legan\u00e9s, by the way, will not be permitted to sign a replacement of their own, another bitter blow for a club in a league that is already massively financially skewed in favour of the bigger clubs. Braithwaite will likely play a handful of minutes and not make any meaningful contribution. His Mr 15%, Ali Dursun (who also looks after Frenkie de Jong) will get another payday. Legan\u00e9s, second from bottom and two points from safety, could well go down. That\u2019s football, folks! The Paul Pogba machine has just clicked into gear, again. You can read about that here, if you have the stomach. Donny van de Beek heads a list of names that are being invited on to Ajax\u2019s gilded merchant ship, Do Een, as the Dutch club look to cash in on the stars that guided them to the Champions League semi-final last season. Goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana, left-back Nicolas Tagliafico and winger David Neres are the others being touted for big-money moves, with Real Madrid linked with Van de Beek. He said last month: \u201cNothing is official [with Madrid]. There is no contract. That is the situation. That has not changed throughout the season. I don\u2019t want to choose. Both are great clubs, but as I said before, Ajax is also a great club.\u201d Yaya Tour\u00e9 is back, baby! The big Ivorian could well pop up at Brazilian club Botafogo, who also signed Keisuke Honda in January, if personal terms can be agreed. Tour\u00e9 has most recently been playing in China with Qingdao Huanghai. Finally, Tottenham and Everton are reportedly keen on Chris Smalling, who has recently earned the nickname \u201cSmalldini\u201d for his form at Roma. Manchester United have a contract with the defender until June 2022, with the option to extend for a further year, and so could still command a hefty fee for the 30-year-old.",

Freeman has compiled figures showing there was an explosion in California hive thefts in 2016, with 1,695 being taken, compared with 101 in 2015. In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives.</p> <p>\u201cThe number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.\u201d</p> <p>The center of beehive thefts is California\u2019s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output \u2013 of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more \u2013 requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area.</p> <p>The main driver of the demand for honeybees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/honeybees-deaths-almonds-hives-aoe\">is the almond industry</a>, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom.</p> <p>Beekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation\u2019s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers.</p> <p>But the almond industry\u2019s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates.</p> <p>This dynamic \u2013 growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure \u2013 has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime.</p> <p>\u201cNormal people can\u2019t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,\u201d said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. \u201cSo it\u2019s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"461345ec38d112d3c17359a5e713cae2749a483c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461345ec38d112d3c17359a5e713cae2749a483c/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charley Nye: \u2018Normal people can\u2019t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charley Nye: \u2018Normal people can\u2019t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction.</p> <p>But Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder \u2013 a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse \u2013 and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west.</p> <p>Through a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: \u2018There\u2019s your turn.\u2019 And I turned in there and I said: \u2018This can\u2019t be the right turn.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Why?\u2019 I said: \u2018Because there\u2019s no bees sitting,\u2019\u201d Cunniff recalled. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Uh-oh.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>All 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn\u2019t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation.</p> <p>Not long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was like a chop shop for bees ... And there were a lot of aggressive bees</p> <footer> <cite>Det Andres Solis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was like a chop shop for bees,\u201d said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. \u201cNone of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.\u201d</p> <p>Police called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers.</p> <p>An alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. \u201cVictims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,\u201d Solis said. \u201cWe looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.\u201d</p> <p>The overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">and wider insect</a>, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of bees this year, again,\u201d Cunniff said. \u201cYou watch in this next week or two, there\u2019s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just my turn. That\u2019s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They\u2019re stealing them all the time. It\u2019s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.\u201d</p>",

In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives. \u201cThe number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.\u201d The center of beehive thefts is California\u2019s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output \u2013 of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more \u2013 requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area. The main driver of the demand for honeybees is the almond industry, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom. Beekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation\u2019s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers. But the almond industry\u2019s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates. This dynamic \u2013 growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure \u2013 has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime. \u201cNormal people can\u2019t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,\u201d said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. \u201cSo it\u2019s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.\u201d Lloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction. But Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder \u2013 a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse \u2013 and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west. Through a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them. \u201cWe had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: \u2018There\u2019s your turn.\u2019 And I turned in there and I said: \u2018This can\u2019t be the right turn.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Why?\u2019 I said: \u2018Because there\u2019s no bees sitting,\u2019\u201d Cunniff recalled. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Uh-oh.\u2019\u201d All 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn\u2019t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation. Not long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars. \u201cIt was like a chop shop for bees,\u201d said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. \u201cNone of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.\u201d Police called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers. An alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. \u201cVictims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,\u201d Solis said. \u201cWe looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.\u201d The overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, and wider insect, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of bees this year, again,\u201d Cunniff said. \u201cYou watch in this next week or two, there\u2019s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here. \u201cIt was just my turn. That\u2019s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They\u2019re stealing them all the time. It\u2019s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.\u201d",

Of those 4,300 chemicals, 60% did not have any available hazard data, researchers found.</p> <p>\u201c[The] \u2018known knowns\u2019 are the ones I\u2019m going to gravitate to in terms of concern,\u201d said Dr Leo Trasande, director of the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine, referring to well-known plastic additives such as BPA and phthalates. \u201cThe reality is there are many \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 \u2026 that may be as problematic.\u201d</p> <p>In 1988 the plastics industry came up with standardized identification codes for the seven most common types of plastic resin in circulation. Those <a href=\"https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/Plastic-Resin-Codes-PDF/\">little numbers</a> found on the bottom of soda bottles and yogurt tubs clue you in to what type of plastic you\u2019re eating or drinking out of. Most food containers \u2013 both takeout containers and kinds meant for reuse \u2013 are made of low-density polyethylene (4) or polypropylene (5).</p> <p>Researchers aren\u2019t exactly sure how much chemical exposure occurs from food packaging and storage containers, but they know plastic isn\u2019t a completely stable material. Trasande said that when exposed to heat \u2013 for example, in the microwave and dishwasher \u2013 polyethylene and polypropylene can break down, leaching unknown chemicals into food and drink.

      "bodyText": "Many of us have an overflowing kitchen cupboard of plastic containers to store our leftovers. But as awareness grows over the health and environmental pitfalls of plastic, some consumers may be wondering: is it time to ditch that stash of old deli containers? Only 9% of all the plastic waste ever created has been recycled. From its contributions to global heating and pollution, to the chemicals and microplastics that migrate into our bodies, the food chain and the environment, the true cost of this cheap material is becoming more apparent. There are thousands of compounds found in plastic products across the food chain, and relatively little is known about most of them. But what we do know of some chemicals contained in plastic is concerning. Phthalates, for example, which are used to make plastic more flexible and are found in food packaging and plastic wrap, have been found by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in measurable levels across the US population (including in the body of Guardian journalist Emily Holden). They have been linked to reproductive dysfunction in animal studies and some researchers have suggested links to decreased fertility, neurodevelopmental issues and asthma in humans. BPA, another chemical widely added to food plastics, has been subject to increasing regulations after studies linked the chemical to neonatal and infant brain and reproductive harm. But BPS and BPF, two common replacements used in products marketed as \u201cBPA-free\u201d, may have similar effects to their predecessor: studies out of both the University of Texas and Washington State University found that even at a dose of one part per trillion, BPS could disrupt cell functioning. A 2019 study from New York University linked childhood obesity with BPS and BPF. There are many other chemicals added to plastic during production, and researchers concede that many gaps remain in our understanding of how they affect health and development. But research that is adding to concerns about the \u201cmiracle material\u201d is growing. What\u2019s in those takeout containers? Food containers are just one link in a massive chain of plastic products that touch things we eat, from coated conveyer belts in food production lines to disposable clamshells for delicate berries, clear carrot bags and milk jugs. Researchers say it is difficult to answer which plastic containers are safe without greater transparency about what chemicals make up everyday plastic materials. In 2019, the Food Packaging Forum (FPF), a Switzerland-based not-for-profit focused on the science behind food packaging, compiled a database of more than 900 chemicals \u201clikely\u201d associated with plastic food packaging production worldwide and another 3,400 \u201cpossibly\u201d used. Of those 4,300 chemicals, 60% did not have any available hazard data, researchers found. \u201c[The] \u2018known knowns\u2019 are the ones I\u2019m going to gravitate to in terms of concern,\u201d said Dr Leo Trasande, director of the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine, referring to well-known plastic additives such as BPA and phthalates. \u201cThe reality is there are many \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 \u2026 that may be as problematic.\u201d In 1988 the plastics industry came up with standardized identification codes for the seven most common types of plastic resin in circulation. Those little numbers found on the bottom of soda bottles and yogurt tubs clue you in to what type of plastic you\u2019re eating or drinking out of. Most food containers \u2013 both takeout containers and kinds meant for reuse \u2013 are made of low-density polyethylene (4) or polypropylene (5). Researchers aren\u2019t exactly sure how much chemical exposure occurs from food packaging and storage containers, but they know plastic isn\u2019t a completely stable material. Trasande said that when exposed to heat \u2013 for example, in the microwave and dishwasher \u2013 polyethylene and polypropylene can break down, leaching unknown chemicals into food and drink. Oily foods are also thought to attract some plastic chemicals. The complex chemistry needed to make plastics makes it hard to know exactly what other chemicals are found in plastic food containers, said Jane Muncke, managing director and chief scientific officer at the FPF. (The FPF, one of the few to study food packing exclusively, receives much of its funding from the glass packaging industry, though Muncke said its research priorities are set independently of funders.) Free radicals and reaction by-products are formed during plastic production so that the chemical ingredients you started with might not be the actual composition of the final product. There are also impurities and so-called non-intentionally added substances (Nias) in the original source materials that accumulate alongside known chemical ingredients. Not even manufacturers, Muncke said, \u201cknow exactly what the chemical composition is of the materials of their product down to the last little molecule\u201d. Additionally, few studies exist on end-product plastic chemicals, rather than individual source chemicals. In a paper published last year in the Environmental Science &amp; Technology journal, German and Norwegian researchers used samples of real-world plastic items such as shampoo bottles, yogurt cups and refillable water bottles to test their effect on cells in a laboratory. They found compounds in consumer plastics that are toxic in vitro, but are largely unidentified. The Plastics Industry Association (Plastics), a trade group, disputed researchers\u2019 claims of questionable safety. \u201cAll plastics used in food packaging go through rigorous testing. By the time any type of plastic food packaging even makes it to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it\u2019s already been tested several times by chemists and toxicologists. Plastic food and beverage containers may be used safely in the freezer, microwave, dishwasher or a combination of all three when these uses are labeled on the package,\u201d a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Who is testing those food containers? The FDA has oversight of any \u201cfood contact substance\u201d (FCS), a category that includes reusable food storage and takeaway containers, as well as food manufacturing surfaces and original packaging. But some experts question the rigor behind the FDA\u2019s standards, in part because the agency relies on manufacturers to determine the safety of any chemicals used across the food system. The FDA reviews toxicological data from manufacturers on any new FCS. But the agency doesn\u2019t regulate how manufacturers perform their testing; instead the agency provides \u201crecommendations\u201d. And even those recommendations don\u2019t align with the latest science on chemical toxicology testing, said Maricel Maffini, an independent consultant and expert on food additives. For example, manufacturers don\u2019t actually have to provide toxicology data for substances they use if they estimate human exposure falls below 0.5 parts per billion (ppb). Yet scientists believe some endocrine disrupting chemicals can have effects at even lower amounts, particularly in vulnerable populations like infants and pregnant women. The approach also doesn\u2019t account for cumulative exposure. \u201cIf you think about all the chemicals that we already know are endocrine disruptors that are in the diet, I\u2019m sure that we may be exposed to more than \u2013 cumulatively, collectively \u2013 we are exposed to more than 0.5 parts per billion,\u201d Maffini said. What about claims that plastic containers are microwave- and dishwasher-\u201csafe\u201d? Under FDA law, it\u2019s also up to manufacturers to set the \u201cconditions of use\u201d of any product, including whether it is \u201cmicrowave-safe\u201d or \u201cdishwasher-safe\u201d, or even reusable. \u201cIt would be up to the manufacturer to ensure that their product is properly labelled for safety under its intended use,\u201d an FDA spokesperson said via email. Even for containers labeled \u201csafe\u201d for the microwave and dishwasher, experts caution that heat and plastic don\u2019t mix well. Since heat helps to break the chemical bonds in plastic, it\u2019s possible that exposure to high temperatures increases the rate of chemical migration from the container into the food. Scientists have documented higher rates of chemical migration even in water bottles left in the sun. FDA\u2019s deference to manufacturers on \u201cconditions of use\u201d also means that deli and restaurant takeout containers, which many people reuse and wash in the dishwasher, might not be built for that type of wear and tear. Without more testing and transparency from the FDA and manufacturers, experts can\u2019t say whether they\u2019re leaching chemicals at a higher rate than reusable containers. Manufacturers can also rely on ingredients that were approved in some cases decades ago to make their products, even if the science has since evolved to raise new safety questions. \u201cOnce a chemical or mixture or polymer is approved, it is there forever. There is no reassessment or look back to whether what was considered safe in 1962 is still safe now based on advances in scientific knowledge or exposure to that particular compound in the population,\u201d Maffini said. Trasande conceded \u201cthere are clearly still gaps in our knowledge\u201d about large a role food packaging plays in our everyday exposure to thousands of chemicals. Still, \u201cthere is sufficient evidence that exposure to these chemicals is problematic\u201d.

We\u2019re not trying to take ourselves back to the 1700s,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be new science, and there needs to be requirements for disclosing what chemicals are used.\u201d How to keep plastic out your food Given all of these unknowns, along with the catastrophic environmental impact of our addiction to plastic, here are some tips for lowering your plastic dependence and keeping it out of your food: Switch to glass or metal containers when possible. Avoid heat, including the microwave and dishwasher, especially when it comes to takeout containers and other forms of plastic not meant for reuse. Plastic doesn\u2019t last forever (even if some of the chemicals it contains might) \u2013 avoid scratched and discolored plastic and pay attention to \u201cexpiration dates\u201d on products such as SodaStream bottles. Don\u2019t store fatty or oily foods in plastic \u2013 many chemicals used in plastic are fat soluble and are more likely to leach into fatty food. Cut down on plastic water bottles, which contribute to the widespread ingestion of microplastics. Consider replacing your plastic wrap with a reusable option, like beeswax wrap.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s aid funding to health programs across the Pacific region has been slashed in the past five years, even as Pacific nations have battled health crises, including a devastating measles outbreak, polio and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Overall aid spending on the Pacific region has increased, with the region getting an extra $214m in foreign aid in the 2019-20 aid budget compared with 2014-15. But new figures, released in response to Labor questions in Senate estimates, show the Australian government has slashed budgets of some programs, including health, in favour of more spending on infrastructure. Health funding was cut in the Cook Islands by 75%, Fiji by 22%, in the Solomon Islands by 13% and in Samoa, which has been devastated by a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of more than 80 people, by 36%. The government has made much of its redirection of aid spending towards the Pacific region, at the expense of other regions, as part of its \u201cPacific step-up\u201d, which includes $3bn in infrastructure funding. Labor\u2019s spokesman on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said health had been neglected despite that emphasis. \u201cThe cuts to Australian assistance on health have also hit our Pacific neighbours particularly hard, despite the government\u2019s claims of a Pacific step-up. \u201cCutting health assistance to Samoa by 36% in the aftermath of its tragic measles epidemic raises questions about whether the Morrison government is genuinely responding to the needs of Australia\u2019s Pacific friends.\u201d The chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, Marc Purcell, said Australia had traditionally been a leader on preventive health, but \u201cthis leadership has been lost\u201d as Australia has reduced its aid health spending by a third since 2014-15. \u201cGiven the low resilience of the region against infectious diseases, the recent spread of measles in Samoa and the threat of coronavirus, there are widely held concerns across the Pacific.

Just metres away was a herd of eight horses. Before meeting them, advised therapist Lisanne Peters, it was wise to meditate. First, she told me to focus on sensations \u2013 the smell of hay; the birdsong. Then she instructed me to imagine myself, centaur-like, \u201cwith another back and another set of legs behind you. Feel how sturdy, how grounded, you are.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was the beginning of my equine therapy experience. I have never been a horse person but recently surprised myself by wanting to try it. Perhaps it was because I have felt as though lately I see horses everywhere, particularly in fashion. Gucci\u2019s latest ad campaign, for example, imagines horses integrated in urban lives: models feed them in the supermarket and hose their hooves off with water on petrol station forecourts.</p> \n<p>At couture fashion week, in January, during the Franck Sorbier collection, two horses appeared on a catwalk flanked by hay bales. On the high street, Uniqlo promoted its collaboration with In\u00e8s de la Fressange with a picture of the French style arbiter walking a majestic, milk-white horse down a windswept beach. In menswear, the Charles Jeffrey Loverboy show was inspired by the Orkneys\u2019 200-year-old pagan ritual, the Festival of the Horse.

      "bodyText": "One cold, bright morning in January, I stood in a field in Gloucestershire with my eyes closed and imagined I had four legs. Just metres away was a herd of eight horses. Before meeting them, advised therapist Lisanne Peters, it was wise to meditate. First, she told me to focus on sensations \u2013 the smell of hay; the birdsong. Then she instructed me to imagine myself, centaur-like, \u201cwith another back and another set of legs behind you. Feel how sturdy, how grounded, you are.\u201d This was the beginning of my equine therapy experience. I have never been a horse person but recently surprised myself by wanting to try it. Perhaps it was because I have felt as though lately I see horses everywhere, particularly in fashion. Gucci\u2019s latest ad campaign, for example, imagines horses integrated in urban lives: models feed them in the supermarket and hose their hooves off with water on petrol station forecourts. At couture fashion week, in January, during the Franck Sorbier collection, two horses appeared on a catwalk flanked by hay bales. On the high street, Uniqlo promoted its collaboration with In\u00e8s de la Fressange with a picture of the French style arbiter walking a majestic, milk-white horse down a windswept beach. In menswear, the Charles Jeffrey Loverboy show was inspired by the Orkneys\u2019 200-year-old pagan ritual, the Festival of the Horse. Fashion\u2019s most powerful models \u2013 Bella and Gigi Hadid \u2013 are avowed horse girls who post frequent selfies nuzzling long noses.

The IAG families believe they are at the sharp end of the free school policy, which has been the government\u2019s main vehicle for opening new schools in England since 2011.

It was allowed to open in September 2016 in an office building owned by a church while waiting for its new building on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/28/free-schools-purchase-land-education-funding\" title=\"\">playing fields</a> \u2013 a location, on protected metropolitan open land prone to flooding, that was highly controversial.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the DfE ploughed money into the school\u2019s temporary premises, paying the church \u00a3395,000 in rent each year \u2013 \u00a31,500 per pupil. Parents, many of whom were attracted to IAG because it offered the international baccalaureate curriculum, were told not to worry. </p> <p>A year ago the DfE was still saying it was \u201canticipating a positive planning decision\u201d, and the council\u2019s secondary schools admissions <a href=\"http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&amp;edid=c50bfe19-31e6-4f61-8a06-a5a14074f9b3\" title=\"\">booklet</a> [pdf] for 2019-20 was suggesting the school would be in its permanent building in 2021.</p> <p>Yet emails released under freedom of information show that by last April, Greenwich planning officials were telling the DfE that they did not think there was a case to open the school. While in 2018 Greenwich had stated that there was a shortage of school places, now it was now saying there was not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/15/legal-battle-why-free-schools-succeed-and-fail\">How the Tories picked free schools: chaotic, inconsistent and incompetent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another new free school is due to open in the borough in 2021, run by the Harris Federation. Council <a href=\"https://bit.ly/396qtnC\" title=\"\">documents show </a> [pdf] that this affected Greenwich\u2019s assessment of the need for school places. This has meant, the IAG parents say, that the provision of places in a not-yet-open free school contributed to the closure of the existing one. This is not disputed by the council.</p> <p>Sure enough, in July last year council planners refused permission for the playing fields site, provoking uproar among the IAG\u2019s parents and pupils. With ministers saying the school could not continue long term in its temporary premises, its closure was announced.</p> <p>The IAG, which as of last term had 267 year 7-10 pupils, will close for years 7-9 this summer, with year 10 pupils, who have started their GCSEs, finishing them at the school next year. Pupils have been given no guarantees of places elsewhere, and some parents have moved their children into private education. </p> <p>Kate Simpson is emigrating with her family to Toronto, where she grew up, although she had hoped to stay in London until her son, Cameron, 11, had completed high school. \u201cWe are devastated that the school is closing. Our decision to leave it is no reflection on its incredible teachers.

      "bodyText": "Louise Grace\u2019s two children, aged 13 and 11, spent more than a week off school last term suffering from anxiety. Their school, the International Academy of Greenwich (IAG), is earmarked for closure and the worry of watching it happen \u2013 friends taking up places elsewhere, teachers leaving \u2013 is affecting both children badly, their mother says. \u201cMy daughter is so upset by it all: she is losing her friends and she is worried about going to a new school, with her GCSEs about to start. She is despondent about the whole process,\u201d says Grace. \u201cMy son seemed to be holding it in,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut before Christmas, he said: \u2018We were told by the school that it wouldn\u2019t close, and you told me there would be a school for me. You let me down,\u2019 and then he just shut himself in his room.\u201d Now Grace, a single parent, has given up her job, concerned she would otherwise be unable to support her worried children, and fearful about the logistics of trying to find them new school places. Since November, when the IAG became the latest free school to announce its closure, parents of more than 200 pupils have been scrambling for places at other secondaries. One mother says her son sobbed after being told he had to leave, while for another family, the closure has been a key factor in their decision to move from the UK. Many parents now say free schools should never have been allowed to open without planning permission for permanent buildings. The IAG families believe they are at the sharp end of the free school policy, which has been the government\u2019s main vehicle for opening new schools in England since 2011. There have been success stories, such as the Michaela free school in north London, but the failures \u2013 of which there have been plenty \u2013 are traumatic for those affected. Overall, 27 free schools have had to close or change management. Sometimes children have been left with little or no education for weeks following a school closure while their parents search for a place elsewhere. Since 2016, some 92 schools have opened in temporary accommodation and of these, just 27 have moved into a permanent home. Last year alone, 25 schools opened on a temporary site. Some of the locations have been eyebrow-raising. One free school opened next to an airport runway; another in a building about which officials had expressed multiple safety concerns. Abacus Belsize school, in London, has spent six years in temporary premises while a planning dispute rages over its proposed move into a former police station, bought for \u00a314m and approved by Boris Johnson as mayor of London. A primary free school in Croydon was recently graded \u201cinadequate\u201d by Ofsted, with children being taught in portable buildings since 2014. And Southwark free school, again backed by Johnson, closed in 2017 after five years as it, too, had never managed to find a permanent home. The IAG\u2019s story is the latest example of how the free schools policy can be undermined by poor planning. It was allowed to open in September 2016 in an office building owned by a church while waiting for its new building on playing fields \u2013 a location, on protected metropolitan open land prone to flooding, that was highly controversial. Meanwhile, the DfE ploughed money into the school\u2019s temporary premises, paying the church \u00a3395,000 in rent each year \u2013 \u00a31,500 per pupil. Parents, many of whom were attracted to IAG because it offered the international baccalaureate curriculum, were told not to worry. A year ago the DfE was still saying it was \u201canticipating a positive planning decision\u201d, and the council\u2019s secondary schools admissions booklet [pdf] for 2019-20 was suggesting the school would be in its permanent building in 2021. Yet emails released under freedom of information show that by last April, Greenwich planning officials were telling the DfE that they did not think there was a case to open the school. While in 2018 Greenwich had stated that there was a shortage of school places, now it was now saying there was not. Another new free school is due to open in the borough in 2021, run by the Harris Federation. Council documents show [pdf] that this affected Greenwich\u2019s assessment of the need for school places. This has meant, the IAG parents say, that the provision of places in a not-yet-open free school contributed to the closure of the existing one. This is not disputed by the council. Sure enough, in July last year council planners refused permission for the playing fields site, provoking uproar among the IAG\u2019s parents and pupils. With ministers saying the school could not continue long term in its temporary premises, its closure was announced. The IAG, which as of last term had 267 year 7-10 pupils, will close for years 7-9 this summer, with year 10 pupils, who have started their GCSEs, finishing them at the school next year. Pupils have been given no guarantees of places elsewhere, and some parents have moved their children into private education. Kate Simpson is emigrating with her family to Toronto, where she grew up, although she had hoped to stay in London until her son, Cameron, 11, had completed high school. \u201cWe are devastated that the school is closing. Our decision to leave it is no reflection on its incredible teachers. It\u2019s the system that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Another parent, Michaela Barnes (not her real name), has managed to find her son a place elsewhere, but only after he had started at the IAG and she had bought his uniform. On the evening of his first and last day at IAG he was \u201ccurled up on the floor, in the foetal position, sobbing\u201d, she says. Peter Godden, who has moved his son, aged 14, to a private school, says: \u201cThe government let these schools open in temporary buildings, then let them fall by the wayside when planning permission was not given. It\u2019s scandalous.\u201d Comments from the DfE and Greenwich council indicate they were at loggerheads. Greenwich says: \u201cThis regrettable situation has arisen due to the Department for Education granting permission for a school with no permanent accommodation to open ... the Royal Borough of Greenwich is working closely with Lewisham council to ensure that the pupils, families and staff affected \u2026 receive co-ordinated and comprehensive support.\u201d The DfE says: \u201cWe have changed our policy to prevent cases like this happening again, only using temporary accommodation where there is a pressing need for places and a permanent site has been secured.\u201d Permission was given on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis, said a spokeswoman. The DfE guidance [pdf] says schools should open in temporary buildings only \u201cin exceptional circumstances\u201d. This will ring hollow for the IAG families. Grace, who has found her children a place at an under-subscribed secondary for September, says: \u201cThis has destroyed my faith in the education system. Those in charge genuinely don\u2019t seem to care about the impact on children of schools closing: it is just a political game to them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Time and again, Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s novels feature an artist whose success depends on leaving his wife and children. (His last book broke with the formula to follow a harassed screenwriter on holiday with his family; it\u2019s called <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-should-have-left-9781786484048.html\" title=\"\">You Should Have Left</a></em>.) The creative travails of men, and the collateral damage they inflict, may not seem a surefire draw for book-buyers, yet Kehlmann, who writes in German, is translated into more than 40 languages \u2013 he\u2019s fun to read, and his books travel light, uncluttered by cultural references.</p> <p>Not so <em>Tyll</em>. Set in early 17th-century Europe, it takes place during the thirty years\u2019 war, a sectarian power struggle over the Holy Roman Empire, which ravaged Germany and left millions dead. Wikipedia wormholes await the reader unfamiliar with, say, the battle of Zusmarshausen, the poet Martin Opitz, or indeed the novel\u2019s eponymous hero, lifted from a 16th-century folk tale about a lawless practical joker who roams the land exposing hypocrisy (Michael Rosen once adapted the story).</p> <p>Kehlmann establishes Tyll as a flesh-and-blood figure by giving him tragic origins. We\u2019re shown his tough village boyhood as the son of an intellectually curious miller whose interest in infinity \u2013 \u201cthe fact that to every number you can add another, as if there were no God to stem such a tide\u201d \u2013 spells doom when witch-hunting Jesuits turn up from England in the wake of the gunpowder plot.</p> <p>Kehlmann puts us deftly inside Tyll\u2019s fretful mind. \u201cWhen God wants to make a person, why does he do it in another person?\u201d he wonders, eyeing his pregnant mother, Agneta. When she goes into labour as they are taking flour to the next village, the boy is ordered to wait alone while she turns back.

      "bodyText": "Time and again, Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s novels feature an artist whose success depends on leaving his wife and children. (His last book broke with the formula to follow a harassed screenwriter on holiday with his family; it\u2019s called You Should Have Left.) The creative travails of men, and the collateral damage they inflict, may not seem a surefire draw for book-buyers, yet Kehlmann, who writes in German, is translated into more than 40 languages \u2013 he\u2019s fun to read, and his books travel light, uncluttered by cultural references. Not so Tyll. Set in early 17th-century Europe, it takes place during the thirty years\u2019 war, a sectarian power struggle over the Holy Roman Empire, which ravaged Germany and left millions dead. Wikipedia wormholes await the reader unfamiliar with, say, the battle of Zusmarshausen, the poet Martin Opitz, or indeed the novel\u2019s eponymous hero, lifted from a 16th-century folk tale about a lawless practical joker who roams the land exposing hypocrisy (Michael Rosen once adapted the story). Kehlmann establishes Tyll as a flesh-and-blood figure by giving him tragic origins. We\u2019re shown his tough village boyhood as the son of an intellectually curious miller whose interest in infinity \u2013 \u201cthe fact that to every number you can add another, as if there were no God to stem such a tide\u201d \u2013 spells doom when witch-hunting Jesuits turn up from England in the wake of the gunpowder plot. Kehlmann puts us deftly inside Tyll\u2019s fretful mind. \u201cWhen God wants to make a person, why does he do it in another person?\u201d he wonders, eyeing his pregnant mother, Agneta. When she goes into labour as they are taking flour to the next village, the boy is ordered to wait alone while she turns back. Terrified, deep in a forest with their donkey, he worries she\u2019ll find out that he\u2019s wet himself. Although he\u2019s brought to life with plausibly universal detail, the point isn\u2019t that Tyll could be any boy. Far from it: when he\u2019s eventually discovered in the forest, he\u2019s coated in flour, wearing the donkey\u2019s scalp; it\u2019s a grotesque portent of his future as an agent of chaos who, refusing the cards he\u2019s dealt, tosses them in the air. Yet just as we settle down for a character-centred picaresque, the novel shifts into an episodic hopscotch through the royal politicking behind the continent-wide bloodshed. When Tyll leaves his village with a vagabond balladeer to become a travelling player, he\u2019s relegated to the novel\u2019s margins, as the focus falls on a series of real-life historical figures, including Elizabeth Stuart, granddaughter of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her ill-fated husband, Frederick, King of Bohemia. Like recent Black Death novels by James Meek and Ois\u00edn Fagan, Kehlmann\u2019s portrait of bygone dark times both indulges and disrupts the apocalyptic turn in present-day commentary on current affairs. You could see Tyll as an attempt to politicise his usual man-of-genius trope, even if the anti-authoritarian spirit he embodies is hardly democratic \u2013 at one point, a villager recalls the mayhem his visit unleashed: \u201cWe understood what life could be like for someone who really did whatever he wanted \u2026 we understood that we would never be such people\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn\u2019t mind. We were all in the same boat.</p> <p>I was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht \u2013 our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.</p> <p>The longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.</p> <p>I grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals \u2013 you came to really anticipate meals \u2013 and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.</p> <p>Not long after the sun had gone down, you\u2019d go to sleep \u2013 partly because artificial light drained the boat\u2019s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky \u2013 being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c/0_362_5695_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milky Way streaks across the sky off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not long after the sun had gone down, you\u2019d go to sleep\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Buckley/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn\u2019t come.</p> <p>That transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/greta-thunberg-sets-sail-plymouth-climate-us-trump\">voyage to New York</a> last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world\u2019s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/the-boundless-sea-david-abulafia-review-by-alexander-larman\">The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans</a>, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either \u201ccomplete or comprehensive\u201d.</p> <p>Connections made by sea \u201chave brought together peoples, religions and civilisations\u201d through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge \u2013 and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it \u2013 the \u2018sea of darkness\u2019 and then, on the other hand, \u2018the isles of the blessed\u2019 \u2013 the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.\u201d</p> <p>I see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. \u201cHe\u2019s only happy at sea,\u201d says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.</p> <p>My parents remain \u201cliveaboards\u201d, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7e0077ac838958fd17c46b6b0a068f2a4dfaa12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7e0077ac838958fd17c46b6b0a068f2a4dfaa12/0_0_3000_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese explorers arriving in Calcutta in 1498, painted by Alfredo Gameiro about 1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese explorers arriving in Kolkata in 1498, painted by Alfredo Gameiro.

Passages have been guided by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/nov/04/setting-sail-one-womans-year-alone-at-sea\">trade winds</a> and currents that drive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/19/global-heating-supercharging-indian-ocean-dipole-climate-system\">climate and weather</a> all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide.</p> <p>At many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas \u2013 but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe \u2013 the knot in my hair might attest \u2013 its quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"848300550bf870bbf60109c4a77bafb750b99c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/848300550bf870bbf60109c4a77bafb750b99c79/16_180_633_740/428.jpg\" alt=\"Elle Hunt with her father\" width=\"428\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elle Hunt aged about nine in the bosun\u2019s chair, with her father Anthony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elle Hunt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared \u2013 that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either \u2013 just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.</p> <p>It is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course \u2013 but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long.

      "bodyText": "It was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn\u2019t mind. We were all in the same boat. I was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht \u2013 our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand. The longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time. I grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals \u2013 you came to really anticipate meals \u2013 and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties. Not long after the sun had gone down, you\u2019d go to sleep \u2013 partly because artificial light drained the boat\u2019s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky \u2013 being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.) When we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn\u2019t come. That transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg\u2019s voyage to New York last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world\u2019s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either \u201ccomplete or comprehensive\u201d. Connections made by sea \u201chave brought together peoples, religions and civilisations\u201d through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge \u2013 and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says. \u201cEven if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it \u2013 the \u2018sea of darkness\u2019 and then, on the other hand, \u2018the isles of the blessed\u2019 \u2013 the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.\u201d I see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. \u201cHe\u2019s only happy at sea,\u201d says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children. My parents remain \u201cliveaboards\u201d, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point. Yet for most of history there has also been \u201ca mercenary dimension\u201d to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, \u201cthe wish to exploit\u201d: \u201cYou know you\u2019re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.\u201d Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the Silk Road; in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death. The movement of not just goods, but people has been another constant \u2013 whether their migration was forced, such as by invasion or the slave trade; or voluntary, in search of a new life and opportunities. Passages have been guided by the trade winds and currents that drive climate and weather all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide. At many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas \u2013 but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe \u2013 the knot in my hair might attest \u2013 its quality. At the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared \u2013 that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either \u2013 just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you. It is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course \u2013 but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave \u2013 my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere. Even as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of \u201cblue space\u201d, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature. More significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water \u2013 its literal immersiveness \u2013 can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. \u201cThe optimal environment has both,\u201d says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it\u2019s pretty boring out there when you can\u2019t see the coast.\u201d As a crew member on the inaugural voyage from New York to Macau in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: \u201cIt has been one dreary waste of sky &amp; water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.\u201d Abulafia paraphrased: \u201cOne went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.\u201d He suspects that some ships\u2019 diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts \u201cof a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days\u201d. Yet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears; I\u2019m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous. In fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is \u201cWere there any storms?\u201d or, more to the point: \u201cWere you scared?\u201d The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight; and no \u2013 I slept through it.

Kate, coiffed and styled seven hours after giving birth, never puts a foot wrong. Still, one royal expert said there was a time when \u201cit felt like she wasn\u2019t doing a lot\u201d. I suppose she now has to atone for the sins of Diana and Meghan and will be policed for ever by the failing tabloids. Now she is on a pedestal, which means she can fall only one way \u2013 down. Says this royal expert.",

      "bodyText": "Towns in the bushfire-ravaged Bega Valley are relying on water carted in milk tanks after flooding made the catchment\u2019s water supply undrinkable. Bega Valley shire council has been trucking bore water from Bega for towns such as Bermagui, Cobargo and Quaama and the Australian Defence Force has set up a mobile water treatment plant to filter the water supply at the Brogo dam. The Brogo catchment was burnt out in disastrous fires in the first week of January. With no trees, grasses or other vegetation to act as a buffer, sediment, ash and other organic debris washed into Brogo dam last week when more than 150mm of rain fell across the catchment. Chris Best, the council\u2019s manager for water and sewer services, said residents were now under level four water restrictions to try to avoid a notice to boil water. \u201cIt\u2019s just another thing they\u2019re having to go through,\u201d Best said. Best said in addition to carting water in \u2013 which had cost $300,000 so far \u2013 and the ADF mobile treatment plant, the council was pumping water from a creek that it hadn\u2019t used to supply the water system for 20 years. He said in the immediate aftermath of the flooding, turbidity levels reached 600 NTU. They are still at 25 NTU and for drinking water that figure should be five or less. The dam is still overflowing and 200 megalitres of water a day are pouring over the spillway into the Brogo River. \u201cThis shire has a pristine landscape,\u201d Best said. \u201c[Until now] we\u2019ve managed not to have water treatment ever, just chlorination.\u201d The council is now seeking financial assistance from the New South Wales government to build a temporary water treatment plant, which is expected to cost $300,000. The mayor, Kristy McBain, is talking to the state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey. The NSW government has said it will provide financial assistance to the council up to $350,000 for emergency water carting until 10 March, or until normal supply is restored, whichever is the sooner. A permanent plant was promised by the state government in 2018 but still has to be built. Best estimated the catchment would \u201cstay burnt out for 18-24 months, meaning every time it rains it will happen again\u201d. \u201cHow to get through the next two years is something we have to work out,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, WaterNSW says measures enacted in the wake of the bushfires had been \u201csuccessful in protecting Sydney\u2019s dam water quality\u201d during torrential rain last week. The chief executive of WaterNSW, David Harris, said Warragamba dam would now resume supply of raw water to the Prospect water filtration plant. \u201cWe had a month\u2019s supply in Prospect Reservoir available so we could draw on it until our expert monitoring team could fully understand the effects of the prolonged drought and extensive fire followed by heavy rainfall and confirm their confidence in the water quality in Warragamba,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe spent the last week monitoring the intrusion into the Warragamba system and are now confident in resuming supplying raw water to Prospect water filtration plant.\u201d Dam levels in greater Sydney have spiked after significant rainfalls in February, with overall storage now at 80.4%. Water restrictions in Sydney will be eased from level 2 to level 1 on 1 March.",

Adults with a long history of offending showed a smaller surface area in many regions of the brain, and thinner grey matter in regions linked to regulation of emotions and behaviour, according to the UCL study. However, experts warn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/17/long-term-offenders-have-different-brain-structure-study-says\">picture of cause and effect is far from clear</a>: genetic and environmental factors, such as childhood deprivation, may have shaped their brains early in life, and smoking, alcohol or drug abuse could come into play later. Prof Kevin McConway, of the Open University, said that even if the brain differences were down to genetics or other early-life factors, it may be those factors themselves that were involved, not the resulting brain differences.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>News of the north \u2013 </strong>The Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan has questioned why there are no newsreaders with northern English accents.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Covid-19 kills senior Wuhan doctor Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray getting the show on the road this morning. The British government has said it is working to organise a flight to evacuate citizens from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where more than 450 people have tested positive for the Covid-19 coronavirus. The US has flown out more than 300 Americans while Canada, Australia and several other countries have made plans to evacuate their citizens. The ship remains quarantined in Yokohama, Japan. In China, Liu Zhiming, one of Wuhan\u2019s most senior doctors, has died after contracting Covid-19, while Chinese state media has reported new house-to-house checks are taking place in the city to seek out and \u201cround up\u201d all infected patients. The World Health Organisation has said that based on data from Hubei province, Covid-19 causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, and is not as deadly as other coronaviruses including Sars and Mers. The death rate is calculated at 2%. Apple has warned that new iPhones are going to be in short supply for the time being and it expects a hit to its quarterly revenue amid the virus emergency in China. While all iPhone factories outside of Hubei province had reopened, \u201cthey are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated\u201d, said a statement. More, as has become routine, at our live blog. * * * \u2018Associate\u2019 EU citizenship idea \u2013 The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is using a trip to Brussels to make the case for continued free movement in the EU for Britons through \u201cassociate citizenship\u201d. It was first suggested by Guy Verhofstadt, the ex-Belgian PM and then Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, who continues to back the idea. \u201cThe Maastricht treaty created the concept of \u2018European citizenship\u2019,\u201d Verhofstadt said, \u201cand I am in favour of using this now as a basis for people who want to keep their link with Europe.\u201d The chances of it making headway in \u201cfuture relationship\u201d talks are limited, though, as it would require changes to EU law. Meanwhile, Portugal is considering offering subsidised post-Brexit healthcare to British tourists. Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said Portugal wanted to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic) could continue: \u201cWe are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.\u201d About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year. * * * No plan for green schools \u2013 The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England\u2019s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put power back into the grid. It is the first school in England to meet the Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard. But only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished are installing renewable energy technology \u2013 and the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE\u2019s) recommended designs do not include renewables, writes Liz Lightfoot. In the West Midlands, warmth from canals could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks. A consortium, led by London South Bank University and known as GreenSCIES, plans to install water source heat pumps in the canal through Sandwell near Birmingham. The group already extracts \u201cwaste heat\u201d from the Northern line to warm homes in Islington, north London, accessing funds from a government renewables scheme. * * * Bercow \u2018no bully\u2019 \u2013 John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has hit out at the \u201csnobs and bigots\u201d he says are behind bullying complaints against him.

Adults with a long history of offending showed a smaller surface area in many regions of the brain, and thinner grey matter in regions linked to regulation of emotions and behaviour, according to the UCL study.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffPortugal is considering offering British tourists subsidised post-Brexit healthcare in an effort to retain their custom in the Algarve, Lisbon and beyond. It is one of several novel measures being considered by the Portuguese government in an effort to minimise the disruption of Brexit to its economy. Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said the country was examining a unilateral offer to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic), the EU reciprocal system, can continue if a deal is not struck on it during this year\u2019s trade talks. She said: \u201cThe Portuguese and the UK are the oldest allies in the world and no matter what happens the Portuguese will stand by the British. The British traveller is very important to us. \u201cWe are looking to guarantee this health cover next year. We are currently looking at how often it is used and if it is making a positive impact. We are in the process of testing this and the other ideas right now. \u201cIf these are issues that are important to the British traveller, then we have to go for it. We are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.\u201d About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year. The latest figures show the Algarve is the No 1 destination with 1.2 million British tourists in 2019. Among the other measures Portugal were considering, said Marques, were dedicated passport lanes for British visitors, special arrangements to continue to recognise British driving licences and entry for British pets. But the potential to offer replacement healthcare cover when the Ehic ceases to apply to British residents from January next year is the most dramatic and potentially costly intervention the government is considering. \u201cThe idea is you would pay the same as a Portuguese person, which is a small tax to see the GP or to visit a hospital,\u201d Marques said, adding that it would involve agreements with both state and private hospitals. Unlike the UK, many countries charge a set fee for GP and A&amp;E visits. This co-payment would still apply to British tourists in Portugal where it costs between \u20ac14 (\u00a311.70) and \u20ac18 for emergency medical service, and between \u20ac9 and \u20ac45 for a consultation with a GP or health centre. The Ehic grants EU citizens access to free or reduced-cost healthcare while on holiday in the EU and the European Economic Area, and pays for 250,000 medical treatments of British tourists each year, according to a House of Commons research briefing. However, unless a deal is agreed to continue with the Ehic system, the cover for Britons will disappear on 1 January 2021 when the Brexit transition period ends. Continuing with the health card may be a price worth paying to keep British tourists, who contribute \u20ac3bn \u2013 or about 1.5% \u2013 to the overall Portuguese economy of \u20ac204bn. Statistics show 17% of tourist receipts come from British tourists, with the number of overnight stays among Britons up almost 8% compared with 1.3% for tourism as a whole. Last year\u2019s Brelcome campaign, advertising the country\u2019s 850km (530-mile) coastline, food and sunshine, helped reverse a 2018 decrease in British tourist numbers after a six-year boom.",

What keeps these fans hooked?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce42525d2ba1f00e69861a7062d1a70746335c7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce42525d2ba1f00e69861a7062d1a70746335c7d/5_72_635_458/500.jpg\" alt=\"Like family \u2026 Pete Price on the set of Coronation Street with Sue Nicholls (Audrey Roberts)\" width=\"500\" height=\"361\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like family \u2026 Pete Price on the set of Coronation Street with Sue Nicholls (Audrey Roberts)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Pete Price</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou become so familiar with the characters,\u201d says Price. \u201cThey are a comforting part of your life.

My friends were taking the mickey, but it was like losing a member of the family.\u201d</p> <p>For Glenda Young, another lifelong Corrie fan, the show works as nostalgia, a reminder of her childhood. \u201cI\u2019m 55 now, but I can remember when I was a child, being curled up on the sofa between my mum and my grandma watching Corrie,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the few constants in my life. It\u2019s a real comfort, a reminder of being back home if I\u2019ve been away.\u201d</p> <p>Corrie also helped to kick off her career as a writer. \u201cWhen I got my first computer in 1993, the first two words I typed into the internet were \u2018Coronation Street\u2019 because I wanted to see what was out there.\u201d She came upon a small fan forum and began to write weekly episode recaps from her home in Sunderland at the behest of viewers overseas, where episodes lagged weeks behind. She now writes recaps to a mailing list of more than 5,000 people and organises regular visits to the set in Manchester. It was on one such trip that she met the man who would become her husband.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"463dc40388072754c974e7ccb008557a490ba76d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/463dc40388072754c974e7ccb008557a490ba76d/0_11_845_663/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s changed my life\u2019 \u2026 Glenda Young on the set of Corrie.\" width=\"500\" height=\"392\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s changed my life\u2019 \u2026 Glenda Young on the set of Corrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAfter we had been together for 10 years,\u201d she says, \u201cwe went on another set visit and he suddenly got down on one knee, on the famous cobbles, to propose to me.

      "body": "<p>It is not easy to find the library <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/moria-refugee-camp-doctors-story-lesbos-greece\" title=\"\">at Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos</a>. Before reaching the refugee camp\u2019s main entrance, you turn off the road where the police bus is always parked, then walk up the track that runs beside the perimeter fence. You walk past the military post and the hawkers selling fruit and veg, trainers, cooking utensils, cigarettes, electrical equipment \u2013 pretty much everything; past huge stinking mountains of bagged-up rubbish \u2013 so much rubbish; and past the worst toilets in the world, overflowing with excrement and plastic.</p> <p>Then, opposite the hole in the fence where people who don\u2019t want to use the main gate come and go, you turn right, into what they call the Jungle, the olive groves into which the camp has exploded, because it was meant for 3,000 people and now has 20,000. Continue along the winding path, watching out for low-slung washing lines, past the burnt-out olive tree and the tiny tent with the family who always say hello, then turn left up the steep hill that becomes a muddy slide after rain. And there it is, on the right: Moria\u2019s new library.</p> <p>From the outside, it looks like all the other structures in this part of the camp \u2013 a shack cobbled together from bits of wood and tarpaulins. But inside there are shelves and books. And, standing behind a counter, wearing a New York Yankees beanie, a librarian \u2013 Zekria, from Afghanistan.</p> <p>He runs a school, too \u2013 that is how the library started. Zekria, 40, his wife and their five children arrived on the island a year ago in the usual perilous way, in a small boat at night across the 12-mile strait from Turkey. He tried to register the kids at one of the NGO-run schools that provide some educational activities, but they were all full; the waiting list could have been a month, two months, three months.</p> <p>So Zekria, who used to teach law at a university in Kabul, decided to start his own class. \u201cI bought a whiteboard and some markers. It started in an open area under an olive tree last March, teaching English,\u201d he says. \u201cEnglish is the most important, because, even though people get stuck here for a year, two years, more even, no one wants to live here for ever.\u201d He speaks excellent English, softly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"384af6c2678354953ab9d1a6923a4489963f7901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/384af6c2678354953ab9d1a6923a4489963f7901/0_0_1777_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugee children on the outskirts of Moria camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everyone \u2013 especially children \u2013 needs hope\u2019 ... young refugees on the outskirts of Moria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Byron Smith/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More and more people \u2013 mostly Afghans, but also Syrians, Iraqis and members of other nationalities \u2013 wanted classes. Zekria was invited to people\u2019s tents and containers to teach; soon he had more potential students than he could cope with. So he set up a team and they built a classroom. Registration opened one Friday morning. \u201cWhen I came here at 7.30am, more than 600 people were in the line.\u201d</p> <p>They scheduled lessons for everyone: no one gets turned away, even if it means 50 to a class. \u201cWe cannot say no,\u201d says Zekria. As if to prove it, 14-year-old Somahya shows up to register for German lessons (her family is trying to get to Germany) and is told there will be a class available by next week.</p> <p>Now there are three classrooms and the teaching team numbers 30, with more than 1,000 students learning English, German, French and Greek, guitar and art. In the room next to the library, a class mostly of teenagers is painting designs on T-shirts on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for people living in this stressful place,\u201d says Zekria. \u201cThey come here, paint or listen to music, they learn something, they\u2019re busy, they forget the other traumatic stuff they suffer in this camp. Psychology starts in action. Doctors will advise, but we are doing it in action.\u201d</p> <p>The library is the latest project. Zekria hasn\u2019t quite worked out the system yet. It doesn\u2019t officially open until tomorrow. He thinks it is going to be one book borrowed at a time, maybe two if users travel a long distance within the camp. They will be able to keep items for a week, maybe 10 days. So far, books have mostly been donated by aid workers and NGOs, some possibly more pertinent (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/10/catch-22-50-years-joseph-heller\" title=\"\">Catch-22</a>) than others (the Lonely Planet guide to China). Zekria would like more books in Farsi and Arabic. I have only one book with me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/a-bit-of-a-stretch-chris-atkins-review\" title=\"\">a new one by the film-maker</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/a-bit-of-a-stretch-chris-atkins-review\" title=\"\"> Chris Atkins about his time banged up in Wandsworth prison</a> in London. That could be relevant, I guess. Anyway, it is there now, in the library at Moria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f877c9c81cc65d1493bf0c69ea1eab38212fc12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f877c9c81cc65d1493bf0c69ea1eab38212fc12/0_0_1777_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Sudanese migrants outside Moria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humanity survives in hell ...

Their asylum application has been rejected. He doesn\u2019t know why, but suspects it may have something to do with this educational activity. The authorities don\u2019t like it, he says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I have come to Moria on the hunt for hope. It began with a letter to the Guardian from an aid worker there. He was concerned that the notorious camp\u2019s portrayal in the media was relentlessly negative. But working there, he said, was an amazing experience; every day, he witnessed acts of kindness by extraordinary people. It gave him faith in humanity. </p> <p>You will have heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/dec/03/life-in-a-greek-makeshift-migrant-camp-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the desperate conditions</a>, the overcrowding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/sep/30/riots-follow-deadly-fire-lesbos-refugee-camp-video\" title=\"\">the fires, the riots</a>, the unaccompanied minors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/03/trauma-runs-deep-for-children-at-dire-lesbos-camp-moria\" title=\"\">the trauma</a>, <a href=\"https://neoskosmos.com/en/122778/medecins-sans-frontieres-confirms-rape-cases-at-moria-migrant-camp/\" title=\"\">sexual exploitation, rape</a> <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/248542/article/ekathimerini/news/young-migrant-stabbed-to-death-at-moria-camp\" title=\"\">and murder</a>. I am here to see if there is another, more positive side to Moria.</p> <p>Bloody hell, that looks unlikely. \u201cMoria no good,\u201d is the chorus to my time at the camp. The same issues come up again and again: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/moria-is-a-hell-new-arrivals-describe-life-in-a-greek-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">the fear and the cold at night</a>, freezing showers, the unreliable supply of water, no electricity, queueing for hours for food, for months, years or for ever for permission to leave the island. Then there are the fights that break out among the frustrated, angry, bored young men who make up a high proportion of those living here. Just before my arrival, a 20-year-old Yemeni man was fatally stabbed, the second death this year. No one came here for this.</p> <p>Moria is hell, a stain on 21st-century Europe, where bureaucracy, politics and simply not caring enough have left tens of thousands in limbo \u2013 people fleeing war and danger, looking for a future for themselves and their children and not finding it. Moria\u2019s existence is a disgrace, a failure of morality.</p> <p>Yet, somehow, a sort of life goes on; humanity survives in hell. I am here for three days \u2013 two alone, then another with the photographer Byron Smith \u2013 and experience so much goodwill and humour.</p> <p>I am offered warm flatbread fresh from one of Moria\u2019s many ovens, sunflower seeds from kids, shisha from a bunch of Iraqi lads standing around a fire. Language is sometimes a problem, but it turns out it is possible to discuss the demise of Manchester United through sign language. There are more people here from Afghanistan than from any other country and I end up talking to more Afghans than anyone else, but I also meet people from Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Nigeria, Burundi, Zimbabwe and even Myanmar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07987ad63e9c15a7711e59e8fb5a3878908762f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07987ad63e9c15a7711e59e8fb5a3878908762f3/55_0_1667_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah Najafi (second left), from Afghanistan, and two of his children \u2013 Mohammad (left), 14, and Meraj, five \u2013 show photos and share tea with Sam Wollaston inside their tent at Moria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah Najafi <em>(second left)</em>, from Afghanistan, and two of his children \u2013 Mohammad <em>(left)</em>, 14, and Meraj, five \u2013 show photos and share tea with Sam Wollaston inside their tent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Byron Smith/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no power to make coffee or tea in Wahid Amini\u2019s store today, but he has cold drinks.

He sells shampoo, rice, spaghetti, washing-up liquid, disposable razors, etc, which he buys outside the camp. He is open 24 hours.</p> <p>The Najafi family \u2013 Abdullah and Gulbdan, plus their sons Ali Reza (15), Mohammad (14) and Meraj (five) \u2013 invite us into their homemade tent. It is tiny for five people \u2013 six, actually; their 16-year-old daughter, Faezh, has gone to queue for a cold shower. But it is spotless and tidy \u2013 blankets have been folded and piled up for the day \u2013 and we leave our muddy shoes at the entrance. The family\u2019s belongings hang in rucksacks from the wall, next to the Afghan flag and a couple of soft toys, one of which looks like a Kevin the Carrot from Aldi. I really hope it is one of the Kevins I recently sneaked into the charity-shop bag at home.</p> <p>Gulbdan must know of a secret power source, as she conjures up an electric kettle and hot water to make tea, served in cracked cups with almonds and biscuits. Touching hospitality in any circumstance; properly moving in Moria.</p> <p>Mohammad shows me footage on his dad\u2019s phone of him taking part in a karate tournament in Iran. Abdullah and Gulbdan left Afghanistan 20 years ago; the kids have been brought up in Iran until now. Mohammad, already a black belt, won his bout. There is no karate in Moria, just actual fighting. The Najafi family keep to their tent after dark.</p> <p>They show us pictures on Faezh\u2019s camera of some of their journey. Playing on a beach in Turkey, rock pools, jellyfish. She didn\u2019t take pictures of the crossing \u2013 it was too dark and too scary \u2013 but there is a little video of them on the beach where they landed in the north of Lesbos, looking tired but happy, in Europe at last. They never imagined they would end up like this.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One boy gave me a pair of socks.

Kind Danish women distribute clothes; a group of Dutch Christians hand out boxes of toys; a middle-aged British man with a background in water engineering leads a team to maintain the camp\u2019s showers, toilets and sewers. There are hundreds of mostly young volunteers, who consider Moria unacceptable and Europe\u2019s shame. They are not indifferent: they want to make a difference. I meet many who came for a few weeks and ended up staying for a year, sometimes two.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ohf-lesvos.org/en/welcome/\" title=\"\">One Happy Family</a> is, as you might expect from its name, good news. A community centre a few miles from the camp, run by various organisations along with many refugee volunteers, it has a medical centre, a playground, a gym, a women\u2019s space, a cafe, board games, a phone-charging station and an electrical repair shop. There is also a garden, where refugee volunteers including Sima Mohammedi and Reza Rezaie show me the beetroot, spinach, turnips, chard, beans and herbs they are growing. Covering the compost heap is a big piece of black rubber, just recognisable as part of one of the dinghies that bring refugees from Turkey and then get abandoned. Recycling.</p> <p>The vegetables contribute to the OHF kitchen, where they cook lunch for up to 1,200 people every day. Today\u2019s chefs are Fifie from Zimbabwe and Mohammed from Myanmar. They are cooking vegetables, lentils, chickpeas and flatbread. Once a week they do chicken \u2013 and the queues get really long.</p> <p>Back at Moria, it is hard not to meet Ali Shama Eddin. He must be the most famous and is certainly the tallest person here. Ali, 23, from Damascus in Syria, arrived in Moria in 2016. He was alone: his parents had already reached Germany \u2013 but that helps your case only if you are a minor. He started helping, volunteering with the Dutch organisation <a href=\"https://movementontheground.com/\" title=\"\">Movement on the Ground</a>, and learned English from hanging out with the Europeans he worked with.</p> <p>It took Ali almost two years, but he got his travel documents eventually and went to Germany to join his family. \u201cBut my heart, my mind, my feelings were here, so I decided to come back,\u201d he says. Now he works here, as the general manager for the same NGO, Movement on the Ground. He strides about the place in his bright yellow jacket, greeting everyone in several languages, trying to sort out people\u2019s problems, finding room in a tent for a new arrival. \u201cI understand \u2013 I\u2019m a refugee as well,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44c4b609c695ad08a9ed3acd8cebf83156b682fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44c4b609c695ad08a9ed3acd8cebf83156b682fd/0_0_1777_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Shama Eddin, from the charity Movement on the Ground, mediates a dispute in the camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I understand \u2013 I\u2019m a refugee as well\u2019 ...

This one doesn\u2019t end in a fight \u2013 for now.</p> <p>\u201cThere is love and communication between people from different countries \u2013 we can all be together, share a meal, discuss something. We can learn from each other, inspire each other, support each other. This is amazing,\u201d says Ali, who is very much on board with the NGO\u2019s ethos, which is all about treating people with dignity and respect and empowering them.</p> <p>Who is this European woman, who looks a bit like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/24/johan-cruyff-dies-aged-68-holland-football-legend\" title=\"\">Johan Cruyff</a> and smokes like him, too? Ah, Susila Cruyff, the daughter of the footballer. She is here with the <a href=\"https://www.cruyff-foundation.org/en/\" title=\"\">Cruyff Foundation</a>, which develops sports activities for children in need around the world. Nowhere are kids more in need than here. The foundation is going to build a football pitch \u2013 a Cruyff court \u2013 in the camp and Susila is here to look for a suitable site. At the moment, there is nowhere flat in camp to kick a ball. \u201cMy father used to think that sport is more than sport,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good for your health, but also for your mental health,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The foundation will build two pitches: one here, one somewhere else on the island for the locals \u2013 the hope being that it will encourage competitions and build bridges between refugees and residents. The relationship between the two has been far from easy.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cThey steal, they fight, they don\u2019t respect us,\u201d says Sofia, my taxi driver from the airport. Tourists no longer come; Lesbos is now an \u201cIslamic place\u201d, she says.</p> <p>There are about 25,000 refugees on an island with a permanent population of 86,000. That is an increase of almost 30% (think of 19 million people suddenly showing up in the UK). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/16/life-on-lesbos-residents-tell-us-what-its-really-like\" title=\"\">It has put a massive strain on the island\u2019s resources</a>: water, services, the hospital. Ambulances are frequent visitors to Moria\u2019s main gate; I see a woman in labour and obvious pain being lifted into one. She will be back within a couple of days with Moria\u2019s youngest resident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"970cdba708b55dd93b8a27803c13b4ed4142275e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970cdba708b55dd93b8a27803c13b4ed4142275e/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holding a Greek flag protests against the country\u2019s refugee camps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Close the borders\u2019 ... a woman holding a Greek flag protests against the country\u2019s refugee camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a one-day general strike on the island while I am here; everything is shut down. Hundreds of protesters gather in the capital, Mytilini, waving Greek flags, demanding the closure of the camp and the removal of refugees from the island. \u201cWe want our islands back, we want our lives back,\u201d is the main slogan of the protests, which are taking place on the islands of Samos and Chios at the same time.</p> <p>A few miles from Mytilini, in a tiny hamlet on the Gulf of Giera, a very different scene is playing out. In what used to be a restaurant, a cosy dining room with a woodburner, four Afghan teenagers are playing with a kitten. One of them puts on some music from home and they dance.</p> <p>They are unaccompanied minors from Moria, children lost in a world that isn\u2019t fair, but brought here today for something a bit like a home. They are accompanied by Eleni Dimou, who works for the government, looking after boys at Moria. Some have psychological problems; some self-harm, she says. It is hard enough being a teenager anywhere, but it is really hard at Moria.</p> <p>Some call her Mother, says Eleni, whose own children are grown up. \u201cBecause they need a mother, they need someone.\u201d</p> <p>It is a really hard job, but not a thankless one. \u201cI get a lot of love from them,\u201d says Eleni, who is learning Farsi. \u201cOn Christmas Day, one boy gave me a pair of socks. I said: \u2018Why did you do that? It costs money.\u2019 He said: \u2018Because I know in your country, on Christmas, you give presents to the people that you love.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This place was set up by a lovely local couple, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/1120396604768512\" title=\"\">Nikos Katsouris and Katerina Koveou</a>. They turn up later and tell me how it came about. In 2014, Nikos, then a fisherman, was driving around with a van of fish to sell when he came across a group of refugees from Syria who had just landed. They were wet, tired and hungry; there was a pregnant woman and a boy of about 10, who was on his own. Shocked by what he saw, Nikos used the money he got from the fish to buy them food and gave the boy his jacket. When he got home and told Katerina, she got to work immediately, cooking for them. Then they set off to find them, with 40 homecooked meals and all the blankets and clothes they could lay their hands on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cf2f990b3f68ea254ffaa575197fa9fa44d6a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf2f990b3f68ea254ffaa575197fa9fa44d6a11/0_0_1777_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Home for All founders Nikos Katsouris and Katerina Koveou, left, say goodbye to Afghan asylum-seeker Zakira Naderi, at their establishment last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We try to give back what others took from the people\u2019 ...

But the couple found another boatload of arrivals to give it to. Ever since, they have been helping refugees, adapting to the changing needs of the situation. When Moria opened, they took sardines, bread, rice and vegetables to the camp and they fed hungry volunteers in their restaurant. Then they started to bring families from the camp to the restaurant. \u201cWe try to give back what others took from the people,\u201d Nikos says. \u201cThey took their lives, their smiles, their humanity, their dignity. These things we have here.\u201d</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t gone down well with the authorities. They have broken petty rules, such as that you are not allowed to be a charity and a restaurant at the same time. Nikos and Katerina have been fined a total of \u20ac47,800 (\u00a340,000). So they have given up the restaurant and are now solely an NGO, <a href=\"https://homeforall.eu/\" title=\"\">Home for All</a>. They have refugees here every day, to eat, to learn to cook, to be at home, like the boys today. They cook and deliver food for the most vulnerable in the camp \u2013 minors and sick people.</p> <p>Katerina has had to accept that they can\u2019t help everyone. \u201cThis was my problem in the beginning \u2013 I wanted to help them all. But then I realised: \u2018If I do this, probably I am not going to help anyone.\u2019 You help those you can, and if you can do more, you do.\u201d</p> <p>Why do they do it? \u201cBecause we want to and because we can,\u201d she says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I return to Moria one more time, turning off the road where the police bus sits, up the dirt track that runs parallel to the perimeter fence, right into the Jungle. I am not going to Zekria\u2019s library this time, not yet, but to his school, to see one of his teachers.</p> <p>It has been more difficult for me to talk to women in the camp than to men, mostly because of culture and tradition. No problems with 19-year-old Azita Barekzai from Afghanistan, though. She is happy to chat. Her English is good; she is ambitious and wise (I hope that doesn\u2019t sound patronising). When I ask her something I have already asked, she tells me off: \u201cI told you!\u201d She doesn\u2019t want her photo taken, because she has a cold, but in the end she relents. I am glad there is a picture of Azita; like many of the people I meet in Moria, she is amazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52e4256eba9f0cbbadcc8175f3d0a42ec46eda3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e4256eba9f0cbbadcc8175f3d0a42ec46eda3d/0_0_1400_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Azita Barekzai, a 19-year-old Afghan English teacher, poses inside a classroom at the school founded by Zekria Farzad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I enjoy it a lot because I can make some people smile\u2019 ...

She is the oldest of the kids. The crossing was terrifying, \u201creally dangerous. I never thought we were going to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Then she was shocked by what they had come to in Moria. The usual issues \u2013 the cold, the rubbish, the fights, being too scared to leave the tent at night. It is especially horrible when it rains. \u201cYou cannot imagine how people tolerate it. Life is really difficult here.\u201d</p> <p>She wants to go to Switzerland, because she heard it accepts refugees and is beautiful. She would like to be a doctor. She has her papers already; she can travel, but the rest of her family hasn\u2019t been approved. They are still waiting.</p> <p>In the meantime, she is teaching English to kids in Zekria\u2019s school. \u201cI enjoy it a lot because I can make some people smile. I just want to make them laugh. I know that if someone laughs it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have problems. We need hope. Everyone \u2013 especially children \u2013 needs hope. We are really hopeless sometimes because of this bad situation. Maybe learning English gives them some hope for the future. They can go somewhere else better.\u201d</p> <p>It is time for the library\u2019s opening ceremony next door. There is a small gathering; someone has brought a basket of sweets and a red ribbon. Zekria says a few words, thanks the people who nailed the bits of wood together and attached the tarpaulins, and the book donors. Then, with a pair of scissors, he cuts the ribbon. Moria\u2019s library is, he declares, officially open.</p> <p>***</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, back in my nice, safe, warm office, I WhatsApp Zekria to check a couple of things. First, he tells me that the pictures I took of the opening (Byron wasn\u2019t around at the time) were terrible. He is not wrong. Then he says his asylum application was rejected again. Fearing deportation, he and his family managed to get to mainland Greece, where they are staying in a squat. \u201cIt\u2019s cold, there is no electricity, it is the life of refugees,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate the fucking politics of the world.\u201d</p> <p>He has no money left and will try to find informal work, then perhaps try to cross a land border into Albania or North Macedonia. The library and the school in Moria are fine, he says. The team is running them; he is in touch regularly. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will speak later, my friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020. An earlier version mistakenly referred to \u201cMacedonia\u201d, a country which officially changed its name to North Macedonia in February 2019. This has been corrected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is not easy to find the library at Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos. Before reaching the refugee camp\u2019s main entrance, you turn off the road where the police bus is always parked, then walk up the track that runs beside the perimeter fence. You walk past the military post and the hawkers selling fruit and veg, trainers, cooking utensils, cigarettes, electrical equipment \u2013 pretty much everything; past huge stinking mountains of bagged-up rubbish \u2013 so much rubbish; and past the worst toilets in the world, overflowing with excrement and plastic. Then, opposite the hole in the fence where people who don\u2019t want to use the main gate come and go, you turn right, into what they call the Jungle, the olive groves into which the camp has exploded, because it was meant for 3,000 people and now has 20,000. Continue along the winding path, watching out for low-slung washing lines, past the burnt-out olive tree and the tiny tent with the family who always say hello, then turn left up the steep hill that becomes a muddy slide after rain. And there it is, on the right: Moria\u2019s new library. From the outside, it looks like all the other structures in this part of the camp \u2013 a shack cobbled together from bits of wood and tarpaulins. But inside there are shelves and books. And, standing behind a counter, wearing a New York Yankees beanie, a librarian \u2013 Zekria, from Afghanistan. He runs a school, too \u2013 that is how the library started. Zekria, 40, his wife and their five children arrived on the island a year ago in the usual perilous way, in a small boat at night across the 12-mile strait from Turkey. He tried to register the kids at one of the NGO-run schools that provide some educational activities, but they were all full; the waiting list could have been a month, two months, three months. So Zekria, who used to teach law at a university in Kabul, decided to start his own class. \u201cI bought a whiteboard and some markers. It started in an open area under an olive tree last March, teaching English,\u201d he says. \u201cEnglish is the most important, because, even though people get stuck here for a year, two years, more even, no one wants to live here for ever.\u201d He speaks excellent English, softly. More and more people \u2013 mostly Afghans, but also Syrians, Iraqis and members of other nationalities \u2013 wanted classes. Zekria was invited to people\u2019s tents and containers to teach; soon he had more potential students than he could cope with. So he set up a team and they built a classroom. Registration opened one Friday morning. \u201cWhen I came here at 7.30am, more than 600 people were in the line.\u201d They scheduled lessons for everyone: no one gets turned away, even if it means 50 to a class. \u201cWe cannot say no,\u201d says Zekria. As if to prove it, 14-year-old Somahya shows up to register for German lessons (her family is trying to get to Germany) and is told there will be a class available by next week. Now there are three classrooms and the teaching team numbers 30, with more than 1,000 students learning English, German, French and Greek, guitar and art. In the room next to the library, a class mostly of teenagers is painting designs on T-shirts on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for people living in this stressful place,\u201d says Zekria. \u201cThey come here, paint or listen to music, they learn something, they\u2019re busy, they forget the other traumatic stuff they suffer in this camp. Psychology starts in action. Doctors will advise, but we are doing it in action.\u201d The library is the latest project. Zekria hasn\u2019t quite worked out the system yet. It doesn\u2019t officially open until tomorrow. He thinks it is going to be one book borrowed at a time, maybe two if users travel a long distance within the camp. They will be able to keep items for a week, maybe 10 days. So far, books have mostly been donated by aid workers and NGOs, some possibly more pertinent (Catch-22) than others (the Lonely Planet guide to China). Zekria would like more books in Farsi and Arabic. I have only one book with me, a new one by the film-maker Chris Atkins about his time banged up in Wandsworth prison in London. That could be relevant, I guess. Anyway, it is there now, in the library at Moria. Zekria\u2019s own sentence \u2013 and his family\u2019s \u2013 is further uncertainty. Their asylum application has been rejected. He doesn\u2019t know why, but suspects it may have something to do with this educational activity. The authorities don\u2019t like it, he says. *** I have come to Moria on the hunt for hope. It began with a letter to the Guardian from an aid worker there. He was concerned that the notorious camp\u2019s portrayal in the media was relentlessly negative. But working there, he said, was an amazing experience; every day, he witnessed acts of kindness by extraordinary people. It gave him faith in humanity. You will have heard about the desperate conditions, the overcrowding, the fires, the riots, the unaccompanied minors, the trauma, sexual exploitation, rape and murder. I am here to see if there is another, more positive side to Moria. Bloody hell, that looks unlikely. \u201cMoria no good,\u201d is the chorus to my time at the camp. The same issues come up again and again: the fear and the cold at night, freezing showers, the unreliable supply of water, no electricity, queueing for hours for food, for months, years or for ever for permission to leave the island. Then there are the fights that break out among the frustrated, angry, bored young men who make up a high proportion of those living here. Just before my arrival, a 20-year-old Yemeni man was fatally stabbed, the second death this year. No one came here for this. Moria is hell, a stain on 21st-century Europe, where bureaucracy, politics and simply not caring enough have left tens of thousands in limbo \u2013 people fleeing war and danger, looking for a future for themselves and their children and not finding it. Moria\u2019s existence is a disgrace, a failure of morality. Yet, somehow, a sort of life goes on; humanity survives in hell. I am here for three days \u2013 two alone, then another with the photographer Byron Smith \u2013 and experience so much goodwill and humour. I am offered warm flatbread fresh from one of Moria\u2019s many ovens, sunflower seeds from kids, shisha from a bunch of Iraqi lads standing around a fire. Language is sometimes a problem, but it turns out it is possible to discuss the demise of Manchester United through sign language. There are more people here from Afghanistan than from any other country and I end up talking to more Afghans than anyone else, but I also meet people from Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Nigeria, Burundi, Zimbabwe and even Myanmar. There is no power to make coffee or tea in Wahid Amini\u2019s store today, but he has cold drinks. A cameraman back in Kabul, Wahid, 20, is trying to join his family in France, but his application has been rejected. He is hopeful that, with legal help and more documentation, he might get there one day. The shop, next to a busy barber\u2019s, is a new enterprise, to try to make a bit of money. He sells shampoo, rice, spaghetti, washing-up liquid, disposable razors, etc, which he buys outside the camp. He is open 24 hours. The Najafi family \u2013 Abdullah and Gulbdan, plus their sons Ali Reza (15), Mohammad (14) and Meraj (five) \u2013 invite us into their homemade tent. It is tiny for five people \u2013 six, actually; their 16-year-old daughter, Faezh, has gone to queue for a cold shower. But it is spotless and tidy \u2013 blankets have been folded and piled up for the day \u2013 and we leave our muddy shoes at the entrance. The family\u2019s belongings hang in rucksacks from the wall, next to the Afghan flag and a couple of soft toys, one of which looks like a Kevin the Carrot from Aldi. I really hope it is one of the Kevins I recently sneaked into the charity-shop bag at home. Gulbdan must know of a secret power source, as she conjures up an electric kettle and hot water to make tea, served in cracked cups with almonds and biscuits. Touching hospitality in any circumstance; properly moving in Moria. Mohammad shows me footage on his dad\u2019s phone of him taking part in a karate tournament in Iran. Abdullah and Gulbdan left Afghanistan 20 years ago; the kids have been brought up in Iran until now. Mohammad, already a black belt, won his bout. There is no karate in Moria, just actual fighting. The Najafi family keep to their tent after dark. They show us pictures on Faezh\u2019s camera of some of their journey. Playing on a beach in Turkey, rock pools, jellyfish. She didn\u2019t take pictures of the crossing \u2013 it was too dark and too scary \u2013 but there is a little video of them on the beach where they landed in the north of Lesbos, looking tired but happy, in Europe at last. They never imagined they would end up like this. There is plenty of humanity on show from the aid workers. Kind Danish women distribute clothes; a group of Dutch Christians hand out boxes of toys; a middle-aged British man with a background in water engineering leads a team to maintain the camp\u2019s showers, toilets and sewers. There are hundreds of mostly young volunteers, who consider Moria unacceptable and Europe\u2019s shame. They are not indifferent: they want to make a difference. I meet many who came for a few weeks and ended up staying for a year, sometimes two. One Happy Family is, as you might expect from its name, good news. A community centre a few miles from the camp, run by various organisations along with many refugee volunteers, it has a medical centre, a playground, a gym, a women\u2019s space, a cafe, board games, a phone-charging station and an electrical repair shop. There is also a garden, where refugee volunteers including Sima Mohammedi and Reza Rezaie show me the beetroot, spinach, turnips, chard, beans and herbs they are growing. Covering the compost heap is a big piece of black rubber, just recognisable as part of one of the dinghies that bring refugees from Turkey and then get abandoned. Recycling. The vegetables contribute to the OHF kitchen, where they cook lunch for up to 1,200 people every day. Today\u2019s chefs are Fifie from Zimbabwe and Mohammed from Myanmar. They are cooking vegetables, lentils, chickpeas and flatbread. Once a week they do chicken \u2013 and the queues get really long. Back at Moria, it is hard not to meet Ali Shama Eddin. He must be the most famous and is certainly the tallest person here. Ali, 23, from Damascus in Syria, arrived in Moria in 2016. He was alone: his parents had already reached Germany \u2013 but that helps your case only if you are a minor. He started helping, volunteering with the Dutch organisation Movement on the Ground, and learned English from hanging out with the Europeans he worked with. It took Ali almost two years, but he got his travel documents eventually and went to Germany to join his family. \u201cBut my heart, my mind, my feelings were here, so I decided to come back,\u201d he says. Now he works here, as the general manager for the same NGO, Movement on the Ground. He strides about the place in his bright yellow jacket, greeting everyone in several languages, trying to sort out people\u2019s problems, finding room in a tent for a new arrival. \u201cI understand \u2013 I\u2019m a refugee as well,\u201d he says. When there is a dispute between two men, one of whom says the other owes him money, Ali sits them down to try to sort it out. \u201cI want to hear from both of you to understand how we can solve this problem,\u201d he tells them. This one doesn\u2019t end in a fight \u2013 for now. \u201cThere is love and communication between people from different countries \u2013 we can all be together, share a meal, discuss something. We can learn from each other, inspire each other, support each other. This is amazing,\u201d says Ali, who is very much on board with the NGO\u2019s ethos, which is all about treating people with dignity and respect and empowering them. Who is this European woman, who looks a bit like Johan Cruyff and smokes like him, too? Ah, Susila Cruyff, the daughter of the footballer. She is here with the Cruyff Foundation, which develops sports activities for children in need around the world. Nowhere are kids more in need than here. The foundation is going to build a football pitch \u2013 a Cruyff court \u2013 in the camp and Susila is here to look for a suitable site. At the moment, there is nowhere flat in camp to kick a ball. \u201cMy father used to think that sport is more than sport,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good for your health, but also for your mental health,\u201d she says. The foundation will build two pitches: one here, one somewhere else on the island for the locals \u2013 the hope being that it will encourage competitions and build bridges between refugees and residents. The relationship between the two has been far from easy. *** \u201cThey steal, they fight, they don\u2019t respect us,\u201d says Sofia, my taxi driver from the airport. Tourists no longer come; Lesbos is now an \u201cIslamic place\u201d, she says. There are about 25,000 refugees on an island with a permanent population of 86,000. That is an increase of almost 30% (think of 19 million people suddenly showing up in the UK). It has put a massive strain on the island\u2019s resources: water, services, the hospital. Ambulances are frequent visitors to Moria\u2019s main gate; I see a woman in labour and obvious pain being lifted into one. She will be back within a couple of days with Moria\u2019s youngest resident. There is a one-day general strike on the island while I am here; everything is shut down. Hundreds of protesters gather in the capital, Mytilini, waving Greek flags, demanding the closure of the camp and the removal of refugees from the island. \u201cWe want our islands back, we want our lives back,\u201d is the main slogan of the protests, which are taking place on the islands of Samos and Chios at the same time. A few miles from Mytilini, in a tiny hamlet on the Gulf of Giera, a very different scene is playing out. In what used to be a restaurant, a cosy dining room with a woodburner, four Afghan teenagers are playing with a kitten. One of them puts on some music from home and they dance. They are unaccompanied minors from Moria, children lost in a world that isn\u2019t fair, but brought here today for something a bit like a home. They are accompanied by Eleni Dimou, who works for the government, looking after boys at Moria. Some have psychological problems; some self-harm, she says. It is hard enough being a teenager anywhere, but it is really hard at Moria. Some call her Mother, says Eleni, whose own children are grown up. \u201cBecause they need a mother, they need someone.\u201d It is a really hard job, but not a thankless one. \u201cI get a lot of love from them,\u201d says Eleni, who is learning Farsi. \u201cOn Christmas Day, one boy gave me a pair of socks. I said: \u2018Why did you do that? It costs money.\u2019 He said: \u2018Because I know in your country, on Christmas, you give presents to the people that you love.\u2019\u201d This place was set up by a lovely local couple, Nikos Katsouris and Katerina Koveou. They turn up later and tell me how it came about. In 2014, Nikos, then a fisherman, was driving around with a van of fish to sell when he came across a group of refugees from Syria who had just landed. They were wet, tired and hungry; there was a pregnant woman and a boy of about 10, who was on his own. Shocked by what he saw, Nikos used the money he got from the fish to buy them food and gave the boy his jacket. When he got home and told Katerina, she got to work immediately, cooking for them. Then they set off to find them, with 40 homecooked meals and all the blankets and clothes they could lay their hands on. That first lot never got their dinner: they were detained by the police before Nikos and Katerina found them. But the couple found another boatload of arrivals to give it to. Ever since, they have been helping refugees, adapting to the changing needs of the situation. When Moria opened, they took sardines, bread, rice and vegetables to the camp and they fed hungry volunteers in their restaurant. Then they started to bring families from the camp to the restaurant. \u201cWe try to give back what others took from the people,\u201d Nikos says. \u201cThey took their lives, their smiles, their humanity, their dignity. These things we have here.\u201d It hasn\u2019t gone down well with the authorities. They have broken petty rules, such as that you are not allowed to be a charity and a restaurant at the same time. Nikos and Katerina have been fined a total of \u20ac47,800 (\u00a340,000). So they have given up the restaurant and are now solely an NGO, Home for All. They have refugees here every day, to eat, to learn to cook, to be at home, like the boys today. They cook and deliver food for the most vulnerable in the camp \u2013 minors and sick people. Katerina has had to accept that they can\u2019t help everyone. \u201cThis was my problem in the beginning \u2013 I wanted to help them all. But then I realised: \u2018If I do this, probably I am not going to help anyone.\u2019 You help those you can, and if you can do more, you do.\u201d Why do they do it? \u201cBecause we want to and because we can,\u201d she says. *** I return to Moria one more time, turning off the road where the police bus sits, up the dirt track that runs parallel to the perimeter fence, right into the Jungle. I am not going to Zekria\u2019s library this time, not yet, but to his school, to see one of his teachers. It has been more difficult for me to talk to women in the camp than to men, mostly because of culture and tradition. No problems with 19-year-old Azita Barekzai from Afghanistan, though. She is happy to chat. Her English is good; she is ambitious and wise (I hope that doesn\u2019t sound patronising). When I ask her something I have already asked, she tells me off: \u201cI told you!\u201d She doesn\u2019t want her photo taken, because she has a cold, but in the end she relents. I am glad there is a picture of Azita; like many of the people I meet in Moria, she is amazing. She got here seven months ago, with her parents and her three siblings. She is the oldest of the kids. The crossing was terrifying, \u201creally dangerous. I never thought we were going to survive.\u201d Then she was shocked by what they had come to in Moria. The usual issues \u2013 the cold, the rubbish, the fights, being too scared to leave the tent at night. It is especially horrible when it rains. \u201cYou cannot imagine how people tolerate it. Life is really difficult here.\u201d She wants to go to Switzerland, because she heard it accepts refugees and is beautiful. She would like to be a doctor. She has her papers already; she can travel, but the rest of her family hasn\u2019t been approved. They are still waiting. In the meantime, she is teaching English to kids in Zekria\u2019s school. \u201cI enjoy it a lot because I can make some people smile. I just want to make them laugh. I know that if someone laughs it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have problems. We need hope. Everyone \u2013 especially children \u2013 needs hope. We are really hopeless sometimes because of this bad situation. Maybe learning English gives them some hope for the future. They can go somewhere else better.\u201d It is time for the library\u2019s opening ceremony next door. There is a small gathering; someone has brought a basket of sweets and a red ribbon. Zekria says a few words, thanks the people who nailed the bits of wood together and attached the tarpaulins, and the book donors. Then, with a pair of scissors, he cuts the ribbon. Moria\u2019s library is, he declares, officially open. *** A couple of weeks later, back in my nice, safe, warm office, I WhatsApp Zekria to check a couple of things. First, he tells me that the pictures I took of the opening (Byron wasn\u2019t around at the time) were terrible. He is not wrong. Then he says his asylum application was rejected again. Fearing deportation, he and his family managed to get to mainland Greece, where they are staying in a squat. \u201cIt\u2019s cold, there is no electricity, it is the life of refugees,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate the fucking politics of the world.\u201d He has no money left and will try to find informal work, then perhaps try to cross a land border into Albania or North Macedonia. The library and the school in Moria are fine, he says. The team is running them; he is in touch regularly. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will speak later, my friend.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 February 2020. An earlier version mistakenly referred to \u201cMacedonia\u201d, a country which officially changed its name to North Macedonia in February 2019. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>It has become received wisdom among Westminster pundits that the new winning formula in politics is to \u201cmove left on economics and right on culture\u201d.

At the same time, Johnson\u2019s government has sent a series of clear signals to the right \u2013 on immigration, on perceived liberal bias at the BBC, on the \u201cfree-speech crisis\u201d in universities \u2013 the latest of which is the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/15/new-attorney-general-suella-braverman-in-controversial-buddhist-sect\" title=\"\">Suella Braverman</a> as attorney general.</p> <p>This suggests that the government intends to pursue the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/11/reckless-tory-pantomime-authoritarianism-thatcherism\" title=\"\">pantomime authoritarianism</a> displayed by the home secretary, Priti Patel, at last year\u2019s party conference: an ostentatious cruelty, directed at people who supposedly threaten public safety, and waved like a taunt to the liberal elite that stands in the government\u2019s way. Braverman comes from the hard-right milieu that has increasingly set the tone in the Conservative party since the EU referendum. Last year, she drew criticism from the Board of Deputies of British Jews and others for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/26/tory-mp-criticised-for-using-antisemitic-term-cultural-marxism\" title=\"\">saying</a> the right was engaged in \u201ca battle against cultural Marxism\u201d, echoing a conspiracy theory with antisemitic connotations that has made its way from the extremist fringe into the mainstream via websites such as Breitbart.</p> <p>But the problem is not so much careless language as the vision of our legal system held by Braverman, a former immigration lawyer who has represented the Home Office <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/former-immigration-lawyer-named-attorney-general/\" title=\"\">against claims of unlawful detention</a>. Writing last month <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2020/01/suella-braverman-people-we-elect-must-take-back-control-from-people-we-dont-who-include-the-judges.html\" title=\"\">for Conservative Home</a>, she argued that the concept of human rights had been \u201cstretched beyond recognition\u201d and that \u201celected decision-makers\u201d needed to \u201ctake back control\u201d from \u201ca small number of unelected, unaccountable judges\u201d once the UK had left the EU. (Her predecessor, Geoffrey Cox, had already suggested that judges considered for the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/geoffrey-cox-signals-would-accept-lead-role-review-judiciary\" title=\"\">be interviewed by MPs</a> before they are appointed.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The law may be a vital form of protection, but legal action cannot halt the rise of the right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The main target of Braverman\u2019s ire was judicial review, which allows individuals to challenge public bodies when they feel they have exercised their power unlawfully. In theory it exists to protect people with relatively little power \u2013 most of us, in other words \u2013 from being hurt by the actions of large and frequently unaccountable institutions. If the state denies you housing or puts you in immigration detention when it shouldn\u2019t, or charges you exorbitant sums of money to <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2017/07/tribunal-fees-victory/\" title=\"\">take your employer to court</a>, then judicial review is one of the ways you can try to stop it. Politicians such as Braverman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/11/what-is-judicial-review-and-why-doesnt-the-government-like-it\" title=\"\">dislike judicial review</a> because they think it has been expanded far beyond its original purpose \u2013 and become a political tool for activists who want to change government policy by undemocratic means.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why the right feels this way: the courts have become a primary arena for challenges to their power. Judicial review was one of the legal tools used by campaigners who wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/17/brexit-legal-challenge-government-two-weeks-respond\" title=\"\">stop or slow down Brexit</a>. It played an important role in the court battle that provoked the Daily Mail\u2019s notorious \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">Enemies of the people</a>\u201d front page in November 2016 \u2013 a case that centred on the question of whether the government had followed its own laws in its plans to trigger article 50.</p> <p>But liberals may wish to consider the outcome of that fight. Brexit has indeed gone ahead, thanks in part to a widespread public feeling, cultivated by the right, that critics of the process were attempting to frustrate democracy. The success of this message, which swept aside any remain victories in parliament and the courts, and helped deliver a giant Conservative majority, indicates the difficulties for those seeking to rein in the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/14/dominic-cummings-cabinet-reshuffle\">Dominic Cummings has started to believe he\u2019s cool. What can you say but, \u2018Ooooh\u2019? | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t just a problem in the UK. The failed impeachment of Donald Trump and the impending criminal trial of Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini for holding rescued migrants at sea both show the risk of backlash inherent in legal challenges to rightwing populism, however justified. Rightwing populists like to invoke a majoritarian conception of \u201cthe people\u201d, usually along exclusionary nationalist lines. They pose as its direct and exclusive voice, often in opposition to the checks and balances that exist to uphold the rule of law, or protect the rights of minorities and the vulnerable. Challenge them on this and they will inevitably portray their opponents as anti-democratic.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean they should go unchallenged. \u201cMove right on culture\u201d might sound like a relatively innocuous phrase, but the resulting policies have a real and devastating effect on other people\u2019s lives. The row this month over a deportation charter flight to Jamaica is an example. Britain stopped banishing its citizens in 1868, when it abolished the transportation of convicts to penal colonies in Australia. Over the past 15 years it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/17/champion-boxer-caught-in-britains-immigration-dragnet-kelvin-bilal-fawaz-operation-nexus\" title=\"\">reintroduced a de facto form of banishment</a> for people who are almost citizens but not quite: foreign nationals who have lived significant parts of their lives in the UK, who frequently hail from former British colonies, and who very often feel British even if their documents say otherwise. It is a cruel policy, particularly when it involves those who arrived in the UK as children, and one that disproportionately affects people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.</p> <p>On the face of it, the policy has strong public support, since the people deported are easily portrayed as having broken the rules: they have been convicted of crimes or fallen foul of immigration restrictions. But that support may be more fragile than it appears, since when people start to find out the details of who is being deported and why, the situation starts to look a lot more complex.</p> <p>The distinction between \u201ccitizen\u201d and \u201cforeigner\u201d has become less clear in recent decades, with large numbers of people living long-term in Britain on <a href=\"https://discoversociety.org/2016/10/04/deportation-and-multi-status-britain/\" title=\"\">various temporary and precarious forms of leave to remain</a>. When challenged on its deportation charter flights \u2013 there are several a year, to Jamaica, west Africa, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2013 the Home Office always claims that they are for serious criminals, such as rapists and drug dealers. Other, more sympathy-inducing cases can provoke an uproar, so the Home Office tries to maintain a veil of secrecy over the flights and to rush people on to planes, often breaking its own rules in the process.</p> <p>There was a rare public outcry over the scheduled deportation flight to Jamaica \u2013 in part because it took place before the long-awaited publication of a report into the lessons of the Windrush scandal, in which many long-term residents of the UK were wrongly deported to the Caribbean. Opposition came from prominent Labour MPs, human rights defenders and leftwing activists, and included an attempt to halt the flight via judicial review. It was partially successful: some of the passengers were removed because they had been denied mobile phone access in the preceding days and had been unable to contact their lawyers.</p> <p>Immediately, Downing Street briefed that Johnson was \u201cfurious\u201d, with his adviser Dominic Cummings reportedly calling the court\u2019s decision \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d and promising \u201curgent action on the farce that judicial review has become\u201d.</p> <p>Braverman is likely to agree. Even before the Tories fully embraced the culture war, many lawyers working on sensitive areas such as immigration preferred to build their cases without public fanfare \u2013 because of the risk that a media backlash could lead to further abridgement of legal rights.</p> <p>The law may be a vital form of protection, but it is not an escape from politics. Campaigners are right to use the courts to challenge this government\u2019s hostility to those who do not fit its vision of Britishness. But legal action cannot halt the rise of the right. That will require a longer political struggle \u2013 one that challenges the framing of the culture war, builds popular support and wins at the ballot box.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe</p>",

In theory it exists to protect people with relatively little power \u2013 most of us, in other words \u2013 from being hurt by the actions of large and frequently unaccountable institutions. If the state denies you housing or puts you in immigration detention when it shouldn\u2019t, or charges you exorbitant sums of money to take your employer to court, then judicial review is one of the ways you can try to stop it. Politicians such as Braverman dislike judicial review because they think it has been expanded far beyond its original purpose \u2013 and become a political tool for activists who want to change government policy by undemocratic means. It\u2019s not hard to see why the right feels this way: the courts have become a primary arena for challenges to their power. Judicial review was one of the legal tools used by campaigners who wanted to stop or slow down Brexit. It played an important role in the court battle that provoked the Daily Mail\u2019s notorious \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d front page in November 2016 \u2013 a case that centred on the question of whether the government had followed its own laws in its plans to trigger article 50. But liberals may wish to consider the outcome of that fight. Brexit has indeed gone ahead, thanks in part to a widespread public feeling, cultivated by the right, that critics of the process were attempting to frustrate democracy. The success of this message, which swept aside any remain victories in parliament and the courts, and helped deliver a giant Conservative majority, indicates the difficulties for those seeking to rein in the right. This isn\u2019t just a problem in the UK. The failed impeachment of Donald Trump and the impending criminal trial of Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini for holding rescued migrants at sea both show the risk of backlash inherent in legal challenges to rightwing populism, however justified. Rightwing populists like to invoke a majoritarian conception of \u201cthe people\u201d, usually along exclusionary nationalist lines. They pose as its direct and exclusive voice, often in opposition to the checks and balances that exist to uphold the rule of law, or protect the rights of minorities and the vulnerable. Challenge them on this and they will inevitably portray their opponents as anti-democratic. That doesn\u2019t mean they should go unchallenged. \u201cMove right on culture\u201d might sound like a relatively innocuous phrase, but the resulting policies have a real and devastating effect on other people\u2019s lives. The row this month over a deportation charter flight to Jamaica is an example. Britain stopped banishing its citizens in 1868, when it abolished the transportation of convicts to penal colonies in Australia. Over the past 15 years it has reintroduced a de facto form of banishment for people who are almost citizens but not quite: foreign nationals who have lived significant parts of their lives in the UK, who frequently hail from former British colonies, and who very often feel British even if their documents say otherwise. It is a cruel policy, particularly when it involves those who arrived in the UK as children, and one that disproportionately affects people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. On the face of it, the policy has strong public support, since the people deported are easily portrayed as having broken the rules: they have been convicted of crimes or fallen foul of immigration restrictions. But that support may be more fragile than it appears, since when people start to find out the details of who is being deported and why, the situation starts to look a lot more complex. The distinction between \u201ccitizen\u201d and \u201cforeigner\u201d has become less clear in recent decades, with large numbers of people living long-term in Britain on various temporary and precarious forms of leave to remain. When challenged on its deportation charter flights \u2013 there are several a year, to Jamaica, west Africa, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2013 the Home Office always claims that they are for serious criminals, such as rapists and drug dealers. Other, more sympathy-inducing cases can provoke an uproar, so the Home Office tries to maintain a veil of secrecy over the flights and to rush people on to planes, often breaking its own rules in the process. There was a rare public outcry over the scheduled deportation flight to Jamaica \u2013 in part because it took place before the long-awaited publication of a report into the lessons of the Windrush scandal, in which many long-term residents of the UK were wrongly deported to the Caribbean. Opposition came from prominent Labour MPs, human rights defenders and leftwing activists, and included an attempt to halt the flight via judicial review. It was partially successful: some of the passengers were removed because they had been denied mobile phone access in the preceding days and had been unable to contact their lawyers. Immediately, Downing Street briefed that Johnson was \u201cfurious\u201d, with his adviser Dominic Cummings reportedly calling the court\u2019s decision \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d and promising \u201curgent action on the farce that judicial review has become\u201d. Braverman is likely to agree. Even before the Tories fully embraced the culture war, many lawyers working on sensitive areas such as immigration preferred to build their cases without public fanfare \u2013 because of the risk that a media backlash could lead to further abridgement of legal rights. The law may be a vital form of protection, but it is not an escape from politics. Campaigners are right to use the courts to challenge this government\u2019s hostility to those who do not fit its vision of Britishness. But legal action cannot halt the rise of the right. That will require a longer political struggle \u2013 one that challenges the framing of the culture war, builds popular support and wins at the ballot box. \u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe",

Even online sales to addresses within the city limits have been stopped. Stores outside the city that dispatch e-cigarettes to an SF postcode will face prosecution.</p> <p>While vaping is banned, sales of legal marijuana and tobacco will continue as usual. San Francisco has often been considered more progressive than the rest of the US in its approach to drugs and unorthodox lifestyles: marijuana was legalised in California for medical use in 1996, after a campaign by Aids activists from the city, and for recreational use in 2016. Vaping, on the other hand, has crossed a line.</p> <p>Behind the outright ban on sales of e-cigarettes in San Francisco is a panic about teenagers vaping. More than one in four American teens have tried vaping, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1910739\" title=\"\">study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 12% of 16- and 17-year-olds were addicted to nicotine, and raised the alarm about the effect of nicotine on the adolescent brain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-enforcement-policy-unauthorized-flavored-cartridge-based-e-cigarettes-appeal-children\" title=\"\">described</a> the use of e-cigarettes as a \u201ccrisis among America\u2019s youth\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSan Francisco has never been afraid to lead. That will always be the case when the health of our children is on the line,\u201d announced the San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera in a statement after the ban was passed by the the city legislature last June. He was scathing about the FDA\u2019s failure to control e-cigarette sales. \u201cNow, youth vaping is an epidemic. If the federal government is not going to act to protect our kids, San Francisco will,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the UK, meanwhile, the medical establishment is endorsing vaping as an aid to giving up smoking. My local vape shop in London is colourful, thriving, offers a panoply of flavours and displays a banner the length of its storefront proclaiming: \u201cVaping is 97% safer than smoking, according to NHS and Cancer Research UK.\u201d (The correct figure is 95%, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review\" title=\"\">a report</a> in August 2015 by Public Health England, PHE, the government executive agency and watchdog that offers guidelines on health protection issues.)</p> <p>A transatlantic schism has opened up over vaping and health. In the US, the war on vaping is being pursued by activists, politicians and scientists who believe that tobacco companies are cynically promoting e-cigarettes as a means to get people addicted to nicotine, which will \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 lead them to cigarettes. In the UK, anti-smoking campaigners and health experts counter that for many adult smokers, vaping offers the best hope of avoiding a premature death.</p> <p>The two sides periodically break into open hostilities. The claim by PHE that vaping is 95% safer than smoking tobacco, frequently quoted by e-cigarette manufacturers and sellers, has been criticised as misleading by anti-smoking campaigners in the US. Matt Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington DC, the biggest anti-smoking organisation in the world, has called the 95%-safer figure \u201cmere fiction\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Ann McNeill of King\u2019s College London, a tobacco and addiction expert who advises PHE, defends its position. \u201cWe are battling against misinformation on a massive scale,\u201d she says. McNeill acknowledges there has been a rise in vaping among kids in the US and Canada, but does not see it as a reason for panic. \u201cI don\u2019t think it merits discussion of an \u2018epidemic\u2019. That word is overblown,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The soaring popularity of vaping among the young in the US is largely down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine\" title=\"\">Juul</a> \u2013 a tiny black or chrome device that looks like a USB stick and fits into the palm of the hand. In 2004, two design graduate students came up with the idea for an electronic alternative to smoking. They launched Juul in 2015, which quickly defined the market; by July 2019, Juul accounted for 75% of US e-cigarette sales. Since then, its fortunes have taken a dive. The company is accused, in dozens of lawsuits from San Diego to New York City, of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/juul-vaping-lawsuit.html\" title=\"\">targeting young</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/juul-vaping-lawsuit.html\" title=\"\"> users</a> via social media campaigns featuring youthful models. Opponents claim Juul pods are easier for novice vapers to inhale, since they contain nicotine salts instead of straight nicotine, further softened with teen-friendly flavourings such as mango, cool cucumber and creme brulee. Juul has repeatedly denied it has marketed to teens.</p> <p>There was fresh alarm in the US last year when 2,500 cases of lung disease and 55 deaths were associated with vaping. E-cigarettes work by heating liquid containing nicotine to produce vapour, which is then inhaled. There is no smoke or tar involved, but there are small amounts of chemical flavourings, including diacetyl, which has been linked to lung disease, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. If the e-liquid overheats, formaldehyde can be formed. In fact, none of these chemicals were to blame in these cases \u2013 it turned out that the people who fell ill were using bootleg devices containing cannabis \u2013 but the reputational damage was done.</p> <p>In the wake of this alarming spate of hospitalisations and deaths, the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, took emergency action in September, attempting to ban flavoured e-cigarette products. President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/11/vaping-flavored-e-cigarettes-fda-ban-trump\" title=\"\">entered the fray</a>, telling the FDA to act and imposing a temporary ban on any flavours that might appeal to young people. In December, New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed a law banning flavours. \u201cManufacturers of fruit and candy-flavoured e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people,\u201d said Cuomo, citing flavours including bubblegum, cotton candy and Captain Crunch. The state ban was overturned in January 2020 by Justice Catherine Cholakis, who said it was an overreach.</p> <p>In the UK, the NHS continues to edge as close as it can to approving the use of e-cigarettes to quit smoking. NHS hospitals in the West Midlands have sanctioned vape stores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vape-shops-hospital-smokers-kick-habit-west-midlands\" title=\"\">on the premises</a>, while PHE launched, via YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RisBe5sLGPc\" title=\"\">a video</a> showing two white-coated experts with bell jars demonstrating how e-cigarettes are free of all the disgusting and damaging tar in a conventional cigarette.</p> <p>The science is furiously disputed. Academics on both sides are accused of cherry-picking data to suit their own prejudices. PHE is a global authority on health issues such as vaccination and obesity, but on vaping, it is looking increasingly isolated. Deborah Arnott, head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) in the UK, says that Britain is losing ground in the e-cigarette debate because of the virulent campaign in the US against vaping. \u201cThe noise is causing problems in how we are perceived,\u201d Arnott said. \u201cWe\u2019re being written off.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>What should be settled by science has become a clash of faiths. In the US, the debate is dominated by those who believe people should \u201cjust say no\u201d to drugs. In the UK, there is more support for the idea of \u201charm reduction\u201d, in which addicts take controlled amounts of their drug, be it alcohol, heroin or in this case, nicotine, to keep them stable.</p> <p>PHE\u2019s support for e-cigarettes as a tool to help people quit smoking is shared by other respected health bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Cancer Research UK. They point out that the UK regulates smoking and vaping far more rigorously than the US. The UK has rules on age, and health warnings, and caps on the nicotine content. Marketing to young people is forbidden \u2013 e-cigarettes cannot be advertised on TV. There is less nicotine in Juul pods or e-cigarette cartridges sold in the UK: Juul in the US contains up to 59mg per ml, while nicotine levels in e-cigarettes across Europe are capped at 20mg per ml by an EU directive enshrined in British law. In the US, at this point, there is no middle ground between unrestricted sales and an outright ban.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71eeb5d85dcb780d643d7b2d94316f769880679f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71eeb5d85dcb780d643d7b2d94316f769880679f/125_0_1423_854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from PHE\u2019s video demonstrating how vapes are free from the tar and damaging substances found in cigarettes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from PHE\u2019s video demonstrating how vapes are free from the tar and damaging substances found in cigarettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PHE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All sides agree that vaping nicotine is safer than getting it from cigarettes. Nicotine by itself is \u201crelatively harmless\u201d, according to the NHS, while the harm from cigarettes is in the smoke produced by burning tobacco and the residue of tar it leaves, which damages the airways, causing lung disease and cancer.</p> <p>\u201cPeople smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar,\u201d wrote Michael Russell, a professor in addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and a pioneer of harm reduction, in 1976. His work laid the foundations for the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy \u2013 the nicotine patches and gum the NHS hands out today.</p> <p>Russell, who died in 2009, wanted to develop a low-tar cigarette that would be high in nicotine, to give smokers the hit they wanted without inhaling more deeply. His research on the low tar product was funded by the tobacco company RJ Reynolds, now owned by British American Tobacco (BAT). This relationship with a tobacco company, which Russell later claimed was normal practice at the time, is now seen as fatally compromising. It has since been used to undermine his research and attack his reputation.</p> <p>Ann McNeill, who worked with Russell as a young researcher, believes he was ahead of his time. \u201cHis pioneering research improved the quality of life of smokers and saved the lives of many more,\u201d she said in a paper celebrating Russell, co-written with Debbie Robson of the UK Centre for Tobacco &amp; Alcohol Studies. \u201cIt is a sad indictment of our community that his work is still not recognised adequately by all those working in tobacco control, some of whom still fail to recognise the centrality of nicotine in tobacco use and the implications of this.\u201d</p> <p>Anti-tobacco activists \u2013 whether they are for or against e-cigarettes \u2013 believe they are defending the gains they have made in the battle against smoking. Vaping\u2019s defenders say the tobacco firms are diversifying into a product that won\u2019t kill their customer base. Hardline opponents are convinced e-cigarette sales will keep the hated tobacco companies in business.</p> <p>The major tobacco companies \u2013 Philip Morris, Imperial, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco \u2013 did not take long to realise the potential of e-cigarettes, and all are now players in the vaping business. Blu, launched in the US in 2009 by an Australian entrepreneur, was bought by Lorillard Tobacco, and later acquired by the British company Imperial. In 2013, BAT launched Vype. In 2015, RJ Reynolds, makers of Camel and Lucky Strike, produced Vuse, which was the most popular brand in the US before Juul came along. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, acquired a 35% stake in Juul.</p> <p>Most scientists and health campaigners in the US will have no dealings with the tobacco industry, because of its history of devious marketing practices and underhand tactics. Under the terms of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty in the early 00s, governments agree not to have any discussions with tobacco industry representatives (over trade terms, for example, taxation, regulation or investment). But anti-smoking campaigners now fear that, by promoting the benefit of their e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, tobacco companies are acquiring respectability. WHO shares that anxiety and has advised measures to control e-cigarettes. Many countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore, the Seychelles and Uruguay, have banned e-cigarettes as a result, while others have imposed regulations limiting their use.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A number of health professionals and academics have dedicated their careers to exposing lies about the safety of tobacco products and stopping the promotion of cigarettes around the world. Recent hard-won victories include smoking bans in public spaces and plain packaging with severe health warnings. Despite their efforts, there are still over 1 billion smokers in the world. The global cigarette market was worth $888bn (\u00a3682bn) in 2018 and forecast to rise to $1,124bn by 2024. </p> <p>Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine at the Center for Tobacco Control, Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco, is the loudest of the anti-tobacco lobbyists \u2013 in his choice of Hawaiian shirts as well as his pronouncements. Glantz claims he was agnostic when e-cigarettes first appeared. He isn\u2019t now. In December, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/profglantz/status/1078439444644917248?lang=en\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cUsing e-cigs increases exposure to toxic chemicals for most users; they would be better off just smoking.\u201d</p> <p>This was a new extreme, even for Glantz. Alex Berezow, vice-president of scientific affairs at the American Council on Science and Health, described the tweet as \u201cmind-boggling\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, Dr Glantz has become something of an ideologue. His (justifiable) animosity toward the tobacco industry has been turned (unjustifiably) to other industries, such as vaping,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/12/28/stanton-glantz-says-vapers-should-smoke-cigarettes-instead-13690\" title=\"\">wrote</a> on his blog. The research paper that had prompted Glantz\u2019s tweet, Berezow pointed out, actually shows that e-cigarette users get less exposure to toxic chemicals than tobacco smokers \u2013 not more.</p> <p>Glantz, who you have to interrupt if you want to ask a question, told me that in the tweet, he was talking about dual-users \u2013 people who are both smoking and vaping. \u201cMaybe it was worded inarticulately,\u201d he conceded. But he won\u2019t back down. He claims the evidence suggests that most people are dual users (in the UK, about a third of vapers are still smoking as well, according to a <a href=\"https://ash.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Use-of-e-cigarettes-among-adults-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">survey</a> by YouGov).</p> <p>A giant in the anti-tobacco lobby, Glantz does not understand how researchers he respects can support vaping. Glantz claims that confidence in e-cigarettes, at PHE and among the UK scientists who condone it, is starting to crack. He is convinced the \u201c95% safer\u201d figure is wrong. It came from a paper published in 2014 by a group of experts led by David Nutt \u2013 the former government drugs adviser famous in the UK for declaring that ecstasy and LSD were safer than alcohol, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked\" title=\"\">led to</a> his sacking.</p> <p>\u201cThe Nutt paper had no evidence whatsoever. It was 12 guys who sat around and pulled that number out of the air,\u201d said Glantz. \u201cThe most generous thing you can say about that paper is that it was much earlier in the process and there wasn\u2019t a lot of evidence out there.\u201d He believes the credibility of Nutt\u2019s group has been undermined by revelations that they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/28/public-health-england-under-fire-for-saying-e-cigarettes-are-95-safer\" title=\"\">part-funded</a> by a consultancy called EuroSwiss Health, run by Delon Human, a South African doctor who has accepted funding from BAT for some of his ventures.</p> <p>Nutt says that\u2019s nonsense. The group comprised 12 world experts. \u201cHas [Glantz] ever read the paper?\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 14 variables in that paper [possible harms, such as death from cancer]. It looks at the effect of 12 different forms of nicotine on 14 variables. And I bet he wouldn\u2019t actually disagree with any of them.\u201d He gives an example. \u201cDoes he actually think that tobacco is not much more harmful than vaping on the likelihood of lung cancer?\u201d The paper, he said, \u201ccomes up with an answer he doesn\u2019t want. That\u2019s why he thinks it\u2019s bad science.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nutt, a professor in neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, says he is \u201csaddened\u201d by Glantz\u2019s attacks. \u201cHe was a hero of mine. He was one of the pioneers in demolishing the myth that tobacco wasn\u2019t addictive and opposing the fraud and misinformation and lies of the tobacco industry. But the problem is he is still basically playing the same tune and we\u2019re now in a different era.\u201d It\u2019s proven impossible to stop people selling tobacco, Nutt said. \u201cSo the anti-tobacco people have got to attack something else, because that\u2019s what they do \u2013 they attack and they ban. So basically they\u2019ve fixed their wagons against vaping because it is one thing they can ban, and they\u2019re very successful. It\u2019s laughable that in India people go to prison for selling vaping when the government allows advertising of tobacco.\u201d</p> <p>Glantz became an icon of the anti-tobacco movement after he received 4,000 leaked documents from Brown and Williamson, then the US\u2019s third-biggest tobacco company, in 1994. They proved the industry knew that smoking caused cancer and had hidden it. Since then, Glantz has always objected vigorously to any compromise with the industry. In 1997, a deal was broached with the tobacco industry by Matt Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It would have brought in tight federal regulatory control of cigarettes, prohibiting the sort of advertising and marketing that is still ubiquitous in the US, as well as sales to children. But Glantz was opposed to any deal that would allow cigarette manufacturers to continue in business. His goal was to close them down altogether. Myers was stymied by his own allies, and the US still does not have the anti-tobacco regulations that are common in Europe.</p> <p>Myers is calm and quietly authoritative. He is not against harm reduction, he says. Nor are other public health bodies such as the American Cancer Society or the American Heart Association. \u201cAll of us have said that under appropriate circumstances, if e-cigarettes are shown to actually significantly help smokers quit or switch completely, and that there are rules in place to prevent them being marketed in a way that doesn\u2019t unduly impact youth, we would be supportive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Up until now, on a national level, the US has had no regulatory control of e-cigarette sales, marketing, minimum age, or limits on nicotine content. \u201cIt\u2019s the wild west,\u201d said Myers. Tobacco-Free Kids has brought legal action against the FDA over its failure to regulate e-cigarette use and last year won a ruling from a federal judge that there was no excuse for further delay. The e-cigarette companies are irresponsible too, Myers added.</p> <p>Myers says both sides in the argument interpret scientific studies according to their prior beliefs. He describes PHE\u2019s \u201c95% safer\u201d figure as worthless, because not enough research has been done. \u201cI have very little doubt that e-cigarettes under appropriate circumstances are significantly less harmful to a smoker. Do we know exactly how much less harmful? The answer is no, because we have no clue how much nicotine it is delivering, how pure they are, what else they\u2019re putting in them. Comparing it to the most lethal product ever created, for public relations purposes, is not helpful.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March 2018, Myers and Glantz, as well as representatives of PHE and almost every other influential anti-smoking scientist or campaigner, attended the World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Cape Town \u2013 just up the road from BAT\u2019s South Africa HQ. At this meeting, held every two years, activists can discuss the perfidy of the industry, celebrate their successes and plan for the future.</p> <p>Nobody connected with the tobacco industry is allowed in the building. The WHO\u2019s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005, lays down recommended anti-smoking measures for governments, from taxing cigarettes to marketing controls and smoking bans in enclosed public places. It has been signed by 168 countries (the US is a notable exception). <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/WHO_FCTC_english.pdf\">The Framework document says </a>governments \u201cneed to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts\u201d and must limit their contact to the absolute minimum. Activists now take this to mean there must be an impenetrable wall between themselves and anyone in any way connected with tobacco.</p> <p>The man who did as much as anyone to establish the Framework Convention while an executive director of WHO, Derek Yach \u2013 originally from Cape Town but now based in the US \u2013 finds himself on the wrong side of that wall. Yach was pointedly excluded from the conference in his home city \u2013 and yet much of the conversation was about him. Yach had done the unthinkable: accepting almost $1bn over 12 years from Philip Morris, makers of Marlboro and other leading brands, to set up his Foundation for a Smokefree World in New York in 2017 to fund research into alternatives to tobacco.</p> <p>As part of its commitment to a \u201csmokefree future\u201d, Philip Morris International is heavily promoting its e-cigarettes and Iqos, a cigar-shaped electronic device designed to heat, rather than burn, tobacco. \u201cThese products will one day replace cigarettes,\u201d it says on its website, claiming to be moving on from tobacco products because \u201csociety expects us to act responsibly\u201d. Iqos has taken off in Japan, where 3 million people regularly use them. Smoking there was declining by 2% a year before Iqos arrived, and is now dropping by 10% per year, for which Philip Morris International claims the credit.</p> <p>Yach believes it\u2019s in the tobacco companies\u2019 interests to develop products that will leave conventional cigarettes behind. His erstwhile colleagues believe he is working for the devil. Why, they ask, does Philip Morris still sell cigarettes if it cares about the world\u2019s health?</p> <p>As rumours circulated that Yach was in the building or lurking outside, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York and funder of vast amounts of anti-tobacco science and programmes, was launching his own campaign. Striding down the hallway, flanked by purple banners emblazoned with the words Bloomberg Philanthropies, the financial backer of the conference and his entourage made their way to the TV cameras to discuss his Stop initiative. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/michael-bloomberg-launches-tobacco-industry-watchdog\" title=\"\">announced</a> he has set aside $20m to counter the lies of the tobacco industry. Top of the watch list was Yach\u2019s Foundation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df77f11cc681ffa4b9968b8a83e944f78ed5877b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df77f11cc681ffa4b9968b8a83e944f78ed5877b/219_78_3281_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney general Letitia James announces a lawsuit by the state of New York against e-cigarette maker Juul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney general Letitia James announces a lawsuit by the state of New York against e-cigarette maker Juul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bloomberg helps pay for WHO\u2019s work on tobacco. I was offered a five-minute audience \u2013 just long enough to ask if he thinks there\u2019s a role for e-cigarettes in combating smoking. \u201cIt is like marijuana: one of the stupid things we\u2019re doing is legalising it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s no place for e-cigarettes. I think it\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d</p> <p>Yach claims that \u201cA-grade scientists and researchers around the world\u201d are picking up grants from his foundation and doing useful work, but few believe he can succeed. He admits he was taken aback by the strength of feeling. \u201cI wasn\u2019t completely naive about it, but I didn\u2019t actually appreciate how harsh it would be, particularly from a pretty small bunch of people who have incredible influence at WHO,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Clive Bates, the former head of the UK\u2019s Ash, who blogs and campaigns for e-cigarettes from his home in Nigeria \u2013 he is married to the British High Commissioner \u2013 said he was amazed by the anti-vaping anger in Cape Town. \u201cIt was like a cult, almost,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly the attacks on the foundation. It\u2019s quite an achievement for Derek to create an institution that has a worse reputation than Philip Morris.\u201d</p> <p>However, Robert West, a professor of health psychology and director of tobacco studies at UCL, says: \u201cIt is playing out beautifully [for Philip Morris]. [The Foundation] has got the tobacco control community arguing among itself and divided. Result.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the UK, a small number of prominent public health academics vehemently oppose e-cigarettes. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool, believe the tobacco companies are using e-cigarettes as a route back to respectability. Sally Davies, until recently the UK\u2019s chief medical officer (the most senior government adviser on public health matters), backs a ban on flavours that might attract children. She\u2019s worried that we don\u2019t know the long-term health effects of vaping, which she described as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d.</p> <p>Ann McNeill says there is not much growth in vaping among kids in the UK. Her key concern would be a rise in vaping among young people who have never smoked, but there\u2019s no sign of that. She thinks the key to reducing youth uptake is \u201cgetting adult smoking down\u201d, because young people tend to imitate their elders\u2019 behaviour. </p> <p>She feels she and her colleagues at PHE have been unfairly attacked for saying vaping is 95% safer than smoking tobacco. She points out that they never said it was <em>harmless</em>. A 5% risk of harm, she insisted, \u201cis not an insubstantial number\u201d. She feels that the statement has been twisted as if PHE had said vaping was completely safe.</p> <p>There is evidence that smoking is going down as e-cigarette use goes up, both in the UK and in the US. In 1942, 82% of British men smoked. By 2006, when e-cigarettes first appeared, 22% of adults in England smoked. The number of smokers is now at an all-time low of 14.7%, while 7% of the UK population are vaping regularly. Bans on smoking in public places, no-logo cigarette packaging with gruesome pictures of tumours, and the removal of cigarettes from sight in shops have all had an impact, but, McNeill says: \u201cAll the evidence, I believe, points to e-cigarettes playing a role.\u201d</p> <p>The best evidence that vaping helps people stop smoking comes from a study showing that e-cigarettes double the quitting success rate compared to gum or other aids. Peter Hajek from Queen Mary University of London and colleagues carried out the trial among more than 880 people who went to the NHS for help to give up smoking. Half were given nicotine replacement therapy in whatever form they wanted, such as patches or gum. The other half were given a starter e-cigarette kit and encouraged to buy their own when it ran out. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2019, showed that, at a year, the quit rate in the e-cigarette group was twice that of the nicotine replacement group, 18% versus 9.9%.</p> <p>Of course, it did not satisfy the critics. When the researchers went back to the subjects after a year, most of the e-cigarette group were still vaping, whereas few of the ex-smokers in the other group were still chewing gum. So, they insisted, the study showed just how addictive e-cigarettes are.</p> <p>Juul, once the leading e-cigarette, is struggling against public outrage and bad press. Sales have dropped and hundreds of staff have been laid off. The company said to be worth $38bn in 2018 was written down to $24bn by Altria in October last year, and valued at just $19bn by one of its major investors, Tiger Global Management, in December.</p> <p>In the storm over child users, and anticipating an FDA ban, Juul stopped selling its fruit medley and mango flavours in the US in October and even dropped mint the following month. In January, the FDA acted, banning all flavours except tobacco and menthol from e-cigarettes that use a cartridge \u2013 as the Juul devices do. These are the devices kids use, said the FDA: flavours will not be banned from the refillable e-cigarettes that are more popular with adults. The FDA is also finally getting going on regulation, and has instructed manufacturers of e-cigarettes to apply for a right to trade by May.</p> <p>The WHO, taking its cue from the US and from Bloomberg, has advised countries to control vaping, warning about the unknown impact on health and stating that e-cigarettes are risky for teenage brains, as well as for the foetus. That may leave the UK isolated, a lone bastion where (highly regulated) vaping is actually encouraged in the hopes of cutting smoking rates. Many public health experts in the UK believe they are witnessing an unnecessary tragedy, and that failure to promote the most promising method of helping people quit smoking is endangering the lives of millions.</p> <p>McNeill insists public health experts in the UK do care about young people. But those whose lives are at risk are adults living in disadvantaged communities, who cannot kick their smoking habit. \u201cI have lived with smokers and watched smokers die. You want them to do anything they can to prevent them from smoking.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2020: to clarify that Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA and that Iqos is a product of Philip Morris International and to correct an error in attributing a quote from the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gone With the Smoke is already no more than a distant whiff of bubblegum-flavoured vapour. The vape shop and lounge, one of many in San Francisco, has been forced to close. So have Vapor Den (\u201ceclectic lounge &amp; hipster go-to\u201d) and Happy Vape. From late January, it became illegal to sell e-cigarettes and e-liquids in San Francisco. Even online sales to addresses within the city limits have been stopped. Stores outside the city that dispatch e-cigarettes to an SF postcode will face prosecution. While vaping is banned, sales of legal marijuana and tobacco will continue as usual. San Francisco has often been considered more progressive than the rest of the US in its approach to drugs and unorthodox lifestyles: marijuana was legalised in California for medical use in 1996, after a campaign by Aids activists from the city, and for recreational use in 2016. Vaping, on the other hand, has crossed a line. Behind the outright ban on sales of e-cigarettes in San Francisco is a panic about teenagers vaping. More than one in four American teens have tried vaping, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 12% of 16- and 17-year-olds were addicted to nicotine, and raised the alarm about the effect of nicotine on the adolescent brain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently described the use of e-cigarettes as a \u201ccrisis among America\u2019s youth\u201d. \u201cSan Francisco has never been afraid to lead. That will always be the case when the health of our children is on the line,\u201d announced the San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera in a statement after the ban was passed by the the city legislature last June. He was scathing about the FDA\u2019s failure to control e-cigarette sales. \u201cNow, youth vaping is an epidemic. If the federal government is not going to act to protect our kids, San Francisco will,\u201d he said. In the UK, meanwhile, the medical establishment is endorsing vaping as an aid to giving up smoking. My local vape shop in London is colourful, thriving, offers a panoply of flavours and displays a banner the length of its storefront proclaiming: \u201cVaping is 97% safer than smoking, according to NHS and Cancer Research UK.\u201d (The correct figure is 95%, according to a report in August 2015 by Public Health England, PHE, the government executive agency and watchdog that offers guidelines on health protection issues.) A transatlantic schism has opened up over vaping and health. In the US, the war on vaping is being pursued by activists, politicians and scientists who believe that tobacco companies are cynically promoting e-cigarettes as a means to get people addicted to nicotine, which will \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 lead them to cigarettes. In the UK, anti-smoking campaigners and health experts counter that for many adult smokers, vaping offers the best hope of avoiding a premature death. The two sides periodically break into open hostilities. The claim by PHE that vaping is 95% safer than smoking tobacco, frequently quoted by e-cigarette manufacturers and sellers, has been criticised as misleading by anti-smoking campaigners in the US. Matt Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington DC, the biggest anti-smoking organisation in the world, has called the 95%-safer figure \u201cmere fiction\u201d. Prof Ann McNeill of King\u2019s College London, a tobacco and addiction expert who advises PHE, defends its position. \u201cWe are battling against misinformation on a massive scale,\u201d she says. McNeill acknowledges there has been a rise in vaping among kids in the US and Canada, but does not see it as a reason for panic. \u201cI don\u2019t think it merits discussion of an \u2018epidemic\u2019. That word is overblown,\u201d she said. The soaring popularity of vaping among the young in the US is largely down to Juul \u2013 a tiny black or chrome device that looks like a USB stick and fits into the palm of the hand. In 2004, two design graduate students came up with the idea for an electronic alternative to smoking. They launched Juul in 2015, which quickly defined the market; by July 2019, Juul accounted for 75% of US e-cigarette sales. Since then, its fortunes have taken a dive. The company is accused, in dozens of lawsuits from San Diego to New York City, of targeting young users via social media campaigns featuring youthful models. Opponents claim Juul pods are easier for novice vapers to inhale, since they contain nicotine salts instead of straight nicotine, further softened with teen-friendly flavourings such as mango, cool cucumber and creme brulee. Juul has repeatedly denied it has marketed to teens. There was fresh alarm in the US last year when 2,500 cases of lung disease and 55 deaths were associated with vaping. E-cigarettes work by heating liquid containing nicotine to produce vapour, which is then inhaled. There is no smoke or tar involved, but there are small amounts of chemical flavourings, including diacetyl, which has been linked to lung disease, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. If the e-liquid overheats, formaldehyde can be formed. In fact, none of these chemicals were to blame in these cases \u2013 it turned out that the people who fell ill were using bootleg devices containing cannabis \u2013 but the reputational damage was done. In the wake of this alarming spate of hospitalisations and deaths, the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, took emergency action in September, attempting to ban flavoured e-cigarette products. President Trump entered the fray, telling the FDA to act and imposing a temporary ban on any flavours that might appeal to young people. In December, New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed a law banning flavours. \u201cManufacturers of fruit and candy-flavoured e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people,\u201d said Cuomo, citing flavours including bubblegum, cotton candy and Captain Crunch. The state ban was overturned in January 2020 by Justice Catherine Cholakis, who said it was an overreach. In the UK, the NHS continues to edge as close as it can to approving the use of e-cigarettes to quit smoking. NHS hospitals in the West Midlands have sanctioned vape stores on the premises, while PHE launched, via YouTube, a video showing two white-coated experts with bell jars demonstrating how e-cigarettes are free of all the disgusting and damaging tar in a conventional cigarette. The science is furiously disputed. Academics on both sides are accused of cherry-picking data to suit their own prejudices. PHE is a global authority on health issues such as vaccination and obesity, but on vaping, it is looking increasingly isolated. Deborah Arnott, head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) in the UK, says that Britain is losing ground in the e-cigarette debate because of the virulent campaign in the US against vaping. \u201cThe noise is causing problems in how we are perceived,\u201d Arnott said. \u201cWe\u2019re being written off.\u201d * * * What should be settled by science has become a clash of faiths. In the US, the debate is dominated by those who believe people should \u201cjust say no\u201d to drugs. In the UK, there is more support for the idea of \u201charm reduction\u201d, in which addicts take controlled amounts of their drug, be it alcohol, heroin or in this case, nicotine, to keep them stable. PHE\u2019s support for e-cigarettes as a tool to help people quit smoking is shared by other respected health bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Cancer Research UK. They point out that the UK regulates smoking and vaping far more rigorously than the US. The UK has rules on age, and health warnings, and caps on the nicotine content. Marketing to young people is forbidden \u2013 e-cigarettes cannot be advertised on TV. There is less nicotine in Juul pods or e-cigarette cartridges sold in the UK: Juul in the US contains up to 59mg per ml, while nicotine levels in e-cigarettes across Europe are capped at 20mg per ml by an EU directive enshrined in British law. In the US, at this point, there is no middle ground between unrestricted sales and an outright ban. All sides agree that vaping nicotine is safer than getting it from cigarettes. Nicotine by itself is \u201crelatively harmless\u201d, according to the NHS, while the harm from cigarettes is in the smoke produced by burning tobacco and the residue of tar it leaves, which damages the airways, causing lung disease and cancer. \u201cPeople smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar,\u201d wrote Michael Russell, a professor in addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and a pioneer of harm reduction, in 1976. His work laid the foundations for the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy \u2013 the nicotine patches and gum the NHS hands out today. Russell, who died in 2009, wanted to develop a low-tar cigarette that would be high in nicotine, to give smokers the hit they wanted without inhaling more deeply. His research on the low tar product was funded by the tobacco company RJ Reynolds, now owned by British American Tobacco (BAT). This relationship with a tobacco company, which Russell later claimed was normal practice at the time, is now seen as fatally compromising. It has since been used to undermine his research and attack his reputation. Ann McNeill, who worked with Russell as a young researcher, believes he was ahead of his time. \u201cHis pioneering research improved the quality of life of smokers and saved the lives of many more,\u201d she said in a paper celebrating Russell, co-written with Debbie Robson of the UK Centre for Tobacco &amp; Alcohol Studies. \u201cIt is a sad indictment of our community that his work is still not recognised adequately by all those working in tobacco control, some of whom still fail to recognise the centrality of nicotine in tobacco use and the implications of this.\u201d Anti-tobacco activists \u2013 whether they are for or against e-cigarettes \u2013 believe they are defending the gains they have made in the battle against smoking. Vaping\u2019s defenders say the tobacco firms are diversifying into a product that won\u2019t kill their customer base. Hardline opponents are convinced e-cigarette sales will keep the hated tobacco companies in business. The major tobacco companies \u2013 Philip Morris, Imperial, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco \u2013 did not take long to realise the potential of e-cigarettes, and all are now players in the vaping business. Blu, launched in the US in 2009 by an Australian entrepreneur, was bought by Lorillard Tobacco, and later acquired by the British company Imperial. In 2013, BAT launched Vype. In 2015, RJ Reynolds, makers of Camel and Lucky Strike, produced Vuse, which was the most popular brand in the US before Juul came along. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, acquired a 35% stake in Juul. Most scientists and health campaigners in the US will have no dealings with the tobacco industry, because of its history of devious marketing practices and underhand tactics. Under the terms of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty in the early 00s, governments agree not to have any discussions with tobacco industry representatives (over trade terms, for example, taxation, regulation or investment). But anti-smoking campaigners now fear that, by promoting the benefit of their e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, tobacco companies are acquiring respectability. WHO shares that anxiety and has advised measures to control e-cigarettes. Many countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore, the Seychelles and Uruguay, have banned e-cigarettes as a result, while others have imposed regulations limiting their use. * * * A number of health professionals and academics have dedicated their careers to exposing lies about the safety of tobacco products and stopping the promotion of cigarettes around the world. Recent hard-won victories include smoking bans in public spaces and plain packaging with severe health warnings. Despite their efforts, there are still over 1 billion smokers in the world. The global cigarette market was worth $888bn (\u00a3682bn) in 2018 and forecast to rise to $1,124bn by 2024. Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine at the Center for Tobacco Control, Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco, is the loudest of the anti-tobacco lobbyists \u2013 in his choice of Hawaiian shirts as well as his pronouncements. Glantz claims he was agnostic when e-cigarettes first appeared. He isn\u2019t now. In December, he tweeted: \u201cUsing e-cigs increases exposure to toxic chemicals for most users; they would be better off just smoking.\u201d This was a new extreme, even for Glantz. Alex Berezow, vice-president of scientific affairs at the American Council on Science and Health, described the tweet as \u201cmind-boggling\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, Dr Glantz has become something of an ideologue. His (justifiable) animosity toward the tobacco industry has been turned (unjustifiably) to other industries, such as vaping,\u201d he wrote on his blog. The research paper that had prompted Glantz\u2019s tweet, Berezow pointed out, actually shows that e-cigarette users get less exposure to toxic chemicals than tobacco smokers \u2013 not more. Glantz, who you have to interrupt if you want to ask a question, told me that in the tweet, he was talking about dual-users \u2013 people who are both smoking and vaping. \u201cMaybe it was worded inarticulately,\u201d he conceded. But he won\u2019t back down. He claims the evidence suggests that most people are dual users (in the UK, about a third of vapers are still smoking as well, according to a survey by YouGov). A giant in the anti-tobacco lobby, Glantz does not understand how researchers he respects can support vaping. Glantz claims that confidence in e-cigarettes, at PHE and among the UK scientists who condone it, is starting to crack. He is convinced the \u201c95% safer\u201d figure is wrong. It came from a paper published in 2014 by a group of experts led by David Nutt \u2013 the former government drugs adviser famous in the UK for declaring that ecstasy and LSD were safer than alcohol, which led to his sacking. \u201cThe Nutt paper had no evidence whatsoever. It was 12 guys who sat around and pulled that number out of the air,\u201d said Glantz. \u201cThe most generous thing you can say about that paper is that it was much earlier in the process and there wasn\u2019t a lot of evidence out there.\u201d He believes the credibility of Nutt\u2019s group has been undermined by revelations that they were part-funded by a consultancy called EuroSwiss Health, run by Delon Human, a South African doctor who has accepted funding from BAT for some of his ventures. Nutt says that\u2019s nonsense. The group comprised 12 world experts. \u201cHas [Glantz] ever read the paper?\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 14 variables in that paper [possible harms, such as death from cancer]. It looks at the effect of 12 different forms of nicotine on 14 variables. And I bet he wouldn\u2019t actually disagree with any of them.\u201d He gives an example. \u201cDoes he actually think that tobacco is not much more harmful than vaping on the likelihood of lung cancer?\u201d The paper, he said, \u201ccomes up with an answer he doesn\u2019t want. That\u2019s why he thinks it\u2019s bad science.\u201d Nutt, a professor in neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, says he is \u201csaddened\u201d by Glantz\u2019s attacks. \u201cHe was a hero of mine. He was one of the pioneers in demolishing the myth that tobacco wasn\u2019t addictive and opposing the fraud and misinformation and lies of the tobacco industry. But the problem is he is still basically playing the same tune and we\u2019re now in a different era.\u201d It\u2019s proven impossible to stop people selling tobacco, Nutt said. \u201cSo the anti-tobacco people have got to attack something else, because that\u2019s what they do \u2013 they attack and they ban. So basically they\u2019ve fixed their wagons against vaping because it is one thing they can ban, and they\u2019re very successful. It\u2019s laughable that in India people go to prison for selling vaping when the government allows advertising of tobacco.\u201d Glantz became an icon of the anti-tobacco movement after he received 4,000 leaked documents from Brown and Williamson, then the US\u2019s third-biggest tobacco company, in 1994. They proved the industry knew that smoking caused cancer and had hidden it. Since then, Glantz has always objected vigorously to any compromise with the industry. In 1997, a deal was broached with the tobacco industry by Matt Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It would have brought in tight federal regulatory control of cigarettes, prohibiting the sort of advertising and marketing that is still ubiquitous in the US, as well as sales to children. But Glantz was opposed to any deal that would allow cigarette manufacturers to continue in business. His goal was to close them down altogether. Myers was stymied by his own allies, and the US still does not have the anti-tobacco regulations that are common in Europe. Myers is calm and quietly authoritative. He is not against harm reduction, he says. Nor are other public health bodies such as the American Cancer Society or the American Heart Association. \u201cAll of us have said that under appropriate circumstances, if e-cigarettes are shown to actually significantly help smokers quit or switch completely, and that there are rules in place to prevent them being marketed in a way that doesn\u2019t unduly impact youth, we would be supportive,\u201d he said. Up until now, on a national level, the US has had no regulatory control of e-cigarette sales, marketing, minimum age, or limits on nicotine content. \u201cIt\u2019s the wild west,\u201d said Myers. Tobacco-Free Kids has brought legal action against the FDA over its failure to regulate e-cigarette use and last year won a ruling from a federal judge that there was no excuse for further delay. The e-cigarette companies are irresponsible too, Myers added. Myers says both sides in the argument interpret scientific studies according to their prior beliefs. He describes PHE\u2019s \u201c95% safer\u201d figure as worthless, because not enough research has been done. \u201cI have very little doubt that e-cigarettes under appropriate circumstances are significantly less harmful to a smoker. Do we know exactly how much less harmful? The answer is no, because we have no clue how much nicotine it is delivering, how pure they are, what else they\u2019re putting in them. Comparing it to the most lethal product ever created, for public relations purposes, is not helpful.\u201d * * * In March 2018, Myers and Glantz, as well as representatives of PHE and almost every other influential anti-smoking scientist or campaigner, attended the World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Cape Town \u2013 just up the road from BAT\u2019s South Africa HQ. At this meeting, held every two years, activists can discuss the perfidy of the industry, celebrate their successes and plan for the future. Nobody connected with the tobacco industry is allowed in the building. The WHO\u2019s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005, lays down recommended anti-smoking measures for governments, from taxing cigarettes to marketing controls and smoking bans in enclosed public places. It has been signed by 168 countries (the US is a notable exception). The Framework document says governments \u201cneed to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts\u201d and must limit their contact to the absolute minimum. Activists now take this to mean there must be an impenetrable wall between themselves and anyone in any way connected with tobacco. The man who did as much as anyone to establish the Framework Convention while an executive director of WHO, Derek Yach \u2013 originally from Cape Town but now based in the US \u2013 finds himself on the wrong side of that wall. Yach was pointedly excluded from the conference in his home city \u2013 and yet much of the conversation was about him. Yach had done the unthinkable: accepting almost $1bn over 12 years from Philip Morris, makers of Marlboro and other leading brands, to set up his Foundation for a Smokefree World in New York in 2017 to fund research into alternatives to tobacco. As part of its commitment to a \u201csmokefree future\u201d, Philip Morris International is heavily promoting its e-cigarettes and Iqos, a cigar-shaped electronic device designed to heat, rather than burn, tobacco. \u201cThese products will one day replace cigarettes,\u201d it says on its website, claiming to be moving on from tobacco products because \u201csociety expects us to act responsibly\u201d. Iqos has taken off in Japan, where 3 million people regularly use them. Smoking there was declining by 2% a year before Iqos arrived, and is now dropping by 10% per year, for which Philip Morris International claims the credit. Yach believes it\u2019s in the tobacco companies\u2019 interests to develop products that will leave conventional cigarettes behind. His erstwhile colleagues believe he is working for the devil. Why, they ask, does Philip Morris still sell cigarettes if it cares about the world\u2019s health? As rumours circulated that Yach was in the building or lurking outside, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York and funder of vast amounts of anti-tobacco science and programmes, was launching his own campaign. Striding down the hallway, flanked by purple banners emblazoned with the words Bloomberg Philanthropies, the financial backer of the conference and his entourage made their way to the TV cameras to discuss his Stop initiative. Bloomberg announced he has set aside $20m to counter the lies of the tobacco industry. Top of the watch list was Yach\u2019s Foundation. Bloomberg helps pay for WHO\u2019s work on tobacco. I was offered a five-minute audience \u2013 just long enough to ask if he thinks there\u2019s a role for e-cigarettes in combating smoking. \u201cIt is like marijuana: one of the stupid things we\u2019re doing is legalising it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s no place for e-cigarettes. I think it\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d Yach claims that \u201cA-grade scientists and researchers around the world\u201d are picking up grants from his foundation and doing useful work, but few believe he can succeed. He admits he was taken aback by the strength of feeling. \u201cI wasn\u2019t completely naive about it, but I didn\u2019t actually appreciate how harsh it would be, particularly from a pretty small bunch of people who have incredible influence at WHO,\u201d he says. Clive Bates, the former head of the UK\u2019s Ash, who blogs and campaigns for e-cigarettes from his home in Nigeria \u2013 he is married to the British High Commissioner \u2013 said he was amazed by the anti-vaping anger in Cape Town. \u201cIt was like a cult, almost,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly the attacks on the foundation. It\u2019s quite an achievement for Derek to create an institution that has a worse reputation than Philip Morris.\u201d However, Robert West, a professor of health psychology and director of tobacco studies at UCL, says: \u201cIt is playing out beautifully [for Philip Morris]. [The Foundation] has got the tobacco control community arguing among itself and divided. Result.\u201d * * * In the UK, a small number of prominent public health academics vehemently oppose e-cigarettes. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool, believe the tobacco companies are using e-cigarettes as a route back to respectability. Sally Davies, until recently the UK\u2019s chief medical officer (the most senior government adviser on public health matters), backs a ban on flavours that might attract children. She\u2019s worried that we don\u2019t know the long-term health effects of vaping, which she described as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d. Ann McNeill says there is not much growth in vaping among kids in the UK. Her key concern would be a rise in vaping among young people who have never smoked, but there\u2019s no sign of that. She thinks the key to reducing youth uptake is \u201cgetting adult smoking down\u201d, because young people tend to imitate their elders\u2019 behaviour. She feels she and her colleagues at PHE have been unfairly attacked for saying vaping is 95% safer than smoking tobacco. She points out that they never said it was harmless. A 5% risk of harm, she insisted, \u201cis not an insubstantial number\u201d. She feels that the statement has been twisted as if PHE had said vaping was completely safe. There is evidence that smoking is going down as e-cigarette use goes up, both in the UK and in the US. In 1942, 82% of British men smoked. By 2006, when e-cigarettes first appeared, 22% of adults in England smoked. The number of smokers is now at an all-time low of 14.7%, while 7% of the UK population are vaping regularly. Bans on smoking in public places, no-logo cigarette packaging with gruesome pictures of tumours, and the removal of cigarettes from sight in shops have all had an impact, but, McNeill says: \u201cAll the evidence, I believe, points to e-cigarettes playing a role.\u201d The best evidence that vaping helps people stop smoking comes from a study showing that e-cigarettes double the quitting success rate compared to gum or other aids. Peter Hajek from Queen Mary University of London and colleagues carried out the trial among more than 880 people who went to the NHS for help to give up smoking. Half were given nicotine replacement therapy in whatever form they wanted, such as patches or gum. The other half were given a starter e-cigarette kit and encouraged to buy their own when it ran out. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2019, showed that, at a year, the quit rate in the e-cigarette group was twice that of the nicotine replacement group, 18% versus 9.9%. Of course, it did not satisfy the critics. When the researchers went back to the subjects after a year, most of the e-cigarette group were still vaping, whereas few of the ex-smokers in the other group were still chewing gum. So, they insisted, the study showed just how addictive e-cigarettes are. Juul, once the leading e-cigarette, is struggling against public outrage and bad press. Sales have dropped and hundreds of staff have been laid off. The company said to be worth $38bn in 2018 was written down to $24bn by Altria in October last year, and valued at just $19bn by one of its major investors, Tiger Global Management, in December. In the storm over child users, and anticipating an FDA ban, Juul stopped selling its fruit medley and mango flavours in the US in October and even dropped mint the following month. In January, the FDA acted, banning all flavours except tobacco and menthol from e-cigarettes that use a cartridge \u2013 as the Juul devices do. These are the devices kids use, said the FDA: flavours will not be banned from the refillable e-cigarettes that are more popular with adults. The FDA is also finally getting going on regulation, and has instructed manufacturers of e-cigarettes to apply for a right to trade by May. The WHO, taking its cue from the US and from Bloomberg, has advised countries to control vaping, warning about the unknown impact on health and stating that e-cigarettes are risky for teenage brains, as well as for the foetus. That may leave the UK isolated, a lone bastion where (highly regulated) vaping is actually encouraged in the hopes of cutting smoking rates. Many public health experts in the UK believe they are witnessing an unnecessary tragedy, and that failure to promote the most promising method of helping people quit smoking is endangering the lives of millions. McNeill insists public health experts in the UK do care about young people. But those whose lives are at risk are adults living in disadvantaged communities, who cannot kick their smoking habit. \u201cI have lived with smokers and watched smokers die. You want them to do anything they can to prevent them from smoking.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2020: to clarify that Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA and that Iqos is a product of Philip Morris International and to correct an error in attributing a quote from the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

With the backing of the former prime minister of Belgium Guy Verhofstadt, Khan called for the idea to be at the \u201cthe heart\u201d of the negotiations over the future relationship. Khan said that rejoining the EU was not foreseeable in the \u201cshort to medium term\u201d but that associate citizenship of the bloc could be one way to \u201cmake the best of Brexit\u201d. The idea had been first raised in late 2016 by Verhofstadt, who was then the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator. The offer would include continued freedom of movement and residence around the bloc for those who wished to retain such rights. Such a status would also protect rights in healthcare, welfare and workplace conditions and likely the right to vote in European parliament elections. Khan told reporters that he believed the idea had merit. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for us to move forward with this and I\u2019ve been pleased with the response and it gives hope to London, as well as across our country\u201d, he said, following meetings with EU officials. The chances of such an initiative making headway in the negotiations are extremely limited as it would be unlawful under EU legislation. There is unlikely to be appetite for any rewriting of treaties among the 27 member states, given the UK government\u2019s hostile attitude to the free movement of EU nationals who wish to live and work in Britain. Speaking at a joint press conference with Khan, Verhofstadt conceded that the biggest battle would be in persuading the member states to engage with the issue. \u201cWhy not also give such a citizenship and, and the rights linked to the [EU] constitution, to people who want to keep that linked with with you?\u201d, he asked. \u201cThat will certainly return in the coming months because such an idea needs to be discussed around the negotiation table\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The unpaved outskirts of Omdurman, Sudan\u2019s second city, seem like an unusual place to find a musical superstar, but Abu Obaida Hassan is far from ordinary. The frail man in his 60s who holds court in the shaded yard of a squat brick house represents a musical revolution, one that electrified traditional Sudanese music. Stranger still, in the eyes of the Sudanese public he is back from the dead.</p> <p>In his 70s heyday, Abu Obaida travelled from Merowe, the home of the Shaigiya people and a centre of Nubian culture, to Khartoum, finding fame as a renegade player of a local stringed instrument known as the tambour.</p> <p>The music of the Shaigiya people focuses on call and response, designed to draw the audience into grand tales of love and heartbreak. Rolling, pulsating drumbeats are overlaid with heartfelt vocals, mirrored back with handclaps and a chorus of voices. As the first Shaigiya artist released on the global stage, Abu Obaida has become an accidental ambassador for both the Shaigiya people and their distinctive musical style.</p> <p>\u201cI became popular across the world!\u201d he says, laughing in a way that suggests this is what he always wanted. Family members gathered around his bed laugh with him.</p> <p>A fixture on the Khartoum music scene during its golden era of the 70s and early 80s, Abu Obaida subsequently faded into obscurity through a combination of misfortune and Sudan\u2019s shifting politics. Things reached the point where, 20 years ago, one prominent Sudanese newspaper pronounced him dead. Rumours of his survival persisted, however, sustained by fans trading his songs through online forums and Khartoum record shops, by sheer devotion to the man who could play the tambour like no other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"661d2d135f81b821f0e5d5156cd19fb79e7a7590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/661d2d135f81b821f0e5d5156cd19fb79e7a7590/0_27_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Obaida Hassan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was a superstar\u2019: Abu Obaida Hassan enjoyed notable success on the Khartoum music scene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abu Obaida Hassan via Ostinato Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu Obaida says he never went away, but simply receded from public view. His comeback, if you can call it that, is a spectacular one. Ostinato Records, a Grammy-nominated label based in New York and Bangkok, and known for an ability to source rare music from countries affected by war or natural disasters, tracked down Abu Obaida and released his music to the world.</p> <p>In just a few years, he went from missing, presumed dead, to global star. His EP sold out worldwide within a week of its release. Ostinato pressed a second batch, which also sold out in Europe.</p> <p>After his career fell victim to a crackdown on the swinging Khartoum party scene that sustained him, Sudan\u2019s new transitional government is attempting to usher in an age of caring for revered musical icons like Abu Obaida.</p> <p>\u201cI was nervous initially, because it takes a bit of listening,\u201d says Vik Sohonie, the founder of Ostinato Records, of Abu Obaida\u2019s music. \u201cIt\u2019s a new sound \u2013 there are no electric guitars or saxophones or anything like that. It\u2019s not an immediately relatable or accessible sound, but people fell in love with it.\u201d</p> <p>Sohonie\u2019s hunt for Abu Obaida and his records is almost as bizarre as the musician\u2019s supposed return from the dead. Sohonie travelled to Khartoum in 2016, searching for lost recordings by the artist and hoping to learn more about his disappearance from public life. He was helped in his search by Ahmed Asyouti, a local dentist who had posted on TripAdvisor offering his services to tourists.</p> <p>Asyouti told Sohonie that Abu Obaida was probably dead, but said that together they could find out what happened to him. The quest began with Asyouti getting Sohonie an appearance on Sudanese breakfast television, and helping him to sneak into the grounds of the national radio station, skirting a ban on the entry of foreign visitors.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone at the national radio archives said: \u2018I think he\u2019s alive,\u2019\u201d says Sohonie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e49ac240ad8632fded29cb3ae9f4cf83c8ca48c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e49ac240ad8632fded29cb3ae9f4cf83c8ca48c/0_0_5100_6368/801.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Obaida Hassan with fellow Sudanese musicians\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Obaida Hassan, centre, with his tambour, to which he added a sixth string.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abu Obaida Hassan via Ostinato Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A hunt through Khartoum\u2019s record-collectors and music aficionados led them to a shop where playing one of Abu Obaida\u2019s recordings sparked a chance encounter. \u201cA guy in the corner of the store said: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re looking for Abu Obaida Hassan? His wife is my cousin.\u2019 My first thought was that this guy was messing with us.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t, and the random meeting meant the pair finally found Abu Obaida\u2019s wife, who set up a meeting with the artist. The result was an agreement to release an eight-track EP entitled Abu Obaida Hassan and His Tambour, the Shaigiya Sound of Sudan.

      "bodyText": "The unpaved outskirts of Omdurman, Sudan\u2019s second city, seem like an unusual place to find a musical superstar, but Abu Obaida Hassan is far from ordinary. The frail man in his 60s who holds court in the shaded yard of a squat brick house represents a musical revolution, one that electrified traditional Sudanese music. Stranger still, in the eyes of the Sudanese public he is back from the dead. In his 70s heyday, Abu Obaida travelled from Merowe, the home of the Shaigiya people and a centre of Nubian culture, to Khartoum, finding fame as a renegade player of a local stringed instrument known as the tambour. The music of the Shaigiya people focuses on call and response, designed to draw the audience into grand tales of love and heartbreak. Rolling, pulsating drumbeats are overlaid with heartfelt vocals, mirrored back with handclaps and a chorus of voices. As the first Shaigiya artist released on the global stage, Abu Obaida has become an accidental ambassador for both the Shaigiya people and their distinctive musical style. \u201cI became popular across the world!\u201d he says, laughing in a way that suggests this is what he always wanted. Family members gathered around his bed laugh with him. A fixture on the Khartoum music scene during its golden era of the 70s and early 80s, Abu Obaida subsequently faded into obscurity through a combination of misfortune and Sudan\u2019s shifting politics. Things reached the point where, 20 years ago, one prominent Sudanese newspaper pronounced him dead. Rumours of his survival persisted, however, sustained by fans trading his songs through online forums and Khartoum record shops, by sheer devotion to the man who could play the tambour like no other. Abu Obaida says he never went away, but simply receded from public view. His comeback, if you can call it that, is a spectacular one. Ostinato Records, a Grammy-nominated label based in New York and Bangkok, and known for an ability to source rare music from countries affected by war or natural disasters, tracked down Abu Obaida and released his music to the world. In just a few years, he went from missing, presumed dead, to global star. His EP sold out worldwide within a week of its release. Ostinato pressed a second batch, which also sold out in Europe. After his career fell victim to a crackdown on the swinging Khartoum party scene that sustained him, Sudan\u2019s new transitional government is attempting to usher in an age of caring for revered musical icons like Abu Obaida. \u201cI was nervous initially, because it takes a bit of listening,\u201d says Vik Sohonie, the founder of Ostinato Records, of Abu Obaida\u2019s music. \u201cIt\u2019s a new sound \u2013 there are no electric guitars or saxophones or anything like that. It\u2019s not an immediately relatable or accessible sound, but people fell in love with it.\u201d Sohonie\u2019s hunt for Abu Obaida and his records is almost as bizarre as the musician\u2019s supposed return from the dead. Sohonie travelled to Khartoum in 2016, searching for lost recordings by the artist and hoping to learn more about his disappearance from public life. He was helped in his search by Ahmed Asyouti, a local dentist who had posted on TripAdvisor offering his services to tourists. Asyouti told Sohonie that Abu Obaida was probably dead, but said that together they could find out what happened to him. The quest began with Asyouti getting Sohonie an appearance on Sudanese breakfast television, and helping him to sneak into the grounds of the national radio station, skirting a ban on the entry of foreign visitors. \u201cSomeone at the national radio archives said: \u2018I think he\u2019s alive,\u2019\u201d says Sohonie. A hunt through Khartoum\u2019s record-collectors and music aficionados led them to a shop where playing one of Abu Obaida\u2019s recordings sparked a chance encounter. \u201cA guy in the corner of the store said: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re looking for Abu Obaida Hassan? His wife is my cousin.\u2019 My first thought was that this guy was messing with us.\u201d He wasn\u2019t, and the random meeting meant the pair finally found Abu Obaida\u2019s wife, who set up a meeting with the artist. The result was an agreement to release an eight-track EP entitled Abu Obaida Hassan and His Tambour, the Shaigiya Sound of Sudan. The album comes with the warning: \u201cWe are not responsible for any addiction issues caused by Abu Obaida Hassan\u2019s Shaigiya sound.\u201d Vintage Sudanese music is prized across Africa. From Nairobi to Mogadishu, collectors treasure its rich sound of playful synths and violins, often accompanied by piercing vocals and poetic song titles. But Abu Obaida\u2019s more unusual sound stands out, even among prominent tambour players of his generation. Part of his unique origin story is his own version of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cgoing electric\u201d moment. By adding a sixth string to his tambour, and sometimes wiring it to an amp, Abu Obaida stormed the Khartoum music scene. \u201cMy country was playing my music and I was a superstar,\u201d he says of his moment of notoriety on the Sudanese music scene. \u201cI was a megastar \u2013 I couldn\u2019t walk in the street!\u201d Such was the demand for his sound, he hired a car and toured the concerts and parties that had sprung up across Sudan, riding a wave of his own celebrity and a scene that was fostering artistic talent. \u201cMorning and evening \u2013 parties that went all night!,\u201d he recalls fondly. \u201cAt the time I had no idea of my own value.

Staying between Merowe and the outskirts of Omdurman, he had no idea that fans of his music had been trying to find him, despairing at his apparent demise. Popular protests last year overthrew Bashir and brought his long-running dictatorship to an end. In its place is a transitional government, one intending to shepherd Sudan into democracy. The new regime has signalled a desire to care for cultural icons from the pre-Bashir era. Sparked by increased local news coverage of the artists\u2019 neglect and poor health, representatives from Sudan\u2019s ministry of culture and members of the public began visiting the homes of golden-era musicians like singer Abdel Aziz El Mubarak and Abu Obaida. Social media campaigns soliciting donations were matched by government offers to pay both musicians\u2019 medical bills, before El Mubarak\u2019s death in early February. Although Abu Obaida is no longer well enough to tour, a stream of musicians and guests travel to his home to hear him play the tambour once again. Abu Obaida\u2019s family say his return to the spotlight is positive, but that they will remain sceptical until they see support from the government. \u201cWe want people to know that he\u2019s a forgotten talent \u2013 and such a talent should be cared for,\u201d says Hala Homeida, Abu Obaida\u2019s sister-in-law. Asked how she feels about Abu Obaida\u2019s newfound fame, she replies: \u201cThe tambour is linked to the Shaigiya tribe, but now it\u2019s viral internationally \u2013 this is amazing.\u201d",

Yet it was slow to build, and at 4.47pm I was beginning to wonder if it would happen at all. Then there was suddenly an evolving genie of birds.</p> <p>Soon there were multiple genies, and as these formations revolved there were convulsive downward movements as hundreds entered the roost and vanished. Yet if thousands disappeared, thousands arrived, and the sky became a self-filling vessel.</p> <p>It is difficult to define precisely why murmurations are so captivating, but perhaps it\u2019s this. As they passed, the gyrations suggested to me the following: a flock of knots, a shoal of minnows, an army-ant colony in hunting spate across the rainforest floor, an octopus, an anaconda wound in round coil, a broad river\u2019s flow but also its arching bridge, an ocean tide, a silk scarf in a breeze; they were autumn leaves torn down by a strong wind, black fireworks, a black rainbow and a single amoeba in phagocytosis.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IfhfCQaoFU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0IfhfCQaoFU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The murmuration recorded by Mark Cocker.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>These were not in sequence; they were all manifest simultaneously. I could perhaps describe it best if I could take all the letters from all those words and make a single construction that conjured all parts at once. Yet for every observer that imaginary word would have to be unique, because for each of us starlings summon different things.</p> <p>Bear in mind also that a roost is not an inherited entity shaped by genes. It is a cultural phenomenon, passed on, one to another. Perhaps we should think of it as art involving movement and music, since one has both the geophony of the wind through trees, and the biophony of their voices and wings. The closest might be a ballet with orchestra, but recall that there is no rehearsal and it is entirely functional. Perhaps it\u2019s more than any human art. It is starling art: made in soil of earthworms and leatherjacket mash, conceived in the moment, delivered in real time and unique each evening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "All starling roosts are wonderful but some are more wonderful than others \u2013 a matter determined by numbers, their location, the prevailing light and wind, and one\u2019s capacity to get close to the birds. Yet it was slow to build, and at 4.47pm I was beginning to wonder if it would happen at all. Then there was suddenly an evolving genie of birds. Soon there were multiple genies, and as these formations revolved there were convulsive downward movements as hundreds entered the roost and vanished. Yet if thousands disappeared, thousands arrived, and the sky became a self-filling vessel. It is difficult to define precisely why murmurations are so captivating, but perhaps it\u2019s this. As they passed, the gyrations suggested to me the following: a flock of knots, a shoal of minnows, an army-ant colony in hunting spate across the rainforest floor, an octopus, an anaconda wound in round coil, a broad river\u2019s flow but also its arching bridge, an ocean tide, a silk scarf in a breeze; they were autumn leaves torn down by a strong wind, black fireworks, a black rainbow and a single amoeba in phagocytosis. These were not in sequence; they were all manifest simultaneously. I could perhaps describe it best if I could take all the letters from all those words and make a single construction that conjured all parts at once. Yet for every observer that imaginary word would have to be unique, because for each of us starlings summon different things. Bear in mind also that a roost is not an inherited entity shaped by genes. It is a cultural phenomenon, passed on, one to another. Perhaps we should think of it as art involving movement and music, since one has both the geophony of the wind through trees, and the biophony of their voices and wings. The closest might be a ballet with orchestra, but recall that there is no rehearsal and it is entirely functional. Perhaps it\u2019s more than any human art. It is starling art: made in soil of earthworms and leatherjacket mash, conceived in the moment, delivered in real time and unique each evening.",

The planet\u2019s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week. In a statement signed by 23 diplomats \u2013 including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind \u2013 world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land. Next week\u2019s meeting in Rome \u2013 originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. The current draft commits countries to protect 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species, and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. \u201cThe loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity. It disproportionately harms our poorest communities while undermining our ability to meet a broad range of targets set by the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals. We must rise above politics and ideology to unite the global community around the urgent cause of protecting our planet and way of life,\u201d reads the statement, which was released through non-profit thinktank Aspen Institute.

      "body": "<p>As the sun began to set, the evening of 14 December seemed destined to be no different to any other for Hayder, a former military medic in Baghdad. After leaving the protest camp in Tahrir Square, where he had been treating the wounds of injured anti-government demonstrators, he went out for dinner with friends in the neighbouring district of Karrada.</p> \n<p>Like thousands of other young Iraqis, Hayder first took to the streets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/iraq-protests-un-demands-end-to-violence-as-death-tolls-nears-100\">two months earlier on 1 October</a>. He was chanting slogans demanding better services and denouncing the corrupt ruling parties when security forces opened fire on the crowd. He stood on a highway leading to Tahrir Square and saw young, unarmed protesters fall around him, some dead, others injured.</p> \n<p>The next day, he packed his military backpack with bandages and medicine and went back on to the streets. By the end of October, when protesters were regularly occupying Tahrir Square, Hayder was leading a team of medics, treating the casualties of military-grade teargas grenades and plastic bullets as well as live ammunition. When one of these grenades smashed through his right arm, he was evacuated to a nearby hospital but was back in the square three days later with metal bars protruding from his bandaged arm. The blue tent that he shared with his friends, with its piles of mould-covered blankets, had become his home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/anti-government-protesters-defy-bloody-crackdown-in-iraq\">Thousands of Iraqis defy bloody crackdown on Tahrir Square protest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After the dinner that December night, rather than going back to the square as he usually did, Hayder decided to go to his house in a working-class neighbourhood in east Baghdad to check on his pregnant wife and his mother. Just after midnight, he was sitting on the pavement outside his house \u2013 where the internet reception was better \u2013 checking his Twitter feed for the latest news from the square when a small van stopped in front of him. Three men in black military uniforms and white trainers stepped out and approached him. \u201cAre you Hayder?\u201d one of them asked, he recalled.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, I am his brother Mohamad,\u201d he answered swiftly, telling the men he would go inside to fetch the person they were looking for. </p> \n<p>The ploy didn\u2019t work; one of the men grabbed him by the neck and dragged him into the van. Another picked up his phone and wallet. The men blindfolded him, tied his hands and pushed him to the floor of the van under their feet. One of them put a pistol to his head and told Hayder he would shoot if he opened his mouth.</p> \n<p>When the car stopped, an hour or so later, the men walked him in silence into a large, bare room and locked the door. Early the next day, two masked men dressed in the same black uniforms and carrying sticks and thick cables entered the room. They blindfolded him again and, without asking any questions, began beating him until he was unconscious.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"530911698ccd056b450721491bc20cdd6205be59\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530911698ccd056b450721491bc20cdd6205be59/0_5_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Memorials for protesters killed by security forces in Tahrir Square held on 1 December 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Memorials for protesters killed by security forces in Tahrir Square held on 1 December 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Iraqi government\u2019s response to the popular protest movement has been violent and brutal.

Last month a television reporter and his cameraman were killed in their cars hours after the reporter denounced the clampdown in a Facebook video. Hayder\u2019s kidnapping, it would seem, was part of the same effort.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom day one, the government chose to pursue violent options in dealing with the protesters,\u201d a senior official at Iraq\u2019s human rights commission told the Guardian, speaking on condition of anonymity. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72dec1a6-89c4-4543-ad17-35c1b1a9e901\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TCZ7sPcZpcY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe violence came in waves,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, there were mass killings; 157 were killed in the first three days alone. By early November we started getting reports of kidnappings, not only in Baghdad but also in Ammarah and Nassiriya. Activists, journalists, academics and anyone suspected of supporting the protest movement logistically or morally started receiving death threats before they were kidnapped.\u201d Two activists in Karbala, the commissioner said, were assassinated a few days after meeting with him and his colleagues.</p> \n<p>In Tahrir Square, pictures of the disappeared are posted on walls, electricity poles or flapping tent doors. Some are old, yellow and tattered, others are fresh and new.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a616954abf801613e837c6a99fc0e5556d0ac7b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a616954abf801613e837c6a99fc0e5556d0ac7b/0_277_1536_921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Tahrir Square, the pictures of the disappeared are posted on walls, electricity poles or flapping tent doors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Tahrir Square, the pictures of the disappeared are posted on walls, electricity poles or flapping tent doors.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThese kidnappings are not random,\u201d the senior human rights official said. \u201cThey are calculated, planned and designed to terrorise the demonstrations.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThey came in stages; first they began with the leading activists, especially those appearing in the media, then academics and poets, followed by journalists, and now we have reached the medics and doctors. All to terrorise the protesters and prevent demonstrations from expanding.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Hayder woke up, he said he found himself lying naked on the floor of a small dark room that reeked of urine and faeces. There was a hook in the ceiling and a dirty bathtub filled with brown water and electrical wires.</p> \n<p>A few hours later, masked men entered the room and spoke to him for the first time. They demanded that he unlocked his phone and, as they resumed their beating, began interrogating him about his political affiliation, asking which embassy was financing him and his protester friends. </p> \n<p>He wept and pleaded, telling them he had not been to any embassies and pretending he had forgotten the password to his phone. The torture went on, lasting two or three hours; he is not sure. When he fainted he was submerged in the bathtub, and when he woke up they hung him from the hook in the ceiling, attached wires to his fingers, toes and genitalia and sent electric shocks through him.</p> \n<p>After three nights of torture \u2013 the masked men only came at night \u2013 Hayder unlocked his phone. They went through his pictures and asked him to identify the protest leaders in Baghdad and the provinces. When he said there were no leaders, they put him in icy water in the bath tub, piled concrete blocks on his chest and one of the torturers heaved himself on top, crushing him under the water. They took particular joy in beating him on his injured arm, he recalled.</p> \n<p>When he persisted in his refusal to identify anyone they began raping him with an electrical stick and forced him to sit on a glass bottle until it penetrated him. They showed him pictures of his mother and pregnant wife and taunted him that they were getting the same treatment with the bottle. They showed video footage of him inside the tent and told him in detail what he packed in his medical bag.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy the end of the first week, I yearned for death. I wanted them to kill me. I just wanted to die and the torture to stop.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3671fc083ce77837f7484bfb4ce98f5374c6ab8b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3671fc083ce77837f7484bfb4ce98f5374c6ab8b/0_238_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-government protesters on the streets of Baghdad last October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-government protesters on the streets of Baghdad last October.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In his statements and TV addresses, the former Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, claimed that a \u201cthird party\u201d, intent of sowing discord among the Iraqi people, was committing the kidnappings and assassinations, the same \u201cthird party\u201d that deployed snipers in the early days of the protest. These claims were ridiculed by human rights groups and protesters, and contradicted by some of the government\u2019s own security officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the last week of September, we started receiving intelligence reports that mass demonstrations will take place, followed by a military coup,\u201d a high-ranking official in the directorate of Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The PMU, or the Hashed, is a state-backed umbrella organisation of militias that was formed in 2014 during the war against Isis, with some of its paramilitary units directly affiliated with Iran.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn operation room was formed,\u201d said the official. \u201cAbdul-Mahdi was there as the supreme commander of all armed forces. Around him sat army and federal police commanders and leaders of the Hashed as well as the Iranians. They all saw the demonstrations as part of a larger conspiracy, and a decision to oppress it violently was taken collectively, and that\u2019s why all the units opened fire.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen some of the [PMU] factions, and not all of them, decided to target the activists connected to foreign embassies and media organisations that are sponsoring the riots,\u201d added the official.</p> \n<p>Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s office refused to comment on the allegations when approached by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The claim that there is government involvement in the kidnappings is backed by human rights groups. \u201cThe security forces exist in the vicinity of the square, and they are monitoring anyone who goes in and out, and a network of high-resolution cameras connects Baghdad, so it is not conceivable that the government can\u2019t identify the people who are kidnapping,\u201d the official from Iraq\u2019s human rights commission said.</p> \n<p>The Guardian also spoke to an intelligence officer in the ministry of interior who claimed he was ordered to take part in the demonstrations in order to spy on the movements of genuine protesters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe secret surveillance department of the ministry are all in the square, they have their tents, and they monitor who goes in and out,\u201d said the intelligence officer, Hussam. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe have cameras and can monitor the squares and all the entrances, and we know who enters and leaves the square. We take advantage of the protesters\u2019 youth and inexperience, we talk to them, get their names and follow them to try and reach their leaders.\u201d </p> \n<p>A special target for surveillance, Hussam claimed, were those who distribute food and provide the protesters with tents and blankets. \u201cThe government wants us to file daily reports on who is financing these protests, but we can\u2019t find these \u2018financiers\u2019 because everyone is sending money; old women, shop owners and students. But the government is obsessed by the idea of a conspiracy and that the demonstrations are all organised by [foreign] embassies.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cabeee81a9c2816b474bdb3328b1bd950725ca46\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cabeee81a9c2816b474bdb3328b1bd950725ca46/0_5_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends of protesters who were killed by the Iraqi government\u2019s security forces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends of protesters who were killed by the Iraqi government\u2019s security forces.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hayder was given food once a day: a piece of bread one day, a rotten tomato another and sometimes a white styrofoam packet with some congealed leftover rice from his jailers\u2019 meals. If he asked for water, the jailers would urinate on him, so he had to drink from the water in the torture bath tub. A plastic bag next to the door was his toilet.</p> \n<p>The torture sessions took place during the night, but during the day, if he fell asleep, guards doused him in cold water or beat him with a stick. Once, he says, a guard entered the room when he was sleeping and fired his pistol into the ceiling just to laugh at his screams of terror.</p> \n<p>On the 14th day of his kidnapping, the guards dressed Hayder in pyjama bottoms, blindfolded him and led him out of the cell. \u201cI knew they were taking me to be executed, and I was happy; I wanted to die,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>They led him to a waiting car and sat him on the back seat. The vehicle drove for some time, and when he stepped out he felt rubbish and dirt under his bare feet. One of the guards nudged him forward, walked him a short distance then pushed him to his knees.</p> \n<p>\u201cI knew death was coming but I begged him to let me call my wife. He told me to wait while he got a phone but said if I removed the blindfold he would shoot. I heard his footsteps move away.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hayder waited for some time, but when the guard didn\u2019t come back he removed the blindfold and found himself in a deserted, empty rubbish dump. He didn\u2019t know the time or where he was. His first reaction was to run but suddenly he felt the agony of two weeks of torture and began to shiver from the cold and the pain. \u201cI thought I was dead, and that this was my soul running.\u201d</p> \n<p>He saw houses in the distance and a highway in the other direction. He knocked at the first door that he came to but no one answered. He knocked at three more doors until he could hear people inside. </p> \n<p>From the fourth door came a young boy. Hayder begged him for water and a phone to call his family. The boy asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p> \n<p>When he realised the boy could see him, Hayder began to weep, finally realising that he was still alive. Thinking Hayder was drunk, the boy went back inside. Hayder heard the boy\u2019s mother telling him not to go out again.</p> \n<p>Someone called the police and when they arrived they wanted to take him to a hospital or a police department. He begged them to take him back to Tahrir Square where he felt the protesters would protect him.</p> \n<p>The simple goal of kidnappings such as Hayder\u2019s, the Hashed official said, is to create fear, \u201cso that other activists will be scared and run away.\u201d</p> \n<p>To a large extent they have succeeded, according to the senior human rights official. \u201cMost of those released migrate and leave, they refuse to talk, or submit a complaint, and many won\u2019t even mention who kidnapped them.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Note: Names have been changed to </em><em>preserve anonymity</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As the sun began to set, the evening of 14 December seemed destined to be no different to any other for Hayder, a former military medic in Baghdad. After leaving the protest camp in Tahrir Square, where he had been treating the wounds of injured anti-government demonstrators, he went out for dinner with friends in the neighbouring district of Karrada. Like thousands of other young Iraqis, Hayder first took to the streets two months earlier on 1 October. He was chanting slogans demanding better services and denouncing the corrupt ruling parties when security forces opened fire on the crowd. He stood on a highway leading to Tahrir Square and saw young, unarmed protesters fall around him, some dead, others injured. The next day, he packed his military backpack with bandages and medicine and went back on to the streets. By the end of October, when protesters were regularly occupying Tahrir Square, Hayder was leading a team of medics, treating the casualties of military-grade teargas grenades and plastic bullets as well as live ammunition. When one of these grenades smashed through his right arm, he was evacuated to a nearby hospital but was back in the square three days later with metal bars protruding from his bandaged arm. The blue tent that he shared with his friends, with its piles of mould-covered blankets, had become his home. After the dinner that December night, rather than going back to the square as he usually did, Hayder decided to go to his house in a working-class neighbourhood in east Baghdad to check on his pregnant wife and his mother. Just after midnight, he was sitting on the pavement outside his house \u2013 where the internet reception was better \u2013 checking his Twitter feed for the latest news from the square when a small van stopped in front of him. Three men in black military uniforms and white trainers stepped out and approached him. \u201cAre you Hayder?\u201d one of them asked, he recalled. \u201cNo, I am his brother Mohamad,\u201d he answered swiftly, telling the men he would go inside to fetch the person they were looking for. The ploy didn\u2019t work; one of the men grabbed him by the neck and dragged him into the van. Another picked up his phone and wallet. The men blindfolded him, tied his hands and pushed him to the floor of the van under their feet. One of them put a pistol to his head and told Hayder he would shoot if he opened his mouth. When the car stopped, an hour or so later, the men walked him in silence into a large, bare room and locked the door. Early the next day, two masked men dressed in the same black uniforms and carrying sticks and thick cables entered the room. They blindfolded him again and, without asking any questions, began beating him until he was unconscious. The Iraqi government\u2019s response to the popular protest movement has been violent and brutal. In four months, security forces killed 669 civilians and injured more than 25,000, according to Iraq\u2019s human rights commission, local NGOs and activists. Some 2,800 are reported to have been detained. Some of these security forces are, the Guardian has been told, following a parallel crackdown to end the protests and silence activists and journalists through kidnappings, intimidations and assassinations. Last month a television reporter and his cameraman were killed in their cars hours after the reporter denounced the clampdown in a Facebook video. Hayder\u2019s kidnapping, it would seem, was part of the same effort. \u201cFrom day one, the government chose to pursue violent options in dealing with the protesters,\u201d a senior official at Iraq\u2019s human rights commission told the Guardian, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe violence came in waves,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, there were mass killings; 157 were killed in the first three days alone. By early November we started getting reports of kidnappings, not only in Baghdad but also in Ammarah and Nassiriya. Activists, journalists, academics and anyone suspected of supporting the protest movement logistically or morally started receiving death threats before they were kidnapped.\u201d Two activists in Karbala, the commissioner said, were assassinated a few days after meeting with him and his colleagues. In Tahrir Square, pictures of the disappeared are posted on walls, electricity poles or flapping tent doors. Some are old, yellow and tattered, others are fresh and new. \u201cThese kidnappings are not random,\u201d the senior human rights official said. \u201cThey are calculated, planned and designed to terrorise the demonstrations.\u201d \u201cThey came in stages; first they began with the leading activists, especially those appearing in the media, then academics and poets, followed by journalists, and now we have reached the medics and doctors. All to terrorise the protesters and prevent demonstrations from expanding.\u201d When Hayder woke up, he said he found himself lying naked on the floor of a small dark room that reeked of urine and faeces. There was a hook in the ceiling and a dirty bathtub filled with brown water and electrical wires. A few hours later, masked men entered the room and spoke to him for the first time. They demanded that he unlocked his phone and, as they resumed their beating, began interrogating him about his political affiliation, asking which embassy was financing him and his protester friends. He wept and pleaded, telling them he had not been to any embassies and pretending he had forgotten the password to his phone. The torture went on, lasting two or three hours; he is not sure. When he fainted he was submerged in the bathtub, and when he woke up they hung him from the hook in the ceiling, attached wires to his fingers, toes and genitalia and sent electric shocks through him. After three nights of torture \u2013 the masked men only came at night \u2013 Hayder unlocked his phone. They went through his pictures and asked him to identify the protest leaders in Baghdad and the provinces. When he said there were no leaders, they put him in icy water in the bath tub, piled concrete blocks on his chest and one of the torturers heaved himself on top, crushing him under the water. They took particular joy in beating him on his injured arm, he recalled. When he persisted in his refusal to identify anyone they began raping him with an electrical stick and forced him to sit on a glass bottle until it penetrated him. They showed him pictures of his mother and pregnant wife and taunted him that they were getting the same treatment with the bottle. They showed video footage of him inside the tent and told him in detail what he packed in his medical bag. \u201cBy the end of the first week, I yearned for death. I wanted them to kill me. I just wanted to die and the torture to stop.\u201d In his statements and TV addresses, the former Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, claimed that a \u201cthird party\u201d, intent of sowing discord among the Iraqi people, was committing the kidnappings and assassinations, the same \u201cthird party\u201d that deployed snipers in the early days of the protest. These claims were ridiculed by human rights groups and protesters, and contradicted by some of the government\u2019s own security officials. \u201cIn the last week of September, we started receiving intelligence reports that mass demonstrations will take place, followed by a military coup,\u201d a high-ranking official in the directorate of Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) told the Guardian. The PMU, or the Hashed, is a state-backed umbrella organisation of militias that was formed in 2014 during the war against Isis, with some of its paramilitary units directly affiliated with Iran. \u201cAn operation room was formed,\u201d said the official. \u201cAbdul-Mahdi was there as the supreme commander of all armed forces. Around him sat army and federal police commanders and leaders of the Hashed as well as the Iranians. They all saw the demonstrations as part of a larger conspiracy, and a decision to oppress it violently was taken collectively, and that\u2019s why all the units opened fire. \u201cThen some of the [PMU] factions, and not all of them, decided to target the activists connected to foreign embassies and media organisations that are sponsoring the riots,\u201d added the official. Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s office refused to comment on the allegations when approached by the Guardian. The claim that there is government involvement in the kidnappings is backed by human rights groups. \u201cThe security forces exist in the vicinity of the square, and they are monitoring anyone who goes in and out, and a network of high-resolution cameras connects Baghdad, so it is not conceivable that the government can\u2019t identify the people who are kidnapping,\u201d the official from Iraq\u2019s human rights commission said. The Guardian also spoke to an intelligence officer in the ministry of interior who claimed he was ordered to take part in the demonstrations in order to spy on the movements of genuine protesters. \u201cThe secret surveillance department of the ministry are all in the square, they have their tents, and they monitor who goes in and out,\u201d said the intelligence officer, Hussam. \u201cWe have cameras and can monitor the squares and all the entrances, and we know who enters and leaves the square. We take advantage of the protesters\u2019 youth and inexperience, we talk to them, get their names and follow them to try and reach their leaders.\u201d A special target for surveillance, Hussam claimed, were those who distribute food and provide the protesters with tents and blankets. \u201cThe government wants us to file daily reports on who is financing these protests, but we can\u2019t find these \u2018financiers\u2019 because everyone is sending money; old women, shop owners and students. But the government is obsessed by the idea of a conspiracy and that the demonstrations are all organised by [foreign] embassies.\u201d Hayder was given food once a day: a piece of bread one day, a rotten tomato another and sometimes a white styrofoam packet with some congealed leftover rice from his jailers\u2019 meals. If he asked for water, the jailers would urinate on him, so he had to drink from the water in the torture bath tub. A plastic bag next to the door was his toilet. The torture sessions took place during the night, but during the day, if he fell asleep, guards doused him in cold water or beat him with a stick. Once, he says, a guard entered the room when he was sleeping and fired his pistol into the ceiling just to laugh at his screams of terror. On the 14th day of his kidnapping, the guards dressed Hayder in pyjama bottoms, blindfolded him and led him out of the cell. \u201cI knew they were taking me to be executed, and I was happy; I wanted to die,\u201d he said. They led him to a waiting car and sat him on the back seat. The vehicle drove for some time, and when he stepped out he felt rubbish and dirt under his bare feet. One of the guards nudged him forward, walked him a short distance then pushed him to his knees. \u201cI knew death was coming but I begged him to let me call my wife. He told me to wait while he got a phone but said if I removed the blindfold he would shoot. I heard his footsteps move away.\u201d Hayder waited for some time, but when the guard didn\u2019t come back he removed the blindfold and found himself in a deserted, empty rubbish dump. He didn\u2019t know the time or where he was. His first reaction was to run but suddenly he felt the agony of two weeks of torture and began to shiver from the cold and the pain. \u201cI thought I was dead, and that this was my soul running.\u201d He saw houses in the distance and a highway in the other direction. He knocked at the first door that he came to but no one answered. He knocked at three more doors until he could hear people inside. From the fourth door came a young boy. Hayder begged him for water and a phone to call his family. The boy asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d When he realised the boy could see him, Hayder began to weep, finally realising that he was still alive. Thinking Hayder was drunk, the boy went back inside. Hayder heard the boy\u2019s mother telling him not to go out again. Someone called the police and when they arrived they wanted to take him to a hospital or a police department. He begged them to take him back to Tahrir Square where he felt the protesters would protect him. The simple goal of kidnappings such as Hayder\u2019s, the Hashed official said, is to create fear, \u201cso that other activists will be scared and run away.\u201d To a large extent they have succeeded, according to the senior human rights official. \u201cMost of those released migrate and leave, they refuse to talk, or submit a complaint, and many won\u2019t even mention who kidnapped them.\u201d Note: Names have been changed to preserve anonymity",

At age 34, he had achieved that rare status in modern medicine of an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d specialist who thought beyond one organ,cared about people who were not his patients and indeed, about broader society. The best tribute his profession could pay him is to reflect on how each one of us could carry his flame a little bit further. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

The mass die-off in Northland was sparked by \u201can exceptional period of warm weather\u201d combined with low tides in the middle of the day, which had exposed the shellfish, said Dr Andrew Jeffs, a marine scientist from the University of Auckland. He said more marine life would soon be affected by climate change, and there was little that that could be done to protect the vulnerable shellfish, other than manual protection measures such as shadecloth, which were impractical and \u201cunrealistic\u201d.

The effects of the drought have been severe, with Kiwi birds perishing as they search for water, and tankers of freshwater urgently trucked in to fill rainwater tanks in remote communities. Exposed at a time of day when the sun was at its most intense, hundreds of beds of mussels had been \u201ccooked\u201d by the sun, Jeffs said.

      "bodyText": "Welfare recipients were forced to correct the employment income they reported to Centrelink 15m times in one year, the government has revealed, as it makes the case for new laws to simplify the process. The Coalition has announced it hopes by July to introduce new reporting requirements for about 1.2 million welfare recipients who inform Services Australia, formerly Centrelink, of their earnings so the agency can calculate their fortnightly payments. Legal and welfare groups and the public sector union offered support for the plan in their submissions to a Senate inquiry into the legislation, although they warned that there was concern the policy may not be implemented smoothly, citing the robodebt scandal that also involved an attempt to bolster the budget bottom line. \u201cThere is widespread mistrust in government and its use of data matching in the administration of social security following robodebt,\u201d the Australian Council of Social Service said in a submission. The government has insisted that the $2.1bn over four years of expected savings would not come from debts being raised but instead be gained by accurately paying recipients what they are entitled to. Currently welfare recipients are told to report their work income over a fortnight by calculating what they earned as a result of the number of hours worked. Under the new arrangements, people would be able to report their income to Centrelink after receiving their payslip, avoiding the need to estimate their earnings. Shane Bennett, an acting deputy secretary at the Department of Social Services, conceded that the current system was \u201conerous\u201d, saying it effectively required people to keep a diary of their shifts and \u201cthe different rates that they have worked those shifts at\u201d. More than 600,000 debts have been issued under the government\u2019s botched debt recovery scheme \u2013 known as robodebt \u2013 alleging that welfare recipients were overpaid because they misreported their work income. While many of these debts are now under a legal cloud, even critics of the scheme acknowledge that some welfare recipients will have misreported their income and therefore received excess payments. The government\u2019s submission offers a potential insight into why this may be, revealing that in 2017 there were around 15m corrections to recently reported earnings. These were cases \u201cwhere people discovered when they got their pay that they had incorrectly reported their earned income for the previous fortnight\u201d. Under the new system, Centrelink will also pre-fill income reporting forms of about 95% of all welfare recipients\u2019 using tax office data provided via the Single Touch Payroll scheme. People will be asked to confirm the information, similar to what occurs with tax returns. But the Greens senator, Rachel Siewert, warned that recipients could be tripped up in cases where the pre-filled information was different to the income listed on their own payslip. \u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d go, \u2018Uh-oh!

Leanne Ho, the National Social Security Rights Network executive officer, argued that the government should consider the pre-filled data as the correct information in law, rather than what is reported by a welfare recipient. \u201cIt would avoid debt because it wouldn\u2019t be up to vulnerable people to work out, through a complicated system, what their income being reported should be,\u201d she said. The Senate inquiry will report on Friday.",

On Monday more than 600 people protested outside parliament to remember 65-year-old Brent Norriss who died after being struck by a vehicle while cycling on State Highway 2 between Wellington and Hutt Valley. Police enquiries into the crash on 3 February are continuing. Protest organiser Patrick Morgan, from the Cycling Action Network said proper infrastructure needed to be built \u2013 including barriers \u2013 to protect cyclists in the region, and around New Zealand. Currently only paint is used to mark cycle paths on State Highway 2 and many cyclists say they feel they are gambling with their lives when they get on their bikes. \u201cPaint is not protection.\u201d Morgan said. In 2016, five cyclists died on New Zealand roads, 169 were seriously injured and 560 suffered minor injuries in police-reported crashes, according to the Ministry of Transport. According to the New Zealand Transport Association, cycling is the the fastest growing mode of transport in cities and towns across New Zealand, including Wellington and Christchurch. Census 2013 showed cycling to work in Wellington had increased by 73% since 2006, to 3.6%, while in Christchurch 5.8% of the city\u2019s employees travelled to work by bike, up from 5.3% in 2006. But as cycling\u2019s popularity has increased, so too have tensions with drivers and other road users, including several recent incidents of motorists verbally abusing cyclists and threatening to run them off the road. Late last year the mayor of the South Island city of Dunedin called for calm after a series of aggressive altercations between drivers and cyclists on narrow harbour roads.

      "bodyText": "Growing a beard, wearing a veil or accidentally visiting a foreign website were among the justifications for sending Uighurs to China\u2019s notorious detention camps, according to a leaked database, casting doubt on Beijing\u2019s claim to be conducting a re-education campaign to root out extremism. The newly revealed database \u2013 known as the \u201cKarakax list\u201d after the county where it was compiled \u2013 comprises 137 pages and exposes in detail the main reasons for the detention of more than 300 people on the edge of Xinjiang\u2019s Taklamakan desert. On the database, detainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid, well-defined categories. Households are designated as \u201ctrustworthy\u201d or \u201cnot trustworthy,\u201d and their attitudes are graded as \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d. Families have \u201clight\u201d or \u201cheavy\u201d religious \u201catmospheres\u201d, and the document keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are in prison or have been sent to a \u201ctraining centre\u201d. Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was, even if they had not committed any crimes. Other reasons listed for internment include \u201cminor religious infection\u201d, \u201cdisturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons\u201d, \u201crelatives abroad\u201d, \u201cthinking is hard to grasp\u201d and \u201cuntrustworthy person born in a certain decade\u201d. The last seems to refer to younger men, according to an analysis of the data by Adrian Zenz, an expert on the detention centres who compiled a report on the Karakax list. \u201cIt underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government, and how the government criminalises everything,\u201d said Zenz. The most recent date in the document is March 2019. The detainees listed come from Karakax County, a traditional settlement of about 650,000 people where more than 97% of the population are Uighur. The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, Chinese identity verification tools, and other lists and documents seen by the Associated Press. The database indicates much of the information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques, sent to visit homes and posted in communities. This information is then compiled in a dossier called the \u201cthree circles\u201d, encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background. It showed that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad, getting a passport, installing foreign software or clicking on a link to a foreign website. The database also emphasises that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention \u2014 not just political extremism, as authorities claim, but ordinary activities such as praying, attending a mosque, or even growing a long beard. It also shows the role of family: People with detained relatives were far more likely to end up in a camp themselves, uprooting and criminalising entire families. Similarly, family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behaviour in whether they are released. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that religious practice is being targeted,\u201d said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang. \u201cThey want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation.\u201d The leak of the database follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works. The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, showed that the centres were in fact forced ideological and behavioural re-education camps run in secret. Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention. China has sought for decades to control the far western region of Xinjiang, where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing\u2019s heavy-handed rule. After militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang\u2019s capital in 2014, President Xi Jinping launched a so-called \u201cPeople\u2019s War on Terror\u201d, transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state. The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes sent by AP requesting comment on the latest database leak. Asked whether Xinjiang was targeting religious people and their families, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said \u201cthis kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on\u201d. Beijing has said before that the detention centres are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion. Associated Press contributed to this report",

On Tuesday, Morrison told reporters in Melbourne the report in the Australian was \u201cvery speculative\u201d, but said it was true that emissions reductions were achieved through technology, not \u201cmeetings\u201d. The Australian suggested Morrison favoured a technology investment target as a way to help Australia resist an international push for a more explicit commitment to reduce emissions to net zero by mid-century at the next major UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The government is expected to soon release what it calls a technology investment roadmap, but has said little about what it will entail.

Under that deal, countries agreed to keep global heating above pre-industrial levels below 2C and to pursue policies to restrict it to 1.5C. Morrison has begun the political year torn between moderate Liberals attempting to build traction internally for the government to increase climate action and resistance from the Nationals, who want more government support for coal-fired power. Cabinet discussions have explored how to reposition the government\u2019s climate policies, with a focus on technology, as the bushfire crisis caused a spike in concern about the environment and a hit to Morrison\u2019s popularity. At a press conference on Tuesday, Morrison reiterated that Australia would not make commitments without \u201chaving thoroughly looked at what is the impact on jobs\u201d. Asked if an investment target would create tension with those who want a net zero emissions commitment, Morrison said \u201ccurrently no one can tell me that going down that path won\u2019t cost jobs, won\u2019t put up your electricity prices, and won\u2019t impact negatively on jobs in the economies of rural and regional Australia\u201d.

Described as a \u201cfinal drunken hurrah\u201d, the app\u2019s last broadcast was watched by 28,000 people after the company told employees last Friday it would shut down due to lack of funding. Launched in 2017, HQ Trivia drew millions of players with a format where a live host asked trivia questions and cracked jokes in a 15-minute quiz. Players around the world answered a series of increasingly difficult questions, with winners splitting a shared prize pool that rose as high as US$400,000. However, on Saturday the app hosted its final game, with a princely $5 prize from host Matt Richards\u2019 own pocket eventually split by 523 contestants. Hosts Richards and Anna Roisman drank as they asked viewers to hire them and the other laid-off staff, and briefly sang a modified version of the song Memory from Cats.

My dogs are going to starve!\u201d \u201cThis is so sad,\u201d he said as he opened a bottle of champagne that had been saved for the game hitting the 3 million player milestone. \u201cWe should have unionised a long time ago.\u201d Roisman added: \u201cThis is fucking awful.\u201d In a company-wide email on Friday, CEO Rus Yusupov said that the app had initially secured a buyer, but they \u201csuddenly changed their position\u201d on Thursday, making the app financially untenable. \u201cLead investors are no longer willing to fund the company, and so effective today HQ will cease operations and move to dissolution,\u201d he said in an email obtained by CNN Business. \u201cWe received an offer from an established business to acquire HQ and continue building our vision, had definitive agreements and legal docs, and a projected closing date of tomorrow, and for reasons we are still investigating, they suddenly changed their position and despite our best efforts, we were unable to reach an agreement.\u201d On the app\u2019s final broadcast, Richards and Roisman paid tribute to the app\u2019s longstanding fans, and shared their grief over the game\u2019s end. \u201cGive these people jobs,\u201d Roisman said of the app\u2019s remaining staff. \u201cAnd us. Hire me. I\u2019ll host anything you want.\u201d Richards pointed out on Twitter that the \u201cafter dark\u201d version of the show, which they were hosting at the time of their final broadcast, was \u201calways about jokes and being silly\u201d. Over its lifetime, the app has handed out a cumulative $6m in prizes to its players.",

      "bodyText": "Fossil fuel giant Santos, two of the major banks and Nine Entertainment were among the big corporates that paid tens of thousands of dollars to mix with Labor and Liberal politicians through party business forums in the lead-up to the 2019 federal election. The major parties have long relied on business forum and observer programs as a significant source of funds, selling memberships and subscriptions to companies in exchange for access to events, special policy briefings and boardroom meetings. Paying for business forum memberships typically gives businesses the chance to mingle with leading political figures in both parties, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison. The forums are decried by critics as an opaque system of cash for access, but businesses say they are a completely legitimate way to discuss and understand party policy, and share the experience, expertise and priorities of industry. The parties do not typically disclose who has paid for a membership or attended specific events. But new analysis of the latest donation disclosures by Queensland Greens MP Michael Berkman suggests about 114 companies and lobby groups may have purchased business forum memberships to access the Labor or Liberal parties in 2018-19, worth a total of $4.7m. \u201cThat\u2019s more access than an ordinary person gets in a lifetime,\u201d Berkman said. \u201cNo wonder people are fed up with politics.\u201d Nine Entertainment, the owners of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, confirmed it paid $27,500 to each party for membership of business forums in 2018-19. \u201cWe have been a member of both forums for a number of years,\u201d a Nine spokeswoman said. \u201cWe work with both sides of parliament on issues which effect our industry.\u201d Nine was last year criticised for hosting an event for the Liberal party\u2019s business forum, the Australian Business Network, at its Willoughby headquarters. Santos also confirmed it paid Labor $55,000 and the Liberals $27,500 for business forum memberships. The company said it was also a member of the business forum for the Nationals. \u201cThese forums have transparent membership fees and services, and provide the opportunity to discuss important public policy issues not only with politicians, but with other members of the business community,\u201d a Santos spokeswoman said. \u201cThe involvement of a wide range of businesses in these forums helps to ensure that campaign funds are received from multiple sources with wide-ranging policy positions and interests so that no single interest unduly influences the political process.\u201d Commonwealth Bank and Westpac are also still paying for business forum memberships. Commonwealth Bank paid Labor and the Liberals each $55,000. Westpac\u2019s annual report says it purchased business forum memberships in the year up to September 2019 as part of its $166,650 total political expenditure. Other companies that have previously confirmed involvement in business forums include Bupa, PwC, Woodside, the Minerals Council of Australia, Macquarie Group, Optus, Westpac and Pfizer. Berkman is using the analysis to support his proposal to ban corporate donations in Queensland. His bill is due before Queensland parliament on Tuesday but is unlikely to pass. \u201cI hope my state colleagues reading this recognise that it\u2019s completely ridiculous to suggest corporations donating to political parties don\u2019t expect anything in return when we\u2019ve got some of the biggest corporations in Australia paying $27k, $55k and $110k for special meetings.\u201d",

Abid Hussain, ACE\u2019s director of diversity, said there had to be \u201csignificant improvement\u201d in these two areas.</p> <p>ACE has been publishing diversity data for five years but has often been accused of merely talking instead of taking strong action. The language this year is significantly more robust. Hussain said organisations would have to start setting \u201cstretching\u201d diversity targets, to be agreed with the council, and if these were not met they could lose public money.</p> <p>\u201cThe pace of change has been too slow,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain communities are significantly under-represented and we need to change that. We need to be very clear: if organisations are not delivering, they could lose their funding. There has been a lot of development support for organisations to get to grips with the challenges. We are moving to a point where targets are going to be set and if organisations are not delivering or meeting targets there will be implications and repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Details of the targets are expected to be revealed in April and they are as likely to be as challenging for big arts organisations as for small ones. Hussain said: \u201cMy frustration is that we have seen a very slow pace of change in the larger organisations that receive funding. We have to see a higher level of expectation to make sure they are reflecting the diversity of their local communities.\u201d</p> <p>The diversity report contains statistics on all aspects of diversity in the sector. On gender, the report shows 47% of the workforce is female and that 52% of national portfolio organisations are run by female chief executives. Forty-five per cent of artistic directors and 40% of chairs are women.</p> <p>There is also a breakdown of data geographically and by art form. The report shows that dance has the highest proportion of BME employees, at 18%, and the lowest proportion of disabled workers (3%). Museums have the lowest BME workforce at 6%.</p> <p>The report says women make up at least 32% of the workforce in music and men 41%, with 6% identifying as non-binary and the rest of the respondents preferring not to say. The Midlands has the lowest proportion of staff who define as LGBT (4%) and London has the highest (8%).</p> <p>All arts organisations are required to integrate diversity into programming in order to get funding. In 2018 ACE introduced a four-point scale measuring their success, ranging from \u201cnot met\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d.</p> <p>For the first time ACE is publishing individual ratings in the report. \u201cNot met\u201d accounts for 1% of the portfolio and includes the British Youth Opera, London International Mime Festival, the National Horseracing Museum and the National Youth Jazz Orchestra.</p> <p>The Royal Opera House, which receives one of the largest sums of annual public funding \u2013 \u00a324m \u2013 got a \u201cmet\u201d rating. Among its workforce, 11% are BME and 3% disabled.</p> <p>Five per cent of organisations had an outstanding rating, including Graeae Theatre Company, Midlands Arts Centre, Paraorchestra and Friends, and Rich Mix Cultural Centre.</p> <p>ACE\u2019s measuring of diversity data will become more detailed when this year it begins monitoring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/dec/16/arts-council-takes-steps-to-tackle-working-class-gaps-in-workforce\">socio-economic background of employees</a>.</p> <p>Serota said there had been progress over the years \u201cbut we must now all act with greater determination to remove the persistent inequalities in our boards, our workforce and our audiences that are holding back opportunity and achievement in our sector.\u201d</p> <p>Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder and artistic director of Europe\u2019s first BME-majority orchestra, said national portfolio organisations had a responsibility to get diversity right. \u201cIt comes down to the fundamentals like recruitment and commissioning new work, as well as participation. Who are these arts leaders talking to? Are they going to these so-called hard to reach communities?</p> <p>\u201cThe scrutiny on diversity is greater than it ever was. There is increasing transparency and perhaps now that the stakes are higher, with the possibility of funding cuts, the pressure will be on to deliver on their promises of inclusion.\u201d</p>",

On gender, the report shows 47% of the workforce is female and that 52% of national portfolio organisations are run by female chief executives. Forty-five per cent of artistic directors and 40% of chairs are women. There is also a breakdown of data geographically and by art form. The report shows that dance has the highest proportion of BME employees, at 18%, and the lowest proportion of disabled workers (3%). Museums have the lowest BME workforce at 6%. The report says women make up at least 32% of the workforce in music and men 41%, with 6% identifying as non-binary and the rest of the respondents preferring not to say. The Midlands has the lowest proportion of staff who define as LGBT (4%) and London has the highest (8%). All arts organisations are required to integrate diversity into programming in order to get funding. In 2018 ACE introduced a four-point scale measuring their success, ranging from \u201cnot met\u201d to \u201coutstanding\u201d. For the first time ACE is publishing individual ratings in the report. \u201cNot met\u201d accounts for 1% of the portfolio and includes the British Youth Opera, London International Mime Festival, the National Horseracing Museum and the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. The Royal Opera House, which receives one of the largest sums of annual public funding \u2013 \u00a324m \u2013 got a \u201cmet\u201d rating. Among its workforce, 11% are BME and 3% disabled. Five per cent of organisations had an outstanding rating, including Graeae Theatre Company, Midlands Arts Centre, Paraorchestra and Friends, and Rich Mix Cultural Centre. ACE\u2019s measuring of diversity data will become more detailed when this year it begins monitoring the socio-economic background of employees. Serota said there had been progress over the years \u201cbut we must now all act with greater determination to remove the persistent inequalities in our boards, our workforce and our audiences that are holding back opportunity and achievement in our sector.\u201d Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder and artistic director of Europe\u2019s first BME-majority orchestra, said national portfolio organisations had a responsibility to get diversity right. \u201cIt comes down to the fundamentals like recruitment and commissioning new work, as well as participation. Who are these arts leaders talking to? Are they going to these so-called hard to reach communities? \u201cThe scrutiny on diversity is greater than it ever was. There is increasing transparency and perhaps now that the stakes are higher, with the possibility of funding cuts, the pressure will be on to deliver on their promises of inclusion.\u201d",
