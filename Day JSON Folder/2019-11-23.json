To reach another final, the team will have to beat the brilliant Spanish team on home soil, spearheaded by Rafael Nadal.</p> <p>Yesterday, Great Britain came through an evenly-matched tie against Germany with two brilliant performance. First, Kyle Edmund produced a majestic display of attacking tennis, bulldozing Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets. Then Dan Evans shook off his opening two losses to see off Jan Lennard Struff, the top ranked singles player of the tie, in a third set tiebreak.</p> <p>With Rafael Nadal standing across the net against Evans tonight, the key to victory will almost certainly rest on the opening match between Edmund and Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. Carre\u00f1o has taken Spain\u2019s second singles spot in tragic circumstances after No 9 Roberto Bautista Agut was forced to withdraw from the knockout stages after the death of his father. Carre\u00f1o, a former top 10 player himself, struggled in yesterday\u2019s three sets loss to Guido Pella. Given the form he has established in his previous two matches, Edmund should like his chances on these fast courts.</p> <p>Andy Murray will have to settle for a spot on the bench tonight, but after the form showed by his teammates yesterday, he will almost certainly understand that it was the obvious and correct decision. Look forward to plenty of fistpumping from him throughout the evening.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T16:12:37.799Z\">at 4.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report on a dramatic night in Madrid. That loss will be tough to take, but that should go down as a strong effort from the British team. Their recent Davis Cup success has been driven by the strength of Andy Murray at the peak of his career. This week, Murray played only one rubber but his teammates stepped up and showed their strength in depth across both singles and doubles to reach the semi-final this week and nearly even more. Well done to all. Rafael Nadal: Well, here we are. This competition is dramatic and with this new format even more. Things were really close and we were not able to have one break in the entire match... We are super, super happy, it has been an amazing and unforgettable evening. Astonishing effort from Spain to move into the final and particularly from Rafael Nadal who dragged his team into the final with an astonishing performance. The Spaniards saved four set points in the third set and few watching will forget the way Nadal single-handedly saved the set point on Skupski\u2019s serve at 5-6*. Given his age, one of the great seasons in tennis history continues. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 (8-9*) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Jamie Murray saves the match point by forcing a Nadal backhand error with forehand volley. But at 8-8, Lopez produces one of his best returns of the match. Breathtaking drama right now. Second match point. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 (*7-8) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Nadal saved the set point with a bomb of an inside out forehand winner after a frantic struggle. Nadal then fired down a big unreturned serve to bring up match point. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 (*7-6) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): A fourth set point for Great Britain here after an easy volley winner from Murray. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 (*6-6) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Incredible play from Nadal to save a second set point. Murray had a simple volley over the net, but he framed the volley. Nadal chased the volley down, lobbed Murray at the net and then dispatched the overhead. Astonishing scenes. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 (*4-3) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Incredible scenes as Nadal attempts to challenge an unreturned serve by Skupski, only for the umpire to the deny the call because she felt it was too late. Nadal was completely enraged. He called out the umpire, repeatedly screaming: \u201cFaster? Impossible!\u201d He responded by slamming down a serve to level the tiebreak, but a brilliant volley from Skupski produces the first mini-break. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-6 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): We\u2019re going to a tiebreak, but some agonising moments on Nadal\u2019s serve there. With the score at 30-30, Lopez had the easiest overhead in the world on top of the net, but he somehow blasted it far out. On set point, Skupski produced a brilliant return and proceeded to go blow for blow with Nadal in a frantic point, but Nadal slipped a forehand down the line past Murray to save the set point. Two big serves later, the Spaniards held. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 6-5* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Murray and Skupski piece together yet another love service game on Skupski\u2019s serve. According to Eurosport commentator Barry Cowan, the Spaniards have missed a third of their returns today. Before he can even finish his sentence, Nadal slams a backhand return into the net. The Brits have served as well as they can and they will do no worse than another tiebreak here. Can they get it done? Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) *5-5 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): The Brits continue to pile on the pressure create opportunities wherever they can. This time, Jamie Murray produced an incredible reflex volley followed by a lunging forehand passing shot to bring up 30-30. The opportunity only lasted a millisecond as Lopez slammed down a huge serve at 30-30, then produced a great first volley at 40-30. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 5-4* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): There is not much to say about Great Britain on serve except that both Skupski and Murray are serving extremely well and picking off every last return at the net. As Murray slams down another love hold, they have lost just two points on serve all set. The pressure will rest heavily on the shoulders of the Spaniards here. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) *4-4 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): It\u2019s midnight in Madrid but the crowd is as loud as it has been throughout this entire week as Nadal slams down another hold to 30. He very nearly whipped an insane forehand around the netpost, but he instead he has to settle for more great serving. Nadal keeps on imploring the crowd to scream at the top of its lungs and so far it is obliging. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 4-3* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Skupski continues to serve incredibly well, breezing through an easy love hold. The Brit picked a brilliant overhead from high out of the sky at 30-0 before sealing the love hold by acing Nadal. They move on. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) *3-3 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Lopez allows the Spaniards to breathe after two complicated holds from deuce. Enormous serving from the Spaniard throughout, with Nadal picking off an easy volley to seal the love hold. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 3-2* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): There has been a clear shift in the second set. The Brits are piling on the pressure in their return games while breezing through their service games. Another easy service game for Murray with plenty of big serving. The question is whether they can make this momentum count as no tennis player in the world is as good at wrestling momentum back in their favour as Nadal. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) *2-2 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): These are tense moments, with the Brits putting so much pressure on the Spaniards now. At 30-30, Lopez fumbled a volley at 30-30 to bring up break point on Nadal\u2019s serve. Both Murray and Skupski fired stroke after stroke towards Lopez at the net, who miraculously held them off and saved the break point. The opportunity was gone as quickly as it arrived. Nadal closed the game with some huge serving, including a 133mph(!) ace to finish. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 2-1* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Skupski is finding plenty of joy in his service games now. It\u2019s partly down to the magic hands of his partner at the net - Murray opened the game a glorious volley, deflecting a huge forehand return by Nadal with a no-look angled drop volley. However, Skupski is also serving extremely well and he ploughed through another quick hold to 15. It must be said that the returning from both teams have left a lot to be desired in this match, but it certainly doesn\u2019t help that the courts are so fast. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) *1-1 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Lopez holds, but the Brits should take plenty of encouragement from that tight deuce game. Lopez missed a couple of first serves and the Brits made them pay, forcing him to 30-30 for the very first time. But at 30-30, Nadal produced a brilliant angled backhand volley past Skupski. Skupski responded with a searing forehand return winner to push Lopez to deuce, but the Spaniard slammed down two big first serves in succession to eradicate the danger. We\u2019ll see if they can keep on producing that quality under pressure. Second set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-7(3) 1-0* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): The Spaniards left the court for the bathroom and the break seems to have served the Brits well. Jamie Murray eased through the opening service game with more great serving to edge ahead. It will be interesting to see if the Brits serving first in this set makes any difference. It has to be said - Nadal may well be more entertaining on a doubles court than in singles. The difference between his level of intensity and the other three players on the court is so great. Most doubles teams tend to be understated and positive. Meanwhile, Nadal is pumping his fists as if his life depends on it. Tiebreaks can turn on moments of magic, but also luck. At 4-2, Lopez shanked a forehand passing shot that both Brits thought was flying out. It just landed in. As Lopez apologized, Nadal roared to the heavens. And that was that. After an incredibly tight match, it was the Spaniards who played a faultless tiebreak and stand one set from the final. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-6 (2-4) Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): A moment of magic from Nadal at 1-0 has turned this tiebreak in Spain\u2019s favour. He finally landed a brilliant dipping forehand return before slipping a forehand winner up the line. Nadal followed it up with two brilliant serves to lead 4-1. A great serve from Skupski brings one back. Only one mini-break is in this. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 6-6 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): We\u2019re heading to a tiebreak! Another quick hold from Skupski, who has been nearly as dominant on serve as Lopez since his opening service game. Nadal has been surprisingly poor on return, continually moving back and not looking too confident there. Let\u2019s see if that changes in the tiebreak... First set: J.Murray/Skupski *5-6 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Tense, tense moments as Nadal saves break point to hold and keep Spain ahead. It was Skupski who brought up the break point, crushing a bullet forehand winner down the line as Lopez errantly crossed the net. But Nadal is serving extremely well and he saved the break point with a sliding serve out wide. It took a couple of game points, but on the second, Lopez came up with an incredible reflex backhand volley, which just dribbled over. The crowd is loud. Nadal is pumped. A tiebreak beckons. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 5-5* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Jamie Murray continues to be deadly on his serve and he strolls to yet another love hold. Both Brits are volleying extremely well so far, with Murray bringing up 40-0 with a sweet backhand volley winner straight down the middle. After a missed forehand volley from Lopez at 40-0, we\u2019re level again. Lopez has been the weak link in every part of the court aside from his serve, but he sure does serve well. First set: J.Murray/Skupski *4-5 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): After some tight service games at the beginning, this set is moving fast with big serving and plenty of quick points. This time, it\u2019s Lopez\u2019s turn to slam down a love hold. Enormous serving from him and the few returns that come back are being dealt with by Nadal. The pressure builds... First set: J.Murray/Skupski 4-4* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): A quick love hold from Skupski, who really seems to be growing in confidence. Great serving from the Brit throughout, with Murray picking off all weak responses to the net. First set: J.Murray/Skupski *3-4 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Nadal strings together a much better service game, holding to love with a swinging ace out wide. More great serving from Nadal, with Lopez cleaning up well at the net. Skupski will be looking for a first simple hold of his own. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 3-3* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Jamie Murray strings together an easy hold of his own, slamming down an ace at 30-0. Nadal absolutely clobbered a forehand return winner down the line at 40-0, but then Lopez netted a forehand return of his own. Lopez has returned quite horribly so far, with very few even clearing the net. That may eventually hurt them. First set: J.Murray/Skupski *2-3 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): No problems for Lopez on his serve. He is by far the biggest server on the court and Nadal is having plenty of fun picking off the loose balls his serve elicits. The pressure falls straight back onto the shoulders of the Brits. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 2-2* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Skupski pulls off a brilliant hold, fending off break point to level the match. It took him five game points with the Brit finding a heck of a lot more joy when serving against Lopez at deuce, only for Nadal to produce numerous incredible returns on game point to drag the game back to deuce. After four missed game points, Skupski finally found two effective serves against Nadal to hold on. First set: J.Murray/Skupski *1-2 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Nadal has also picked up where he left off against Evans with some good serving to hold his opening service game. After the Spaniards moved up 30-0, the Brits responded with two brilliant returns in a row - Murray nailed a brilliant backhand return down the line, then Skupski crushed an inside out forehand return winner. But Nadal found a huge serve down the T at 30-30, which Lopez happily picked off. He found two more big serves from deuce, with Skupski\u2019s return flying out on game point to seal the hold. Aside from the Spanish team, the big question mark is Neal Skupski, who is playing in his first Davis Cup tie and has never played in an atmosphere like this. Let\u2019s see how he handles this first service game. First set: J.Murray/Skupski 1-1* Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Nadal has started the match the way he ended the last, firing a forehand winner past Skupski at the net and then drilling a backhand return straight at the Brit to immediately move to 0-30. But Jamie Murray responded with four great serves to dig out a hold. Both Spaniards are took some huge swings and Lopez very nearly buried a backhand down the line return winner at 30-30, but Great Britain will take that. First set: J.Murray/Skupski *0-1 Nadal/Lopez (GBR 1-1 ESP): Feliciano Lopez opens up Spain\u2019s account with a brilliant opening service game. Plenty of enormous serving from the Spaniard already, but he also executed a beautiful low volley at 30-15 before slamming down the overhead. After a great second serve to the body, Nadal picked off an easy forehand volley to put the Spanish pair on the board. Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez are old friends and played quite a lot of doubles together when they were younger but they have paired up only once since 2008 (Stuttgart 2015). Their record together isn\u2019t great, with only one final in 2005. Their only Davis Cup doubles match together was a 4-6 6-4 6-2 4-6 9-7 loss to Bracciali/Galimberi in Spain\u2019s 3-2 win over Italy in 2005. In other words, it\u2019s difficult to know how they will gel together and J. Murray/Skupski will have to figure them out as the match goes on. What we do know is that Nadal is an excellent doubles player - by far the best doubles player of the big four - and Lopez won the French Open in 2016. Let\u2019s see how this goes. The players are now warming up. We have the official Spanish pairing. As with their first singles rubber, it\u2019s a bit of a shock. Nadal has paired with Marcel Granollers in the previous two rubbers, winning both matches. Today, he will take to the court with Feliciano Lopez. Still no news on the doubles lineups, but play will resume at 21:05 GMT. Rafael Nadal after his big win: Have been a tough, tough first set. He played great, changing the rhythm and played aggressive. [After breaking for the set at 5-4]: I think I started to play with more freedom on the shots, the ball started to go in the right places. Super happy for the victory and I hope we can play another great match in the doubles. Spain\u2019s doubles lineup is yet to be confirmed, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that he won\u2019t step out onto the court if he is in any good shape. Evans played extremely well for eight games, but as soon as the world number one flipped into gear, it was all over. An awesome display from the world number one. It\u2019s time for some doubles. Second set: Dan Evans 4-6 *0-5 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Since the opening couple of games, Nadal has been unimpeachable on his serve. He is serving incredibly well but also serving and volleying behind his serve so frequently. Last week, Nadal became the oldest world number one in history precisely because of how efficient he has become and how much more willing he is to shorten up these points. Second set: Dan Evans 4-6 0-4* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): The answer comes very quickly. Evans is missing first serves, making a few more errors and the tank looks empty. At 15-30, Nadal crushes a glorious inside out forehand winner, then Evans nets a volley after an almighty scramble from Nadal. This is a lesson for Evans. He can play at a high level for a period, but the top level requires that intensity point after point until the end. Second set: Dan Evans 4-6 *0-3 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Credit to Evans for bouncing back from the break immediately and continuing to attack the net. He brought up a 15-30 lead on Nadal\u2019s serve with a sweet chip and charge, dispatching a nice backhand volley at the net. But Nadal is serving too well now. The Spaniard slammed down a few big serves and escaped to consolidate the break. Needless to say, he can play at this level and with this intensity forever. Can Evans? Second set: Dan Evans 4-6 0-2* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Nadal is beginning to return extremely well and the immense pressure from the world number one is finally starting to leave a mark on Evans. Evans reached 40-30, only for Nadal to go on the attack, crushing an overhead to save the first game point. Evans quickly generated another, but he overhit just too much and sent a forehand long. With his return flowing, Nadal brought up his break point with a brilliant crosscourt backhand return. It took a couple of attempts, but on his second break point he crushed an angled forehand crosscourt return winner to take the break. Second set: Dan Evans 4-6 *0-1 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Nadal opens with another quick service game, sealed with more great serving and then a sweet serve and volley on the final point. This continues to be a prickly atmosphere, even by Davis Cup standards, with the players both exchanging words with the umpire. Back to the tennis, Nadal is 48-1 after losing the opening set this year. Again, this is a tough task. First set: Dan Evans 4-6 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): That was a little bit more than a challenging service game for Evans! That was impossible. Nadal opened with huge inside out forehand, then he crushed a forehand down the line return to set up an easy finishing forehand. At 0-30, Nadal found an incredible backhand down the line passing shot off his return. In the blink of an eye, the Brit found himself down three set points. Evans saved the first two break points with aplomb, but on the third he just sent a forehand wide. Just too good from the world number one. First set: Dan Evans *4-5 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Nadal is still serving extremely well and he strolls through another game to move to within a point of victory. An ace down the T at 30-15 and another big serve to hold. Nadal punctuated that hold with huge \u201cvenga!\u201d which means that he is extremely pumped up. A challenging service game for Evans next... First set: Dan Evans 4-4* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Things are getting spicy in the Caja Magica. The crowd is now throwing in a few scattered boos towards Evans and cheering his missed first serves, but he shrugs off their noise and pieces together one of his most positive holds of the day. After two great unreturned first serves, he holds to 15. First set: Dan Evans *3-4 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): As he puts immense pressure on Evans\u2019 serve, Nadal seems to have found a good rhythm on his serve. He is serving well and also frequently serving and volleying now. Nadal has always been great at the net, but he has never come to the net more frequently and it has allowed him to find even more joy on faster courts. First set: Dan Evans 3-3* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): This is only getting tougher, but Evans digs out another tight deuce game to keep himself in the mix. This time, he led 40-15 and then he missed two routine forehands to bring him back to deuce. But he kept on serving well and taking his shots on. It took three more game points, but eventually Nadal dropped a forehand into the net and Evans escaped. First set: Dan Evans *2-3 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): No such problems for Nadal, who pieces together his first love hold of the day with some brilliant serving. An ace, a few unreturned serves and one monster forehand. Easy. First set: Dan Evans 2-2* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): That was impressive. Evans saves a couple of break points to level Nadal again. After immediately falling down 0-30 he executed a beautiful angled drop volley from a low, dipping passing shot. When Nadal brought up his first break point at 30-40, Evans saved the break point with a forehand crosscourt followed by another huge \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019, then a second break point with a big forehand down the line. Evans found a brilliant forehand down the line passing shot to hold. You get the picture. He is taking big cuts at the ball, moving forward and defending extremely well. It has to be that good just to hold serve. First set: Dan Evans *1-2 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): Evans continues to look up for this match and he is playing very well. Nadal led 40-0, only for the the Brit to edge him back with some good returning alongside a couple of errors from the Spaniard. Evans saved the fourth game point with a great down the line forehand, then he crushed a forehand crosscourt to save the fifth. But Nadal never panicked and he is playing positive, aggressive tennis himself. He found two successive aces to hold off the pressure and move ahead again. First set: Dan Evans 1-1* Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): This is a great start from Evans, who eases through great hold to 15. He has already made it clear that he is going to attempt to play this match on the front foot. He opened the game with a great serve and volley, then came in behind a huge forehand down the line at 30-15, finishing the point with an easy overhead. Evans held with an ace. That was about as good as it gets from Evans in his opening service game. Now he just has to do that at least 11 more times! First set: Dan Evans *0-1 Rafael Nadal (GBR 1-0 ESP): A comfortable hold from Nadal to begin. He opened with a vicious combination of forehands, forcing an error from Evans\u2019 backhand with a crosscourt bomb. Evans pushed Nadal to 30-30 and punctuated each point by hollering \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019 to the skies, but the Spaniard found a huge ace down the T at 30-30, then he sealed the hold with a great serve and volley. Rafael Nadal leads the head to head 1-0 over Evans after they played for the first time this summer in Montreal. Evans should take heart from his tight 7-6(6) 6-4 loss to Nadal, but the Spaniard was playing in his first match after Wimbledon and he was certainly a bit rusty. He isn\u2019t now. Nadal completely dismantled Diego Schwartzman yesterday and then came back to clinch the doubles. He has now won 29 straight Davis Cup matches for Spain and he last lost for his country in 2005. This is about as tough as it gets. Evans and Nadal are out on the court. According to Dan Evans in the pre-match interview, he is here to win. Nothing more, nothing less: It\u2019s not about about anything apart from trying to get the win and hopefully not trying to have the doubles guys come on. That\u2019s all we\u2019re focusing on. Some stat. Edmund was understated as usual after the match but he was clearly very pleased: \u201cWhen you start off the match in this situation. It\u2019s just a lot of noise, obviously full house tonight and obviously they come to support Feli. I just had to be really, really focused and I got off to a good start.\u201d Edmund\u2019s stats tonight: 69% first serves in, 74% first serves won, 9 aces, 19(!) forehand winners and 19 unforced errors. A crucial point for Great Britain with Dan Evans now facing the unenviable task of beating Rafael Nadal for the win. Individually, no matter what happens, Edmund has ensured that he will go into 2020 full of confidence after such a tough season. Impressive resilience from the Brit this week. Edmund comes through a great, essential win to hand Britain the first point today and his third win of the tournament. Another great serving performance from him and he was so clinical in all the complicated moments. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 6-6 (*5-1) Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Great passing shot from Edmund to take a decisive mini-break, then Lopez badly double faulted at 3-1. After a service winner from the Brit, he will serve two points away from victory. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 6-6 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): We\u2019re off to a tiebreak! Edmund opened his final service game of the set with a nice change, throwing in a rare serve and volley himself and easily dispatching the volley. Then he found a big unreturned first serve for 30-0 and then dealt with a tricky high backhand volley to move up 40-0. He sealed the love hold by breaking down Lopez\u2019s weak forehand and eliciting the error. He should take plenty of confidence from what was perhaps his best hold of the set. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *5-6 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Lopez is having no such problems on his own serve. He immediately flitted to 40-15 with some quick big serving and then his 6th ace of the day. On the second game point, he swept into the net behind another big first serve and easily picked off the volley. He\u2019ll do no worse than a tiebreak in this set. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 5-5* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): This has been a tough set on serve for Edmund with plenty of slow starts in his service game. This time, he found himself down 15-40 after spraying a forehand wide. Edmund saved the first break point with an ace down the T, his 9th of the day, then he slammed down an unreturned wide serve to bring the game to deuce. At deuce, he crushed a whistling forehand down the line winner, then he dismounted with another huge forehand to hold. After such a dire year on the main tour, this man is playing with so much confidence right now. No holding back. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *4-5 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): A glorious moment of inspiration from Lopez to dig himself out of a 15-30 hole with aplomb. How did he respond? He found a sweet sliding first serve at 15-30 and swept forward to pick off the volley, then he placed a really nice unreturned second serve into the corner. But it was on the game point that the magic arrived. Lopez sped into the net and just about managed to land a drop volley off a low, dipping passing shot from Edmund. Edmund chased it down and tried to dink his backhand past Lopez, who threw himself to the ball at full stretch and just about landed the volley past him. He walked to his chair with his fist in the sky. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 4-4* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Some great work from the Brit to hold to 30 and put the pressure back on Lopez\u2019s shoulders. He keeps on moving forward when he can and he particularly executed a really nice forehand volley at 30-15, finishing the point with an easy overhead. Lopez took the first game point with a really nice return, but Edmund slammed down a huge inside out forehand winner to keep himself ahead. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *3-4 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): There has been a small shift in this second set. While Edmund has had to battle through a few tricky holds, Lopez is serving big and finding plenty of quick holds on his serve. This time, he holds to 15 in the blink of an eye. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 3-3* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Goodness. That was a huge test for Edmund, but he holds from 15-30 down to keep the set on serve. Down 15-30, Edmund found a first serve and Lopez responded with quite a dire attempt at a blocked return. However, from 30-30 it was all about Edmund. Down to a second serve and with the pressure weighing heavily on his shoulders, Edmund connected with a bomb of a forehand down the line to eradicate the danger. On game point, Lopez chip and charged after a long rally and Edmund found a beautiful angled crosscourt to hold. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *2-3 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Lopez pieces together another solid hold. Edmund opened with a searing backhand down the line passing shot and, whooping towards his team with the hope of driving forward to a decisive break. But Lopez is still serving really well and he eased to a 40-15 lead. Quite a comical drop volley attempt into the net from Lopez on the opening game point, but another big serve keeps him ahead. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 2-2* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Good hold. Edmund is still in the zone on his serve and he quickly connected with a couple of serve and forehand combos to move up 30-0. Lopez attempted to change things up by chipping and charging, but Edmund moved to 40-0 by threading a nice down the line backhand passing shot. Edmund held with another big serve and forehand combination. Meanwhile, Gerard Pique is in the house. He was on double duty today after playing at home for Barcelona against Leganes earlier on. And now he\u2019s back. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *1-2 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Lopez slams down an easy love hold to keep himself ahead. He opened with two really nice serve and volley points, confidently dispatching both volleys, and then slammed down a couple of big serves to take the game. He looks a lot more confident now that he is serving well and making some progress on Edmund\u2019s serve, but so too does the Brit. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 1-1* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): A real test for Edmund there after couple of loose errors moved him to at 15-30 deficit. Edmund responded extremely well: he crushed a backhand winner at 15-30, then at 30-30 he thumped a big crosscourt forehand behind a big first serve. He held after a rare long rally, Lopez\u2019s forehand eventually falling limply into the net. Second Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 *0-1 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): A much better start to this set by Lopez, who holds to 15 with a series of big first serves. He has found a nice rhythm on his serve. If he keeps this up, he will be tougher to break in this set. It is fitting that Edmund started that set with an ace and ended with one. His serving has been brilliant throughout this match so far and it has allowed him to swing freely and attack with few nerves. Lopez began to serve better towards the end of the set and his only hope is if it can keep it up and match Edmund\u2019s serving. First Set: Kyle Edmund 6-3 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Kyle Edmund takes the first set to 15, sealed to 15 with his 8th ace. Edmund\u2019s stats are tremendous: 70% first serves in, 84% of first serves in, 8 aces, 8 forehand winners and just 7 unforced errors. First Set: Kyle Edmund *5-3 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Some very good serving from Lopez now, who streams through a love hold with a series of unreturned serves. Edmund will now attempt to serve this thing out. First Set: Kyle Edmund 5-2* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): No problem for Edmund on serve once again as he moves through a comfortable hold to 15. Lopez opened the game with a good chip and charge on the opening point, forcing a backhand error from Edmund. But it\u2019s clear that he simply cannot hang with Edmund in any of the rallies. Edmund took control, crushing an couple of huge forehands to move up 40-15. He sealed the hold with a big unreturned serve down the T. One game away from the set. First Set: Kyle Edmund *4-2 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Despite his lack of confidence on return, Lopez seems to be finding more belief behind his huge lefty serve as plenty of big serving moved him to 40-0. Edmund edged him back to 40-30 with two quality passing shots, but the Spaniard found a brilliant curling wide serve on the third game point and easily put away the volley. We move on. First Set: Kyle Edmund 4-1* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Another good hold for Edmund, but this one provided his first test of the day. Edmund looked to be cruising up 40-15 until he just lost a bit of concentration, missing a tight backhand volley at 40-15 then shanking a forehand at 40-30. Great work from the Brit from deuce though, finding two big first serves and two huge forehands behind them to hold. Across the net, Lopez seemed to be asking his team for advice on which side to guess as he attempted to return Edmund\u2019s serve. Oh dear. First Set: Kyle Edmund *3-1 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): A good hold for Lopez to finally get himself on the board. A really nice reflex forehand volley winner at 30-0, then he connected with a really nice crosscourt forehand winner for 40-0. Another double fault from Lopez at 40-0, but he held with his second service winner of the game. Much better serving from the Spaniard there and that may help him settle into the match. First Set: Kyle Edmund 3-0* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Edmund\u2019s tremendous serving continues as he easily holds to consolidate the break with just one points lost on serve. The Brit slammed down his fourth and fifth aces in just two service games, then dismounted with a further service winner. This is already ominous for Lopez, who desperately needs to get on the board here. First Set: Kyle Edmund *2-0 Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): Edmund\u2019s start was about as confident as possible, but that was a disastrous opening service game from Lopez. He missed his first volley on the opening point, then Edmund executed a sweet lob to bring up 0-30, then Lopez double faulted for 0-40. After Lopez saved the first break point, Edmund snapped a brilliant crosscourt return winner past the Spaniard as he came steaming into the net. First Set: Kyle Edmund 1-0* Feliciano Lopez (GBR 0-0 ESP): That is how you start a Davis Cup semi-final. Edmund opened with three aces in a row, then slipped to the net on the final point and comfortably put away a forehand volley. An easy love hold from Edmund to begin. Kyle Edmund already had a great opportunity in this first rubber, but on paper it is even bigger now. Although Lopez is the higher-ranked player, that is primarily due to his excellent grass court season, where he shocked himself as well as everyone else by winning Queen\u2019s in both singles and doubles alongside (who else?) Andy Murray. Lopez has been vulnerable on hard courts throughout the year and at 38 years-old he is well aware that the finish line is fast approaching. On the other hand, Lopez showed at Queen\u2019s that he can still bring an extremely high level at certain moments. These conditions are fast and he will have plenty of chances to move forward and attack the net. This tournament may be Lopez\u2019s last singles opportunity in Davis Cup and the Caja Magica is even more of a home to him than his teammates - he is the tournament director of the Madrid Open played at this stadium. Let\u2019s see what he can bring today. Some significant news. Feliciano Lopez will take an injured Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta\u2019s place in the opening rubber. Lopez and Edmund will be heading out to the court any moment now. Here is the official running order for tonight. Due to the late finish, play has been delayed and it seems like the players will be on court in about 45 minutes. Denis Shapovalov is very happy: It\u2019s honestly unbelievable. I\u2019m in a loss of words. It\u2019s incredible how far we\u2019ve come as a squad. Canada have reached their first ever Davis Cup Final! Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-3 3-6 7-6(5) to clinch the tightest of 2-1 victories over Russia. As we prepare for the evening session, the first semi-final between Canada and Russia is going all the way. After Andrey Rublev defeated Vasek Pospisil 6-4 6-4 and Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov responded with a 6-4 4-6 6-4 win over Russia\u2019s Karen Khachanov, they are heading to a third set tiebreak in the deciding doubles rubber. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of semi-final day at the Davis Cup Finals in Madrid, where Great Britain\u2019s quite nice run of opponents comes to an end. To reach another final, the team will have to beat the brilliant Spanish team on home soil, spearheaded by Rafael Nadal. Yesterday, Great Britain came through an evenly-matched tie against Germany with two brilliant performance. First, Kyle Edmund produced a majestic display of attacking tennis, bulldozing Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets. Then Dan Evans shook off his opening two losses to see off Jan Lennard Struff, the top ranked singles player of the tie, in a third set tiebreak. With Rafael Nadal standing across the net against Evans tonight, the key to victory will almost certainly rest on the opening match between Edmund and Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. Carre\u00f1o has taken Spain\u2019s second singles spot in tragic circumstances after No 9 Roberto Bautista Agut was forced to withdraw from the knockout stages after the death of his father. Carre\u00f1o, a former top 10 player himself, struggled in yesterday\u2019s three sets loss to Guido Pella. Given the form he has established in his previous two matches, Edmund should like his chances on these fast courts. Andy Murray will have to settle for a spot on the bench tonight, but after the form showed by his teammates yesterday, he will almost certainly understand that it was the obvious and correct decision. Look forward to plenty of fistpumping from him throughout the evening.",

But the mobilisation is beyond our wildest dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Then there\u2019s social media, where the Tories are making much more effort than they did in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories have invested so much more in terms of social media \u2026they\u2019re spending much more money than us \u2026 but keep cocking it up.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\" title=\"\">doctored video of Keir Starmer</a> was followed by Conservative campaign headquarters rebadging its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/twitter-accuses-tories-of-misleading-public-in-factcheck-row\" title=\"\">Twitter account as \u201cfactcheck UK</a>\u201d during last week\u2019s leaders\u2019 TV debate. \u201cStudent politics stuff,\u201d sniffs McDonnell.

You can\u2019t trust a word he [Boris Johnson] says. Boris is Marmite on the doorstep.

So it does require a huge response. We've got these weeks to get that message across'</p> <footer> <cite>John McDonnell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McDonnell instantly blames elements of the media. \u201cThey\u2019ve had that extra couple of years of a full brutal assault on him, all the time.\u201d He has to believe that Corbyn-sceptical and Corbyn-loathing voters will reconsider the Labour leader as the campaign progresses. \u201cJeremy is doing his rallies all around the country \u2026. You\u2019ll see much more of Jeremy in the national media now. And not just being seen in a white coat, like Boris with the stunts with boxing gloves. Much more quiet conversations on the sofa \u2026 Just get across the image of the man. When they [the voters] see that, they\u2019re reassured.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/whats-in-the-labour-party-manifesto\" title=\"\">Labour has just published its manifesto</a>, a prospectus that doubles down on the 2017 version by adding a slew of huge additional spending promises. \u201cIt is radical,\u201d says the shadow chancellor. More radical than the last one? \u201cYeah, in some ways it is.\u201d</p> <p>Last time around, the manifestos proved to be the inflection point of the campaign. Labour was energised by its launch; the Tory campaign imploded soon after theirs. McDonnell and the rest of the Labour leadership team are hoping that history will repeat itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened last time, as soon as the manifesto was out there, that did start to turn things. Because we started getting on to real policies.\u201d</p> <p>In conversation with us, he announces another large spending commitment, one omitted from the manifesto, saying he will compensate older females, often called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/03/older-women-pensions-retirement-age\" title=\"\">\u201cthe Waspi women\u201d</a>, who lost out when the state pension age for men and women was equalised. \u201cWe\u2019re recognising this is a historic injustice that we think we have a debt of honour to address.\u201d He puts the cost to the taxpayer at \u00a358bn.</p> <p>That\u2019s on top of many other spending commitments that Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls \u201ccolossal\u201d and incapable of being paid for simply by raising taxes on the rich and business. There\u2019s also some polling evidence that the scale of Labour\u2019s promises are leaving many voters unconvinced, because they don\u2019t believe the party could possibly deliver them.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that,\u201d he responds. \u201cThe problems we face, the issues that we face, are big. They\u2019re huge. So it does require a huge response. We\u2019ve got these weeks to get that message across. But you\u2019re right. We talk about billions. People just switch off. So the issue for us is translating that into what does it mean in your local area \u2026 so people don\u2019t think the big numbers are just unreal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a068361af937ad0fcd2ee7148af9082d1d5cc4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a068361af937ad0fcd2ee7148af9082d1d5cc4b/7_59_4853_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn in Stoke on Trent on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn in Stoke on Trent on Friday. McDonnell believes, by not forcing his own views on others, the Labour leader can bring people together over the vexed issue of Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tories are hoping to win Labour seats in the party\u2019s historic heartlands with Johnson\u2019s cry of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Labour\u2019s gamble is that \u201cthe salience of other issues is more important than Brexit\u201d. McDonnell contends: \u201cThe two big ones, which is health and education, have a greater salience for the Labour Leave voters than Brexit itself \u2026. It is about security as well \u2013 police cuts and stuff like that. Also, climate change does come up on the doorstep.\u201d</p> <p>Labour is now committed to a fresh referendum on Brexit that would put Remain up against whatever kind of new withdrawal deal a Labour government could negotiate with the EU. McDonnell tells us that the negotiations would be led by himself, Corbyn and Starmer. Crucial to any renegotiation would be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/how-immigration-became-britains-most-toxic-political-issue\" title=\"\">subject of immigration</a>, which is known to divide senior figures in the party. Does he accept that to achieve the closer relationship with Europe that Labour says it would seek, Britain would have to accept a continuation of freedom of movement?</p> <p>McDonnell turns opaque: \u201cIt will be a negotiating issue.\u201d He goes on: \u201cOf course, we welcome the principles of free movement, but we also recognise that there are issues that have to be addressed.\u201d Whatever new deal a Labour government might come up with, he says he is a Remainer. \u201cI\u2019ve made this point time and time again. I can\u2019t see a better deal than that [remaining within the EU], but the party will make the decision once we come to the deal.\u201d</p> <p>No one can say what Corbyn would do, because he is continuing to refuse to say whether he is for or against Brexit. On Friday night he said he would adopt a \u201cneutral stance\u201d in a referendum campaign. When Labour\u2019s candidate for the premiership won\u2019t express a view about such a defining question, doesn\u2019t it make him ridiculous?

      "bodyText": "One of the lesser-known facts about John McDonnell is that he began training as a Catholic priest before deciding against the vocation in his teens when he discovered girlfriends and the disadvantages of celibacy. Does his party need some kind of miracle to win this election? It is not hard to find Labour people who think so. \u201cI do believe in miracles,\u201d says the shadow chancellor. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need a miracle. \u201cLast time, at this stage of the campaign, I was getting lots of phone calls from colleagues saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be wiped out and [we\u2019re] really worried\u2019. We\u2019re at that stage now. I\u2019m getting the phone calls which are saying: \u2018I think, at best, [Labour will be the] largest party [in parliament]\u2019. Then people saying: \u2018Actually, on the doorstep, it doesn\u2019t feel like the polls\u2019.\u201d He makes the Labour optimist\u2019s case for the way in which the campaign is unfolding. \u201cMobilisation on the ground is huge. Despite the weather. The drawback for us is that being a December election, evening canvassing is in the dark. So you\u2019re approaching someone\u2019s house with a torch and frightening each other on the doorstep. That makes it tougher. But the mobilisation is beyond our wildest dreams.\u201d Then there\u2019s social media, where the Tories are making much more effort than they did in 2017. \u201cThe Tories have invested so much more in terms of social media \u2026they\u2019re spending much more money than us \u2026 but keep cocking it up.\u201d A doctored video of Keir Starmer was followed by Conservative campaign headquarters rebadging its Twitter account as \u201cfactcheck UK\u201d during last week\u2019s leaders\u2019 TV debate. \u201cStudent politics stuff,\u201d sniffs McDonnell. Tory fakery, he argues, only delivers \u201cmore attention on our agenda \u2013 which is: you can\u2019t trust the Tories\u201d. On the doorstep, he claims, \u201cit comes across the whole time. You can\u2019t trust a word he [Boris Johnson] says. Boris is Marmite on the doorstep. Absolute Marmite\u201d. The trouble for Labour is that this is at least as true of Jeremy Corbyn, another leader who dramatically polarises opinion. There are people who love the thought of prime minister Corbyn. But, if the polls are anything like correct, there are more who are repelled by the idea. And their numbers have grown since the election in 2017. McDonnell instantly blames elements of the media. \u201cThey\u2019ve had that extra couple of years of a full brutal assault on him, all the time.\u201d He has to believe that Corbyn-sceptical and Corbyn-loathing voters will reconsider the Labour leader as the campaign progresses. \u201cJeremy is doing his rallies all around the country \u2026. You\u2019ll see much more of Jeremy in the national media now. And not just being seen in a white coat, like Boris with the stunts with boxing gloves. Much more quiet conversations on the sofa \u2026 Just get across the image of the man. When they [the voters] see that, they\u2019re reassured.\u201d Labour has just published its manifesto, a prospectus that doubles down on the 2017 version by adding a slew of huge additional spending promises. \u201cIt is radical,\u201d says the shadow chancellor. More radical than the last one? \u201cYeah, in some ways it is.\u201d Last time around, the manifestos proved to be the inflection point of the campaign. Labour was energised by its launch; the Tory campaign imploded soon after theirs. McDonnell and the rest of the Labour leadership team are hoping that history will repeat itself. \u201cWhat happened last time, as soon as the manifesto was out there, that did start to turn things. Because we started getting on to real policies.\u201d In conversation with us, he announces another large spending commitment, one omitted from the manifesto, saying he will compensate older females, often called \u201cthe Waspi women\u201d, who lost out when the state pension age for men and women was equalised. \u201cWe\u2019re recognising this is a historic injustice that we think we have a debt of honour to address.\u201d He puts the cost to the taxpayer at \u00a358bn. That\u2019s on top of many other spending commitments that Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls \u201ccolossal\u201d and incapable of being paid for simply by raising taxes on the rich and business. There\u2019s also some polling evidence that the scale of Labour\u2019s promises are leaving many voters unconvinced, because they don\u2019t believe the party could possibly deliver them. \u201cI understand that,\u201d he responds. \u201cThe problems we face, the issues that we face, are big. They\u2019re huge. So it does require a huge response. We\u2019ve got these weeks to get that message across. But you\u2019re right. We talk about billions. People just switch off. So the issue for us is translating that into what does it mean in your local area \u2026 so people don\u2019t think the big numbers are just unreal.\u201d The Tories are hoping to win Labour seats in the party\u2019s historic heartlands with Johnson\u2019s cry of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Labour\u2019s gamble is that \u201cthe salience of other issues is more important than Brexit\u201d. McDonnell contends: \u201cThe two big ones, which is health and education, have a greater salience for the Labour Leave voters than Brexit itself \u2026. It is about security as well \u2013 police cuts and stuff like that. Also, climate change does come up on the doorstep.\u201d Labour is now committed to a fresh referendum on Brexit that would put Remain up against whatever kind of new withdrawal deal a Labour government could negotiate with the EU. McDonnell tells us that the negotiations would be led by himself, Corbyn and Starmer. Crucial to any renegotiation would be the subject of immigration, which is known to divide senior figures in the party. Does he accept that to achieve the closer relationship with Europe that Labour says it would seek, Britain would have to accept a continuation of freedom of movement? McDonnell turns opaque: \u201cIt will be a negotiating issue.\u201d He goes on: \u201cOf course, we welcome the principles of free movement, but we also recognise that there are issues that have to be addressed.\u201d Whatever new deal a Labour government might come up with, he says he is a Remainer. \u201cI\u2019ve made this point time and time again. I can\u2019t see a better deal than that [remaining within the EU], but the party will make the decision once we come to the deal.\u201d No one can say what Corbyn would do, because he is continuing to refuse to say whether he is for or against Brexit. On Friday night he said he would adopt a \u201cneutral stance\u201d in a referendum campaign. When Labour\u2019s candidate for the premiership won\u2019t express a view about such a defining question, doesn\u2019t it make him ridiculous? McDonnell endeavours to make a virtue of it, saying that he thinks voters will warm to \u201cthe quiet calm of Jeremy trying to \u2026 bring people together. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to position Jeremy in terms of the rest of the campaign on Brexit. This is the consensus builder. This is the man who can bring us all together. By not forcing his own view down people\u2019s throats, he\u2019s the only one who could do that.\u201d In what some may take as an implied criticism of Corbyn\u2019s performance in the TV debate, he adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the message gets across more clearly.\u201d There\u2019s less than three weeks to do it.",

And they whistled him again when he escaped up the right and looped a cross to the far post for Benzema to head down for Modric to score the third. As Benzema and Modric celebrated, Valverde and Casemiro headed to Bale, embraced him and brought him across to join the rest. With every touch now, the whistles were quieter. Adnan Januzaj escaped Ramos and hit the side-netting before Courtois made a superb save from Alexander Isak, but this game was won. For Bale, though, there was time for more. He flashed a ball across the six-yard box with five minutes to go and then almost scored in the very last minute, drawing applause. It was timid, but it was a start.",

      "bodyText": "The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says the banking regulator is looking at disqualifying the Westpac board for accountability failings which may have helped facilitate child exploitation. The financial intelligence agency, Austrac, announced it had begun legal action against Westpac last week, levelling accusations the bank had more than 23m legal breaches in relation to its obligations under anti-money and counterterror finance laws. Among those accusations was that the bank failed to stop payments from Westpac customers to people in the Philippines, which Austrac said should have been detected and stopped given the consistency of the payments with child exploitation. One customer had been convicted of child exploitation but was alleged to have not been monitored. Another paid someone who was later charged with \u201clive streaming of child sex shows and offering children for sex\u201d. The bank\u2019s board has expressed it\u2019s \u201cdeep distress\u201d at the \u201cnotion that any child has been hurt by any failings by Westpac\u201d but so far has resisted pressure to step down. The bank\u2019s boss, Brian Hartzer, has also indicated he will continue at the helm. Both sides of politics have maintained it is for the bank\u2019s board and shareholders to dictate the bank\u2019s future. But speaking to ABC\u2019s Insider\u2019s program, Frydenberg said the bank regulator was looking at triggering mechanisms which could take the decision out of their hands. \u201cWhere boards start is not necessarily where boards finish,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cNow, Apra has the ability \u2013 under the banking executive accountability regime \u2013 to disqualify boards and to disqualify executives where there\u2019s a failure to appropriately enforce and uphold the duties under the legislation. \u201cThat legislation came into force in 2018. It\u2019s not retrospective, and some of those alleged breaches date back to 2013. But the anti-money-laundering laws are a proscribed activity under Apra, and I know Apra are looking at it.\u201d Frydenberg said he would not interfere with the process, but was aware it was under way. \u201cApra is an independent entity, like Austrac, and they will determine their own conclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will say that they are looking at it and obviously they have particular powers under that legislation that we introduced.\u201d The government and Labor are reluctant to push the bank in any one direction as politicians seek to find a line between holding the big banks accountable and protecting Australia\u2019s financial markets and consumer confidence. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d and that banks needed to \u201clift their game\u201d but that it showed Australia\u2019s banking watchdogs were doing their jobs. Frydenberg said the matter of consequences rightly sat with independent bodies. \u201cOur position has consistently been \u2013 decisions about who are on boards are matters for shareholders and who are on executive teams are matters for boards,\u201d he said. \u201cThat being said, these are very serious issues. There must be accountability. Austrac have been highly critical in their statement. And now Apra is looking into it. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt as to the seriousness of these issues and the government\u2019s position.\u201d Apra also has the power to fine banks for its failings and can apply to the courts to issue fines of up to $500m. The Westpac news came just months after the banking royal commission revealed systemic failings within Australia\u2019s leading financial institutions, leading to questions over what consequences individuals in charge of the organisations face. Frydenberg said it was too early to conclude whether or not anyone would lose their job over the Westpac news, but indicated he expected action at the bank\u2019s annual general meeting later this week. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an AGM on December 12,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some tough conversations between now and then. The board, management, they\u2019re all seized on this issue and they\u2019re now going through a process. But with Apra providing additional focus, as well as Austrac, certainly the heat is on the company.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That was fun in the end. Thanks for joining me. Here is the match report: I hope the trophy is handed to Flamengo by a stormtrooper. What a finish! Gabriel Barbosa breaks the hearts of River Plate with two extremely late goals to turn round what looked like a lost cause. Two goals and a red card for the striker who has irked the referee. What a fun few minutes he\u2019s had. Bruno Henrique gets a kicking in the corner from Palacios. It was a tap really, but completely needless. It\u2019s all kicking off. He has barely had a sniff all game but has turned the match around in a few dramatic minutes. The ball is lumped down the pitch by Diego and the River defence fail to deal with it, allowing Gabriel Barbosa to take it into the box and whack a shot into the corner. 90 mins: Four minutes added on. Bruno Henrique does some fine work on the left wing and works the ball into the box to De Arrascaeta, whose cross ends up at the back post with Gabriel Barbosa who taps into an empty net at the far post. 87 mins: Arao departs and Vitinho enters the stage for the final act. Tough blow: 85 mins: River break down the right through Montiel. The ball eventually lands at Pratto\u2019s feet and he - once again - whacks a shot from distance but this one is straight at the goalkeeper. 83 mins: Gabriel Barbosa wins a corner for Flamengo odd Pinola. Diego swings it into the box, only to see Armani come 10 yards out of his goal to claim it. 81 mins: Pratto holds up the ball, as a man nicknamed \u2018The Bear\u2019 should, but his work is prematurely ended by Rafinha hacking him down for good measure. Suarez dispossess Filipe Luis in the box and pulls the ball back for the onrushing Palacios but his shot goes well wide. 79 mins: Pratto decides to try and make an impact by whacking a shot from 30 yards out but it flies high and wide. 77 mins: Flamengo work the ball into the box, with Gabriel Barbosa setting up Everton Ribeiro to chip a cross for De Arrascaeta who tries a bicycle kick and it goes nowhere near the net. 75 mins: River\u2019s second change see goalscorer Borre replaced by Pratto. Gallardo has brought on two strikers so far, a sign of his mentality. 73 mins: Flamengo are looking a bit more lively going forward but there is absolutely not end product currently. 71 mins: River\u2019s 36-year-old captain Pinola has a word with Bruno Henrique who has done some to irk him. The look from the rugged defender was one of \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me, sonny.\u201d Enzo Perez goes into the book for tactically taking down Bruno Henrique when dribbling towards the area. 69 mins: Pablo Mari only gets the ball as far as Fernandez, who chest it down and volleys a shot inches over the bar. What a goal it would have been. 67 mins: Gerson departs and Diego comes on. Yeah, that one from Atletico Madrid and Wolfsburg fame. 65 mins: Filipe Luis lifts a cross into the box, which Everton Ribeiro tries to get his head onto but only succeeds in flicking it out for a throw-in. The lads: 63 mins: A cracking foul from Casco who crashes into Rafinha on the halfway line. He is nowhere near the ball and is already on a yellow but the referee feels the free-kick is sufficient. 61 mins: Jonathan Denness emails to say: \u201cOn the BBC Jonathan Wilson is described as a \u201cFootall writer\u201d. I think he will be pleased - he knows all foot(b)all.\u201d He\u2019s been called worse in the office, to be fair. 59 mins: There has been plenty of VAR since all that went on and, in the end, nothing has happened, so the referee hands the ball over to Armani. 57 mins: WHAT A PASSAGE OF PLAY! River have a man down in the Flamengo box, so half-stop playing, allowing the Brazilians to counter and get into the opposition box. Henrique pulls it back from the byline but the first shot is blocked from Gabigol by the back of a flying defender then the second is well saved by Armani. How did they not score? 55 mins: Borre gets a free-kick after Pablo Mari drags him down on the flank. The Spanish centre-back goes into the book for his troubles. 53 mins: Armani once again comes to take a deep cross into the box. Having him behind the back four looks to be giving them an extra level of confidence in a heated situation. Palacios has a dig from 25 yards but curls it just wide. 51 mins: Henrique has a word with the ref after he blows up for a free-kick, which was ultimately a fairly contested aerial challenge. 49 mins: River do not seem to be tiring, they are keeping up their high tempo and limitless aggressive. Montiel proves that River still be business by taking down De Arrascaeta. 47 mins: Gabigol finally gets a sight of goal, picking up the ball 20 yards out and whacking a low drive which is gobbled up by Armani. The majority of Flamengo\u2019s squad seem to be warming up on the touchline. Here we go again! Flamengo need to get the ball up to Gabigol, otherwise they will be in for another disappointing 45 minutes. The Argentines have certainly been the better side in the opening 45 minutes. Their intense style and constant pressing has been too much to deal with the Flamengo so far, which is probably why they are yet to create a decent chance. 45 mins: Three minutes added on! 44 mins: Borre is played in down the left flank and latches onto the ball, taking it into the area, he tries to pull it back but the ball is blocked by the goalkeeper. He is a mile offside but the assistant waits ten seconds to put the flag up. 42 mins: Now there is a nasty head clash between Rafinha and De La Cruz, when challenging for the ball on the halfway line. The River man caught the Brazilian full-back on the temple, resulting in both needing treatment. 40 mins: Another foul, this time from Fernandez on Arao, who is shoved from behind for little to no reason. 38 mins: There are two Manchester City legends involved in this game. Flamengo have Pablo Mari at the back - I am not sure he ever visited Manchester in his three years with the club. Meanwhile, Bruno Zuculini is on the River bench - he enjoyed six loan spells during his three years at City. 36 mins: Palacios almost adds a second. He picks the ball up 25 yards from goal and gets it out of his feet before firing a fearsome wide just wide. 34 mins: Gerson takes the ball off De La Cruz and then dribbles 60 yards down the pitch, beating a number of players on the way until tiring near the edge of the area and being dispossessed before he could do anything dangerous. 32 mins: Flamengo send in a couple of crosses into the box but they are dealt with, the second being caught by Armani who looks happy to dominate his own area. 30 mins: We have a booking! Casco is the man to see yellow after clipping Rafinha the wing. It will not be the last caution of the match, thats for sure. 28 mins: This game is lacking in individual moments of quality. River are on top thanks to their tempo making things difficult for Flamengo who cannot cope with the pressing and are getting overrun in midfield. Here is the goal. 26 mins: Stephen Carr (probably not that one) says: \u201cInteresting game insofar as both managers look like magicians on a Cruise liner.\u201d Who has the better tricks? 24 mins: The referee is sweating profusely and he is unlikely to cool down. De La Cruz commits the latest foul with a very late challenge on Rafinha. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the cynical fouls. 22 mins: Suarez tries to cross the ball for De La Cruz but it hits the River winger\u2019s feet and bounces out of play. 20 mins: Gabriel goes down under minimal pressure and rightly gets nothing for it. The striker lies on the ground for a moment, looking angrily at the referee before getting up. Some of the passing so far has been pretty poor, possibly due to the pitch. To make up for this, the fouling has been relentless. 18 mins: The roar when the goal hit the back of the net was incredible and Borre certainly loved the moment. Gallardo imminent statue can\u2019t be built enough at this rate. 16 mins: How will Flamengo respond? This will suit River\u2019s style, I feel and they will be able to sit back and hit Flamengo on the break. River Plate are aided by some dreadful defending inside the Flamengo area. Luis gets in a pickle on the edge and loses possession, the ball then makes it to the byline and is pulled back but all the Flamengo defenders leave it for each other, allowing Borre to nip in and fire into the corner. 12 mins: If you like fouls, this is the game for you. On the upside, Rodrigo Caio is now playing with tissue up his nose. As an image, it is not up there with Terry Butcher\u2019s bandage around his head. 10 mins: Flamengo take a short free-kick but it\u2019s a bit rubbish and River counter-attack but it is just about ended by Filipe Luis after he first slipped. The pitch looks pretty dry and slow, which will not help this contest. 8 mins: Rodrigo Caio suffers a bloody nose and takes a bit of time one the sideline to get some tissue bunged up there or something equally comical. On the pitch, Bruno Henrique goes down after a shove in the back 25 yards from goal. 6 mins: The latest person to go down is Rodrigo Caio who has taken a knock to the face. I think we might have a lot of injury time in this one. 4 mins: Flamengo are enjoying the majority of the early possession. Luis almost gets beyond his man and into the box but takes a heavy touch and loses the ball. Amani comes to punch a cross and goes down after colliding with an attacker. It is just a coming together and everyone should stop messing about. 2 mins: The stands are awash with red, white and black. It looks like a cracking atmosphere in Lima. The game has started at a pretty high tempo and there\u2019s been a couple of fouls already and both sets of players look to show they\u2019re up for it. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! You heard, Baz! Some stormtroopers have brought out the trophy. What a ludicrous spectacle. I am pretty confused. Jonathan Wilson is in the studio, so you\u2019re stuck with me. Some pre-match reading ... Flamengo: Diego Alves, Rafinha, Rodrigo Caio, Pablo Mar\u00ed, Filipe Luis, Willian Ar\u00e3o, Gerson, \u00c9verton Ribeiro, G. De Arrascaeta, Bruno Henrique, Gabriel Barbosa Subs: Rodinei, Rhodolfo, Rene, Diego, Vitinho, Cesar, Souza, Reinier, Lincoln, Piris, Thuler, Berio River Plate: Armani; Montiel, Martinez Quarta, Pinola, Casco; Nacho Fern\u00e1ndez, Enzo P\u00e9rez, Palacios, De La Cruz; Borre, Su\u00e1rez. Subs: Bologna, Lux, Rojas, Diaz, Angileri, Zuculini, Ponzio, Ferreira, Quintero, \u00c1lvarez, Scocco, Pratto. Good evening! Last year\u2019s final will be remembered for the cancellations and the second leg eventually taking place in Madrid, so getting the whole thing done in one night would be a result. Flamengo\u2019s frontline is led by Gabriel, or Gabigol as he is affectionately known. His early promised resulted in a move to Inter but they sent him quickly on his way to Benfica for a loan spell. After one goal in 10 games in Europe, he was packed off back to Brazil to Santos and now Flamengo where he has enjoyed plenty of success. River Plate, on the other hand, rely on their manager to make the difference. Marcelo Gallardo is highly thought of in Argentina and could make the move to Europe in the near future, with a Copa Libertadores in his back pocket certainly useful on the CV, so a third tonight would be great. He\u2019s recently been linked with the Barcelona job. Should be a cracker! Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT)",

      "bodyText": "Two Soviet-born Americans who form a key link between Donald Trump and Ukraine \u201cweren\u2019t James Bond\u201d, the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said on Saturday, insisting the men \u201cdidn\u2019t have personal communications with the president\u201d during a time period under intense scrutiny in the impeachment inquiry. Giuliani also repeated a remark made to the Guardian earlier this month, that he is not worried about Trump throwing him under the bus as an impeachment vote and Senate trial loom, because he has \u201cinsurance\u201d. Some observers have treated such remarks as potential veiled threats to Trump, to flip and tell House investigators everything he knows. Others, including Giuliani\u2019s own lawyer, have insisted the former New York mayor is joking. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman played key roles earlier this year as Giuliani tried \u2013 at the president\u2019s direction \u2013 to get Ukraine to investigate both Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son and a discredited conspiracy theory about supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Nearly $400m in military aid was held up with a White House meeting for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also dangled as bait. That quid pro quo, confirmed in public testimony by Trump appointee Gordon Sondland, lies at the heart of what Democrats say is an abuse of power that merits Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office. Parnas and Fruman were arrested last month on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records. Both pleaded not guilty. Parnas has indicated a willingness to cooperate with Congress. On Friday, CNN reported that a lawyer for Parnas said his client was willing to testify about meetings between Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee conducting the impeachment inquiry, and a former Ukrainian prosecutor general in Vienna in 2018, allegedly to discuss digging up dirt on Biden. The same evening, newly released state department documents showed Parnas and Fruman\u2019s involvement in contacts between Giuliani and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in the months before the US ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled, an event under scrutiny by the House panel. The documents were released to the group American Oversight in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. They showed that Pompeo talked to Giuliani on 26 March and 29 March. Last week, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told House investigators she felt \u201ckneecapped\u201d by a \u201csmear campaign\u201d Giuliani led against her. She was withdrawn from Ukraine in May. The documents also included a report that appeared with Trump hotel stationery and seemed to summarize a 23 January interview with former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin at which Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman were present. The CNN report about Nunes\u2019 trip to Europe quoted the attorney Joseph A Bondy as saying Parnas was told by Shokin that he met the California Republican in Vienna last December. Nunes responded by telling the far-right Breitbart News website he would sue CNN and the Daily Beast, which reported on the same subject. A second state department memo released on Friday appeared to summarize an interview with Yuri Lutsenko, another former prosecutor general of Ukraine, conducted in the presence of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman. Lutsenko was quoted as raising questions about compensation Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, received from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. There is no evidence either Hunter Biden or his father committed any wrongdoing related to Ukraine. Speaking to Fox News on Saturday, Giuliani was asked about Parnas and Fruman. \u201cSo they helped me find people,\u201d he said, \u201cand as I\u2019ve said, they did a good job, but they weren\u2019t investigators, and they weren\u2019t James Bond, and they didn\u2019t have personal communications with the president.\u201d Giuliani admitted introducing the men to Trump at a Hanukkah party in December 2018 \u2013 the subject of another CNN report \u2013 but said there was no extended conversation. \u201cThey took a one-minute picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey walked away.\u201d CNN cited sources as saying Parnas said \u201cthe big guy\u201d, meaning Trump, had \u201ctalked about tasking him and Fruman with what Parnas described as \u2018a secret mission\u2019 to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate\u201d the Bidens. Giuliani himself is being investigated by federal prosecutors in New York, over whether he failed to register as a foreign agent. On Fox News, the former mayor was asked if he was concerned about being indicted. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m afraid?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way. I was so effective that I discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years.\u201d Giuliani has defied attempts to compel him to turn over documentation relevant to the impeachment inquiry. He has also appeared dramatically in public testimony, described as being involved in a political \u201cdrug deal\u201d and as \u201ca hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up\u201d. On Saturday he released a dramatic letter to the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, in which he claimed witnesses damaging to House Democrats\u2019 case against Trump were being kept from coming to the US from Ukraine. Giuliani told Fox he continues to have a good relationship with Trump, to whom he talks \u201cearly and often\u201d. He also said he had seen it written that Trump was intending to throw him under the bus. \u201cWhen they say that, I say he isn\u2019t, but I have insurance,\u201d Giuliani said. That was a repeat of a remark made to the Guardian, prompting his own lawyer to interject: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d Later on Saturday, Giuliani returned to the subject on Twitter, writing that his remark was \u201csarcastic [and] relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family\u2019s [four-] decade monetizing of his office.

Given the amount of silverware the former Real Madrid manager has already accumulated, that would not appear to be too outlandish a request, even if Spurs have been slumming it in the bottom half of the Premier League table, rising to ninth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/west-ham-tottenham-jose-mourinho-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">with Saturday\u2019s win at West Ham</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dcdebd92-9d6f-4db5-a329-a0af1891b722\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v0k9ktNbr2E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pochettino\u2019s side were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/24/colchester-tottenham-carabao-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">beaten in the Carabao Cup</a> on penalties by Colchester, perhaps one of the factors that accelerated the Argentinian\u2019s demise, so people have been assuming over the past few days that Mourinho\u2019s eyes must be firmly fixed on the FA Cup. A side that can reach a Champions League final can surely get its act together for a now minor domestic knockout competition, after all, yet it must also have occurred to Mourinho that a side capable of reaching last season\u2019s Champions League final, disposing of Manchester City, Ajax and Borussia Dortmund en route, can probably make it to another one.</p> \n<p>Yes, that might be difficult if the current disaffected attitude of certain senior players remains, but the other side of that coin is that all the ingredients of last season\u2019s near-success are still there, even if some of them are winding down their contracts. If Mourinho can inspire the sort of dutiful dedication that led Inter to win the first Italian treble after years in the doldrums, anything is possible. No one doubts the quality at Spurs and, though Mourinho\u2019s continuing ability to galvanise teams and outsmart opponents tactically is more debatable, there is an opportunity on offer here that both parties must recognise might be fleeting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/jose-mourinho-special-porto-inter-milan-real-madrid-tottenham\">What makes Jos\u00e9 Mourinho special? Former players give Spurs an insight | Fabrizio Romano</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In his last job Mourinho was tasked with getting a side into the Champions League. Now he is in charge of one already in that bracket and, though results have been uneven, Spurs look a good bet for the knockout stages as they prepare to host Olympiakos on Tuesday. Never mind the issues within the squad and the fact the domestic title looks as far away as ever. That is bound to excite a coach who is one of a group of just five to win the European Cup with two clubs. Only two of those are still working \u2013 Carlo Ancelotti is the other \u2013 and it would thrill Mourinho enormously to go out on his own as the first manager in history to record European Cup triumphs with three different clubs from three different countries. That, one would guess, would be a mark on posterity that might last some considerable time and, for all the talk of a man now interested in only short contracts and big payoffs, he has reappeared in a situation that makes it possible.</p> \n<p>The elephant-sized question is whether he still possesses the ability to win matches against top opponents through force of personality and rigid discipline on the pitch, when the evidence of the past few years suggests his methods have been rendered obsolete by the pressing games favoured by Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp. We may shortly find out, though a coach with Mourinho\u2019s record surely deserved better than to be dubbed a luxury version of Sam Allardyce.</p> \n<p>The Portuguese\u2019s last Champions League success was in 2010, though before accepting the commonly held theory that Mourinho\u2019s golden years are behind him, have a closer look at some of those other double European Cup winners. Ottmar Hitzfeld was 52 when he won his second, Ernst Happel was 57 and Jupp Heynckes a remarkable 67. Mourinho is 56 and possibly not ready to start winding down just yet.</p>",

It has been rightly pointed out that Daniel Levy and his new manager appear to be poles apart in their approaches to team-building and strengthening, and one or other of the immovable objects will have to give a little if even the end of the current season is to be reached in harmony. But, if Mourinho has any of the magic dust left over from his most impressive incarnations at Porto, Chelsea and Internazionale, he can change present perceptions of his usefulness at a stroke. All it would take is a trophy, the weakness in Pochettino\u2019s otherwise impressive CV, and most of the reservations about Mourinho would be swept away. Given the amount of silverware the former Real Madrid manager has already accumulated, that would not appear to be too outlandish a request, even if Spurs have been slumming it in the bottom half of the Premier League table, rising to ninth with Saturday\u2019s win at West Ham. Pochettino\u2019s side were beaten in the Carabao Cup on penalties by Colchester, perhaps one of the factors that accelerated the Argentinian\u2019s demise, so people have been assuming over the past few days that Mourinho\u2019s eyes must be firmly fixed on the FA Cup. A side that can reach a Champions League final can surely get its act together for a now minor domestic knockout competition, after all, yet it must also have occurred to Mourinho that a side capable of reaching last season\u2019s Champions League final, disposing of Manchester City, Ajax and Borussia Dortmund en route, can probably make it to another one. Yes, that might be difficult if the current disaffected attitude of certain senior players remains, but the other side of that coin is that all the ingredients of last season\u2019s near-success are still there, even if some of them are winding down their contracts. If Mourinho can inspire the sort of dutiful dedication that led Inter to win the first Italian treble after years in the doldrums, anything is possible. No one doubts the quality at Spurs and, though Mourinho\u2019s continuing ability to galvanise teams and outsmart opponents tactically is more debatable, there is an opportunity on offer here that both parties must recognise might be fleeting. In his last job Mourinho was tasked with getting a side into the Champions League. Now he is in charge of one already in that bracket and, though results have been uneven, Spurs look a good bet for the knockout stages as they prepare to host Olympiakos on Tuesday. Never mind the issues within the squad and the fact the domestic title looks as far away as ever. That is bound to excite a coach who is one of a group of just five to win the European Cup with two clubs. Only two of those are still working \u2013 Carlo Ancelotti is the other \u2013 and it would thrill Mourinho enormously to go out on his own as the first manager in history to record European Cup triumphs with three different clubs from three different countries. That, one would guess, would be a mark on posterity that might last some considerable time and, for all the talk of a man now interested in only short contracts and big payoffs, he has reappeared in a situation that makes it possible. The elephant-sized question is whether he still possesses the ability to win matches against top opponents through force of personality and rigid discipline on the pitch, when the evidence of the past few years suggests his methods have been rendered obsolete by the pressing games favoured by Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp. We may shortly find out, though a coach with Mourinho\u2019s record surely deserved better than to be dubbed a luxury version of Sam Allardyce. The Portuguese\u2019s last Champions League success was in 2010, though before accepting the commonly held theory that Mourinho\u2019s golden years are behind him, have a closer look at some of those other double European Cup winners. Ottmar Hitzfeld was 52 when he won his second, Ernst Happel was 57 and Jupp Heynckes a remarkable 67. Mourinho is 56 and possibly not ready to start winding down just yet.",

Goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez on 29 and 37 minutes cancelled out N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s opener at the Etihad Stadium to lift the champions to third. Yet Ag\u00fcero limped off on 77 minutes and Guardiola is concerned that City\u2019s top scorer in the league may be out for a prolonged period. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll know tomorrow [Sunday], but the first indication is not good. I think it\u2019s a muscular injury. [We could be without] him for some days of the toughest part of our season,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe doctor says tomorrow we are going to see but he thought it was a kick but I think he stretched a little bit.\u201d Rodri and David Silva also had to be replaced but Guardiola put this down to cramping. The City manager praised Frank Lampard as a courageous manager after Chelsea limited City to 46.7% possession, the lowest of the Catalan\u2019s 381 top-flight matches as a manager. \u201cThere is always one thing in your lifetime that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happened. So, OK, I have another record, I won one game without possession. They are an incredible team with Kant\u00e9, Kovacic, Jorginho, so it can happen. \u201cWe beat an incredible top side, Frank is a brave manager \u2013 courageous to play. Chelsea are an incredible team, we knew it but we beat them. It was a typical high-level game. Our back four played so good today. In the most difficult period of the game we scored on the counter. \u201cWe created enough chances to score more goals. We score a goal [equaliser] when they were better. Before the goal from them, the game was tight. Then we suffered, but the second half we were much better.\u201d Lampard said: \u201cWe were controlling the game, we were playing some great stuff and we felt in control but you can\u2019t be absolutely in control against Manchester City. \u201cIt was bad luck for their first goal [due to a deflection], and absolute quality from Riyad Mahrez for the second and that changed the game.

She wanted a caesarean section from the outset because she was worried.\u201d</p> <p>A reluctance to intervene may be a common factor in many of the tragedies in Shrewsbury and Telford. Vaginal birth has become less common since the 80s \u2013 possibly because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/15/more-women-getting-pregnant-after-30-than-in-20s-for-first-tim\" title=\"\">more women give birth in their 30s and 40s</a> and older mothers are more likely to have complicated births \u2013 so, in 2005, the Royal College of Midwives began a \u201cnormal birth\u201d campaign to encourage mothers to give birth without caesarean sections, epidurals or other interventions.</p> <p>They ended the campaign in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/12/midwives-to-stop-using-term-normal-birth\" title=\"\">following criticism</a> after an inquiry into the deaths of 16 babies and three mothers in the maternity unit at Furness general hospital in Cumbria.</p> <p>A spokesman for NHS Resolution said it was dealing with 40 obstetric claims against SaHT. \u201cIn total we have 116 outstanding claims against this trust involving other specialities. Since 2007 we have settled 56 obstetric claims against the trust and closed 27 without the payment of damages.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://resolution.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NHS-Resolution-Annual-Report-2018-19.pdf\" title=\"\">Maternity claims accounted </a>for about 60% of the \u00a39bn the NHS admitted it was liable to pay last year, according to NHS Resolution, the body that oversees claims. In an attempt to reduce the number of claims, NHS Resolution has introduced a maternity incentive scheme.

I know that people say all this money\u2019s been taken out the NHS, but it\u2019s allowed these poor people who\u2019ve been robbed of their normal life just to have a life.\u201d</p>",

The baby came out feet first, but his head became trapped for 30 minutes before he was delivered by an emergency caesarean section. By then he had been starved of oxygen and died two and a half hours later. \u201cI get the impression they wanted to follow vaginal deliveries at all cost,\u201d Uppal said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t thinking, \u2018this lady has a risk factor; we need to follow a different course\u2019. She wanted a caesarean section from the outset because she was worried.\u201d A reluctance to intervene may be a common factor in many of the tragedies in Shrewsbury and Telford. Vaginal birth has become less common since the 80s \u2013 possibly because more women give birth in their 30s and 40s and older mothers are more likely to have complicated births \u2013 so, in 2005, the Royal College of Midwives began a \u201cnormal birth\u201d campaign to encourage mothers to give birth without caesarean sections, epidurals or other interventions. They ended the campaign in 2017, following criticism after an inquiry into the deaths of 16 babies and three mothers in the maternity unit at Furness general hospital in Cumbria. A spokesman for NHS Resolution said it was dealing with 40 obstetric claims against SaHT. \u201cIn total we have 116 outstanding claims against this trust involving other specialities. Since 2007 we have settled 56 obstetric claims against the trust and closed 27 without the payment of damages.\u201d Maternity claims accounted for about 60% of the \u00a39bn the NHS admitted it was liable to pay last year, according to NHS Resolution, the body that oversees claims. In an attempt to reduce the number of claims, NHS Resolution has introduced a maternity incentive scheme. Hospitals which reach 10 safety standards receive extra funding, yet so far only 75 out of 132 trusts have achieved 10 out of 10. For individual families who would otherwise rely on disability benefit and carer\u2019s allowance, compensation can make a tragedy more bearable. In a case brought by Shoosmiths against a different NHS trust, a family has been able to move into a single-storey home. \u201cIt\u2019s large enough for carer\u2019s accommodation and a bedroom for the child, a specially adaped bathroom,\u201d Uppal said. \u201cThe mother can\u2019t continue working because of the demands of ensuring the child\u2019s needs are met. I know that people say all this money\u2019s been taken out the NHS, but it\u2019s allowed these poor people who\u2019ve been robbed of their normal life just to have a life.\u201d",

I do think some of the staffing has gone a bit awry. They don\u2019t have people who can stand up to them now. They\u2019ve gone back to the Hooray Henrys who go \u2018yah, yah, yah\u2019 and don\u2019t confront them properly.\u201d</p> <p>This would not be such a problem if there was leadership at the top. But the Duke of Edinburgh is frail and has retired from the fray. The Queen is 93.</p> <p>\u201cThe royals are like most families,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou need a head of the family to step in \u2013 somebody tough and stern \u2013 who sorts it all out, but they don\u2019t have anyone at the moment. It\u2019s all sliding again. The Queen is just tired. It needs a stronger hand at the helm.\u201d</p> <p>From the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s infamous car crash to the apparently growing divide between princes William and Harry, the royal family could be forgiven for wishing to see the back of 2019. That the Queen felt she had no choice but to sacrifice Andrew, whom many consider her favourite child, will have made it a particularly bleak year.</p> <p>\u201cThe circumstances suggest he may well have been her favourite,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cIt is well established that the Queen regretted that her early accession to the throne did not enable her to parent Charles and Anne as she would have liked, nor to enjoy the experience of having children. It\u2019s no secret that she and Prince Philip took the decision that they would like a second, younger family and Andrew was the first of those.\u201d</p> <p>That the Prince of Wales was heavily involved in the decision to excommunicate his brother is evidence of a monarchy in flux.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be seen as the moment that marks the transition from one reign to another, when Prince Charles clearly stepped in,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cAlthough Prince Andrew was allowed to say he jumped, he was in fact pushed. The royal family are absolutely ruthless when it comes to protecting the institution.\u201d</p> <p>But a monarchy in transition can be a fragile, fractious thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Prince of Wales has got his team,\u201d a royal source said. \u201cHe has always done his own thing, but now they are looking across the park and want more of a say, and this causes friction.\u201d</p> <p>Lacey believes it is significant that the Prince of Wales was away on royal duties when the decision to use Buckingham Palace for the interview was taken.</p> <p>\u201cWith Prince Philip out of the scene, Prince Andrew had effectively become the man in charge of the palace,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cFrom the inquiries one can make, it is not really certain that the Queen gave her personal approval for the use of the palace.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d828bcc1979f43b33d7eafbbdcfab0830e68e4e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d828bcc1979f43b33d7eafbbdcfab0830e68e4e5/0_55_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Andrew and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, at Royal Ascot this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Andrew and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, at Royal Ascot this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Rooke/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The choice of location was both telling and a substantial error of judgment, according to Lacey.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way, it [the ensuing post-interview furore] is nothing to do at all with whatever Prince Andrew\u2019s relations were or were not with Jeffrey Epstein. It all starts with last Saturday night and a projection of his attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cMost people do not feel they want to be represented by someone like that. It was made worse by his decision to use Buckingham Palace as a backdrop. It invited questions and confrontation. It went along with the lack of contrition in what he said, and in his tone.\u201d</p> <p>As it became apparent just how far Andrew\u2019s interview had backfired, the palace drafted a statement that it was hoped would paint the duke in a more empathetic light. Announcing his intention to stand down from public duties, the duke confirmed that he was willing \u201cto help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required\u201d.</p> <p>But, as with his television interview, the response raised more questions than it answered.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not committing to giving evidence to anyone who asks him. It\u2019s carefully caveated \u2013 deliberately so,\u201d said one legal expert who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cThe duke says \u2018if required\u2019 \u2013 so he\u2019s not prepared to do it voluntarily. It may well be a get-out. Epstein is dead, so there is not going to be a criminal prosecution of him. It may well be that law enforcement agencies are looking at prosecuting his associates involved in the trafficking of young women, but there may end up being no criminal prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>Epstein\u2019s victims are pursuing civil damages claims against the financier\u2019s estate, but lawyers believe it is significant that the duke has not signalled any desire to help them by agreeing to provide a witness testimony. \u201cIf he\u2019s genuinely concerned about helping victims, he needs to commit to assisting those who are representing them, as they have called upon him to do,\u201d said Richard Scorer, a specialist in sexual abuse cases at the law firm Slater and Gordon. \u201cAt the moment, his statement doesn\u2019t include that.\u201d</p> <p>John Cooper QC, a barrister who knows about rehabilitating reputations, having sought to have the conviction of Dr Crippen overturned on the strength of new DNA evidence, suggested there was no reason why the duke would not accede to the lawyers\u2019 demands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The spectre of Epstein will loom large over the duke for years to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHopefully, as a man of public duty, he would be quite content to help them,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/06/jeffrey-epstein-virginia-roberts-giuffre-prince-andrew-photo\" title=\"\">now notorious photograph</a> of the duke with his arm around the waist of one of Epstein\u2019s teenage victims, Virginia Roberts, apparently taken in 2001 at the London mews home of Epstein\u2019s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has been cited as evidence that he could provide valuable insight.</p> <p>But there are claims the photo is a fake. The duke used his <em>Newsnight </em>interview to say he had no recollection of it being taken, that he did not recall meeting Roberts, and to categorically deny having sex with her.</p> <p>In 2015 the Metropolitan Police conducted a review of \u201cavailable evidence\u201d after receiving a complaint over claims lodged in court papers that a girl \u2013 now known to be Roberts \u2013 was \u201cforced to have sex with Prince Andrew\u201d. But the Met decided that <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/exclusive-met-police-decided-not-to-conduct-full-investigation-into-court-claims-of-sex-trafficking-of-girl-in-prince-andrew-photo\" title=\"\">the matter \u201cwould not progress to a full investigation\u201d</a>, according to <em>Channel 4 News</em>.</p> <p>That decision perplexes some in legal circles. Several experts spoken to by the <em>Observer</em> point out that, in 2015, Scotland Yard was throwing substantial resources into investigating claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. \u201cWhat was different about this claim?\u201d asked one.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cWe acknowledge the considerable interest and concern around this case and have revisited that decision-making and believe it remains entirely appropriate. Therefore no further action is being taken. The Met will always take seriously any allegation concerning sexual exploitation.\u201d But until the duke provides testimony under oath, it is likely that the controversy surrounding the photo will continue to haunt him.</p> <p>\u201cCan the prince be compelled to give testimony under oath in a civil case?\u201d asked Dominique Penson, a New York-based attorney who has handled many sex abuse claims. \u201cThe answer is yes. If he\u2019s compelled to give a deposition, they are taken under oath.\u201d</p> <p>Penson has served subpoenas on witnesses in European countries compelling them to give depositions for cases heard in the US, using a supranational legal mechanism called the Hague Treaty.</p> <p>\u201cHe could be served with a subpoena,\u201d Penson said. \u201cHe would not be compelled to come back here to give testimony but he could provide sworn testimony in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers may also want to obtain documents that confirm the duke\u2019s whereabouts on key dates. He was provided with a security detail who were supposed to keep logs of his movements and carry out risk assessments of people he met. Do they exist and if so where are they?</p> <p>With his television interview and his subsequent statement leaving so many unanswered questions, it seems that the spectre of Epstein will loom large over the duke for years to come \u2013 years in which an enfeebled monarchy will attempt to redefine itself under a new king.</p> <p>But it may be that the duke is now beyond rehabilitation.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose he could try to do a Mother Teresa \u2013 or the classic example is John Profumo, who is generally said to have redeemed himself,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cBut it would have to be a pretty massive and visible act of redemption for people to say \u2018ah yes, well, we\u2019d love to have Prince Andrew as our patron\u2019. And I simply can\u2019t see that.\u201d</p> <h2>The centuries of scandal</h2> <p><em>This is not the first time the British monarchy has been rocked by scandal. Even before social media and the tabloid press, the royals were regularly the object of public outrage and ridicule. Here, </em><em>Kate Williams, professor of history at Reading University</em><em>, looks at how the palace has dealt with disgrace in the past.</em></p> <h2>Frederick, Duke of York, 1809</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b810b1571e5f723c079c77dc932d70796ef424b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b810b1571e5f723c079c77dc932d70796ef424b3/654_634_2624_3280/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frederick, Duke of York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frederick, Duke of York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George III had seven sons and six daughters. By 1800, they had between them 56 illegitimate children and one legitimate child, Charlotte, daughter of the Prince of Wales. The brothers and sisters generated scandal apace \u2013 including the Prince of Wales\u2019s shocking attempts to divorce his wife for adultery. But society was rocked by the acts of his brother, Frederick, duke of York.</p> <p>His mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, needed money to maintain her position and began selling army positions. The married duke was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces \u2013 thus the nursery rhyme, The Grand Old Duke of York<em> </em>\u2013 so this was corruption on a huge scale. MPs investigated and Clarke appeared looking marvellously chic and read out the duke\u2019s love letters.</p> <p>He was widely mocked and derided and was forced to give up his position and live quietly away from the public glare \u2013 no more mistresses.</p> <h2>Edward VII, 1869</h2> <p>Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, known popularly as \u201cBertie\u201d was spoiled and debauched. He visited brothels, openly consorted with women and had dozens of mistresses, including Alice Keppel, the great-grandmother of Camilla Parker Bowles \u2013 who was even invited to his deathbed \u2013 and the actress Lillie Langtry.</p> <p>In 1869, the young Scottish aristocrat Harriet Mordaunt gave birth to a girl who seemed as if she might be blind and Lady Mordaunt panicked about sexually transmitted diseases. She confessed to her husband her various affairs, including the prince, and Lord Mordaunt said he would divorce herfor adultery. A prince called as the third party in a divorce case, would be a real threat to the monarchy.</p> <p>Harriet\u2019s family also feared the scandal and so she was declared insane and locked in an asylum for the rest of her life. Bertie\u2019s public reputation was saved \u2013 and he acceded to the throne after Victoria\u2019s death in 1901.</p> <h2>Edward VIII, 1936</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"daf2467407a53a793b30776c9fe68ed8af69124c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daf2467407a53a793b30776c9fe68ed8af69124c/183_109_2518_3146/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edward VIII, as the Duke of Windsor, after his wedding to Wallis Simpson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward VIII, as the Duke of Windsor, after his wedding to Wallis Simpson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1920s, Edward, Prince of Wales, handsome, youthful and idealistic, was seen as the future of the monarchy. He was fond of older married women and by his mid-thirties had fallen in love with a witty American, Mrs Wallis Simpson. When he ascended the throne in 1936, he began to talk seriously of marriage. Prime minister Stanley Baldwin told him it was politically impossible for him to marry the soon to be twice-divorced Simpson \u2013 the Church of England would not accept it and public opinion would be vehemently opposed.</p> <p>The king was on a collision course with his ministers and Baldwin feared that the matter would bring down his government. Finally, Edward decided to abdicate and, on 10 December 1936, made the announcement to the nation.</p> <p>He was essentially exiled for the rest of his life and died in his home near Paris in 1972.</p> <h2>Divorce, 1978</h2> <p>Princess Margaret\u2019s marriage to society photographer Lord Snowdon was crumbling when she met Roddy Llewellyn a handsome young aristocratic landscape gardener, who, at 25, was 17 years her junior.</p> <p>They began a passionate love affair, much of it conducted at her beautiful villa in Mustique. In February 1976, the <em>News of the World</em> published front-page pictures of Margaret and Roddy enjoying themselves on the beach \u2013 and a huge scandal erupted.</p> <p>Snowdon insisted on divorce (despite his own many affairs) and the press and many politicians attacked Margaret for being a \u201cfloozy\u201d and a \u201croyal parasite\u201d and there was talk of taking her off the civil list.It was the first royal divorce since Princess Victoria Melita in 1901 (who had a very unhappy marriage).</p> <p>Margaret was devastated and heartbroken and, although Roddy eventually married another, her public reputation suffered greatly.</p> <h2>Annus horribilis, 1992</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bc04c9ba2a37531dd480ff82f593f644be2011f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bc04c9ba2a37531dd480ff82f593f644be2011f/0_33_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PRINCESS DIANA - THE SECRET TAPES\u2019 TV PROGRAMME - MAR 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A series of tapes secretly recorded by Princess Diana detailing the breakdown of her marriage to Prince Charles were the main source for Andrew Morton\u2019s 1992 bestseller, Diana: Her True Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features/REX FEATURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she herself put it, 1992 was the Queen\u2019s <em>annus horribilis</em>. In spring, the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson announced their separation \u2013 and the notorious \u201ctoe-sucking\u201d photographs of Sarah sunbathing with her financial adviser caused huge scandal in the summer. Then the marriage of Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales, imploded.</p> <p>The bombshell book, <em>Diana, Her True Story,</em> by Andrew Morton was published in May 1992, laying bare Diana\u2019s suicide attempts, eating disorders and suspicions about Camilla Parker Bowles. Then the leaks began \u2013 a phone exchange between Diana and James Gilbey, who called her \u201cSquidgy\u201d, detailed in the <em>Sun</em> and a transcript of an intimate conversation between Camilla and Prince Charles. In December of that year, prime minister John Major announced the \u201camicable separation\u201d of the pair.</p> <p>The war of the Windsors continued and the Queen pushed them to divorce in 1995. The divorce was supposed to stop the talk; it did not. Diana continued to attract a huge amount of press wherever she went. Her death in 1997 turned what had been a royal scandal into a tragedy.</p>",

They\u2019ve gone back to the Hooray Henrys who go \u2018yah, yah, yah\u2019 and don\u2019t confront them properly.\u201d This would not be such a problem if there was leadership at the top. But the Duke of Edinburgh is frail and has retired from the fray. The Queen is 93. \u201cThe royals are like most families,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou need a head of the family to step in \u2013 somebody tough and stern \u2013 who sorts it all out, but they don\u2019t have anyone at the moment. It\u2019s all sliding again. The Queen is just tired. It needs a stronger hand at the helm.\u201d From the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s infamous car crash to the apparently growing divide between princes William and Harry, the royal family could be forgiven for wishing to see the back of 2019. That the Queen felt she had no choice but to sacrifice Andrew, whom many consider her favourite child, will have made it a particularly bleak year. \u201cThe circumstances suggest he may well have been her favourite,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cIt is well established that the Queen regretted that her early accession to the throne did not enable her to parent Charles and Anne as she would have liked, nor to enjoy the experience of having children. It\u2019s no secret that she and Prince Philip took the decision that they would like a second, younger family and Andrew was the first of those.\u201d That the Prince of Wales was heavily involved in the decision to excommunicate his brother is evidence of a monarchy in flux. \u201cThis will be seen as the moment that marks the transition from one reign to another, when Prince Charles clearly stepped in,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cAlthough Prince Andrew was allowed to say he jumped, he was in fact pushed. The royal family are absolutely ruthless when it comes to protecting the institution.\u201d But a monarchy in transition can be a fragile, fractious thing. \u201cThe Prince of Wales has got his team,\u201d a royal source said. \u201cHe has always done his own thing, but now they are looking across the park and want more of a say, and this causes friction.\u201d Lacey believes it is significant that the Prince of Wales was away on royal duties when the decision to use Buckingham Palace for the interview was taken. \u201cWith Prince Philip out of the scene, Prince Andrew had effectively become the man in charge of the palace,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cFrom the inquiries one can make, it is not really certain that the Queen gave her personal approval for the use of the palace.\u201d The choice of location was both telling and a substantial error of judgment, according to Lacey. \u201cIn a way, it [the ensuing post-interview furore] is nothing to do at all with whatever Prince Andrew\u2019s relations were or were not with Jeffrey Epstein. It all starts with last Saturday night and a projection of his attitudes. \u201cMost people do not feel they want to be represented by someone like that. It was made worse by his decision to use Buckingham Palace as a backdrop. It invited questions and confrontation. It went along with the lack of contrition in what he said, and in his tone.\u201d As it became apparent just how far Andrew\u2019s interview had backfired, the palace drafted a statement that it was hoped would paint the duke in a more empathetic light. Announcing his intention to stand down from public duties, the duke confirmed that he was willing \u201cto help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required\u201d. But, as with his television interview, the response raised more questions than it answered. \u201cHe\u2019s not committing to giving evidence to anyone who asks him. It\u2019s carefully caveated \u2013 deliberately so,\u201d said one legal expert who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cThe duke says \u2018if required\u2019 \u2013 so he\u2019s not prepared to do it voluntarily. It may well be a get-out. Epstein is dead, so there is not going to be a criminal prosecution of him. It may well be that law enforcement agencies are looking at prosecuting his associates involved in the trafficking of young women, but there may end up being no criminal prosecution.\u201d Epstein\u2019s victims are pursuing civil damages claims against the financier\u2019s estate, but lawyers believe it is significant that the duke has not signalled any desire to help them by agreeing to provide a witness testimony. \u201cIf he\u2019s genuinely concerned about helping victims, he needs to commit to assisting those who are representing them, as they have called upon him to do,\u201d said Richard Scorer, a specialist in sexual abuse cases at the law firm Slater and Gordon. \u201cAt the moment, his statement doesn\u2019t include that.\u201d John Cooper QC, a barrister who knows about rehabilitating reputations, having sought to have the conviction of Dr Crippen overturned on the strength of new DNA evidence, suggested there was no reason why the duke would not accede to the lawyers\u2019 demands. \u201cHopefully, as a man of public duty, he would be quite content to help them,\u201d Cooper said. The now notorious photograph of the duke with his arm around the waist of one of Epstein\u2019s teenage victims, Virginia Roberts, apparently taken in 2001 at the London mews home of Epstein\u2019s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has been cited as evidence that he could provide valuable insight. But there are claims the photo is a fake. The duke used his Newsnight interview to say he had no recollection of it being taken, that he did not recall meeting Roberts, and to categorically deny having sex with her. In 2015 the Metropolitan Police conducted a review of \u201cavailable evidence\u201d after receiving a complaint over claims lodged in court papers that a girl \u2013 now known to be Roberts \u2013 was \u201cforced to have sex with Prince Andrew\u201d. But the Met decided that the matter \u201cwould not progress to a full investigation\u201d, according to Channel 4 News. That decision perplexes some in legal circles. Several experts spoken to by the Observer point out that, in 2015, Scotland Yard was throwing substantial resources into investigating claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. \u201cWhat was different about this claim?\u201d asked one. A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard told the Observer: \u201cWe acknowledge the considerable interest and concern around this case and have revisited that decision-making and believe it remains entirely appropriate. Therefore no further action is being taken. The Met will always take seriously any allegation concerning sexual exploitation.\u201d But until the duke provides testimony under oath, it is likely that the controversy surrounding the photo will continue to haunt him. \u201cCan the prince be compelled to give testimony under oath in a civil case?\u201d asked Dominique Penson, a New York-based attorney who has handled many sex abuse claims. \u201cThe answer is yes. If he\u2019s compelled to give a deposition, they are taken under oath.\u201d Penson has served subpoenas on witnesses in European countries compelling them to give depositions for cases heard in the US, using a supranational legal mechanism called the Hague Treaty. \u201cHe could be served with a subpoena,\u201d Penson said. \u201cHe would not be compelled to come back here to give testimony but he could provide sworn testimony in the UK.\u201d Lawyers may also want to obtain documents that confirm the duke\u2019s whereabouts on key dates. He was provided with a security detail who were supposed to keep logs of his movements and carry out risk assessments of people he met. Do they exist and if so where are they? With his television interview and his subsequent statement leaving so many unanswered questions, it seems that the spectre of Epstein will loom large over the duke for years to come \u2013 years in which an enfeebled monarchy will attempt to redefine itself under a new king. But it may be that the duke is now beyond rehabilitation. \u201cI suppose he could try to do a Mother Teresa \u2013 or the classic example is John Profumo, who is generally said to have redeemed himself,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cBut it would have to be a pretty massive and visible act of redemption for people to say \u2018ah yes, well, we\u2019d love to have Prince Andrew as our patron\u2019. And I simply can\u2019t see that.\u201d The centuries of scandal This is not the first time the British monarchy has been rocked by scandal. Even before social media and the tabloid press, the royals were regularly the object of public outrage and ridicule. Here, Kate Williams, professor of history at Reading University, looks at how the palace has dealt with disgrace in the past. Frederick, Duke of York, 1809 George III had seven sons and six daughters. By 1800, they had between them 56 illegitimate children and one legitimate child, Charlotte, daughter of the Prince of Wales. The brothers and sisters generated scandal apace \u2013 including the Prince of Wales\u2019s shocking attempts to divorce his wife for adultery. But society was rocked by the acts of his brother, Frederick, duke of York. His mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, needed money to maintain her position and began selling army positions. The married duke was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces \u2013 thus the nursery rhyme, The Grand Old Duke of York \u2013 so this was corruption on a huge scale. MPs investigated and Clarke appeared looking marvellously chic and read out the duke\u2019s love letters. He was widely mocked and derided and was forced to give up his position and live quietly away from the public glare \u2013 no more mistresses. Edward VII, 1869 Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, known popularly as \u201cBertie\u201d was spoiled and debauched. He visited brothels, openly consorted with women and had dozens of mistresses, including Alice Keppel, the great-grandmother of Camilla Parker Bowles \u2013 who was even invited to his deathbed \u2013 and the actress Lillie Langtry. In 1869, the young Scottish aristocrat Harriet Mordaunt gave birth to a girl who seemed as if she might be blind and Lady Mordaunt panicked about sexually transmitted diseases. She confessed to her husband her various affairs, including the prince, and Lord Mordaunt said he would divorce herfor adultery. A prince called as the third party in a divorce case, would be a real threat to the monarchy. Harriet\u2019s family also feared the scandal and so she was declared insane and locked in an asylum for the rest of her life. Bertie\u2019s public reputation was saved \u2013 and he acceded to the throne after Victoria\u2019s death in 1901. Edward VIII, 1936 In the 1920s, Edward, Prince of Wales, handsome, youthful and idealistic, was seen as the future of the monarchy. He was fond of older married women and by his mid-thirties had fallen in love with a witty American, Mrs Wallis Simpson. When he ascended the throne in 1936, he began to talk seriously of marriage. Prime minister Stanley Baldwin told him it was politically impossible for him to marry the soon to be twice-divorced Simpson \u2013 the Church of England would not accept it and public opinion would be vehemently opposed. The king was on a collision course with his ministers and Baldwin feared that the matter would bring down his government. Finally, Edward decided to abdicate and, on 10 December 1936, made the announcement to the nation. He was essentially exiled for the rest of his life and died in his home near Paris in 1972. Divorce, 1978 Princess Margaret\u2019s marriage to society photographer Lord Snowdon was crumbling when she met Roddy Llewellyn a handsome young aristocratic landscape gardener, who, at 25, was 17 years her junior. They began a passionate love affair, much of it conducted at her beautiful villa in Mustique. In February 1976, the News of the World published front-page pictures of Margaret and Roddy enjoying themselves on the beach \u2013 and a huge scandal erupted. Snowdon insisted on divorce (despite his own many affairs) and the press and many politicians attacked Margaret for being a \u201cfloozy\u201d and a \u201croyal parasite\u201d and there was talk of taking her off the civil list.It was the first royal divorce since Princess Victoria Melita in 1901 (who had a very unhappy marriage). Margaret was devastated and heartbroken and, although Roddy eventually married another, her public reputation suffered greatly. Annus horribilis, 1992 As she herself put it, 1992 was the Queen\u2019s annus horribilis. In spring, the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson announced their separation \u2013 and the notorious \u201ctoe-sucking\u201d photographs of Sarah sunbathing with her financial adviser caused huge scandal in the summer. Then the marriage of Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales, imploded. The bombshell book, Diana, Her True Story, by Andrew Morton was published in May 1992, laying bare Diana\u2019s suicide attempts, eating disorders and suspicions about Camilla Parker Bowles. Then the leaks began \u2013 a phone exchange between Diana and James Gilbey, who called her \u201cSquidgy\u201d, detailed in the Sun and a transcript of an intimate conversation between Camilla and Prince Charles. In December of that year, prime minister John Major announced the \u201camicable separation\u201d of the pair. The war of the Windsors continued and the Queen pushed them to divorce in 1995. The divorce was supposed to stop the talk; it did not. Diana continued to attract a huge amount of press wherever she went. Her death in 1997 turned what had been a royal scandal into a tragedy.",

Right now, they sit nine points off the blistering pace set by Liverpool ... and a point behind both Leicester City and Chelsea.

The Blues have their tails up - and they\u2019ll also take heart from their impressive win over City at Stamford Bridge nearly a year ago.</p> <p><strong>City will be desperate to keep on Liverpool\u2019s shoulder, and keep their dreams of a hat-trick of league titles alive. </strong>But Chelsea will have designs on the title race themselves, and any sort of positive result here would signal that they\u2019re not intending to go away. This match could potentially affect the story of the entire season. So will City reassert their authority? Or will Chelsea\u2019s unexpected challenge get that little bit more serious? It\u2019s going to be a blast finding out ... and it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>5.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Jamie Jackson was our man at the Etihad. Here\u2019s his report. Enjoy, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Frank Lampard\u2019s turn. \u201cSome big parts were good. Some parts we can improve on. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a gap. We went toe-to-toe in the main. A moment of quality from Mahrez, and a deflection, was the difference. Games can be won or lost in the boxes and that was the difference. We\u2019re coming to close the gap, and we\u2019ll have to show our response to losing for the first time in a long time. We\u2019re in the early stages, but if we keep working we\u2019ll be coming.\u201d Guardiola also gave an update, of sorts, on Sergio Aguero, who limped off injured. It\u2019s a \u201cmuscular\u201d injury, and he\u2019ll require a scan tomorrow. He might be out for \u201csome days during the toughest part of our season\u201d. Pep\u2019s thoughts. \u201cIt was a top game between top sides. A great victory for us. After they scored, we suffered a little bit, and in their best moments we scored. Then we created a lot of chances. They are a top side but we fought a lot and it\u2019s a great victory. They are so good, they are an incredible team. It\u2019s Chelsea. The last 15, 20 years it was always United and Chelsea. The top teams want to play and go forward, they are playing very well. Liverpool, Leicester, us and Chelsea. I give a lot of credit to my team.\u201d That was a very impressive performance by the champions. They were all over the shop for the best part of half an hour, and having fallen behind to N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s goal, will have started to fret a little about the title race. But this City side aren\u2019t back-to-back champs for nothing, and they refused to panic. They slowly reasserted their authority in midfield and will wonder how they didn\u2019t win by a larger margin in the end. Not that it matters a whole lot. A win\u2019s a win\u2019s a win, ain\u2019t that the truth. Chelsea meanwhile can take heart from their performance in the early stages. It didn\u2019t bear fruit today, but there\u2019s no shame in a young side losing to this Pep machine. And here\u2019s Mary Waltz with the tl;dr version: \u201cChelsea ran out of gas or ideas, City kept their cool and got the win they had to have. Kudos to them.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t matter! City move into third, leapfrogging Chelsea and keeping on Liverpool and Leicester\u2019s tail! A hair on Sterling\u2019s arm had wafted offside, apparently. What a fiasco VAR is. Sterling has done next to nothing today ... except seal the deal for the champions! He latches onto Jesus\u2019s header down the middle, swivels, and guides a shot into the bottom left! Kepa should have done better, but a decent finish nonetheless. 90 min +2: Mount\u2019s effort - from the best part of 30 yards - flies wide left. But not a million miles away from the top corner. Ederson was diving over at full stretch, taking no chances whatsover. 90 min +1: Kante latches onto a loose Sterling pass in midfield and races into the City half. Gundogan clips his heel cynically, taking a booking for the team. Mount is preparing to take a belt at the free kick from long range. 90 min: The Etihad is a little bit nervous. For all City\u2019s dominance in this second half, they\u2019re still just one lapse away from dropping a couple more precious points in the title race. The four minutes to be added on won\u2019t go particularly quickly for them. 88 min: Mahrez flicks Foden into acres down the left, but the young midfielder hits a blind cross to nobody in particular. He may as well have taken a shot. 87 min: Mount attempts to release Willian with a long pass down the inside right, but Mendy reads well and intercepts, before drawing a foul that eases the pressure on the champions. Time is on their side. 85 min: Ederson plays a lazy pass out, straight at Batshuayi. The ball balloons off the striker\u2019s backside, over the keeper, and fortunately for City, out of play to the right of goal. On the touchline, Pep simmers quietly. 84 min: Chelsea have enjoyed nearly 70 percent of possession in the last ten minutes. However only six percent of the play has taken place in City\u2019s final third. 82 min: Chelsea are beginning to ask the odd question. Mount bombs down the middle and tries to release Batshuayi with a sliderule pass along the inside-left channel. Batshuayi should take up possession just inside the City box, but falls over and the ball rolls out for a goal kick instead. 80 min: Chelsea spring forward. Pulisic breaks fast down the left and swans inside. He lays off to Willian, whose first touch isn\u2019t the best, but the ball sits up and allows him to take a Le Tissieresque lash at goal. It\u2019s going over the bar, but Ederson fingertips over anyway. But Chelsea don\u2019t get the corner they deserve. Willian is fuming. 79 min: Chelsea knock it around the back, but City are pressing hard and they\u2019re struggling to break out of their final third. 77 min: Foden takes another speculative effort at goal. His sidefoot slap flies harmlessly wide left. 76 min: Augero is limping. City are taking no chances, and on comes Jesus in his stead. Aguero takes an absolute age to trot off; expect a little time to be added on for that brazenly drawn-out farewell at the end. 74 min: A double change for Chelsea. Batshuayi and Mount replace Abraham and Jorginho. 72 min: Foden has a crack from distance. Kepa smothers. Then Sterling chips over the Chelsea back line. Aguero, chasing, runs into James and wants a penalty. But he\u2019s not getting it, Martin Atkinson deeming it an accidental collision. 71 min: Willian, Abraham, Kovacic and Pulisic combine artfully, pinging first-time passes to each other down the middle and nearly opening City up. The move comes to a pitiful end, however, as Abraham miscontrols, then assumes he\u2019ll win a corner off Fernandinho. But the Brazilian isn\u2019t giving it up, and draws a foul from the young striker, who panics upon realising he shouldn\u2019t have powered down. 69 min: James makes another run down the right. He whips a Beckhamesque cross towards Abraham by the far post. The striker is an inch or two away from connecting. But what delivery by the young full-back. He really does look like a player. 68 min: James crosses from the right. The ball\u2019s only half-cleared, and falls to Willian, who blazes over wildly from a promising position down the inside-right. A decent half-chance wasted by a rush of blood to the noggin. Chelsea don\u2019t need to panic yet. 67 min: The old warrior can\u2019t continue. He\u2019s replaced by Foden. 66 min: A pause as Silva gets treatment for cramp. 65 min: Fernandinho, Silva and Sterling triangulate sharply down the let and win their fourth corner of the evening so far. De Bruyne swings long. Aguero clips it back into the mixer from the right. Fernandinho, coming in from the left, shoots straight at Azpilicueta. The ball breaks to Mahrez, whose rising shot is tipped over by Kepa. Nothing comes of the resulting corner, but City are pushing hard for the third goal that would surely put this game to bed. 63 min: A rare period of second-half possession for Chelsea. They stroke it around the middle, then Kovacic tries to release Willian with a quick pass down the right. Not quite. But it\u2019s a little bit better from the visitors, for whom the opening half hour must seem quite a long time ago. 61 min: Jorginho is booked for a cynical block on De Bruyne, who was looking to make good up the left wing. No argument. 59 min: Emerson is replaced by James, who will offer some extra pace at right back while the captain Azpilicueta shifts across to the other flank. 57 min: Chelsea commit too many players to an attack, and suddenly Mahrez is heading the other way. He\u2019s got time and space to work in, and options either side, but instead dallies before taking a shot that\u2019s blocked easily. Aguero is incensed, though he tries to keep the attack going, unsuccessfully as it happens. 56 min: Stones tries to guide a header goalwards, but it\u2019s deflected wide. The second corner is a training-ground masterpiece, Mahrez pulling it back for Cancelo, who is free in a pocket just inside the Chelsea box on the right. Cancelo slapshots towards the bottom left, where Aguero waits to bundle home, but Azpilicueta is on hand to block and clear. 55 min: De Bruyne romps down the right and enters the box at great speed. He hits a shot - or is it a cross? - towards the far corner. Kepa feathers it with his fingertips and that\u2019ll be a corner. 54 min: Chelsea finally put something together in attack, Willian driving down the right and seeing his shot blocked pretty much the second it leaves his boot. City clear. But Chelsea come back again, quickly, Willian playing a reverse pass down the right to release Azpilicueta, who cuts back from the byline for Kante. The shot that follows is deflected inches wide of the right-hand post by Fernandinho. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. 52 min: Rodri appears to have picked up some sort of tweak. He\u2019s replaced by Gundogan. 51 min: More of the City passing. Chelsea have completely misplaced their early verve. 49 min: And then suddenly Mahrez sashays in from the right and pulls the trigger, sending the ball inches wide of the left-hand post. Kepa might have had that covered ... but you wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it. 48 min: City have hardly given Chelsea a sniff since the restart. They continue to pass it around, a statement of intent. 46 min: City finished the first half very strongly, and in the early exchanges of this second period, they\u2019re looking to reestablish that domination. They ping the ball around in the sterile manner, making Chelsea nip about hither and yon. City get the ball rolling for the second half. No half-time changes. Half-time reading. Just in case you\u2019re wondering why both teams are going for it in such devil-may-care fashion ... The thrills of association football, the rhythms of basketball. That was magnificent fun. Where did those 45 minutes go? 45 min +1: They nearly don\u2019t make it safe to the shore. Sterling is sent scampering down the left. He\u2019s in an awful lot of space, but when he brings Silva and Aguero into the mix, the trio overthink things on the edge of the box. A couple of pointlessly intricate flicks later, and Silva\u2019s passing the ball out for a goal kick, with Sterling standing offside. 45 min: Chelsea stroke it around the back awhile. They\u2019re waiting for the half-time whistle, and a change to regroup, because for the first time they\u2019re beginning to look a little ragged. 43 min: Kepa gets away with a howler! He shanks a pass upfield, straight to Aguero. The striker\u2019s eyes light up ... but he somehow fails to make Chelsea pay, lofting a shot over the keeper, towards the top left, and off the crossbar! Chelsea clear their lines. 41 min: ... and neither is VAR. The correct decision. There was no significant contact. 40 min: City scream for a penalty kick. Silva is released into the box down the left by Sterling. Silva swivels and crosses low for Aguero, who tries to nip in ahead of Tomori but falls over instead. Martin Atkinson isn\u2019t interested ... 39 min: Willian scampers down the right and reaches the byline. He flicks a pass towards Abraham at the near post, but Stones gets in the road. City clear. Chelsea are still looking dangerous every time they cross the halfway line. 38 min: So far, City are leading Chelsea 7-6 on attempts. How is this only 2-1? We should ask that sort of question more often. Mahrez dribbles with purpose, in from the right. He slips between Emerson and Kovacic, opens his body as he enters the area, and slots a gorgeous curler across Kepa and into the bottom left! 36 min: De Bruyne cuts in from the right and very nearly sends a whistler into the top left. Inches over. What an effort! How is this still only 1-1? 35 min: Chelsea finally recover from the blow of the equaliser. Willian strides down the middle of the park, City\u2019s defence lined up in the avant-garde style once again. He should send Abraham, to his right, clear on goal, but hesitates and eventually plays the easier pass to Emerson on his left. Emerson\u2019s cross is no good, and that\u2019s that. 33 min: De Bruyne flicks a ball to Aguero, just inside the Chelsea box on the right. Aguero turns and shoots, but he\u2019s not got much space to operate in, and doesn\u2019t really catch it. Kepa gathers. 32 min: City were rocking hysterically back there, but suddenly they\u2019ve reestablished a modicum of control. That\u2019s why they\u2019re champions. They stroke it around the middle awhile, making Chelsea chase shadows, just because they can. 30 min: That\u2019s got the home crowd singing again. Most likely that isn\u2019t going to be an end to the scoring. The champions step it up! Fernandinho nicks the ball off Abraham in the centre circle, and City are away on the counter. The ball ends up at De Bruyne\u2019s feet, on the edge of the D. He drops a shoulder and sends a shot towards the bottom left. But the ball takes a huge deflection off Zouma, closing in, and whistles past a wrong-footed Kepa in to the other side! 28 min: Chelsea are bossing this. City\u2019s midfield - when was the last time we could truly say this? - is being overrun. The home faithful have slipped into a state of mild anxiety. The champions need to step this up. 26 min: Tomori launches long. Abraham nearly gets the better of Fernandinho in a one-on-one footrace. But City\u2019s makeshift central defender holds firm, just, and the flag went up for offside anyway. However, yet again, City looked threadbare at the back. They can\u2019t go on like this. 24 min: Another corner, after De Bruyne and Aguero dip into their bag of tricks and nearly open Chelsea up down the right. A set piece isn\u2019t much of a reward for an intricate move, especially when De Bruyne blooters it behind in uncharacteristically clumsy fashion. 23 min: That was no more than Chelsea deserved. City need a response, and quick. They earn a corner, but there\u2019s no instant redemption as Stones heads weakly off target. It\u2019s fair to say this had been coming. Kovacic, to the left of the centre circle, sprays a perfectly weighted ball down the channel to release Kante. Where are City\u2019s central defenders? There\u2019s a search party out for them. Meanwhile Mendy comes across to try to help, but Kante holds him off, draws the outrushing Ederson, and does enough to flick the ball past the keeper and into the empty net! 19 min: Willian drives at City, head down. He passes to Emerson, free as a bird on the left. Emerson strides into the area. He really should roll the ball across for Abraham to sidefoot home, but goes for glory instead. Bad choice. His poor effort flies straight down Ederson\u2019s throat, and then he receives the mother of all bollockings, richly deserved, from Abraham and a couple of other team-mates. 17 min: Mahrez and De Bruyne link up down the inside-right channel, the former nearly releasing the latter. The move is ended by Tomori, who heads cutely away from trouble when in a tight spot on the byline. Chelsea go straight up the other end, Pulisic driving at the City defence before scooping a chip over the back line for Abraham. As Abraham shaped to shoot, he\u2019s clipped from behind by Cancelo. It would have been an obvious penalty kick ... but Abraham was clearly offside, and City breathe again. 15 min: Willian and Kante combine well down the right and earn a corner off Stones. There\u2019s some head tennis in the box. Then the ball drops to Tomori, in a preposterous pocket of space to the right of the penalty spot. He lashes a shot inches wide of the bottom-right corner. This match is fantastic. Ludicrous, but fantastic. 14 min: This match is absurdly open. Both defences are all over the shop right now. Our pre-match pundits Mary Waltz and Hubert O\u2019Hearn had it damn straight, there\u2019s surely no way this is going to end goalless. Both sides could easily have netted a couple already. 12 min: Aguero showcases some Maradonaesque ball control in a tight spot just inside the Chelsea area. He can\u2019t get a shot away, so hands off to Mahrez instead. No joy for Mahrez either. 11 min: Jorginho cuts in from the left and slips a pass forward to Kante, who tees up Abraham on the edge of the D. Abraham attempts a chip over Ederson, but curls the ball just wide of the top-right corner. 9 min: From the restart, Aguero is sent scampering clear on goal by Ederson\u2019s long goal kick. But the whistle goes, because the ball was still moving when Ederson threw it down and punted upfield. 8 min: Now Chelsea show their teeth. Mahrez is robbed by a buzzing Abraham, who slips the ball to Willian on the right. Willian is in acres, with Mendy way out of position. He enters the box and, like De Bruyne minutes before up the other end, sends a diagonal daisycutter inches wide of the left-hand post. Give or take a few millimetres here and there, and this game would be 1-1 already. 6 min: Chelsea string a few passes together in City territory. But the move\u2019s broken up, and suddenly the hosts are tearing upfield on the counter. Silva feeds Aguero, who eats up the turf before slipping De Bruyne into acres to his right. De Bruyne opts to cut inside instead of entering the box directly to shoot, a strange decision that proves costly. Chelsea usher him away from the danger zone. 4 min: Suddenly City burst into life. Fernandinho rolls a pass down the inside-right channel from deep. Aguero picks it up and flicks it on to De Bruyne, who enters the box from the right and whistles a low shot across Kepa and inches wide of the left-hand post. That was a rapier thrust, and very nearly the opening goal. 3 min: Ederson kicks it long. Somebody\u2019s been watching Tottenham earlier today. 2 min: Chelsea win a throw deep in City territory. Within 15 seconds or so, the ball\u2019s back at Kepa\u2019s feet. Everyone carefully feeling each other out at the minute. It\u2019s a big game. Nobody do anything rash! Chelsea get the ball rolling. A massive roar. The ball\u2019s hoicked upfield and then it\u2019s City\u2019s turn to get an early touch. No fast start. Any road, the teams are out. There\u2019s the usual pre-match air of anticipation ... but a little bit of apprehension too. Both teams will be desperate for a win; anything else will seriously compromise their pursuit of Liverpool and Leicester City. We\u2019ll be off once everyone stops crooning Blue Moon. Seems you lot are expecting an evening of freewheeling entertainment. \u201cChelsea is probably the last team that City would prefer to see at this time,\u201d argues Mary Waltz. \u201cCity has to win. Lose this fixture and their hopes for a title are crushed. Chelsea form has been wonderful and even though on paper they should lose they may be too young and too talented to realise they are in over their heads. Should be fun.\u201d Meanwhile Hubert O\u2019Hearn adds: \u201cThis is a truly exciting match. Besides all the wonderful young talent Chelsea are bedding in \u2013 and City is vulnerable to speed which Chelsea has plenty of \u2013 what fascinates me is just how good a manager Frank Lampard is proving to be. In any major team sport, the rarest thing to find is a truly great player who becomes a truly great head coach/manager. Good for Lampard. Lampard always struck me as a solid, good sportsman and he\u2019s assembling a memorable team. Let\u2019s call this one an exhilarating 3-3 draw.\u201d Well that\u2019s fate tempted in the grand tradition. If it\u2019s 0-0 after 75 minutes, remind me to come back and delete this entry. Pep, in one of his more abrupt moods, didn\u2019t have too much to say in his pre-match chat with Sky Sports. He praised Chelsea\u2019s \u201cspirit ... they\u2019re free in their heads, they play good. Individually the quality of the players they have is a top-class team.\u201d He also insisted that swapping out both full-backs is not a reaction to defeat against Liverpool, and responded positively to a question regarding his team\u2019s likelihood of bouncing back from that loss in impressive style. \u201cYes.\u201d Frank Lampard\u2019s pre-match statement of intent: \u201cTo come to Manchester City and declare I\u2019m going to dominate with the ball would be a bit brave. But we have to be confident we can play. We\u2019ve been confident on the ball recently, creating chances, so we have to come with that idea. But we\u2019ve also got to understand we\u2019re coming up against a team that\u2019s been doing this for a few seasons to a really high standard. Both elements of our game, on and off the ball, will have to be spot on to get a result.\u201d There\u2019ll be a blue moon over Manchester this evening whatever happens at the Etihad. City will of course be playing in their famous sky blue. But their shirts are a different enough hue for visitors Chelsea to get away with their own royal version. The stakes have just got that little bit higher. The leaders Liverpool have won 2-1 at Crystal Palace, while second-placed Leicester City are 2-0 winners at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. As things now stand, Liverpool are on 37 points, 11 clear of Chelsea and 12 clear of City. Leicester meanwhile are certain to stay in second place tonight, on 29 points, unless Chelsea win 14-0 that is. So good luck with that. Barry Glendenning has all the details of the 3pm kick-offs. Manchester City make five changes to the team sent out at Anfield a fortnight ago. Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Benjamin Mendy and Riyad Mahrez replace Claudio Bravo, Kyle Walker, Angelino and Ilkay Gundogan, who all drop to the bench. David Silva is in for his suspended namesake Bernardo. Chelsea make a couple of changes to the side that saw off Crystal Palace two weeks back. Mason Mount and Reece James are replaced by Jorginho and captain Cesar Azpilicueta. Manchester City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy, De Bruyne, Rodri, Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Walker, Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus, Jose Angelino, Otamendi, Foden. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson Palmieri, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, Willian, Abraham, Pulisic. Subs: Christensen, Pedro, Caballero, Giroud, Mount, Batshuayi, James. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). There\u2019s a little bit of pressure building on Manchester City. The back-to-back Premier League champions, last season\u2019s imperious treble winners, are currently only fourth in the table. Right now, they sit nine points off the blistering pace set by Liverpool ... and a point behind both Leicester City and Chelsea. This picture could improve or get even worse by the time the 3pm kick-offs are done and dusted - more on those anon - but this is where City are at the moment. They haven\u2019t been here for a while. How they\u2019ll respond to that defeat at Anfield before the international break will be fascinating. The last time they lost on the road, at Norwich in September, they won their next Premier League match 8-0. ! That thrashing of Watford may give today\u2019s visitors to the Etihad pause for thought. Because Chelsea - for it is they - shipped six goals in this fixture last season. Uh-oh. Chelsea are a different proposition this time round, mind you. Frank Lampard has got his fledglings freewheeling all over the shop, and they\u2019ve won their last six Premier League games. The defence might not be totally dependable yet, but who cares when the attackers are having so much fun? The Blues have their tails up - and they\u2019ll also take heart from their impressive win over City at Stamford Bridge nearly a year ago. City will be desperate to keep on Liverpool\u2019s shoulder, and keep their dreams of a hat-trick of league titles alive. But Chelsea will have designs on the title race themselves, and any sort of positive result here would signal that they\u2019re not intending to go away. This match could potentially affect the story of the entire season. So will City reassert their authority? Or will Chelsea\u2019s unexpected challenge get that little bit more serious? It\u2019s going to be a blast finding out ... and it\u2019s on! Kick-off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>That \u201cthe journey down the birth canal is the most dangerous any of us will ever undertake\u201d used to be a favoured saying among the more sententious sort of obstetrician. The maxim was unlikely, as they must have known, to inspire much confidence in the birth process, definitely not if left to its own devices.</p> <p>Probably because of another implication \u2013 that bow-tied male physicians were at least as vital to the weaker sex\u2019s labouring performance as traffic police are to motorways \u2013 the journey analogy has been eclipsed by the more empowering mantra of \u201cpregnancy is not an illness\u201d and assurances, originating in the natural childbirth movement, that \u2013 done right \u2013 the act of giving birth could be a transformatively rewarding, even \u201cpsychosexual\u201d experience. The quality of joy seemed to depend, particularly, on how successfully the labourer had escaped medical intervention, from pain relief to induction. Checking out the NCT advice after a good two-decade gap, I discover that, although \u201cnatural\u201d in childbirth seems at some point to have been replaced with the less contentious \u201cstraightforward\u201d, the organisation\u2019s belief in the superiority of intervention-free birth appears undiminished since the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/12/sheila-kitzinger\" title=\"\">Sheila Kitzinger</a> first communicated the ecstasies that clinicians had suppressed.</p> <p>Among <a href=\"https://www.nct.org.uk/labour-birth/different-types-birth/vaginal-birth/what-straightforward-birth\" title=\"\">the benefits of \u201cstraightforward\u201d delivery</a> itemised by the NCT are \u201cyou are more likely to feel satisfied with your labour\u201d and \u201cless likely to experience psychological problems like depression\u201d. It notes that there are no guarantees on how to achieve satisfaction, though for low-risk mothers \u201cyour own comfy home or a midwife-led unit are strong options\u201d. Even in the comfiest of homes, the NCT admits, \u201cthere is a slightly increased risk to your baby\u201d.</p> <p>The degree to which NCT precepts have been normalised was clear when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, emerged, the third time, from hospital, to renewed tributes to her exemplary ability to enter a ward, deliver a healthy child minus analgesics and leave groomed and in heels, in an unbloodied dress, within 45 minutes, give or take. <em>Mail</em> headline: \u201c11 hours\u2019 labour and all natural! How serene Kate sailed through a textbook delivery as she goes through the perfect birth she was hoping for\u201d.</p> <p>Once its anti-patriarchal origins are forgotten or dispensed with, the philosophy of natural childbirth campaigners has obvious attractions for NHS cost-cutters and for anybody convinced, for whatever reason, that women have, as per, been making a fuss about nothing. In their aversion to elective caesareans, these disparate groups have found something around which they can all unite. More generally, where once unlucky mothers encountered an authoritarian determination to medicalise childbirth, recent reports indicate an occasional hostility towards intervention, which could, in extreme cases, be at least as damaging. The recent investigation into avoidable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/03/morecambe-bay-report-lethal-mix-problems-baby-deaths-cumbria\" title=\"\">deaths at Furness hospital</a> between 2004 and 2013 uncovered, among its horrifying failures, a determination among midwives \u2013 known as \u201cthe musketeers\u201d \u2013 to pursue \u201cnormal\u201d childbirth \u201cat any cost\u201d.</p> <p>Now the leaked provisional report into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/19/leaked-report-exposes-nhs-worst-ever-maternity-scandal-shrewsbury-and-telford-hospital-trust\" title=\"\">multiple deaths in Shropshire and Telford hospitals</a> says it was \u201cinadequately\u201d investigated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and identifies, among other failures <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/shrewsbury-maternity-scandal/nhs-maternity-scandal-shrewsbury-telford-hospitals-mothers-babies-report-a9207176.html\" title=\"\">detailed in the <em>Independent</em></a>, \u201ca long-term lack of informed consent for mothers choosing to deliver their babies in midwifery-led units \u2013 where risks can be higher if problems occur \u2013 which \u2018continues to the present day\u2019\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/28/post-term-pregnancy-research-cancelled-babies-die-sweden\">Post-term pregnancy research cancelled after six babies die</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps a suspicion of intervention, along with occasional fetishisation of natural/straightforward birth, also helps explain what is otherwise mystifying: that only now, after a major Swedish study, suspended after researchers concluded its continuation was unethical, is it confirmed that leaving induction until after 41 weeks is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/20/induction-recommended-for-women-still-pregnant-at-41-weeks\" title=\"\">associated with an increased number of stillbirths</a>.</p> <p>There will always, of course, be some women for whom the possible prize of a \u201cstraightforward\u201d birth cannot outweigh the substantial, extensively documented risks of vaginal delivery or even the ignominy freely associated with its alternative, an elective caesarean.

Swimming pools? Yes, lovely. A considered disinclination to risk urinary or faecal incontinence, vaginal tears, PTSD or, above all, stillbirth? Mad. Maybe the WHO should rethink its <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality\" title=\"\">factsheet </a>on maternal mortality (810 a day globally): it can only encourage unhelpful, caesarean-affirming reflections on human design flaws.</p> <p>Supposing this development can be partly attributed, as sometimes alleged, to consultant/husband convenience or lawsuit avoidance (which might alone say something about relative risks), the WHO does at least acknowledge that women are, in defiance of holy writ, refusing to consider childbirth a white-knuckle ride, acute pain as incidental and their bodies as collateral damage.</p> <p>What, it wonders, can be done to stop these mothers concluding that medical science can offer, in childbirth as elsewhere, a radical improvement on nature? The popular allegation, \u201ctoo posh to push\u201d, has proved ineffectual. The WHO prefers correction by \u201ceducational interventions\u201d or failing that \u2013 possibly inspired by some abortion arrangements \u2013 \u201crequirement for second opinion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16160f01d238583bebc7eb6891c37af7d803a75c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16160f01d238583bebc7eb6891c37af7d803a75c/259_0_4903_2943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baby being born via caesarean section.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baby being born via caesarean section.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mvaligursky/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Advice from the UK\u2019s RCOG is similarly of the view that planned caesareans being, for no obvious reason, wronger than home births, women who ask for them (though presumably not the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/11/nhs.health1\" title=\"\">third of female obstetricians</a> who do so) are similarly wrong, possibly mentally unwell.

      "bodyText": "That \u201cthe journey down the birth canal is the most dangerous any of us will ever undertake\u201d used to be a favoured saying among the more sententious sort of obstetrician. The maxim was unlikely, as they must have known, to inspire much confidence in the birth process, definitely not if left to its own devices. Probably because of another implication \u2013 that bow-tied male physicians were at least as vital to the weaker sex\u2019s labouring performance as traffic police are to motorways \u2013 the journey analogy has been eclipsed by the more empowering mantra of \u201cpregnancy is not an illness\u201d and assurances, originating in the natural childbirth movement, that \u2013 done right \u2013 the act of giving birth could be a transformatively rewarding, even \u201cpsychosexual\u201d experience. The quality of joy seemed to depend, particularly, on how successfully the labourer had escaped medical intervention, from pain relief to induction. Checking out the NCT advice after a good two-decade gap, I discover that, although \u201cnatural\u201d in childbirth seems at some point to have been replaced with the less contentious \u201cstraightforward\u201d, the organisation\u2019s belief in the superiority of intervention-free birth appears undiminished since the late Sheila Kitzinger first communicated the ecstasies that clinicians had suppressed. Among the benefits of \u201cstraightforward\u201d delivery itemised by the NCT are \u201cyou are more likely to feel satisfied with your labour\u201d and \u201cless likely to experience psychological problems like depression\u201d. It notes that there are no guarantees on how to achieve satisfaction, though for low-risk mothers \u201cyour own comfy home or a midwife-led unit are strong options\u201d. Even in the comfiest of homes, the NCT admits, \u201cthere is a slightly increased risk to your baby\u201d. The degree to which NCT precepts have been normalised was clear when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, emerged, the third time, from hospital, to renewed tributes to her exemplary ability to enter a ward, deliver a healthy child minus analgesics and leave groomed and in heels, in an unbloodied dress, within 45 minutes, give or take. Mail headline: \u201c11 hours\u2019 labour and all natural! How serene Kate sailed through a textbook delivery as she goes through the perfect birth she was hoping for\u201d. Once its anti-patriarchal origins are forgotten or dispensed with, the philosophy of natural childbirth campaigners has obvious attractions for NHS cost-cutters and for anybody convinced, for whatever reason, that women have, as per, been making a fuss about nothing. In their aversion to elective caesareans, these disparate groups have found something around which they can all unite. More generally, where once unlucky mothers encountered an authoritarian determination to medicalise childbirth, recent reports indicate an occasional hostility towards intervention, which could, in extreme cases, be at least as damaging. The recent investigation into avoidable deaths at Furness hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered, among its horrifying failures, a determination among midwives \u2013 known as \u201cthe musketeers\u201d \u2013 to pursue \u201cnormal\u201d childbirth \u201cat any cost\u201d. Now the leaked provisional report into multiple deaths in Shropshire and Telford hospitals says it was \u201cinadequately\u201d investigated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and identifies, among other failures detailed in the Independent, \u201ca long-term lack of informed consent for mothers choosing to deliver their babies in midwifery-led units \u2013 where risks can be higher if problems occur \u2013 which \u2018continues to the present day\u2019\u201d. Perhaps a suspicion of intervention, along with occasional fetishisation of natural/straightforward birth, also helps explain what is otherwise mystifying: that only now, after a major Swedish study, suspended after researchers concluded its continuation was unethical, is it confirmed that leaving induction until after 41 weeks is associated with an increased number of stillbirths. There will always, of course, be some women for whom the possible prize of a \u201cstraightforward\u201d birth cannot outweigh the substantial, extensively documented risks of vaginal delivery or even the ignominy freely associated with its alternative, an elective caesarean. To the consternation of sections of the NHS and the World Health Organization, this demographic is growing. \u201cWorldwide,\u201d says the WHO, \u201ccaesarean section rates have been steadily increasing, without significant benefit to the health of women and babies.\u201d It seems plain to them that this particular expression of female preference must be utterly deluded. Swimming pools? Yes, lovely. A considered disinclination to risk urinary or faecal incontinence, vaginal tears, PTSD or, above all, stillbirth? Mad. Maybe the WHO should rethink its factsheet on maternal mortality (810 a day globally): it can only encourage unhelpful, caesarean-affirming reflections on human design flaws. Supposing this development can be partly attributed, as sometimes alleged, to consultant/husband convenience or lawsuit avoidance (which might alone say something about relative risks), the WHO does at least acknowledge that women are, in defiance of holy writ, refusing to consider childbirth a white-knuckle ride, acute pain as incidental and their bodies as collateral damage. What, it wonders, can be done to stop these mothers concluding that medical science can offer, in childbirth as elsewhere, a radical improvement on nature? The popular allegation, \u201ctoo posh to push\u201d, has proved ineffectual. The WHO prefers correction by \u201ceducational interventions\u201d or failing that \u2013 possibly inspired by some abortion arrangements \u2013 \u201crequirement for second opinion\u201d. Advice from the UK\u2019s RCOG is similarly of the view that planned caesareans being, for no obvious reason, wronger than home births, women who ask for them (though presumably not the third of female obstetricians who do so) are similarly wrong, possibly mentally unwell. Addressing women choosing a planned caesarean, it runs through the risks, but not so you\u2019d realise that most obstetricians believe vaginal delivery to be more dangerous for a baby. You may, it kindly suggests, have \u201ctokophobia\u201d (extreme fear of childbirth). No, mate. Though you may have overactive paternalism. And that guidance preceded the latest revelations about maternity care failures. Going for a vaginal delivery? Then you probably know the physical risks. But are you familiar with prevailing childbirth ideology at your chosen provider? \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

Chelsea\u2019s response was instant. Willian was found on a curving run along City\u2019s left but his effort missed to Ederson\u2019s right. This signalled a period of pressure that had Emerson Palmieri, Christian Pulisic, Jorginho and Tammy Abraham probing City\u2019s defence. The contest was a frantic affair. One moment De Bruyne was creating an opening, the next Chelsea had a corner: from it a chance fell to Fikayo Tomori but he failed to test Ederson. Jo\u00e3o Cancelo \u2013 preferred to Kyle Walker at right-back \u2013 won a throw-in near Chelsea\u2019s left corner flag but it was no surprise to find his team defending moments later. The visitors burst upfield and City sighed with relief when Abraham was adjudged to be offside. Lampard\u2019s side were moving possession swiftly and this was how they would score. Mateo Kovacic swapped passes with Jorginho and then flipped the ball into the breaking Kant\u00e9. He ran on and, though Benjamin Mendy galloped across, the City left-back could not prevent Kant\u00e9 from rolling the ball home as Ederson rushed out. The goal again illustrated City\u2019s vulnerability when opponents come at them quickly, especially with their defensive linchpin, Aymeric Laporte, a long-term absentee. Chelsea were controlling the contest through triangular passes inside City\u2019s half, but Guardiola\u2019s men broke away again for their equaliser. Fernandinho intercepted a Jorginho ball near halfway, then De Bruyne took over. There was fortune in how his shot beat Arrizabalaga \u2013 the ball ricocheting off Kurt Zouma\u2019s boot \u2013 but this was an admirable City response. Even better arrived from the dazzling Mahrez as he ran a devilish diagonal at Pulisic and Emerson, swerving between them and finishing slickly to Arrizabalaga\u2019s right. Having been rocking now City had their visitors reeling after a turnaround that took less than 10 minutes. It could have been worse for Chelsea by half-time as Ag\u00fcero hit the upright when Arrizabalaga gifted him the ball. Moments after this only a mix-up between Silva and Raheem Sterling saved the visitors again in what had been a topsy-turvy affair. Rodri was replaced by Ilkay G\u00fcndogan on 51 minutes because of cramp. Guardiola will have been annoyed at the space Azpilicueta was now afforded to pull the ball back to Kant\u00e9 when only a trailing Fernandinho leg stopped what could have been the equaliser. City shrugged it off with an attack that ended with De Bruyne winning a corner. Lampard swapped Pulisic for James just before the hour. Soon after Silva found Sterling and Chelsea were lucky to escape. City dominated but still were too open, though Mahrez was unlucky not to make it 3-1 from close in. Phil Foden came on for Silva \u2013 who was also cramping \u2013 and later tried to beat Arrizabalaga but found only his hands. Sterling thought he had made the points safe late on but was once again denied by VAR, for a marginal offside.",

Responding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darren_levin/status/1196891871290646528\">criticism on Twitter last week</a>, Triple J\u2019s assistant music director, Gemma Pike, and Good Nights host, Bridget Hustwaite, said there\u2019s a large team that selects the music, consisting of many women and younger people. Kingsmill worked as Triple J music director from 2003-2017 but that title now belongs to Nick Findlay (in his 30s). In his new role, Kingsmill has oversight over the music on Double J, Unearthed, ABC Radio and ABC Country as well as the national youth broadcaster.</p> <p>Wards says such <a href=\"https://junkee.com/triple-j-just-appointed-music-director-isnt-53-years-old/102471\">(ongoing)</a> critiques are \u201coften pretty unfounded\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s a misnomer out there that there\u2019s one person out there that runs this stuff \u2026 Lots of people contribute to the music that we play, and that process is often not seen.\u201d He says the ages of these people range from \u201c20s and up\u201d.</p> <p>And the station is aimed at an \u201cincredibly diverse\u201d listener base which makes producing radio for everyone a challenge, he says. \u201cWe might be talking to a student in Melbourne, but also somebody driving a tractor in the bush \u2026 It\u2019s hard to have an archetype of who <em>the</em> Triple J listener is.

In his new role, Kingsmill has oversight over the music on Double J, Unearthed, ABC Radio and ABC Country as well as the national youth broadcaster. Wards says such (ongoing) critiques are \u201coften pretty unfounded\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s a misnomer out there that there\u2019s one person out there that runs this stuff \u2026 Lots of people contribute to the music that we play, and that process is often not seen.\u201d He says the ages of these people range from \u201c20s and up\u201d. And the station is aimed at an \u201cincredibly diverse\u201d listener base which makes producing radio for everyone a challenge, he says. \u201cWe might be talking to a student in Melbourne, but also somebody driving a tractor in the bush \u2026 It\u2019s hard to have an archetype of who the Triple J listener is. The only filter that we put on things is that [18-24] age bracket.\u201d The data suggests the station\u2019s doing a decent job at hitting the demographic, although Triple J still gets a significant share of the 25-39 age group in all major cities. This, of course, is just the radio broadcast. In the latest ABC annual report Triple J recorded a 40% jump in YouTube subscribers and a 27% bump in Instagram followers. Hack\u2019s Instagram followers grew by 62% in the past year, and Wards says: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at putting more resources [into] content that\u2019s online and socials.\u201d They are important streams for young people, many of whom don\u2019t have radios or cars. Maddy Macquine, 23, a community manager at the not-for-profit broadcasting organisation for young people, SYN Media, says it\u2019s \u201ca really exciting time for Triple J\u201d. \u201cGiving young people agency over their own media is important ... No one understands young people better than young people. If Triple J are ever in need of more presenters, I have a long list of talented and passionate radio makers who I can recommend, all under the age of 26.\u201d D\u2019Souza would also like to offer his services to the group music director, who will continue as host of his new music show on Sunday nights: \u201cIf Richard Kingsmill needs someone to help him download TikTok on his phone, he can hit me up.\u201d",

This is because \u201cit\u2019s inexpensive to put back and it\u2019s easy to put back\u201d. Ignoring your lawn allows you to save water for the plants that matter \u2013 usually those that are larger or slow-growing.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking for long-term change, he suggests replacing lawn with gravel, crushed granite or \u201ca drought-tolerant ground cover like a dichondra. Silver falls dichondra has a nice silver leaf and will cover the ground. It uses less water than grass and gives you a nice soft outlook.\u201d</p> <p>Albone makes an exception for those who\u2019ve got rainwater tanks or grey-water recycling systems. If you\u2019ve got large stores of non-potable water \u201cthen you can irrigate your lawn to keep it alive\u201d.</p> <h2>2. Save your trees</h2> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people put enough value in big trees in gardens,\u201d says Albone. \u201cThey get stressed by the drought and ... trying to replace a mature tree in a garden is incredibly expensive, sometimes impossible, especially the effect they give you.\u201d</p> <p>He suggests researching to figure out signs of drought-distress in your trees and larger plants, and watering them as and when they need it.</p> <h2>3. Water the right way</h2> <p>Watering is not just a matter of spraying the leaves of your plants, the approach a lot of gardeners take: \u201cReally you need to be focusing on the root zone of the plant.</p> <p>\u201cWith trees, you can teach them to be drought-tolerant by watering less often, but with more water. So you give the ground a good soaking and that really teaches the roots to grow deep into the soil, which prepares them better for drought.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/17/lessons-to-learn-about-growing-ferns\">Lessons to learn about growing ferns | James Wong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soaking your plants twice a week uses the same amount of water as a light daily spritz. \u201cIf you spread [watering] over seven days your roots will stay in the top area of the soil. If you use the same amount of water, but on two watering days, your roots will grow much deeper.\u201d</p> <p>When you water matters too: \u201cA lot of people will water at the wrong time of day. You need to water before 10am or after 4pm.\u201d</p> <h2>4. Mulch makes all the difference</h2> <p>Not only does mulch make your garden \u201clook a lot nicer\u201d it offers multiple benefits for your plants. Apply about 75mm of organic mulch around trees and in your garden bed. Mulch insulates the soil, preventing water evaporation and, as it breaks down, the mulch releases organic matter into the soil, which nourishes your plants and makes the soil hold more water.</p> <p>For veggie patches, Albone prefers pea straw or sugar cane mulch, but any course bark can do the trick. For pot plants, a layer of pebbles offers many of the benefits of mulching. Though they don\u2019t break down, they still prevent water loss due to evaporation.</p> <p>The best time to apply mulch to the garden is just after it rains: \u201cThat helps lock it in.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Pick future-proof plants</h2> <p>Albone recommends against trying to establish plants during drought unless they\u2019re equipped to cope with the conditions. If you\u2019ve got spots in your garden that need filling, choose drought-tolerant options. One of his favourite varieties is coastal rosemary.</p> <p>It\u2019s always good to do your homework, but you can often spot drought-hardy species just by looking at them. \u201cSo plants with really small leaves are generally suited to a drought because they\u2019ve evolved to have a small leaf that doesn\u2019t evaporate much water,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas if you look at a tropical plant with big open leaves that are used to getting a lot of water, they\u2019re not very good for drought.\u201d</p> <p>While many native species are more drought tolerant, natives are not a surefire route to garden success: \u201cYou still have to do your research.\u201d</p> <p>If conditions change, you don\u2019t need to worry about whether your new plants will hold up in wetter weather, either. \u201cAll plants like water,\u201d Albone says, although drought-tolerant varieties don\u2019t appreciate having water sitting around their roots. \u201cAs long as you\u2019ve got a free draining soil, the more water they have, the happier they\u2019ll be.\u201d</p>",

Save your trees \u201cI don\u2019t think people put enough value in big trees in gardens,\u201d says Albone. \u201cThey get stressed by the drought and ... trying to replace a mature tree in a garden is incredibly expensive, sometimes impossible, especially the effect they give you.\u201d He suggests researching to figure out signs of drought-distress in your trees and larger plants, and watering them as and when they need it. 3. Water the right way Watering is not just a matter of spraying the leaves of your plants, the approach a lot of gardeners take: \u201cReally you need to be focusing on the root zone of the plant. \u201cWith trees, you can teach them to be drought-tolerant by watering less often, but with more water. So you give the ground a good soaking and that really teaches the roots to grow deep into the soil, which prepares them better for drought.\u201d Soaking your plants twice a week uses the same amount of water as a light daily spritz. \u201cIf you spread [watering] over seven days your roots will stay in the top area of the soil. If you use the same amount of water, but on two watering days, your roots will grow much deeper.\u201d When you water matters too: \u201cA lot of people will water at the wrong time of day. You need to water before 10am or after 4pm.\u201d 4. Mulch makes all the difference Not only does mulch make your garden \u201clook a lot nicer\u201d it offers multiple benefits for your plants. Apply about 75mm of organic mulch around trees and in your garden bed. Mulch insulates the soil, preventing water evaporation and, as it breaks down, the mulch releases organic matter into the soil, which nourishes your plants and makes the soil hold more water. For veggie patches, Albone prefers pea straw or sugar cane mulch, but any course bark can do the trick. For pot plants, a layer of pebbles offers many of the benefits of mulching. Though they don\u2019t break down, they still prevent water loss due to evaporation. The best time to apply mulch to the garden is just after it rains: \u201cThat helps lock it in.\u201d 5. Pick future-proof plants Albone recommends against trying to establish plants during drought unless they\u2019re equipped to cope with the conditions. If you\u2019ve got spots in your garden that need filling, choose drought-tolerant options. One of his favourite varieties is coastal rosemary. It\u2019s always good to do your homework, but you can often spot drought-hardy species just by looking at them. \u201cSo plants with really small leaves are generally suited to a drought because they\u2019ve evolved to have a small leaf that doesn\u2019t evaporate much water,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas if you look at a tropical plant with big open leaves that are used to getting a lot of water, they\u2019re not very good for drought.\u201d While many native species are more drought tolerant, natives are not a surefire route to garden success: \u201cYou still have to do your research.\u201d If conditions change, you don\u2019t need to worry about whether your new plants will hold up in wetter weather, either. \u201cAll plants like water,\u201d Albone says, although drought-tolerant varieties don\u2019t appreciate having water sitting around their roots. \u201cAs long as you\u2019ve got a free draining soil, the more water they have, the happier they\u2019ll be.\u201d",

What\u2019s the problem with defamation law today? National laws have been in place since 2006, with states and territories passing almost identical legislation on their level. But Facebook was in its early days, Twitter wasn\u2019t on the scene and the most social of social media was MySpace. Most news outlets had an online component but most journalism was still in print, radio or television.

In the past few years there have been several high-profile cases where media have been ordered to pay millions of dollars in defamation compensation.

The New South Wales attorney general, Mark Speakman, has led a review of defamation law since June last year, and said in an opinion piece published on Friday that the laws were no longer fit for purpose, and courts are \u201coverrun\u201d with minor claims related to \u201ctrivial comments\u201d made on social media. There is not a lot of detail ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting but Speakman has hinted about what we can expect. What will it mean for media? The biggest change would be for online news articles. Under current law, any time an article is viewed it is considered a new publication, meaning publishers have indefinite liability every time someone clicks on an article. The changes proposed by Speakman would mean \u201cpublish\u201d as defined in defamation law means when the article was published on the internet, and not when someone clicks on it. There would also be a defence similar to that in New Zealand law that would allow publishers to claim the material was \u201cresponsible communication on a matter of public interest\u201d. Speakman also proposes a change to the cap on damages. The cap on defamation damages is just under $400,000 for non-economic losses, but there are provisions in the act for \u201caggravated damages\u201d which is why there have been millions awarded in the Wagner family case, and a high payout initially given in the Rebel Wilson case. There is not enough detail in the information available to indicate whether any of the proposed changes would make it easier for media to report on issues such as sexual harassment allegations or any of the cases that led to media campaigns for defamation law reform. What will it mean for everyone else? The goal of the reforms is to stop so many neighbourhood disputes over comments made online ending up in court, such as disputes over emails about mailboxes in an apartment block, or about posts on a local community group. Speakman said plaintiffs would need to show they have suffered, or are likely to suffer serious harm to their reputation, similar to how the law works in the United Kingdom. \u201cI acknowledge that this reform would leave aggrieved parties who don\u2019t reach the serious harm threshold without a remedy, apart from shaking hands and making up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the costs of defamation claims often massively outstrip the damage caused by actions that could be solved better over a coffee or barbecue.\u201d Prospective plaintiffs would also be required to provide a timely concerns notice so the matter could potentially be resolved quickly before it ended up in court. What will it mean for Facebook and Twitter? The first set of changes to defamation law won\u2019t cover online platforms. Porter has flagged that the government will consult on whether Facebook and Twitter and other online platforms should treated the same as publishers. Porter has said he believes they should be. This is a direct response to a NSW supreme court ruling earlier this year that found Fairfax, News Corp and Sky News were responsible for comments made on their Facebook pages in relation to news articles about a former Don Dale youth detention centre detainee, Dylan Voller.

      "bodyText": "The carcasses began to arrive in July. Residents around the Bristol Bay area of Alaska found thousands of dead short-tailed shearwaters washing up on remote beaches, and sent samples to Anchorage. \u201cWe collected about 100 birds for testing and they didn\u2019t test positive for any diseases or toxins,\u201d says Dr Kathy Kuletz of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. \u201cThey were severely emaciated. The birds had starved.\u201d Two months later, observers in Australia began to register similar concerns. Every year the shearwaters \u2013 also known as mutton birds \u2013 make a remarkable 15,000km migration from the northern hemisphere to breeding sites in the Bass Strait and the south-east of the continent. But this year they have arrived late, and in lower numbers than usual, leading at least one watcher in Victoria to warn that Australia\u2019s most common seabird could suddenly become one of its rarest if numbers plummet drastically this year. \u201cI\u2019m very, very concerned,\u201d says Peter Barrand, the president of Birdlife Warrnambool. Patchy and late return The arrival of shearwaters at places such as Griffiths Island and Phillip Island in Victoria is well known not only for its scale, but also its precision timing. But this year, something was wrong. \u201cThey arrived about 10 days to two weeks later than usual, and that\u2019s significant,\u201d says Duncan Sutherland, the deputy director of research at Phillip Island nature parks. In a good year, about 1.4m shearwaters return to burrows on Phillip Island, but Sutherland estimates that numbers are down by half. The birds that did arrive were in good condition, Sutherland says, but the patchy and late return has him worried. Many of the shearwaters are now heading towards Antarctica to feed again, before returning to the island to lay just one egg. In April, they fly back to the northern hemisphere. Back in Alaska, Kuletz believes she may have an explanation for the late arrival of the shearwaters. \u201cWe had some birds staying quite late,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had groups that were just too weak to head south. We saw late flocks sitting on the water very late in the season.\u201d The waters around Bristol Bay are part of one of the world\u2019s biggest salmon fisheries, and Kuletz says gillnet fishers were reporting unusual behaviour from the birds hanging around their boats. \u201cThis is a really remote and widely dispersed area. Most people wouldn\u2019t normally encounter them but [the shearwaters] were coming in, they were weak and approachable.\u201d Kuletz says about 6,000 shearwaters were reported washed up, but this would have been a \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of those that would have died in remote areas far away from human eyes. The most likely cause of the deaths, she says, lies in the unusually warm ocean temperatures. The hypothesis is that the warmer waters have dispersed the shearwaters\u2019 main diet of krill, while other fish unsuited to the warmer temperatures have moved away to find cooler waters. \u201cWe\u2019ve had these unusually warm waters and very little ice in winter and spring,\u201d she says. \u201cThe winters have been warming over the last few years. What we are seeing is very much out of the ordinary, certainly since they have been recording temperatures.\u201d \u2018Begging for food\u2019 Sean Dooley of BirdLife Australia says the organisation has received reports of dead shearwaters on beaches along the New South Wales coast, as far north as Port Macquarie, to Manly, Bondi, Coogee and Cronulla in Sydney, and as far south as Tathra. Dooley says it is very hard to know how many shearwaters may have perished, and whether the numbers this year are abnormal. The mass wreck of 2013 is still the worst known, he says, with more than 50,000 birds found dead. \u201cWe are still talking about a bird in its millions,\u201d he says. \u201cEven on good years they arrive with their fat reserves depleted.\u201d As in 2013, Dooley has heard reports of shearwaters \u201cbegging for food\u201d from fishers at Lord Howe Island. \u201cThat same thing was happening in 2013,\u201d he says. It is not unusual to find dead shearwaters on beaches, even in their hundreds, at this time of year. A 15,000km flight will always claim some. But some close observers are worried that something worse is amiss. For decades Barrand, of Birdlife Warrnambool, has set his calendar to the arrival of the birds to Griffiths Island, near Port Fairy in Victoria. A day or two either side of 22 September, the skies fill with them. This year, they were late.

It is a strain that has become more virulent in response to protests by Extinction Rebellion and the raised voices of those who care not to genuflect to the systems that have led us to the current crisis. It is a strain that conservatives use to their advantage. Two weeks ago, as New South Wales and parts of Queensland burned, the prime minister was at pains to argue that now was not the time to talk about climate change. And the centrists agreed. This week Scott Morrison was ready to talk about climate change and he had the script all prepared. Morrison told the ABC\u2019s Sabra Lane that \u201cthe suggestion that any way, shape or form with Australia accountable for 1.3% of the world\u2019s emissions, that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it\u2019s here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn\u2019t bear up to credible scientific evidence either\u201d. It\u2019s a line straight out of the climate-change denial playbook. No one is suggesting if we had a price on carbon there would be fewer bushfires, or it alone would significantly reduce global temperatures, but that does not mean Australia cannot make a difference. Only on climate change do you ever hear conservatives argue we are powerless.

If we do nothing, it becomes a strong reason for anyone who emits less than us either in total or per capita to do the same. And the problem is we are using what power we have to obstruct action on climate change. Morrison argued that \u201cif anything, Australia is an overachiever on our commitments, on global commitments, and for 2030, we will meet those as well with the mechanisms that we\u2019ve put in place and we\u2019ll ensure we do achieve that\u201d. What utter tosh. Our Kyoto commitment is based on the dodgy counting of land use; and our commitment to Paris targets doubles down on that dodginess by using carry-over credits from the Kyoto target \u2013 something nations such as the UK are now fighting hard to have removed. Our target is also well below what scientists say is needed to keep temperature rises below 1.5C. Thirteen months ago the UN issued a report that concluded we have 12 years to do something to limit climate change, after which it will be too late to keep the rise in temperatures below 1.5C. The science has not changed in that time; all that has is we now have only 11 years. But this week it was reported that fossil fuel production by 2030 is set to be double that which is needed to keep temperature rises below 1.5C. We are failing, and Australia\u2019s own policy is ensuring that failure will continue. But heck, pointing that out will seem biased, and so the centrist looks for a chance to appear balanced. It is why they have grabbed onto the disruption of Extinction Rebellion and loud claims by the Greens \u2013 because the centrist loves nothing more than being able to tell both sides to calm down. A clear example of this came this week from former ALP cabinet minister Craig Emerson, who wrote an opinion piece in the AFR denouncing tribalism that he argues is killing civil discourse. In it he suggested that \u201cnational socialism is resurgent. But so is international green socialism \u2013 a variant of white supremacism\u201d. Yes, nothing like suggesting sections of the environmental movement are racists to get that civil discourse going. Emerson suggested this white supremacism occurred when \u201cwell-off greens demand the races of Asia and Africa forgo economic development using fossil fuels to rectify the sins we white, affluent humans have inflicted on the planet\u201d. Yes \u201cthe races\u201d of Asia and Africa. Emerson didn\u2019t help his case against tribalism by spending most of the week on Twitter berating Greens supporters and suggesting the ALP was the only major party doing anything good on climate change (if the ALP isn\u2019t the biggest force of tribalism in Australian politics, I clearly need to invest in a new dictionary). He further weakened his cause by suggesting that people were arguing that poorer nations needed to shift immediately to 100% renewable energy. No organisation or person of any note is arguing this (although Emerson did find a random person on Twitter). But worse, this argument that fossil fuels help poorer nations is a retread of the old argument that \u201ccoal is good for humanity\u201d that Tony Abbott was pushing in 2014, and which was easily debunked at the time. It was the same argument that saw coal mining companies argue to leaders of the G20 that coal was needed because the WHO had reported that 4 million people die prematurely from household air pollution because \u201cnearly 3 billion people use primitive stoves to burn wood or biomass to cook and heat homes\u201d. Except what the WHO actually noted was that \u201caround 3 billion people cook using polluting open fires or simple stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass and coal\u201d. And yet Emerson\u2019s article, which pushed specious arguments about demands for immediate change to renewables, which likened sections of the environmentalist movement to white supremacists, and which echoed lines from mining companies was met with gushing praise from some very senior journalists. That\u2019s because the column called for calm and reason, and centrists love calm and reason and love even more to praise anyone calling for it. And so in the space of five years we went from an argument pushed by Tony Abbott and mining companies to encourage more coal mines being shown to be clearly fallacious to it now being praised as part of a reasonable approach. This is because centrists care more about being seen to be neutral than whether that neutrality is worthy, or worrying if the centre has moved. It is the force that has journalists and politicians arguing that we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good, and yet spending little time examining how good something has to be before the perfect becomes its enemy. Not all extremism is equal and no force of social or economic change happened due to people refusing to make waves. It happened because people were prepared to go to prison, be attacked, and seek to disrupt those who would go about their lives ignoring the issue. Centrists love the final vote that sees change occur \u2013 where politicians from both sides sit together and agree; they care only in retrospect for the work, suffering and effort over decades that leads to that change. And they ignore that throughout those decades, the powerful in the media and politics actively prevented change occurring by spending more time calling for calm and reason than noting reality. And so long as powerful journalists believe that arguments are worthy purely because they call for a middle ground, then ever will they be a force that prevents effective action on climate change.

      "bodyText": "The judgment in Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s defamation case against David Leyonhjelm will be handed down on Monday, more than a year after the Greens senator sued after a parliamentary debate in which he said she should \u201cstop shagging men\u201d. The Greens senator accused Leyonhjelm of \u201cslut-shaming\u201d her after his comments drew widespread condemnation and sparked a national debate about discourse in the Australia\u2019s parliament. She later filed defamation proceedings against Leyonhjelm after he refused to apologise for the comments, saying he had defamed her in a series of interviews he gave between 28 June and 2 July last year to Sky News, Melbourne radio station 3AW and the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program, and a media statement posted on 28 June. In the interviews, the former Liberal Democrats senator accused Hanson-Young of saying \u201cwords to the effect of men should stop raping women, the implication being all men are rapists\u201d. It followed a feud in the Senate in June last year which began after a debate about women\u2019s safety in which Leyonhjelm told Hanson-Young to \u201cstop shagging men\u201d, a comment that drew widespread condemnation at the time. Hanson-Young said she was defamed by Leyonhjelm\u2019s portrayal of her as a hypocrite and misandrist, in that he alleged she said words in parliament that were \u201ctantamount\u201d to claiming all men are rapists but \u201cnevertheless had sexual relations with them\u201d. During the April trial, Hanson-Young accused the former senator of sexism during cross-examination, saying he \u201ccalled me a hypocrite because I have sex with men\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s sexist about that?\u201d Leyonhjelm\u2019s barrister, Tony Morris, QC, asked during the trial. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say it to a man,\u201d she replied. Hanson-Young told the federal court in Sydney she felt \u201cset-upon\u201d and humiliated after Leyonhjelm gave an interview on the Sky News program Outsiders in which he claimed the Greens senator implied \u201call men are rapists\u201d during a parliamentary debate. She accused Leyonhjelm of engaging in a \u201ccampaign\u201d against her after the comments and made her feel like she was \u201cbeing punished for standing up for myself\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be in the chamber having a political debate, it\u2019s another thing to step outside and have to deal with lies and smears and excuses [that] have nothing to do with the debate you were having, and to have that constant bullying [and] intimidation continue \u2026 for 10 months now,\u201d she said in the witness stand.

Since then they have been travelling on skis pulling sleds with supplies.</p> <p>They planned to complete their journey by mid-November, by which time they hoped to have hit the edge of the sea ice where it meets the water so they could be picked up by their vessel, Pangaea.</p> <p>However, they have been slowed by the thinning ice, which has been credited to climate change. \u201cBecause of climate change the ice is thinner than usual, which is more prone to drift,\u201d Lars Ebbesen, the expedition spokesman, told Agence-France Presse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/melting-permafrost-in-arctic-will-have-70tn-climate-impact-study\">Melting permafrost in Arctic will have $70tn climate impact \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Normally there would be a positive drift of a few extra kilometres a day, \u201cbut the winds are pushing the ice toward Greenland and they have gone backwards three to five kilometres per day\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The duo, who have not asked to be rescued, hope to finish within 10 to 12 days, which is how long their rations will last. Ebbesen explained: \u201cThere is no danger, no huge drama. But it is touch and go \u2013 a mad dash to reach the goal. We are considering how to get more food to them in case it takes longer.\u201d The weather forecast is looking better, he added.</p> <p>Despite their situation, he said Horn and Ousland were in \u201csurprisingly good condition,\u201d adding: \u201cThey have a little frostbite but that\u2019s quite normal.\u201d</p> <p>But Horn\u2019s daughter, Annika, 26, told the French newspaper Le Parisien that her father was not in good shape. \u201cHis morale is very low. I\u2019ve never seen him like that, in such an extreme state of fatigue \u2026 My sister Jessica and I just want him to come home soon,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4470b0bee7d7e597185100cd49a35b77a4f60013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4470b0bee7d7e597185100cd49a35b77a4f60013/145_122_4729_3012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Horn allowed himself three months for the journey, which he should have completed by mid-November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Horn allowed himself three months for the journey, which he should have completed by mid-November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Wissmann/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bard Mortensen, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Northern Norway, said rescuers were \u201cconsidering precautionary plans at this point\u201d in case an evacuation was required. \u201cThere is no evacuation under way \u2026 they are determined at this point to make it on their own,\u201d Mortensen said. A helicopter or ship from Norway\u2019s nearby Svalbard archipelago would be able to rescue the pair, he added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mikehorn.com/\">Horn\u2019s website</a> \u2013 which allows browsers to track the adventurers\u2019 progress in realtime \u2013 paints a daunting picture of their journey, explaining time will be of the essence. \u201cThey are giving themselves a period of a maximum three months to undertake the traverse of the frozen Arctic Ocean via the North Pole,\u201d it reads. \u201cOnce the crossover completed, Pangaea and its crew will pick them up at the point where the open water meets the sea ice in the region of northern Norway.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cIf all goes according to plan and that Pangaea can be sailed as far as 85\u00b0N from Alaska, Mike and Borge will jump off the boat and start their expedition. They will have to cover 900 nautical miles on foot and skis (approx. 1666km) [1035 miles], across the frozen ocean passing via the North Pole. This distance is calculated without taking into account the unavoidable ice drift, which could double or even triple the overall distance the duo will have to cover to reach the other side.\u201d</p> <p>The pair\u2019s trip is the second part of Horn\u2019s \u201cPole2Pole expedition\u201d, after he traversed Antarctica via the South Pole in early 2017.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was supposed to be an epic 1,000-mile journey taking in the stunning snow-covered scenery of the North Pole as two adventurers embarked on a brave bid to cross the frozen Arctic Ocean on skis. But the experienced explorers\u2019 attempt has, quite literally, been left on thin ice as the pair struggle to navigate the harsh terrain in time \u2013 leaving them in a \u201ctouch and go\u201d position to finish before food runs out in 12 days. Mike Horn, 53, from South Africa, and Norwegian Borge Ousland, 57, set off from Alaska on their three-month journey at the end of August by boat, reaching sea ice on 12 September. Since then they have been travelling on skis pulling sleds with supplies. They planned to complete their journey by mid-November, by which time they hoped to have hit the edge of the sea ice where it meets the water so they could be picked up by their vessel, Pangaea. However, they have been slowed by the thinning ice, which has been credited to climate change. \u201cBecause of climate change the ice is thinner than usual, which is more prone to drift,\u201d Lars Ebbesen, the expedition spokesman, told Agence-France Presse. Normally there would be a positive drift of a few extra kilometres a day, \u201cbut the winds are pushing the ice toward Greenland and they have gone backwards three to five kilometres per day\u201d, he said. The duo, who have not asked to be rescued, hope to finish within 10 to 12 days, which is how long their rations will last. Ebbesen explained: \u201cThere is no danger, no huge drama. But it is touch and go \u2013 a mad dash to reach the goal. We are considering how to get more food to them in case it takes longer.\u201d The weather forecast is looking better, he added. Despite their situation, he said Horn and Ousland were in \u201csurprisingly good condition,\u201d adding: \u201cThey have a little frostbite but that\u2019s quite normal.\u201d But Horn\u2019s daughter, Annika, 26, told the French newspaper Le Parisien that her father was not in good shape. \u201cHis morale is very low. I\u2019ve never seen him like that, in such an extreme state of fatigue \u2026 My sister Jessica and I just want him to come home soon,\u201d she said. Bard Mortensen, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Northern Norway, said rescuers were \u201cconsidering precautionary plans at this point\u201d in case an evacuation was required. \u201cThere is no evacuation under way \u2026 they are determined at this point to make it on their own,\u201d Mortensen said. A helicopter or ship from Norway\u2019s nearby Svalbard archipelago would be able to rescue the pair, he added. Horn\u2019s website \u2013 which allows browsers to track the adventurers\u2019 progress in realtime \u2013 paints a daunting picture of their journey, explaining time will be of the essence. \u201cThey are giving themselves a period of a maximum three months to undertake the traverse of the frozen Arctic Ocean via the North Pole,\u201d it reads. \u201cOnce the crossover completed, Pangaea and its crew will pick them up at the point where the open water meets the sea ice in the region of northern Norway.\u201d It adds: \u201cIf all goes according to plan and that Pangaea can be sailed as far as 85\u00b0N from Alaska, Mike and Borge will jump off the boat and start their expedition. They will have to cover 900 nautical miles on foot and skis (approx. 1666km) [1035 miles], across the frozen ocean passing via the North Pole. This distance is calculated without taking into account the unavoidable ice drift, which could double or even triple the overall distance the duo will have to cover to reach the other side.\u201d The pair\u2019s trip is the second part of Horn\u2019s \u201cPole2Pole expedition\u201d, after he traversed Antarctica via the South Pole in early 2017.",

Where did your interest come from?</strong><br>It stems from my interest in human rights. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by courage and how people survive seemingly unsurvivable situations. What I found were these extraordinary people \u2013 who were actually ordinary people \u2013 who got up in the morning and thought: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to put up with this any more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I discovered to my surprise that everyone thinks the Italians had no resistance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Tell me </strong><strong>about the </strong><strong>women in the book.</strong><br>I discovered, to my surprise, that everyone thinks the Italians had no resistance. There were actually 600,000 who joined the resistance; of those, 70,000 were women. Under Mussolini, they were third-class citizens, had no rights, no voice, no equality. It was the women who were the first to rise up and help people. </p> <p><strong>One of the women, Ada Gobetti, dedicated her </strong><strong>memoir </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diario-partigiano-Ada-Gobetti/dp/8806219928\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Diario Partigiano</em></strong></a><strong> to her friends, saying </strong><strong>that solidarity founded on simple human rapport was important</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>I\u2019ve always been interested in friendship, particularly female friendship. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve had a group of women friends whom I\u2019ve known since I was 20 \u2013 we are still close. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/train-in-winter-caroline-moorehead-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Train in Winter</em></a> I explored how friendship helped women to survive; they looked after each other; they said our individual lives do not matter more than keeping other people alive. The friendship was intense among the women I write about who went to Auschwitz. Friendship gave them a sense of worth and value.</p> <p><strong>The mountains are </strong><strong> evoked as a place of refuge.</strong><br>The extraordinary thing about Turin is that the Alps rise away behind it seemingly forever. What I discovered is that a lot of people went into the mountains to hide. So this city and the mountains behind it, into which people disappeared, seemed such a powerful image.</p> <p><strong>The book seems resonant in our age of rising fascism in which the word resistance is often used.</strong><br>It is true. Not long ago the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> asked people to comment on <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/repeating-history-trump-fascist/\" title=\"\">describing Trump as a fascist</a>, and people wrote interestingly about it. In an interview in the 1990s, Umberto Eco defined all the things he thought stood out about the Mussolini era; they are incredibly similar to how you\u2019d describe Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p><strong>What was your research process?</strong><br>I grew up in Italy so it has always been part of my life. Italian war archives are particularly interesting as all the big cities have a resistance archive and the one in Turin is wonderful. I spent a lot of time there \u2013 they have collected every bit of documentation, from telegrams to letters to diaries.</p> <p><strong>Do you enjoy the research process?</strong><br>I love it. I love learning new things. It\u2019s wonderful to be paid to have continuous education. It makes me totally happy.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s fascinating what traces a person and societies leave behind.</strong><br>If I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s to leave no stone unturned looking for those traces. Going into an archive is a miracle of privilege \u2013 you open the packet and it gives insights, jokes, or nothing at all \u2013 it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box, and that\u2019s the best feeling. The journey of discovery is, for me, very important. I don\u2019t want to sit in my room doing my research online \u2013 I want to get out, as the writer\u2019s life can otherwise be very lonely.</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be a writer? </strong><br>Yes, always. Growing up in a family of writers taught me about writers\u2019 lives. My mother died before my first book came out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before the interview she put out her hand, I passed over $200, she counted it, and said: \u201cRight, two hours\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you become a biographer?</strong><br>I\u2019ve always been fascinated by peoples\u2019 lives. When I left university, because I was a girl, not too much was expected of me in those days. I got married the summer after I left university and we moved to Rome, and I was a psychologist for a year in a child psychiatric hospital. Then I went to work at the Italian version of <em>Playboy</em>, called <em>Playmen</em>, and I wrote naughty captions. I then was a journalist at the <em>Times</em> for a long time. I wrote profiles of people including Shirley Williams, Enoch Powell and Neil Kinnock. I interviewed Simone de Beauvoir, which was fun \u2013 she asked to be paid for it in cash. Before we sat down for the interview she put out her hand, I passed over $200, she counted it,, put it down and said: \u201cRight, two hours.\u201d I started doing a column on political prisoners. With my human rights writing I wanted to give identities to people who are traditionally just statistics, and to show that everybody has a story. It was while I was a journalist that I started writing books.</p> <p><strong>The new book </strong><strong>blends biography with history\u2026</strong><br>The first seven books I did were all biographies \u2013 but, increasingly, I like telling history through individual people or a village or a group of women \u2013 so what I\u2019ve tried to do over the past 10 years is to reinvent myself as a historian. I\u2019m so interested in the wider picture of how people lived within their times. I absolutely love history.</p> <p><strong>What books have shaped your life</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I went on a journey across the Sahara aged 30 and took Proust with me and absolutely loved it, so that\u2019s been an influence. Reading has been one of the most important things in my life, whether for research, pleasure or reviewing. I read about eight hours a day. I feel uneasy if I have days when I don\u2019t read enough. Reading is a way of losing oneself, and not being locked up with oneself is wonderful.</p> <p><strong>Wh</strong><strong>ich books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>Since I spend all day reading nonfiction for research, I like to read fiction at night.

      "bodyText": "Caroline Moorehead was born in London in 1944, has written biographies of Bertrand Russell, Freya Stark, Iris Origo and Martha Gellhorn and has been shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson prize and the Costa biography award. Her new book, A House in the Mountains, tells the story of the women who helped form the Italian resistance during the second world war. You have written three other books about the resistance. Where did your interest come from? It stems from my interest in human rights. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by courage and how people survive seemingly unsurvivable situations. What I found were these extraordinary people \u2013 who were actually ordinary people \u2013 who got up in the morning and thought: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to put up with this any more.\u201d Tell me about the women in the book. I discovered, to my surprise, that everyone thinks the Italians had no resistance. There were actually 600,000 who joined the resistance; of those, 70,000 were women. Under Mussolini, they were third-class citizens, had no rights, no voice, no equality. It was the women who were the first to rise up and help people. One of the women, Ada Gobetti, dedicated her memoir Diario Partigiano to her friends, saying that solidarity founded on simple human rapport was important\u2026 I\u2019ve always been interested in friendship, particularly female friendship. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve had a group of women friends whom I\u2019ve known since I was 20 \u2013 we are still close. In A Train in Winter I explored how friendship helped women to survive; they looked after each other; they said our individual lives do not matter more than keeping other people alive. The friendship was intense among the women I write about who went to Auschwitz. Friendship gave them a sense of worth and value. The mountains are evoked as a place of refuge. The extraordinary thing about Turin is that the Alps rise away behind it seemingly forever. What I discovered is that a lot of people went into the mountains to hide. So this city and the mountains behind it, into which people disappeared, seemed such a powerful image. The book seems resonant in our age of rising fascism in which the word resistance is often used. It is true. Not long ago the Times Literary Supplement asked people to comment on describing Trump as a fascist, and people wrote interestingly about it. In an interview in the 1990s, Umberto Eco defined all the things he thought stood out about the Mussolini era; they are incredibly similar to how you\u2019d describe Trump\u2019s America. What was your research process? I grew up in Italy so it has always been part of my life. Italian war archives are particularly interesting as all the big cities have a resistance archive and the one in Turin is wonderful. I spent a lot of time there \u2013 they have collected every bit of documentation, from telegrams to letters to diaries. Do you enjoy the research process? I love it. I love learning new things. It\u2019s wonderful to be paid to have continuous education. It makes me totally happy. It\u2019s fascinating what traces a person and societies leave behind. If I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s to leave no stone unturned looking for those traces. Going into an archive is a miracle of privilege \u2013 you open the packet and it gives insights, jokes, or nothing at all \u2013 it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box, and that\u2019s the best feeling. The journey of discovery is, for me, very important. I don\u2019t want to sit in my room doing my research online \u2013 I want to get out, as the writer\u2019s life can otherwise be very lonely. Did you always want to be a writer? Yes, always. Growing up in a family of writers taught me about writers\u2019 lives. My mother died before my first book came out. How did you become a biographer? I\u2019ve always been fascinated by peoples\u2019 lives. When I left university, because I was a girl, not too much was expected of me in those days. I got married the summer after I left university and we moved to Rome, and I was a psychologist for a year in a child psychiatric hospital. Then I went to work at the Italian version of Playboy, called Playmen, and I wrote naughty captions. I then was a journalist at the Times for a long time. I wrote profiles of people including Shirley Williams, Enoch Powell and Neil Kinnock. I interviewed Simone de Beauvoir, which was fun \u2013 she asked to be paid for it in cash. Before we sat down for the interview she put out her hand, I passed over $200, she counted it,, put it down and said: \u201cRight, two hours.\u201d I started doing a column on political prisoners. With my human rights writing I wanted to give identities to people who are traditionally just statistics, and to show that everybody has a story. It was while I was a journalist that I started writing books. The new book blends biography with history\u2026 The first seven books I did were all biographies \u2013 but, increasingly, I like telling history through individual people or a village or a group of women \u2013 so what I\u2019ve tried to do over the past 10 years is to reinvent myself as a historian. I\u2019m so interested in the wider picture of how people lived within their times. I absolutely love history. What books have shaped your life? I went on a journey across the Sahara aged 30 and took Proust with me and absolutely loved it, so that\u2019s been an influence. Reading has been one of the most important things in my life, whether for research, pleasure or reviewing. I read about eight hours a day. I feel uneasy if I have days when I don\u2019t read enough. Reading is a way of losing oneself, and not being locked up with oneself is wonderful. Which books are on your bedside table? Since I spend all day reading nonfiction for research, I like to read fiction at night. I loved Anna Burns\u2019s Milkman. I love Tim Winton. I\u2019ve become really interested in Japanese and Chinese novels, including those by End\u014d. There\u2019s a pile I\u2019ve spent my entire life trying to read but never get round to, including Robert Musil\u2019s The Man Without Qualities, which I\u2019ve tried to read about 40 times and now realise I never will. Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read? I\u2019m not terribly good at Dickens \u2013 I never liked him as I liked Hardy. I\u2019m appallingly badly read in the Greek and Roman classics. Now that a lot of books are on audio, I try to put classic books I haven\u2019t read on in the car \u2013 I did the whole of Trollope and a lot of Dostoevsky like that, and am currently doing Parade\u2019s End by Ford Maddox Ford on audio I love listening to books on a long journey. Do you have a guilty reading pleasure? I really like reading soppy historical novels. I absolutely love CJ Sansom\u2019s Shardlake series. I also like reading really good historical novels, too; I\u2019m a huge fan of Hilary Mantel. I love all historical fiction and it\u2019s great if they\u2019re set in a place I\u2019m going to \u2013 I read Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe, set in Greece, in the summer. Which contemporary authors do you most admire? Hilary Mantel. Tim Winton. Helen Garner. Ali Smith. What kind of reader were you as a child? I grew up in a house stuffed with books. Both my parents were writers. When my parents built a house in Italy there was no electricity so my father would read to us by the fire \u2013 Chekhov and Nancy Mitford. I remember reading Gone With the Wind, aged 12 or 13, and thinking, reading is a total pleasure that will never leave me. I loved Arthur Ransome and Treasure Island.

How do I know you haven\u2019t rigged your computer to show me fake news? asked the man whose party had just rigged a fake news feed. The mere act of asking questions became evidence of a disabling bias. The political usefulness of Gove\u2019s self-justification was as striking as his absence of self-knowledge. It allowed the Conservatives to use any tactic to fight such unscrupulous media opponents.</p> <p>For, and here we come to the central assumption of modern political discourse, Gove believed no one except the corrupted advocate of malign interests would question him. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do?\u201d asked Channel 4\u2019s Ciaran Jenkins, if we cannot question you on your own statements. Well, Ciaran, you\u2019re meant to be a good boy and suck it up was Gove\u2019s implicit reply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe128bb3dcb6c1a402ea06d9bc426e0f1e38c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe128bb3dcb6c1a402ea06d9bc426e0f1e38c51/0_141_3010_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove and Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove and Boris Johnson address the nation after the results of the 2016 referendum were announced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Turner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike the other architects of Brexit, Gove gets an easy ride. He affects a courteous manner. He reads books, and may even have finished a couple, and perhaps that\u2019s why critics back away. His answer to the question why the public should trust him after his many deceits is that as education secretary in the Cameron government he had promised to raise educational standards and as a result 1.9 million children went to good or outstanding schools.</p> <p>Yet history will remember Michael Gove, assuming it remembers him at all, for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz1_LHtfuCI\" title=\"\">Trump-era defining statement</a>: \u201cI think the people of this country have had enough of experts.\u201d</p> <p>He disparaged the results of a good or outstanding education for the same reason he disparages the hard questions of an open society: education, expertise, a free press must be disparaged if they pose the tiniest threat to the fatuous nationalist adventure he and his comrades have manacled their party and country to.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the projection of his own manipulativeness on to others: Gove\u2019s internal contradictions would keep a halfway competent shrink in work for years. The man who promotes education raises the mob against the educated. The national security conservative, who in his time was a neocon who fretted about the decline of the west, is now a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s security in ways that are worth taking a moment to understand.</p> <p>You can see why Gove and Johnson are so keen to sell the line that they will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d in a matter of months. They must pretend it will be easy to take the UK out of the EU in January and then negotiate a trade deal with Brussels by the end of 2020. While we wait for the negotiations to end, Britain will be subject to EU rules, pay the EU money and accept the free movement of EU citizens to Britain and vice versa. It will seem as if there is no point in leaving.</p> <p>The Conservatives could get over this embarrassment by striking a quick deal if they promise to abide by EU regulations on workers\u2019 rights, the environment and trade standards, and allow EU fishing fleets to carry on as before. But they say they won\u2019t because, once again, what would be the point of Brexit? A hard-fought deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/can-britain-reach-a-trade-deal-with-the-eu-by-the-end-of-2020\" title=\"\">will take years</a> to negotiate, during which we will be subject to EU rules, free movement and budgetary demands. You get the point. There is no point and the electorate cannot realise that before 12 December.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s sole diplomatic advantage is that it is a European military power. It can use the continent\u2019s security as a negotiating card. Don\u2019t think Gove\u2019s previous belief in national defence would restrain him. Brexit furthers Russian foreign policy objectives by weakening Britain and Europe, which is why, I suspect, the government has suppressed the report into Russian influence in the referendum. Do not imagine the supposedly patriotic Gove sees that contradiction either. If he tried to resolve his contradictions, he would fall apart.</p> <p>Fair-minded readers will say that a description of Gove\u2019s deceitful manoeuvres applies as well to Corbyn\u2019s politics, Trump\u2019s politics, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s politics and Bolsonaro\u2019s politics. Why pick on this little guy? My reply is that Gove\u2019s redeeming virtue is that he is a one-stop shop, where you can find all that is tricky and tacky 24/7 in one convenient store.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

It allowed the Conservatives to use any tactic to fight such unscrupulous media opponents. For, and here we come to the central assumption of modern political discourse, Gove believed no one except the corrupted advocate of malign interests would question him. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do?\u201d asked Channel 4\u2019s Ciaran Jenkins, if we cannot question you on your own statements. Well, Ciaran, you\u2019re meant to be a good boy and suck it up was Gove\u2019s implicit reply. Unlike the other architects of Brexit, Gove gets an easy ride. He affects a courteous manner. He reads books, and may even have finished a couple, and perhaps that\u2019s why critics back away. His answer to the question why the public should trust him after his many deceits is that as education secretary in the Cameron government he had promised to raise educational standards and as a result 1.9 million children went to good or outstanding schools. Yet history will remember Michael Gove, assuming it remembers him at all, for his Trump-era defining statement: \u201cI think the people of this country have had enough of experts.\u201d He disparaged the results of a good or outstanding education for the same reason he disparages the hard questions of an open society: education, expertise, a free press must be disparaged if they pose the tiniest threat to the fatuous nationalist adventure he and his comrades have manacled their party and country to. It\u2019s not just the projection of his own manipulativeness on to others: Gove\u2019s internal contradictions would keep a halfway competent shrink in work for years. The man who promotes education raises the mob against the educated. The national security conservative, who in his time was a neocon who fretted about the decline of the west, is now a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s security in ways that are worth taking a moment to understand. You can see why Gove and Johnson are so keen to sell the line that they will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d in a matter of months. They must pretend it will be easy to take the UK out of the EU in January and then negotiate a trade deal with Brussels by the end of 2020. While we wait for the negotiations to end, Britain will be subject to EU rules, pay the EU money and accept the free movement of EU citizens to Britain and vice versa. It will seem as if there is no point in leaving. The Conservatives could get over this embarrassment by striking a quick deal if they promise to abide by EU regulations on workers\u2019 rights, the environment and trade standards, and allow EU fishing fleets to carry on as before. But they say they won\u2019t because, once again, what would be the point of Brexit? A hard-fought deal will take years to negotiate, during which we will be subject to EU rules, free movement and budgetary demands. You get the point. There is no point and the electorate cannot realise that before 12 December. Britain\u2019s sole diplomatic advantage is that it is a European military power. It can use the continent\u2019s security as a negotiating card. Don\u2019t think Gove\u2019s previous belief in national defence would restrain him. Brexit furthers Russian foreign policy objectives by weakening Britain and Europe, which is why, I suspect, the government has suppressed the report into Russian influence in the referendum. Do not imagine the supposedly patriotic Gove sees that contradiction either. If he tried to resolve his contradictions, he would fall apart. Fair-minded readers will say that a description of Gove\u2019s deceitful manoeuvres applies as well to Corbyn\u2019s politics, Trump\u2019s politics, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s politics and Bolsonaro\u2019s politics. Why pick on this little guy? My reply is that Gove\u2019s redeeming virtue is that he is a one-stop shop, where you can find all that is tricky and tacky 24/7 in one convenient store. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

At the Hawthorns, Charlie Austin converted an 88th-minute penalty to keep West Brom top of the Championship. Hal Robson-Kanu\u2019s fourth goal in six games had given his side the lead against Sheffield Wednesday, but a Steven Fletcher penalty looked to have secured a point for the Owls until Matheus Pereira drew a foul in the box in the game\u2019s final stages and Austin slammed home. Leeds left it even later to seal a win of their own against Luton Town, Patrick Bamford\u2019s sixth goal of the season drawing a reply in the form of James Collins\u2019 bullet header. But Matt Pearson\u2019s 90th-minute own-goal \u2013 again forced by Bamford \u2013 saw Leeds take the points. They move into second, leapfrogging Preston who came unstuck at Derby County, first-half substitute Martyn Waghorn making an immediate impact to fire home the winner. Swansea fell to sixth with a home defeat to Millwall, Jed Wallace\u2019s sublime free-kick making the difference, while Nottingham Forest shared the spoils with fellow promotion hopefuls Bristol City, Ryan Yates seeing red at Ashton Gate in a game full of chances but devoid of goals. At the other end of the table, rock-bottom Barnsley came out the losers from a seesawing game at Blackburn, Cauley Woodrow chesting home a late leveller only for Bradley Dack\u2019s second goal of the game to clinch a win for the hosts, while Stoke took a valuable three points against imperilled Wigan, Mame Biram Diouf striking deep into stoppage-time to seal a 2-1 win. Huddersfield remain within three points of the drop zone after Birmingham\u2019s Marc Roberts cancelled out a well-taken goal from Frazier Campbell to leave the scores at 1-1. League One The leaders also left in late in League One, Wycombe snatching a late victory over 10-man Doncaster thanks to Joe Jacobsen\u2019s 92nd-minute spot-kick, a win that extended their lead at the top to five points after Ipswich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Blackpool, Jay Spearing and Luke Garbutt exchanging penalties after Joe Nuttall\u2019s close-range finish had cancelled out Gwion Edwards\u2019 opener. Coventry also lost ground on the leaders with a 1-1 draw at Sunderland, Benjamin Mgunga-Kimpioka stealing a point for the hosts in the last minute after Dominic Hyam\u2019s first-half header. Joe Ward\u2019s injury-time strike gave third-placed Peterborough a 1-0 win over Burton Albion, while MK Dons gave up a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at home to Rotherham to make it 10 defeats in 11. AFC Wimbledon put daylight between them and their loathed rivals with a nervy 1-0 win over Gillingham, Scott Wagstaff scoring the game\u2019s only goal against his former club. Bolton\u2019s season of misery continued apace, losing 7-1 at Accrington Stanley and having to play most of the game with 10 men after Josh Earl\u2019s early red card. They remain on one point, only four behind Sol Campbell\u2019s Southend, who fell to a 4-0 defeat at home to Oxford United \u2013 they climb into the play-off places. League Two Swindon\u2019s retained their two-point lead at the top of the table, Eoin Doyle 17th goal in as many league games sealing a 1-0 win against Mansfield, and Forest Green stayed closely on their tales as an Ebou Adams double steered them towards a 4-2 victory at his former club Leyton Orient. Crewe moved into the third automatic promotion spot, speeding into a three-goal half-time lead over 10-man Morecambe in a game that finished 5-0, while Bradford dropped to seventh after a 2-1 loss at Plymouth. Exeter\u2019s 1-0 win at Crawley took them up to fourth in a congested table where seven points separate the top eight, while a Conor Thomas penalty rescued a 1-1 draw for Cheltenham at home to Colchester but could not prevent his side being overtaken by Northampton, who prevailed 2-0 over managerless Grimsby. A game that had the look of a six-pointer ended a point apiece, with neither Walsall nor Stevenage able to break the deadlock at the Bescot Stadium in a result that leaves the two sides third- and second-bottom respectively.",

With 11 minutes gone, the deadlock remains unbroken in a very even and entertaining game, which you can follow with Scott Murray. Premier League: Marco Silva\u2019s position as Everton manager looks increasingly under threat after defeat at the hands of Norwich.

Premier League: Spurs survived a late scare at the London Stadium to win their first match under Jose Mourinho. Premier League: Arsenal\u2019s late, late equaliser wasn\u2019t enough to prevent them from being booed off at the Toxicity Dome that is otherwise known as the Emirates Stadium. It was a good result for Southampton, who will probably feel otherwise as they head for home. Conceding that goal at the finish makes them the only away team in the Premier League not to win so far today. Will Chelsea fare as well at the Etihad Stadium? Join Scott Murray to find out ...

Premier League: James Tarkowski heads a free-kick back across the face of goal and with his back to goal, six yards out, Chris Wood hooks the ball home. League Two latest Carlisle United 0-0 Cambridge United Cheltenham Town 0-1 Colchester Crawley Town 0-0 Exeter City Crewe 3-0 Morecambe Leyton Orient 1-3 Forest Green Newport County 0-1 Oldham Athletic Northampton Town 2-0 Grimsby Town Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Bradford City Salford City 0-0 Macclesfield Town Scunthorpe United 2-1 Port Vale Swindon Town 1-0 Mansfield Town Walsall 0-0 Stevenage Championship: Huddersfield take the lead against Birmingham City through Fraizer Campbell, while James Collins equalises for Luton against Leeds. Danny Batth strikes in the 55th minute to put Stoke level with Wigan at the Brittania Stadium. Premier League: Todd Cantwell beats Jordan Pickford in a one-on-one to get travelling Canaries fans at Goodison Park cheeping with delight. Championship: Pablo Hernandez tees up Patrick Bamford to put Leeds United a goal up against Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. Premier League: Two up against 10-man Bournemouth, Wolves have a third goal incorrectly ruled out for offside. Diogo Jota was playing - I think - Romain Saiss onside, but neither the referee, his assistants nor the lads at VAR HQ noticed. Premier League: Sadio Mane scores in his fifth consecutive game against Crystal Palace to put Liverpool ahead. Vicente Guaita in the Palace goal got a hand to the shot, but couldn\u2019t prevent it from going in off the woodwork. VAR! A shove by Jordan Ayew on Dejan Lovren in the build-up to Crystal Palace\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d against Liverpool means I have to use inverted commas. Lovren didn\u2019t score and was in no danger of scoring, leaving Gary Lineker unimpressed.

Take him off, Watford. VAR!!! That Palace goal is being reviewed by the VAR officials, who seem to have spotted a rogue shove on Dejan Lovren in the build-up to the Crystal Palace goal. They\u2019ve chalked it off. Premier League: James Tomkins scores at the far post, getting on the end of a deflected cross to put Palace ahead against the league leaders. Championship: It\u2019s Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s second match in charge of Stoke City and after masterminding victory in his first, his team is behind in his second.

Championship: Bradley Dack fires home from 10 yards out to put Blackburn ahead against Barnsley. Premier League: Raul Jimenez doubles Wolves\u2019 lead at the Vitality Stadium, getting on the end of a cross from Armand Traore after Bournemouth\u2019s players nodded off at a free-kick. League One: They\u2019re flying in in the third tier, by contrast, where Phil Parkinson\u2019s poor start as Sunderland manager of Sunderland continues. Out of all three cup competitions already this season, they trail Coventry City at the Stadium of Light. AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Gillingham Accrington Stanley 2-1 Bolton Fleetwood Town 1-0 Tranmere Rovers Ipswich Town 1-1 Blackpool MK Dons 2-0 Rotherham United Peterborough United 0-0 Burton Albion Rochdale 0-1 Portsmouth Shrewsbury Town 0-2 Bristol Rovers Southend 0-1 Oxford United Sunderland 0-1 Coventry City Wycombe Wanderers 0-0 Doncaster Rovers Championship: Just the one goal so far in the second tier, where West Brom are the only one of 18 teams in action to have scored. They continue to lead Sheffield Wednesday 1-0. Premier League: Joao Moutinho scores for Wolves against Bournemouth with a wonderful free-kick, curling the ball around the wall and into the top corner, leaving Aaron Ramsdale clawing at fresh, salty south coast sea air. Premier League: Alexandre Lacazette scores on the follow-up after a Pierre-Emerick Aubamayang effort was blocked on the line. Meanwhile in Scotland: It\u2019s turning into a nightmare afternoon for beleaguered, managerless Hearts. They trail Kilmarnock 3-0 after 16 minutes in their Scottish Premiership encounter. League One: Accrington equalise against Bolton Wanderers, while MK Dons double their lead over Rotherham. At Spotland, Portsmouth have gone ahead against Rochdale through Ronan Curtis, while Fleetwood are one up against Tranmere Rovers.

More goals in League One: Ipswich Town have gone ahead against Blackpool courtesy of Gwion Edwards, while Bristol Rovers are one up against Shrewsbury Town after Tony Craig found the net on 11 minutes. Championship: Hal Robson-Kanu strikes in the 10th minute to give Championship leaders West Brom the advantage over Sheffield Wednesday. Premier League: A completely unmarked Danny Ings takes advantage from some shocking Arsenal defending at a free-kick to fire Southampton into an unlikely lead. League One: Early goals for MK Dons, Bolton and Oxford United, who lead Rotherham, Accrington and Southend respectively. Watford v Burnley: This game kicked off a couple of minutes late because Watford defender Craig Dawson had a dizzy spell on his way out of the dressing-room and felt unwell. He\u2019s since passed himself fit to continue and play is under way at Vicarage Road. Brighton v Leicester: Leicester striker Ayoze Perez hits the woodwork at the Amex Stadium, where Brighton are under pressure early doors. Today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs are go ... Referees have blown their whistles the length and breadth of the United Kingdom to signal the start of play in today\u2019s 3pm kick-offs. Stay tuned ... Premier League: David Hytner was at the London Stadium to see Jose Mourinho\u2019s reign as Tottenham manager get off to a winning start. Please be upstanding for his post-match musings ... Championship: It\u2019s been a decent managerial debut for Neil Harris of Cardiff City too, his side coming from two goals down to leave The Valley and return to The Valleys with a point. Premier League: Just before the 90-minute mark, West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice had a goal correctly disallowed for offside, but then they pulled one back through Angelo Ogbonno deep into injury time. It was too little too late for the Hammers, however, who go down by the odd goal of five. Despite his late scare, Jose Mourinho has masterminded victory in his first game as Tottenham manager.

On the other hand, this was a derby-day occasion with all the powerful surface tension of lukewarm custard tart.

      "bodyText": "Still humble, five days in. At the end of this strangely brittle Tottenham victory, a sustained thrashing of an invertebrate West Ham that somehow ended up a chancy 3-2 win, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho appeared on the London Stadium turf wearing his most convincing relieved\u2011yet\u2011respectful face. Behold: for I am the humblest. The humblissimus, a superstar of humility. Frowning deeply, face contorted into a rictus of dignified integrity, Mourinho pointedly shook the hands of the West Ham players, who looked a little surprised. There was a tentative round of applause towards the Tottenham fans, but from a distance, like a tremulous arm around the back of the cinema seat on a broadly successful second date. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about my Tottenham career. I\u2019m worried about Tottenham,\u201d Mourinho would announce an hour later in the media room, apparently without irony. And outside he kept on lingering and pressing the flesh, was in fact the final person to leave the pitch, all the better to offer a very public hug to Dele Alli and Son Heung-min. With good reason too. What to take from a victory like this? A first away win since January is clearly a note of progress. On the other hand, this was a derby-day occasion with all the powerful surface tension of lukewarm custard tart. There may be easier opening engagements out there than a lunchtime trip to a West Ham team with five defeats and two draws in their last seven games, at a ground where the heat of the home fans is still strangled by the huge empty spaces of this awkward Olympo-drome. But none that spring to mind right now. \u201cHow shit must you be, we\u2019re winning away?\u201d the Tottenham fans sang midway through the second half. The answer to which would seem to be: very shit. The Spurs attack will surely not find a more accommodating central defender than Issa Diop, who displayed right up to his mercy-substitution on 64 minutes all the robust defensive resilience of a bead curtain. A little later still the hapless Roberto made a straightforward save from a free-kick that drew a huge sarcastic cheer from his own fans. It\u2019s not that Roberto doesn\u2019t try: rarely can any footballer have made such an energetic show of himself while having so little physical effect on whether the ball actually goes in his net. West Ham did come on strong, and scored twice toward the end as the Spurs defence suddenly fell apart, a timely reminder of what Mourinho is actually doing here in the first place.

Their isolation means they rarely breed and may become extinct in a matter of decades, according to conservation group International Rhino Foundation. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list identifies the Sumatran and also the Black and Javan rhinoceros as being critically endangered. Both African and Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn. Rhinoceros are killed for their horns which are sold on the black market because of their supposed medical attributes. The horns are ground up and swallowed as treatments for fevers or convulsions even though they are made primarily of keratin, the same material that makes up hair and fingernails.",

Here Rodgers\u2019 team had to show a broader range of qualities, with patience and defensive diligence allied to multifarious attacking. Jamie Vardy, almost inevitably, was at the forefront of the attacks, creating the breakthrough goal for Ayoze P\u00e9rez before completing the victory by netting from a penalty.</p> <p>Rodgers named the same starting lineup for the fifth match in a row and his team began with the conviction of a side who knew they had the wherewithal to plunder a fifth straight win. Graham Potter has introduced a more enterprising style of play at Brighton but for the first 20 minutes here they were forced to play as if managed by Chris Hughton in particularly pessimistic mood, with nearly every player retreating behind the ball as the visitors hogged possession from the start.</p> <p>It was not sterile possession, Leicester creating so many early chances that they should have been ahead before Brighton got going. Leicester probed from all angles but the inquisition was particularly challenging from the left, where Ben Chilwell and Harvey Barnes wrought havoc. Less than two minutes had elapsed when Barnes sent over a cross that Solly March let bounce, only for P\u00e9rez to nip in and head the ball against the upright from five yards.</p> <p>One minute later Barnes fired over after a short corner. Vardy tested the goalkeeper again in the seventh minute, this time with a glancing header from a free-kick by Chilwell. The goalkeeper pushed it over the bar.</p> <p>Barnes\u2019s finishing was not of the same calibre as the rest of his play. In the 28th minute he had an effort deflected wide after good work by P\u00e9rez and four minutes later he drilled a shot wide after a pull-back by Vardy.</p> <p>As the half wore on Brighton got more to grips with their opponents and began to worry them at the other end, where Caglar Soyuncu was imperious \u2013 except in the 41st minute, when Shane Duffy was somehow allowed to meet an Aaron Mooy corner. From five yards out Duffy, normally so reliable, nodded over.</p> <p>Vardy almost made Brighton pay immediately, haring after a through ball from Maddison and clipping it over the keeper at the edge of the box but his shot was off-target.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/watford-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley\u2019s Sean Dyche returns to old home to send Watford to the bottom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brighton began the second half better, Leandro Trossard banging a shot inches over the bar. As the hosts pushed their vulnerability to counterattacks increased. Leicester are lethal from those and Vardy\u2019s menace remains undimmed. Three times he was sent racing through and each time he unselfishly teed up his teammates. P\u00e9rez and Maddison missed two of those chances but in the 64th minute P\u00e9rez made no mistake, sweeping into the net from close range after Vardy\u2019s fine service.</p> <p>A slight shunt from Adam Webster sent the substitute Demarai Gray to the ground in the box with 10 minutes left. Mat Ryan made a terrific save from Vardy\u2019s penalty but Maddison headed in the rebound, only for the referee to order a retake after VAR found encroachment. This time Ryan dived the other way but Vardy stuck to his preferred side to complete an authoritative win.</p>",

This was their fifth win in a row and they fully deserved it. \u201cWe\u2019re not shying away from anything but it\u2019s only 13 games in,\u201d replied Rodgers when asked whether his side could bridge the gap to the league leaders. \u201cI\u2019m happy [to be asked the question] so long as you\u2019re still asking it in April.\u201d This win may not be as eye-catching as their last one on the south coast \u2013 it would have been some going to surpass that 9-0 at Southampton \u2013 but it was deeply impressive in a different way. Here Rodgers\u2019 team had to show a broader range of qualities, with patience and defensive diligence allied to multifarious attacking. Jamie Vardy, almost inevitably, was at the forefront of the attacks, creating the breakthrough goal for Ayoze P\u00e9rez before completing the victory by netting from a penalty. Rodgers named the same starting lineup for the fifth match in a row and his team began with the conviction of a side who knew they had the wherewithal to plunder a fifth straight win. Graham Potter has introduced a more enterprising style of play at Brighton but for the first 20 minutes here they were forced to play as if managed by Chris Hughton in particularly pessimistic mood, with nearly every player retreating behind the ball as the visitors hogged possession from the start. It was not sterile possession, Leicester creating so many early chances that they should have been ahead before Brighton got going. Leicester probed from all angles but the inquisition was particularly challenging from the left, where Ben Chilwell and Harvey Barnes wrought havoc. Less than two minutes had elapsed when Barnes sent over a cross that Solly March let bounce, only for P\u00e9rez to nip in and head the ball against the upright from five yards. One minute later Barnes fired over after a short corner. Vardy tested the goalkeeper again in the seventh minute, this time with a glancing header from a free-kick by Chilwell. The goalkeeper pushed it over the bar. Barnes\u2019s finishing was not of the same calibre as the rest of his play. In the 28th minute he had an effort deflected wide after good work by P\u00e9rez and four minutes later he drilled a shot wide after a pull-back by Vardy. As the half wore on Brighton got more to grips with their opponents and began to worry them at the other end, where Caglar Soyuncu was imperious \u2013 except in the 41st minute, when Shane Duffy was somehow allowed to meet an Aaron Mooy corner. From five yards out Duffy, normally so reliable, nodded over. Vardy almost made Brighton pay immediately, haring after a through ball from Maddison and clipping it over the keeper at the edge of the box but his shot was off-target. Brighton began the second half better, Leandro Trossard banging a shot inches over the bar. As the hosts pushed their vulnerability to counterattacks increased. Leicester are lethal from those and Vardy\u2019s menace remains undimmed. Three times he was sent racing through and each time he unselfishly teed up his teammates. P\u00e9rez and Maddison missed two of those chances but in the 64th minute P\u00e9rez made no mistake, sweeping into the net from close range after Vardy\u2019s fine service. A slight shunt from Adam Webster sent the substitute Demarai Gray to the ground in the box with 10 minutes left. Mat Ryan made a terrific save from Vardy\u2019s penalty but Maddison headed in the rebound, only for the referee to order a retake after VAR found encroachment. This time Ryan dived the other way but Vardy stuck to his preferred side to complete an authoritative win.",

Judges apply the law without fear or favour, and this must not be undermined.</p> \n   <p>Once highly regarded as a vital public service, today\u2019s justice system is widely acknowledged to be suffering from years of under-investment. Crime is increasing, yet prosecutions are falling. Too many people are unable to access justice quickly or effectively. As a result, there is understandable public dissatisfaction with the state of the justice system. Urgent action is required to remedy this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The organisation\u2019s 2019 \u201cManifesto for Justice\u201d says: \u201cThe cumulative effect of ill-conceived, short-term decisions over the last decade is undeniable: swingeing cuts to civil, criminal and family legal aid; court closures; under-resourcing the Crown Prosecution Service; the increase of unrepresented people filling courts (Litigants in Person); a criminal justice system on its knees with crime going up and prosecutions going down. As a matter of urgency, the next government must address the state of the justice system.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Justice has suffered a 40% cut in its budget between 2011 and 2020 and overseen mass closures of courts around the country. \u201cJustice must not become a postcode lottery,\u201d the manifesto states. \u201cWe have fewer courts than ever before. 277 courts and 18 tribunals across England and Wales have closed over the last decade. There are huge backlogs of cases in many of our remaining courts and yet courtrooms are lying empty.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Cuts to legal aid should be reversed, the Bar Council says. \u201cAccess to justice underpins a fair, just and reasonable society. It is not a commodity and must never be a luxury available only to those who can afford to pay for it.</p> \n  <p>\u201cLegal aid should be recognised as being as much a part of civil society as the NHS, housing, social security and education. It should be reintroduced to help the most vulnerable and marginalised citizens who are currently left to fend for themselves. The next government must reinvest in legal aid, reversing a decade of cuts.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The six-point programme also calls for an end to what has been termed the \u201cinnocence tax\u201d. \u201cThe current situation of the state prosecuting an individual, refusing to give him or her legal aid and then refusing to fully reimburse their private legal costs when they are acquitted is desperately unfair. It must be reformed.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Bar Council calls on the next government to recognise the importance of the legal industry which in 2017 contributed \u00a326.8bn to the UK economy. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T15:48:07.543Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd938358f083aa6d5789b94\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T13:56:01.727Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/23/general-election-reaction-to-question-time-leaders-special-live-news?page=with:block-5dd924ef8f083aa6d5789b1b#block-5dd924ef8f083aa6d5789b1b\">launched Labour\u2019s youth manifesto</a> \u2013 called The Future is Ours \u2013 in Loughborough. <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Digital-Youth-Manifesto.pdf\">The document</a> commits the party to giving 16-year-olds the right to vote, and to investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/23/general-election-reaction-to-question-time-leaders-special-live-news?page=with:block-5dd90f0a8f087b800b61fa96#block-5dd90f0a8f087b800b61fa96\">Earlier in the day</a> Corbyn and shadow employment rights secretary, <strong>Laura Pidcock,</strong> vowed to take on \u201cbad bosses and tax dodgers\u201d at an event to highlight the party\u2019s \u201cfair tax programme\u201d outside an Amazon warehouse in Sheffield.

The party has said it would legislate to oblige rail employers and unions to enter into Minimum Service Agreements (MSA), which would set in advance the number and nature of staff who would remain at work during any strike. This would render strike action unlawful if there were no MSA in place. Reaction has continued to roll in to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s announcement on last night\u2019s BBC Question Time special that he would remain neutral in a second referendum on Brexit. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said the position was astonishing, while Brexit party leader Nigel Farage said the Labour leader wasn\u2019t seen as patriotic in leave areas like Hartlepool. Jeremy Corbyn has launched Labour\u2019s youth manifesto \u2013 called The Future is Ours \u2013 in Loughborough. The document commits the party to giving 16-year-olds the right to vote, and to investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres. Earlier in the day he vowed to take on \u201cbad bosses and tax dodgers\u201d at an event to highlight the party\u2019s \u201cfair tax programme\u201d outside an Amazon warehouse in Sheffield. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ruled out scrapping GP home visits after doctors backed the idea in a vote, arguing that they were too over-stretched to deliver the service.

That\u2019s all from me today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thanks for reading. The actor and writer Rob Delaney has shared a video praising the NHS and calling it \u201cthe pinnacle of human achievement\u201d, reports Nicola Slawson. Delaney, co-star of the Channel 4 sitcom Catastrophe, says he is \u201ccrazy\u201d about the NHS in the clip, shared on Twitter. The American actor, who is a vocal supporter of Labour, compared the experiences of being treated by the US private healthcare system when he was in a car accident when he was 25 with the \u201cextraordinary care\u201d his son Henry received from the NHS when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour before he died. A Conservative announcement that they would ensure that a minimum train service must operate during strikes has provoked angry responses from unions. The party has said it would legislate to oblige rail employers and unions to enter into Minimum Service Agreements (MSA), which would set in advance the number and nature of staff who would remain at work during any strike. This would render strike action unlawful if there were no MSA in place. They accused \u201cmilitant rail unions\u201d of causing misery for passengers, with more than 160 days of strikes that have taken place, or are planned, since 2016. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said: Corbyn\u2019s union backers are causing misery for commuters across the country but this is just a taste of things to come if he gets into Downing Street. He would scrap trade union legislation and make it easier for unions to go on strike which would cause chaos for passengers. The Conservative Party will introduce a new law to ensure that the railways keep on running even if trade unions vote to go on strike. The move comes ahead of 27 planned days of strikes on South Western Railway next month by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union in the long-running dispute over guards on trains. RMT members on West Midlands Trains are on strike today over the same issue. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: Banning strikes is the hallmark of the right wing junta, not a democratically elected British government. RMT would fight any attempt to strip our members of their basic human rights. Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: The right to strike - to withdraw your labour - is a fundamental human right. We are not slaves. Aslef has rarely called a strike and, when we have, it has always been as a last resort and as a result of management intransigence. We are not, however, surprised that Boris Johnson and his cronies want to make it even more difficult for hard working men and women to protect their jobs, pay, terms and conditions. Johnson only acts on behalf of the boss class in Britain. Nigel Farage has paid a visit to Hartlepool \u2013 a Brexit party target seat \u2013 on the party\u2019s battle bus and visited the Market Hall in Middleton Grange shopping centre. PA Media reports that he spoke to a number of stallholders, bought a caramel slice and a \u00a31.29 Christmas card for his mother. Farage told reporters: I think the Brexit issue is huge, I think the patriotic issue is huge, I think Corbyn is not seen as being very patriotic and I think if Conservative voters in these areas realise that we\u2019re the challenger and come to us, then we could [beat Labour], absolutely. He said resolving the Brexit issue would help restore the public\u2019s faith in politics. What was interesting though, and I felt it when I did it, from the audience last night was the sheer level of hostility. This is real, people are very angry with politics, their faith and trust in parliament, politicians, has never, ever been lower and goodness me it shows. This is why, actually, getting Brexit done properly will allow us to get people to believe that if they vote for something it might actually happen. Barristers have called on whichever party wins the general election to restore public confidence in a \u201cproperly funded justice system\u201d and increase spending to redress past cuts to legal aid, reports Owen Bowcott. At the Bar Council\u2019s annual conference in central London, the leader of the organisation, which represents 16,500 barristers throughout England and Wales, urged politicians to divert more resources to the \u201cdamaged\u201d system. Richard Atkins QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: The rule of law and independence of the judiciary are fundamental pillars of our democracy. Judges apply the law without fear or favour, and this must not be undermined. Once highly regarded as a vital public service, today\u2019s justice system is widely acknowledged to be suffering from years of under-investment. Crime is increasing, yet prosecutions are falling. Too many people are unable to access justice quickly or effectively. As a result, there is understandable public dissatisfaction with the state of the justice system. Urgent action is required to remedy this. The organisation\u2019s 2019 \u201cManifesto for Justice\u201d says: \u201cThe cumulative effect of ill-conceived, short-term decisions over the last decade is undeniable: swingeing cuts to civil, criminal and family legal aid; court closures; under-resourcing the Crown Prosecution Service; the increase of unrepresented people filling courts (Litigants in Person); a criminal justice system on its knees with crime going up and prosecutions going down. As a matter of urgency, the next government must address the state of the justice system.\u201d The Ministry of Justice has suffered a 40% cut in its budget between 2011 and 2020 and overseen mass closures of courts around the country. \u201cJustice must not become a postcode lottery,\u201d the manifesto states. \u201cWe have fewer courts than ever before. 277 courts and 18 tribunals across England and Wales have closed over the last decade. There are huge backlogs of cases in many of our remaining courts and yet courtrooms are lying empty.\u201d Cuts to legal aid should be reversed, the Bar Council says. \u201cAccess to justice underpins a fair, just and reasonable society. It is not a commodity and must never be a luxury available only to those who can afford to pay for it. \u201cLegal aid should be recognised as being as much a part of civil society as the NHS, housing, social security and education. It should be reintroduced to help the most vulnerable and marginalised citizens who are currently left to fend for themselves. The next government must reinvest in legal aid, reversing a decade of cuts.\u201d The six-point programme also calls for an end to what has been termed the \u201cinnocence tax\u201d. \u201cThe current situation of the state prosecuting an individual, refusing to give him or her legal aid and then refusing to fully reimburse their private legal costs when they are acquitted is desperately unfair. It must be reformed.\u201d The Bar Council calls on the next government to recognise the importance of the legal industry which in 2017 contributed \u00a326.8bn to the UK economy. Jeremy Corbyn has launched Labour\u2019s youth manifesto \u2013 called The Future is Ours \u2013 in Loughborough. The document commits the party to giving 16-year-olds the right to vote, and to investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres. Earlier in the day Corbyn and shadow employment rights secretary, Laura Pidcock, vowed to take on \u201cbad bosses and tax dodgers\u201d at an event to highlight the party\u2019s \u201cfair tax programme\u201d outside an Amazon warehouse in Sheffield. The party has pledged to introduce unitary taxation of multinationals to stop tax-avoiding profit-shifting. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ruled out scrapping GP home visits after doctors backed the idea in a vote, arguing that they were too over-stretched to deliver the service. Delegates representing GPs across England at a British Medical Association conference voted to try to remove the duty from their standard contract, after complaints that they were wasting time driving around the country. The Conservative party has pledged more than \u00a31.6bn for research to find a cure for dementia over the next decade, which it says represents the largest boost to dementia research ever in the UK, doubling current funding levels. The Press Association has comments from Jo Swinson from her campaign visit to London\u2019s Design Museum this morning, where highlighted her party\u2019s policies on innovation and technology. She told the news agency: I think it is quite astonishing that Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to say... not even just refusing to say now where he stands on remaining or leaving the European Union, but is basically saying that he is never going to tell people what he thinks about that. I mean, this is the biggest issue facing our country for generations and he is just saying he is not interested in telling people what he thinks. To me, I think that is a total absence of leadership. Remainers in this country need a leader, not a bystander. Asked about her performance in last night\u2019s BBC Question Time programme, she said: I\u2019m very proud of standing up for what I believe in. I think it\u2019s important to have that authenticity in politics. And I have had a lot of good feedback and I look forward to future opportunities to discuss issues with the public. She said it was up to others to decide if they thought she had been given a tougher time than the other leaders, but added: I understand that it was according to the MPs at the last general election, which doesn\u2019t reflect how we are currently in the opinion polls. There have been a string of complaints from Lib Dem politicians about the make-up of last night\u2019s audience, including this from MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton: That\u2019s it from Labour\u2019s youth manifesto launch. You can read the full document here. The party has announced an additional \u00a31bn in annual revenue expenditure for youth services. Labour analysis of government figures shows that spending on youth services has reduced by \u00a31bn (73%) since 2010. The party says it would double the annual capital expenditure for youth services that the government has committed to, investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres. Among Labour\u2019s pledges aimed to get young voters on side are \u2013 Votes at 16 and automatic voter registration. An end to tuition fees and bringing back maintenance grant. Free bus travel for under-25s. Banning unpaid internships. Reforming Help to Buy to focus it on first-time buyers on ordinary incomes. He concludes: A Labour government that will deliver for all people in the future is a prize within our grasp, but it\u2019s not going to be handed to us on a plate. You\u2019ve seen the attacks we\u2019re getting in some of the billionaire media at the moment. You\u2019re seen all that stuff that\u2019s thrown at us. But, I tell you what: don\u2019t do personal, don\u2019t reply, just relentlessly go out there with the policies we\u2019ve got, the determination we\u2019ve got to put them into operation, and then, in the cold misery of a wet November and December, you\u2019ll get a red Christmas and a great spring with a Labour government. Chants of \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d and selfies ensue. Corbyn says there are 150 billionaires in Britain and 50 of them are funding the Conservatives. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the other 100,\u201d he says. \u201cThey should be funding the Conservative party, because the Conservative party is certainly funding them.\u201d Corbyn says he is proud that the UK parliament declared a climate emergency, but \u201cdeclaring it is not the same as doing something about it\u201d. He says that it is important to get to net-zero emissions as quickly as possible. He adds that the job opportunities created in bringing emissions down are huge. Labour calculates 300,000 green energy jobs will be created. The campaign has been framed as the Brexit election, says Corbyn, but it is also about health, housing and education. He repeats his argument that under a Labour government the \u201cNHS is not for sale\u201d in post-Brexit trade negotiations with the US, prompting chants of \u201cnot for sale, not for sale\u201d from the audience. The Labour leader is talking about his visit to an Amazon warehouse in Sheffield earlier today, where he launched the party\u2019s proposals for cracking down on tax avoidance. \u201cI want to make it very, very clear, under a Labour government there will be a few things done differently,\u201d he says. They will end zero-hours contracts \u201cend of story\u201d, every worker will have full-rights from day one, they will end non-dom status and tax people where they make their money. He says their proposals are not \u201canti-business\u201d because there are lots of small businesses that do pay their taxes and they are focusing on the biggest businesses. Corbyn adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a people-powered manifesto, in a people-powered party, in a people-powered campaign to win this election.\u201d Corbyn is up on stage. He says there are two weeks to get people to register to vote and then to get them to vote Labour. He says there are 9 million people still not registered. Corbyn says he enjoyed last night\u2019s grilling from people in Sheffield. \u201cI am very very happy to take questions from anybody, on anything, any time, any place. We have nothing to hide,\u201d he says. Corbyn is about to launch his youth manifesto \u2013 called The Future is Ours \u2013 in Loughborough. The document commits the party to giving 16-year-olds the right to vote, and to investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres. You can watch the live stream at the top of this blog and I\u2019ll bring you live updates. The latest polling, from Panelbase, has the Conservative party lead over Labour narrow to 10 points. The survey has the Tories on 42%, down one point from the pollster\u2019s survey last week, with Labour on 32%, up two points. The Lib Dems were on 14%, down one point, and the Brexit party down two points to 3%. You can keep up to date with the most recent polling with our tracker here: The Green party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley appeared on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Saturday this morning, where he warned that the climate emergency could kill more people than the second world war: It\u2019s an existential threat. 55m people died in the second world war, the threat of a climate emergency is much, much bigger than that. There is no real bigger threat except of course for nuclear weapons. On Prince Andrew\u2019s decision to withdraw from public life, he said: I think there are still questions that are unanswered. I don\u2019t think just Andrew withdrawing from public life is a solution. The point here is the victims who are at the centre of this, the survivors of abuse. No one should be above the questions and these questions need to be put and this is no substitute, no alternative. Former prime minister Gordon Brown is to claim removing Boris Johnson from Number 10 is the first step in restoring \u201ccommon decency\u201d and moving the UK forward, the PA Media reports. He\u2019ll be speaking today at three Labour campaign events across Scotland - in Fife, South Lanarkshire and East Lothian. He will highlight figures that show there are 121,925 children in working families north of the border living in poverty. The UK is already torn apart by Brexit, divisive nationalisms, a north-south divide and the crude trolling of vulnerable people of all sides. We are so disunited we have lost sight of a once-compassionate, state-guaranteed safety net and seem unable to work together - even to come to the aid of vulnerable children... A caring nation would increase child benefit substantially, raise the child credit, end the withdrawal of benefits from three and four-child families and guarantee that there is always enough housing benefit in place to pay rent. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield, launching the party\u2019s \u201cfair tax programme\u201d. Speaking to reporters, he insisted adopting a neutral stance in a second Brexit referendum was a sign of \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cmaturity\u201d. I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity. Here\u2019s some more on that Conservative dementia announcement. The party has pledged more than \u00a31.6bn for research to find a cure for dementia over the next decade, which it says represents the largest boost to dementia research ever in the UK, doubling current funding levels. They have also announced plans to launch an \u201cinnovative medicines fund\u201d by extending the successful \u201ccancer drugs fund\u201d \u2013 which was due to end next year \u2013 to other diseases. It will have a \u00a3500m budget in the first year, compared with the \u00a3340m value of the cancer drugs fund. There are currently 850,000 people suffering from dementia in the UK and that number is set to rise to more than a million by the middle of the next decade and to double in the next 30 years. Johnson said dementia was \u201cone of the great medical challenges of our time\u201d. \u201cThis is our plan to tackle it: a record injection of cash that unleashes the brilliant British science community that brought the world penicillin, IVF and Proton Beam Therapy for cancer.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow employment rights secretary, Laura Pidcock, are due to launch their \u201cfair tax programme\u201d outside an Amazon warehouse in Yorkshire today. The party has pledged to tackle tax dodging by introducing unitary taxation of multinationals to stop tax avoiding profit shifting. The approach is outlined in this report by Public Services International. Labour says the measure will bring in \u00a36.3bn in 2023-24. Their package of measures (which you can read here) includes: Clamping down on the enablers of tax dodging. Increasing HMRC\u2019s targeted audits. Establishing an inquiry into the finance sector. Introducing a 20% Offshore Company Property Levy, on top of existing stamp duties and surcharges. Scrapping non-dom status. Requiring greater scrutiny of MPs\u2019 tax affairs. In comments issued ahead of the visit, Corbyn said: Huge multinational companies often act as if the rules we all live by don\u2019t apply to them. They use loopholes to claim they don\u2019t owe tax and cynically push their workers to the limit. I don\u2019t want to live in a country of a few billionaires and millions of stressed people, worried about making ends meet every month. Lib Dem parliamentary candidate, and former Labour MP, Chuka Umunna has spoken to the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, repeating criticism of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s neutral Brexit stance. I think it is extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary, that on the biggest issue since the second world war, the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, is saying he would seek to behave like some referee in a football match ... It\u2019s absolutely clear - you can\u2019t save the NHS and address the issues in it at the same time as not seeking to stop Brexit, not least because 10% of our doctors come from the EU, and 7% of our nurses come from the EU. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has given an interview to the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, in which she has said that a Labour government would make values, not numbers, the driving force behind immigration policy. What I would say is different about Jeremy [Corbyn] \u2013 and myself as home secretary \u2013 is we want to talk about values. Because it flows from your values, actually, if you hold them genuinely, what sort of immigration system that you have. It\u2019s worth a read: Here\u2019s a bit more information about what we have to look forward to today. The Conservatives are announcing a \u00a31.6bn fund to find a cure for dementia. Boris Johnson said the investment would double current funding levels and that it would set Britain\u2019s finest scientists to work on a \u201cdementia moonshot\u201d. Labour is launching its youth manifesto. The document called The Future is Ours will commit the party to giving 16-year-olds the right to vote, and to investing an additional \u00a3250m to build up to 500 new youth centres. Jeremy Corbyn is visiting an Amazon depot in Yorkshire, where he will vow to tackle the \u201ctax and wage cheat culture\u201d of multinational companies who \u201crip off\u201d workers. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, will be in west London focusing on creative and arts subjects in schools, which she said should have \u201cthe same footing as the rest of the curriculum\u201d. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will be on a walkabout in Hartlepool, where the party\u2019s chairman, Richard Tice, is a candidate. I\u2019ll bring you more information as I get it. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has responded to yesterday\u2019s vote on GP home visits at the BMA conference yesterday. The crisis in the family doctor service is just one more area where the Conservative government has let down patients and the NHS. In 2015 they promised more GPs, which like their pledges on everything else, never happened. And now there is a serious threat that elderly and vulnerable patients who rely on home visits will have that vital support removed. You can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson with the NHS. Labour\u2019s rescue plan will recruit and train the GPs needed so home visits can continue. Here\u2019s a round up of today\u2019s front pages, with Corbyn\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d Brexit stance dominating many. More on the health secretary\u2019s comments on this morning\u2019s Today programme. Delegates representing GPs across England at a British Medical Association conference on Friday voted to try to remove the duty in their standard contracts to carry out home visits, complaining that they were wasting time driving around the country. However, speaking on Saturday morning, Matt Hancock said the idea was a \u201ccomplete non-starter\u201d and that he was firmly opposed to the plan. The GPs had a vote on what their opening negotiating position should be for the next GP contract. The idea that people shouldn\u2019t be able, when they need it, to have a home visit from a GP is a complete non-starter and it won\u2019t succeed in their negotiations. Of course, people need to be able to see their GP and we\u2019re putting huge amounts of extra resources into training, funding and hiring more GPs, and the other practice staff which are also so important. But you do need, sometimes, for the GP to be able to go and see somebody. You can read the full story here: Good morning and welcome to politics live, the morning after the special BBC Question Time programme in which Jeremy Corbyn announced he would remain neutral in a second Brexit referendum. The Labour leader was quizzed by a live studio audience in Sheffield, followed by the SNP\u2019s leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Lib Dem Jo Swinson and, finally, the prime minister, Boris Johnson. The audience pulled no punches, attacking Swinson over her record in the coalition and her party\u2019s revoke article 50 policy; challenging Boris Johnson over his trustworthiness and previous racist statements; confronting Corbyn over antisemitism in his party and his renationalisation plans; and pushing Sturgeon to confirm that she could support a Corbyn government in exchange for a Scottish independence referendum. You can read full write-up from the Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart here. Some colour from the spin room in Sheffield \u2013 where the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, squared up to each other over racism in their parties \u2013 from me here. And you can watch some video highlights here: The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme ruling out scrapping home visits by GPs, despite complaints from doctors that they are too over-stretched to deliver the service. I\u2019ll bring you more on that shortly. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be guiding you through all of today\u2019s political developments.",

In a game like this you have to make sure you fight for the result and that is what we did. Could we play better? Yes, but 37 points after 13 matches is exceptional.\u201d That much is true and, for sure, there is no denying the spirit Liverpool yet again showed against arguably their toughest opponents of the season. Palace were well organised and aggressive out of possession and, when they had it, looked to stretch the visitors, with Zaha and Andros Townsend menaces on each wing. As Klopp also said, the hosts were a threat from set pieces and that is how they appeared to have taken the lead on 42 minutes after Tomkins sent Luka Milivojevi\u0107\u2019s free-kick into the net with a header via Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s diverted touch. There appeared nothing wrong with the goal but soon the referee, Kevin Friend, had his finger to his ear and eventually the verdict from Chris Kavanagh, the VAR at Stockley Park, arrived: no goal. Kavanagh made the call on the basis of a push by Jordan Ayew on Dejan Lovren. There was definite contact but it had no impact on the goal given Wijnaldum was standing in front of the pair when he made his crucial touch. Little wonder the home fans made their feelings on it clear amid a chorus of moans and groans. Things got worse for Palace when Man\u00e9 scored for the fifth consecutive game against them after his reaction shot landed in the net after clipping both posts. That could have been the cue for the home side to wilt but instead they roared back. Townsend and Jeffrey Schlupp both forced the Liverpool goalkeeper, Alisson, into saves before Christian Benteke went close with a wonderful scissor kick. The pressure was building and, on 82 minutes, it finally told when Zaha fired low into the corner for his first goal of the season. That appeared to be that but Liverpool kept probing, kept pushing forward, kept believing they could win. And they did. \u201cClose but no cigar,\u201d said Roy Hodgson, before going on to say he had no issue with the VAR call. \u201cThere was a push by Jordan and ultimately it\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t get something from what was our best display of the season.\u201d",

She was married to Harvey Preisler, another eminent oncologist, who died of lymphoma in 2002. Her new book, <em>The First Cell</em>, argues against the current preoccupations of cancer research and treatment. Instead of trying to destroy the last cancer cell, says Raza, we should invest more money in preventive treatments that enable us to detect the first cancer cell.</p> <p><strong>What made you decide to become an oncologist?</strong><br>I have been interested instinctively in natural things since as long as I can remember. As I grew older, I really wanted to study Darwinian evolutionary biology. Then I wanted to study molecular biology. But there was no way for me to study science in Pakistan, where I grew up, so the only entry into science was through medicine, and I went to medical school. Once I had a clinical experience with patients, I knew this was something I would have to dedicate my life to.</p> <p>When I came to the US at 24, oncology was laughingly referred to as a sub-speciality into which mostly Indians and Pakistanis and foreign medical graduates entered, because nobody who could have a choice of something better wanted to do it. But I really wanted to do it, for intellectual and emotional reasons.</p> <p><strong>Is it fair to say that your book argues that the multi</strong><strong>billion-dollar medical research into cancer is largely wasted?</strong><br>That would be too strong a statement, because it is largely useful, but not from the perspective of the patient. It is extremely useful in advancing our understanding of biology, of physiology, of pathology and immunology. The tremendous advances we have made thanks to cancer research are undeniable. The only problem I have is that in terms of drug development, and finding better options for our patients, we are failing spectacularly.</p> <p><strong>You say no one is winning the war on cancer. To what do you attribute the successes, for example, in breast and prostate cancer?</strong><br>It\u2019s down to basically two things: early detection, and better use of existing therapies. But my contention is that no major new treatments have arrived on the scene in the past 15 to 20 years for either breast or prostate cancer.</p> <p><strong>You describe standard cancer treatment as slash-poison-burn, which is a somewhat dismissive description, but you acknowledge that it accounts for the fact that 68% of all cancers in the US are cured today</strong><strong>. Is there a danger of underestimating that advance?</strong><br>I hope not, but why do we have to use such stone age methods? The problem is that for thousands of years we have been taking our health for granted and only acting when disease strikes. But a lot of diseases are silent killers: suddenly, somebody would get chest pain and within minutes they would be dead. So cardiologists became smarter and tried to anticipate when somebody had heart disease and prevent it from happening. And as a result, mortality from cardiovascular diseases has <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101895-heart-disease-deaths-have-fallen-by-70-per-cent-in-a-generation/\" title=\"\">gone down by 70%</a>.

We can do better. We must do better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If somebody like me made that statement, a brown female from Pakistan, I would have my licence suspended tomorrow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Does the commercial setup in American medicine distort research in favour of pharmaceuticals rather than prevention?</strong><br>Yes, it distorts, but also it can be used for a different purpose. At least their stated goal is to make money. Think about them investing their very hard-earned, precious resources into an enterprise which currently has a 95% failure rate for experimental drugs. And the 5% that succeed should have failed because they are basically palliative, providing months of improvement in survival. Why don\u2019t we set a different goal, which has a higher rate of success? We could constantly monitor the human body by imaging devices, by new technology, and then look for footprints of any perturbations caused by disease, whether it\u2019s for Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, diabetes, whatever chronic disease we\u2019re talking about. Basically, we set a new goal and then financially incentivise the new goal. The exact criticism that applies to the American medical system as a commercial enterprise also, weirdly enough, accounts for its tremendous success.</p> <p><strong>You are not a fan of cancer research on mice. What\u2019s the problem?</strong><br><strong> </strong>We clearly know that a lot of strategies we try in cancer have failed miserably. For example, in the 1990s there was a huge wave of excitement, as it was felt that just choking off the blood supply of cancerous tumours will end up curing cancer. This was hyped up to such a degree that it went from laboratories to TV screens overnight and everybody wanted to enter these trials. But once it was brought to the bedside, it did not have the same spectacular success. My objection is, you cannot create a tumour that did not exist, artificially give a healthy mouse a tumour, then treat it with a drug, see that it disappears, and expect that the same will happen in a decrepit, crippled, immune-compromised human individual. This kind of extrapolation has failed us over and over, not just in cancer.</p> <p><strong>Your husband, an oncologist who died </strong><strong>of cancer</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> advised you not to get too close to your patients.

But in 40 years in medicine I have yet to meet an oncologist who didn\u2019t care about his or her patients. Whether they like it or not, we get involved. We feel very upset. I mean, we are all humans; we can\u2019t stand each other\u2019s suffering.

      "body": "<p>Why do some men feel aggrieved when actresses admit that they don\u2019t enjoy doing nude scenes? To listen to men carp, you\u2019d think that viewing on-screen female nudity was a basic human right.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/20/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-nude-scenes-were-terrifying\" title=\"\">Emilia Clarke has just spoken about doing \u201cterrifying\u201d nude scenes for <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>. Later, she became more assertive, thinking \u201cfuck you\u201d, when film-makers wanted her to strip, suggesting that, otherwise, she would \u201cdisappoint her <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans\u201d. (Anyone else shuddering?) Clarke was only 23, fresh out of drama school, when she took on the role of Daenerys Targaryen, but she\u2019s still been lambasted for complaining about the part that made her rich and famous. Clarke <em>wasn\u2019t</em> moaning about the role, though \u2013 she was talking honestly about nude scenes. Is that OK or is it not enough for female performers to disrobe? Or do they have to pretend they like it too?</p> <p>It was almost comical how stunned some people were that on-screen nudity was not a career high for Clarke. Was she supposed to sigh: \u201cIt was magical \u2013 I loved getting my tits out for strangers!\u201d? How many of these men would like to spend their own professional lives nude? (Don\u2019t answer that.) Of course, this was <em>Game of Thrones,</em> where female nudity was deemed \u201cintegral\u201d. And Clarke agreed to do such scenes, as did co-star Maisie Williams. (All very creepy, given that her character, Arya, started the series as a child.) </p> <p>But how were they supposed to refuse \u2013 how is <em>anyone</em>? Nude scenes are loaded with pressure: first, wanting the job; then wanting to be perceived as a team player. All laudable, but it shouldn\u2019t involve taking your clothes off.</p> <p>This kind of thing is being addressed with a new set of guidelines, from <a href=\"https://www.directors.uk.com/about/about-directors-uk\" title=\"\">Directors UK</a>, for the British film and TV industry. Meant as a resource for \u201cgrey areas\u201d, bringing the UK into line with changes in Hollywood, Directors UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/21/rules-for-screen-sex-scenes-issued-to-british-directors\" title=\"\">96 recommendations</a> involve everything from whether nude scenes are necessary to stopping nude auditions, via providing on-set support.</p> <p>All of which is commendable, but shouldn\u2019t audiences also change their attitudes? As it is, certain men weirdly seem to presume that they have a right to see women naked.

      "bodyText": "Why do some men feel aggrieved when actresses admit that they don\u2019t enjoy doing nude scenes? To listen to men carp, you\u2019d think that viewing on-screen female nudity was a basic human right. Emilia Clarke has just spoken about doing \u201cterrifying\u201d nude scenes for Game of Thrones. Later, she became more assertive, thinking \u201cfuck you\u201d, when film-makers wanted her to strip, suggesting that, otherwise, she would \u201cdisappoint her Game of Thrones fans\u201d. (Anyone else shuddering?) Clarke was only 23, fresh out of drama school, when she took on the role of Daenerys Targaryen, but she\u2019s still been lambasted for complaining about the part that made her rich and famous. Clarke wasn\u2019t moaning about the role, though \u2013 she was talking honestly about nude scenes. Is that OK or is it not enough for female performers to disrobe? Or do they have to pretend they like it too? It was almost comical how stunned some people were that on-screen nudity was not a career high for Clarke. Was she supposed to sigh: \u201cIt was magical \u2013 I loved getting my tits out for strangers!\u201d? How many of these men would like to spend their own professional lives nude? (Don\u2019t answer that.) Of course, this was Game of Thrones, where female nudity was deemed \u201cintegral\u201d. And Clarke agreed to do such scenes, as did co-star Maisie Williams. (All very creepy, given that her character, Arya, started the series as a child.) But how were they supposed to refuse \u2013 how is anyone? Nude scenes are loaded with pressure: first, wanting the job; then wanting to be perceived as a team player. All laudable, but it shouldn\u2019t involve taking your clothes off. This kind of thing is being addressed with a new set of guidelines, from Directors UK, for the British film and TV industry. Meant as a resource for \u201cgrey areas\u201d, bringing the UK into line with changes in Hollywood, Directors UK\u2019s 96 recommendations involve everything from whether nude scenes are necessary to stopping nude auditions, via providing on-set support. All of which is commendable, but shouldn\u2019t audiences also change their attitudes? As it is, certain men weirdly seem to presume that they have a right to see women naked. Guys, calm down \u2013 you bought a television subscription or\u2248a cinema ticket, not a VIP seat at a lap-dancing show. Let\u2019s face it, most nude scenes are gratuitous \u2013 even when integral to the story, nudity could usually be suggested without anyone actually being naked. Yet here we are, two years since #MeToo, and actresses are still not only having to strip but being denounced for hating doing it.

      "body": "<p>Cars. What? Cars, yes cars, planet-eaters and child-killers, climate-chokers and city-wreckers, antisocial, aggressive, exclusionary, tools and symbols of a world of consumerist selfishness. Un-woke. A subject that the Victoria and Albert Museum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/16/nan-goldin-die-in-v-and-a--sackler-courtyard-opiods\" title=\"\">currently under fire</a> for taking money from the opioid-selling Sackler family, might want to avoid. In, though, it has plunged, with <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/cars#articles\" title=\"\">Cars: Accelerating the Modern World</a>, a major exhibition on these motorised demons.</p> <p>The exhibition has been a long time in the offing, with Norman Foster at one point involved, whose preference (one might guess) would have been for a celebratory parade of shining technology. Foster is still credited as an inspiration behind the show, but in the hands of the curators Brendan Cormier and Lizzie Bisley it is something nuanced and multifaceted. The idea, says the assistant curator Esme Hawes, is to show both the original promises of the motor car and its unintended consequences.</p> <p>So it treads a path between Jeremy Clarkson and Greta Thunberg, a broad-enough terrain but a fraught one. There are cars \u2013 gleaming, drool-worthy objects such as the Czech Tatra T77 of 1934, a pioneer of streamlining, or an opulent Hispano-Suiza custom-built for Suzanna Deutsch de la Meurthe in 1922. There are also film clips, documentaries, trade union banners, advertisements, car-related clothing and artefacts, science-fiction comics. Specially commissioned films show the grassroots sport of car-spinning in South Africa and of the highly ornamented vehicles \u2013 great rolling palaces of glitter and electric light \u2013 of Japanese truckers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5e5c73c49efcad150cd7da6bc2d2dbfac681938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5e5c73c49efcad150cd7da6bc2d2dbfac681938/0_0_5440_4080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Victoire radiator mascot by Lalique, c1925.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Victoire radiator mascot by Lalique, c1925.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dark side of cars is included \u2013 the conditions of assembly-line workers, the death toll from accidents, the effects on climate \u2013 though doesn\u2019t dominate. There is a compelling section on the ways in which Henry Ford learned from the production lines for dismembering pigs developed in the state of Ohio; a certain spirit of ruthlessness was carried over from the process of taking animals apart to that of putting cars together. A breathtaking 1970s advertisement for the Humble energy company, shocking and ironic at once, is displayed: \u201cEach day Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!\u201d<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/humble-oil-predicts-the-f_b_607434?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMDOmLuyHtcnMr970HlpVCBHc92Fq1iHUy61SNgwCnA7YGSfgyfjA0tSjKfOJNMUOdsLyOuomgJsZtl8nF7poyV76liXSvfSPjeIb-lqSHoYAyzHIhly7wzGwd1Tvi6b7zfhc454nIA66dRlciTIEyoZVOUs4_NQ8zNk8oq2B9sN\" title=\"\"> </a>A photo of such a glacier appears above the strapline.</p> <p>You see Jimmy Carter speaking from the Oval Office, with some of the downbeat tone that helped to make him \u2013 for all his many virtues \u2013 a one-term president. \u201cTonight,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to have an unpleasant talk with you.\u201d The bad news he had to impart was that the United States was going to have to change its relationship to the artefact it had made its own, that defined its industrial might and its version of freedom. Americans, he said, would have to be more careful with their fuel consumption because the world was running out of oil.</p> <p>Like some other recent and current shows (the Design Museum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/20/moving-to-mars-design-museum-london-review\" title=\"\">Moving to Mars</a>, the Barbican\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/15/ai-more-than-human-review-barbican-artificial-intelligence\" title=\"\">AI: More Than Human</a>, the V&amp;A Dundee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/09/hello-robot-v-and-a-dundee-review\" title=\"\">Hello, Robot</a>) the exhibition has to demonstrate why it would not be more at home in the Science Museum. It is not just about technology, is the point, but about culture. The aim is to show how profoundly cars have changed almost every aspect of human life: social life, geopolitics, gender politics, city building, tourism, economics, ecology, landscape, industry, art, to name but 10.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e29c04ab4bbe8ff83d0c23ac0fc307078955734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e29c04ab4bbe8ff83d0c23ac0fc307078955734/0_0_3340_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018drool-worthy\u2019 Czech-built Tatra T77, 1934.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018drool-worthy\u2019 Czech-built Tatra T77, 1934.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radim/Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For, if cars are all the bad things listed above, they have also been emancipating, energising, socially and economically transformative. They inspire devotion. They are objects of intense invention and creativity, as seen both in Henry Ford\u2019s production lines and in the iridescent greens and yellows of Tipsy/Guardian Angel, a 1962 Chevrolet Impala convertible customised by a Latino Angeleno called Tomas Vasquez. A short distance from the glum Carter clip is a map annotated by his fellow Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, a little more than 40 years previously, on which lines of blue pencil denote the freeways that were to sweep across the United States. For FDR, during the depression, cars were signs of hope.</p> <p>A recurring theme, indeed,, indeed, is the attachment of national significance to cars. There is the Paykan, a variant of the British Hillman Hunter, which in the time of the Shah became an unlikely symbol of Iranian identity. There is the Delahaye Type 145 of 1937, the successful outcome of a patriotic campaign to build a French car that could win races against the then-mighty products of the Nazi-backed German car makers.</p> <p>With cars, fantasy and function have always been entwined. On arrival at the show you are greeted with a 1950s film envisaging a future in which a uniformed official in a control room \u2013 a sort of inefficient prototype of Google Maps \u2013 radios to drivers the best routes for them to take. Nearby you can see a drawing by a Soviet design student that, as early as 1928, proposed a car-like, bubble-shaped living pod of a kind that is still a popular version of what the future will look like. Next you see the <a href=\"https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2016/01/20/remembering-gms-firebird-i/\" title=\"\">Firebird 1 concept car of 1953</a>, which set out to look like a jet fighter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dcf2b3919937de73a65e11cf758b04479dd360a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dcf2b3919937de73a65e11cf758b04479dd360a/0_0_4801_3912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tipsy/Guardian Angel, a customised 1962 Chevrolet Impala.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"815\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tipsy/Guardian Angel, a customised 1962 Chevrolet Impala.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kelleher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s an arresting section on the ways in which General Motors, in seeking to compete with the efficient monotony of Ford, started styling mass-production cars. Later they wanted to appeal to women, who, their research showed, had the \u201cfinal say\u201d in the majority of car purchases, with such things as pearls stitched into the seats and compartments for makeup. The exhibition touches on the ways in which, following the world of fashion, car manufacturers started restyling the product range every year to stimulate the appetite to keep buying new models. It shows the reaction against the imposition of corporate taste by, for example, customisation.</p> <p>Cars now are on the brink of becoming something different \u2013 driverless, electric, networked \u2013 which may or may not make them more benign. The V&amp;A show touches on this, with a final room showing a hypothetical car of the future, but the main aim is to show how the car got to be what it is now. The material is mostly from before 1980 \u2013 just as well, as the subject is already vast enough. Given that almost everything about life has been touched by cars, it would be possible to mount 50 different exhibitions on the theme, each with its own set of exhibits, each equally valid.</p> <p>This one does a good job of navigating the difficult territory between piston-engine porn and climate apocalypse. It doesn\u2019t try to draw conclusions or give lectures \u2013 in which respect its retrospection makes its avoidance of contemporary controversy easier. The viewer is allowed pleasure at the beauty of some of the creations, fascination with the human brilliance and human foibles at work, and recognition of the accompanying destruction. It\u2019s not agitprop, it\u2019s arguably a touch complacent, but it provides a valuable and arresting set of insights into one of the makers of the modern world. Which, in fact, is quite a lot for one exhibition.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/cars\">At the V&amp;A</a>, London; until 19 April 2020</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Cars. What? Cars, yes cars, planet-eaters and child-killers, climate-chokers and city-wreckers, antisocial, aggressive, exclusionary, tools and symbols of a world of consumerist selfishness. Un-woke. A subject that the Victoria and Albert Museum, currently under fire for taking money from the opioid-selling Sackler family, might want to avoid. In, though, it has plunged, with Cars: Accelerating the Modern World, a major exhibition on these motorised demons. The exhibition has been a long time in the offing, with Norman Foster at one point involved, whose preference (one might guess) would have been for a celebratory parade of shining technology. Foster is still credited as an inspiration behind the show, but in the hands of the curators Brendan Cormier and Lizzie Bisley it is something nuanced and multifaceted. The idea, says the assistant curator Esme Hawes, is to show both the original promises of the motor car and its unintended consequences. So it treads a path between Jeremy Clarkson and Greta Thunberg, a broad-enough terrain but a fraught one. There are cars \u2013 gleaming, drool-worthy objects such as the Czech Tatra T77 of 1934, a pioneer of streamlining, or an opulent Hispano-Suiza custom-built for Suzanna Deutsch de la Meurthe in 1922. There are also film clips, documentaries, trade union banners, advertisements, car-related clothing and artefacts, science-fiction comics. Specially commissioned films show the grassroots sport of car-spinning in South Africa and of the highly ornamented vehicles \u2013 great rolling palaces of glitter and electric light \u2013 of Japanese truckers. The dark side of cars is included \u2013 the conditions of assembly-line workers, the death toll from accidents, the effects on climate \u2013 though doesn\u2019t dominate. There is a compelling section on the ways in which Henry Ford learned from the production lines for dismembering pigs developed in the state of Ohio; a certain spirit of ruthlessness was carried over from the process of taking animals apart to that of putting cars together. A breathtaking 1970s advertisement for the Humble energy company, shocking and ironic at once, is displayed: \u201cEach day Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!\u201d A photo of such a glacier appears above the strapline. You see Jimmy Carter speaking from the Oval Office, with some of the downbeat tone that helped to make him \u2013 for all his many virtues \u2013 a one-term president. \u201cTonight,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to have an unpleasant talk with you.\u201d The bad news he had to impart was that the United States was going to have to change its relationship to the artefact it had made its own, that defined its industrial might and its version of freedom. Americans, he said, would have to be more careful with their fuel consumption because the world was running out of oil. Like some other recent and current shows (the Design Museum\u2019s Moving to Mars, the Barbican\u2019s AI: More Than Human, the V&amp;A Dundee\u2019s Hello, Robot) the exhibition has to demonstrate why it would not be more at home in the Science Museum. It is not just about technology, is the point, but about culture. The aim is to show how profoundly cars have changed almost every aspect of human life: social life, geopolitics, gender politics, city building, tourism, economics, ecology, landscape, industry, art, to name but 10. For, if cars are all the bad things listed above, they have also been emancipating, energising, socially and economically transformative. They inspire devotion. They are objects of intense invention and creativity, as seen both in Henry Ford\u2019s production lines and in the iridescent greens and yellows of Tipsy/Guardian Angel, a 1962 Chevrolet Impala convertible customised by a Latino Angeleno called Tomas Vasquez. A short distance from the glum Carter clip is a map annotated by his fellow Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, a little more than 40 years previously, on which lines of blue pencil denote the freeways that were to sweep across the United States. For FDR, during the depression, cars were signs of hope. A recurring theme, indeed,, indeed, is the attachment of national significance to cars. There is the Paykan, a variant of the British Hillman Hunter, which in the time of the Shah became an unlikely symbol of Iranian identity. There is the Delahaye Type 145 of 1937, the successful outcome of a patriotic campaign to build a French car that could win races against the then-mighty products of the Nazi-backed German car makers. With cars, fantasy and function have always been entwined. On arrival at the show you are greeted with a 1950s film envisaging a future in which a uniformed official in a control room \u2013 a sort of inefficient prototype of Google Maps \u2013 radios to drivers the best routes for them to take. Nearby you can see a drawing by a Soviet design student that, as early as 1928, proposed a car-like, bubble-shaped living pod of a kind that is still a popular version of what the future will look like. Next you see the Firebird 1 concept car of 1953, which set out to look like a jet fighter. There\u2019s an arresting section on the ways in which General Motors, in seeking to compete with the efficient monotony of Ford, started styling mass-production cars. Later they wanted to appeal to women, who, their research showed, had the \u201cfinal say\u201d in the majority of car purchases, with such things as pearls stitched into the seats and compartments for makeup. The exhibition touches on the ways in which, following the world of fashion, car manufacturers started restyling the product range every year to stimulate the appetite to keep buying new models. It shows the reaction against the imposition of corporate taste by, for example, customisation. Cars now are on the brink of becoming something different \u2013 driverless, electric, networked \u2013 which may or may not make them more benign. The V&amp;A show touches on this, with a final room showing a hypothetical car of the future, but the main aim is to show how the car got to be what it is now. The material is mostly from before 1980 \u2013 just as well, as the subject is already vast enough. Given that almost everything about life has been touched by cars, it would be possible to mount 50 different exhibitions on the theme, each with its own set of exhibits, each equally valid. This one does a good job of navigating the difficult territory between piston-engine porn and climate apocalypse. It doesn\u2019t try to draw conclusions or give lectures \u2013 in which respect its retrospection makes its avoidance of contemporary controversy easier. The viewer is allowed pleasure at the beauty of some of the creations, fascination with the human brilliance and human foibles at work, and recognition of the accompanying destruction. It\u2019s not agitprop, it\u2019s arguably a touch complacent, but it provides a valuable and arresting set of insights into one of the makers of the modern world. Which, in fact, is quite a lot for one exhibition. At the V&amp;A, London; until 19 April 2020",

      "bodyText": "A teenager who was among 39 migrants whose bodies were discovered in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex last month had gone missing from an asylum centre in the Netherlands, it has emerged. The country\u2019s Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) told local media the youngster absconded from a shelter for vulnerable migrants. The agency in The Hague did not give details about the name or age of the teenager. Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among 39 Vietnamese nationals found in the trailer in an industrial park in Grays on 23 October, shortly after the lorry arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Last week it emerged that relatives of the migrants found dead were told that neither the British nor Vietnamese governments will bear the costs of repatriating the bodies. Bui Huy Cuong, the deputy chair of Can Loc district\u2019s people\u2019s committee in Ha Tinh province, where 10 of the victims were from, said officials in the region had received instructions from Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry to inform families that neither government would do so. He said the Vietnamese government was offering to pay only the costs of bringing the bodies \u201chome from the airport\u201d. The driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland, has appeared in court charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering, and is expected to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday. Extradition proceedings have also been launched in Ireland to bring Eamonn Harrison, 22, from Mayobridge in Newry, County Down, to the UK. Harrison appeared at the central criminal court in Dublin on Thursday after he was arrested on a European arrest warrant in respect of 39 counts of manslaughter, one count of human trafficking and one count of assisting unlawful immigration. A 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration in the early hours of Friday morning on the M40. Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, from Armagh, Northern Ireland, to hand themselves in. They are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.",

      "bodyText": "When is a quote from a historical figure not to be trusted? When it is tweeted by a Trump. In truth, all historical quotes tweeted out by politicians should be treated with the caution of the most stringent factchecker \u2013 and regularly are, particularly when the words in question are supposedly by Winston Churchill. Nonetheless, this week Ivanka Trump fell into a familiar trap, provoking widespread glee. On Thursday evening, after a final (for now) dramatic day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against her father, the first daughter wrote: \u201c\u2018A decline of public morals in the United States will probably be marked by the abuse of the power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office.\u2019 \u201cAlexis de Tocqueville, 1835.\u201d Democrats say Donald Trump abused the powers of his office when he pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival and a baseless conspiracy theory about interference in the 2016 election. Republicans say the charges are a sham and the hearings a political circus designed to bring down a president without recourse to the ballot box. So Ivanka\u2019s tweet was on message. But, alas, it wasn\u2019t Tocqueville. As historians with Twitter accounts made clear, it was in fact a paraphrase drawn from the Frenchman\u2019s seminal work Democracy in America, which was published between 1835 and 1840 and is, according to the Guardian\u2019s Nicholas Lezard, \u201cstill relevant [as] everyone can find something in it that is recognisably correct\u201d. The incorrect lines Ivanka found were from the 1889 book American Constitutional Law by John Innes Clark Hare. It was also swiftly determined that Trump had most likely not found the 130-year-old lines on Google Books, or even while paging through a dusty tome ordered from the Library of Congress in order to mine the history of her father\u2019s predicament for aper\u00e7us fit to toss over canap\u00e9s at some Kalorama or Georgetown salon. Instead, Innes Clark Hare\u2019s words were published on the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal on 25 October, under the headline \u201cThis impeachment subverts the constitution\u201d. Trump was at least in good company: as a WSJ correction now makes clear, the two constitutional lawyers who wrote the piece in question also misattributed the quote, thanks in part to its appearance under Tocqueville\u2019s name in Deschler\u2019s Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, a catchily titled leviathan by House parliamentarian Lewis Deschler published in 1977. As of Saturday morning, the tweet remained on Ivanka\u2019s Twitter page. If she fancied any further reading, Twitter was of course happy to supply it. Joshua D Rothman, a history professor at the University of Alabama, was among those who pointed out that Innes Clark Hare deployed the paraphrase of Tocqueville in writing about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. That process, in 1868, saw the venal and unpopular 17th president avoid removal from office by one vote in a Senate trial. \u201cThe actual quote in context claims Andrew Johnson was wronged,\u201d Rothman wrote. It was now being used, he added, by a woman he called \u201ca beneficiary of nepotism in defense of a man who settled what is only his most recent fraud case less than two weeks ago\u201d. Tocqueville\u2019s masterwork, meanwhile, contains lines about another president which may seem quotable to readers consumed with the impeachment inquiry. In volume one, the Frenchman quotes \u201cthe first newspaper over which I cast my eyes, upon my arrival in America\u201d, and its judgment of Andrew Jackson. Students of the history of the Trump administration will recall that former White House strategist Steve Bannon encouraged Trump to see himself as a populist successor to Jackson; that Trump claimed both to have read a biography of Jackson and that Jackson would have prevented the civil war, which began 16 years after his death; that the 45th president visited the slave-owning seventh\u2019s home near Nashville, Tennessee; and that Trump keeps Jackson\u2019s portrait in the Oval Office. The article quoted by De Tocqueville calls Jackson a \u201cheartless despot solely occupied with the preservation of his own authority\u201d and adds: Ambition is his crime, and it will be his punishment too: intrigue is his native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks, and will deprive him of his power: he governs by means of corruption, and his immoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. His conduct in the political arena has been that of a shameless and lawless gamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribution approaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw aside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he may curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with which his heart is likely to remain forever unacquainted.",

      "body": "<p>What Britain needs is another museum. No, really. Amid all the hand-wringing about whether Britain\u2019s economic destiny lies in or out of the European Union, there is a clear need for a place to visit that can help people discover how money works.</p> <p>A Brexit deal may have been passed and this election will be a distant memory whenever the museum opens its doors, but with financial education at such a low ebb, a centre that facilitates the discussion of modern-day market capitalism (and its alternatives) must be worth the relatively small outlay.</p> <p>It could be called a Money Museum or a Centre for Understanding Economics, but whatever its name, there is a value in such an institution and it\u2019s a value that other nations understand.</p> <p>In Paris, the French recently opened the <a href=\"https://www.citeco.fr/en\" title=\"\">Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9conomie</a>, or Cit\u00e9co. In 2018, Germany\u2019s central bank revamped the shiny glass and steel <a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/money-museum\" title=\"\">Money Museum</a> that sits alongside its Frankfurt HQ. And there are several in the US.</p> <p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22064354\" title=\"\">40 years of Thatcherite policymaking</a>, which has dumped the responsibility for curating a secure financial future on the individual rather than the state, has left the country in need of a place that can help people figure out what is going on. And the need is more pressing now that we are in the midst of a climate emergency, and water-cooler conversations cover topics from international trade and customs unions to the rise of electronic currencies such as bitcoin.</p> <p>Many of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s disciples promised an increase in funding for financial education to put consumers on an even footing with the financial services industry. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/11/schools-ignore-personal-finance-lessons-fail-generation-debt\" title=\"\">Unfortunately the sums have been pathetic</a>. At the last count, the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en\" title=\"\">Money Advice Service</a> said regulators, banks, and charities spent about \u00a318m a year on educating the young about money.</p> <p>There is a money museum of sorts in the UK. Its entrance is <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/museum\" title=\"\">tucked away up the side of the Bank of England\u2019s imposing headquarters</a> in London\u2019s Square Mile.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We tie economics to nature, because economics starts in nature and ends in nature. We try to relate everything in the museum to people as economic actors</p> <footer> <cite>Spokesman for Mide, Mexico City</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Bank is currently considering ways of revamping the space with a view to giving it a more contemporary feel. At the moment, about 100,000 visitors a year tour the museum (entry is free) looking at assorted displays, mostly in cabinets, that tell the story of how the bank came into being and how it works now.</p> <p>This is not a place where the public can discover how companies account for their money, how the environmental effects of economic growth can be measured or how economic wellbeing is judged.</p> <p>By some accounts, the Cit\u00e9co in Paris, which is housed in a sumptuous neo-Renaissance palace, also qualifies as worthy but dull. Or at least not as exciting as it should be after the French spent \u20ac50m renovating the building and installing a range of interactive exhibits.</p> <p>It expects to attract 130,000 people a year even though it charges a hefty \u20ac12 entry fee for adults and \u20ac6 for school-age children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3526ae7a10b8095a9c0dd930b81634ef538ff2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3526ae7a10b8095a9c0dd930b81634ef538ff2e/80_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Gaillard exterior\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paris\u2019s Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9conomie is housed in the beautiful Hotel Gaillard - but is rather worthy and dull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gold-standard museum is <a href=\"https://www.mide.org.mx//\" title=\"\">the Interactive Museum of Economics</a> (Mide) in Mexico City, where the central bank recruited sponsors from the finance industry to help transform an old central bank office into the most interactive and innovative museum of its kind.</p> <p>Billed as the world\u2019s first and only interactive economics museum, it has an annual budget of \u00a32m and a staff of 110 (the Bank of England\u2019s employs a handful).</p> <p>In one room visitors can immerse themselves in a simulated trading floor, guided by virtual-reality headsets. At the entrance to another, marked Future of Money, visitors are handed a tablet computer to aid their discovery.</p> <p>A spokesman was keen to emphasise how farsighted the museum is. \u201cWe always try to tie economics to nature,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause economics starts in nature and ends in nature. In this way we try to relate everything in the museum to people as economic actors.\u201d</p> <p>Entry is \u00a34 for adults and \u00a33 for students, but this hasn\u2019t deterred the 250,000 people who have visited every year since it opened almost 13 years ago.</p> <p>When both political parties are making huge spending promises, it would be relatively painless to set aside funds for an interactive museum. There are several science museums around the country; why not a proper economics museum? </p> <p>Like Mexico\u2019s version, it should do more than just explain how the central bank works. Schools would then have access to a crucial resource: something that would promote discussion in times that are, Brexit or no Brexit, economically more uncertain than any we have seen since the second world war.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What Britain needs is another museum. No, really. Amid all the hand-wringing about whether Britain\u2019s economic destiny lies in or out of the European Union, there is a clear need for a place to visit that can help people discover how money works. A Brexit deal may have been passed and this election will be a distant memory whenever the museum opens its doors, but with financial education at such a low ebb, a centre that facilitates the discussion of modern-day market capitalism (and its alternatives) must be worth the relatively small outlay. It could be called a Money Museum or a Centre for Understanding Economics, but whatever its name, there is a value in such an institution and it\u2019s a value that other nations understand. In Paris, the French recently opened the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9conomie, or Cit\u00e9co. In 2018, Germany\u2019s central bank revamped the shiny glass and steel Money Museum that sits alongside its Frankfurt HQ. And there are several in the US. Almost 40 years of Thatcherite policymaking, which has dumped the responsibility for curating a secure financial future on the individual rather than the state, has left the country in need of a place that can help people figure out what is going on. And the need is more pressing now that we are in the midst of a climate emergency, and water-cooler conversations cover topics from international trade and customs unions to the rise of electronic currencies such as bitcoin. Many of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s disciples promised an increase in funding for financial education to put consumers on an even footing with the financial services industry. Unfortunately the sums have been pathetic. At the last count, the Money Advice Service said regulators, banks, and charities spent about \u00a318m a year on educating the young about money. There is a money museum of sorts in the UK. Its entrance is tucked away up the side of the Bank of England\u2019s imposing headquarters in London\u2019s Square Mile. The Bank is currently considering ways of revamping the space with a view to giving it a more contemporary feel. At the moment, about 100,000 visitors a year tour the museum (entry is free) looking at assorted displays, mostly in cabinets, that tell the story of how the bank came into being and how it works now. This is not a place where the public can discover how companies account for their money, how the environmental effects of economic growth can be measured or how economic wellbeing is judged. By some accounts, the Cit\u00e9co in Paris, which is housed in a sumptuous neo-Renaissance palace, also qualifies as worthy but dull. Or at least not as exciting as it should be after the French spent \u20ac50m renovating the building and installing a range of interactive exhibits. It expects to attract 130,000 people a year even though it charges a hefty \u20ac12 entry fee for adults and \u20ac6 for school-age children. The gold-standard museum is the Interactive Museum of Economics (Mide) in Mexico City, where the central bank recruited sponsors from the finance industry to help transform an old central bank office into the most interactive and innovative museum of its kind. Billed as the world\u2019s first and only interactive economics museum, it has an annual budget of \u00a32m and a staff of 110 (the Bank of England\u2019s employs a handful). In one room visitors can immerse themselves in a simulated trading floor, guided by virtual-reality headsets. At the entrance to another, marked Future of Money, visitors are handed a tablet computer to aid their discovery. A spokesman was keen to emphasise how farsighted the museum is. \u201cWe always try to tie economics to nature,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause economics starts in nature and ends in nature. In this way we try to relate everything in the museum to people as economic actors.\u201d Entry is \u00a34 for adults and \u00a33 for students, but this hasn\u2019t deterred the 250,000 people who have visited every year since it opened almost 13 years ago. When both political parties are making huge spending promises, it would be relatively painless to set aside funds for an interactive museum. There are several science museums around the country; why not a proper economics museum? Like Mexico\u2019s version, it should do more than just explain how the central bank works. Schools would then have access to a crucial resource: something that would promote discussion in times that are, Brexit or no Brexit, economically more uncertain than any we have seen since the second world war.",

      "body": "<p>When Tony Nourmand began collecting movie posters and other print memorabilia from the French New Wave 30 years ago, he could usually pick them up for next to nothing. \u201cI remember going to Paris and walking into poster shops and digging for hours,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand then I\u2019d suddenly find a poster for <em>Breathless</em> and it was 50 francs, and I\u2019d be so excited. Nobody else seemed to care.\u201d</p> <p>Their stock has certainly risen since those days, but, curiously, this artwork from one of the most explosively creative moments in cinema history is still far less prized than classic Hollywood posters. \u201cMovies like <em>Casablanca</em>, <em>Bull</em><em>itt </em>or <em>The Exorcist</em> were made by major studios,\u201d says Nourmand, \u201cso their posters were more conservative.\u201d The poster design for films by Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and other boundary-pushing French directors of the late 1950s and 60s was anything but.</p> <p>For evidence, take a look at Nourmand\u2019s hefty<em> French New Wave: A Revolution in Design</em>. Published this week by his own Reel Art Press, the book draws almost exclusively from the collection that Nourmand \u2013 who was born in Tehran, but has lived in the UK since 1976 \u2013 started back in 1990. It is now, he claims, the largest collection of French New Wave advertising material in the world, containing more than 3,000 items including photographs, press-books and magazines. (He sold the whole lot to an English collector in 2011, but was given full access for this project.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91f933a1efe44112f76229b5bba69829b345b524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91f933a1efe44112f76229b5bba69829b345b524/0_0_2439_3101/787.jpg\" alt=\"Pickpocket (1959) by Christian Broutin\" width=\"787\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pickpocket (1959) by Christian Broutin (France)<br>This design for Robert Bresson\u2019s Pickpocket was apparently Broutin\u2019s favourite of all his posters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reel Art Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much has been written over the decades about the French New Wave \u2013 about its rebellious young auteurs and the technical innovations they pioneered, about the influence they\u2019ve exerted on successive generations of film-makers. Far less attention has been paid to the designers who created a visual identity for the films around their release. Prioritising the poster artists over the directors, listing them A to Z with a short biography for each one, Nourmand\u2019s book seeks to redress the balance. He and his managing editor at Reel Art Press, Alison Elangasinghe, have spent years researching these often obscure designers and illustrators, many of whom, he says, have not been written about before.</p> <p>With its blend of intellectualism, politics, sex, violence, sartorial elegance and ennui, the New Wave was an inimitably French movement. The artworks in the collection, though, were designed in different parts of the world, in Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Japan, the US and communist-era eastern Europe. Seen together, they provide a fascinating picture of how different countries represented and promoted these films.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6da5bfb1b2c558bef1d463d800ec42df4b923b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6da5bfb1b2c558bef1d463d800ec42df4b923b2/0_0_3734_5038/741.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c0 bout de souffle (1960) by Cl\u00e9ment Hurel (France).\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00c0 bout de souffle (1960) by Cl\u00e9ment Hurel (France).

      "bodyText": "When Tony Nourmand began collecting movie posters and other print memorabilia from the French New Wave 30 years ago, he could usually pick them up for next to nothing. \u201cI remember going to Paris and walking into poster shops and digging for hours,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand then I\u2019d suddenly find a poster for Breathless and it was 50 francs, and I\u2019d be so excited. Nobody else seemed to care.\u201d Their stock has certainly risen since those days, but, curiously, this artwork from one of the most explosively creative moments in cinema history is still far less prized than classic Hollywood posters. \u201cMovies like Casablanca, Bullitt or The Exorcist were made by major studios,\u201d says Nourmand, \u201cso their posters were more conservative.\u201d The poster design for films by Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and other boundary-pushing French directors of the late 1950s and 60s was anything but. For evidence, take a look at Nourmand\u2019s hefty French New Wave: A Revolution in Design. Published this week by his own Reel Art Press, the book draws almost exclusively from the collection that Nourmand \u2013 who was born in Tehran, but has lived in the UK since 1976 \u2013 started back in 1990. It is now, he claims, the largest collection of French New Wave advertising material in the world, containing more than 3,000 items including photographs, press-books and magazines. (He sold the whole lot to an English collector in 2011, but was given full access for this project.) Much has been written over the decades about the French New Wave \u2013 about its rebellious young auteurs and the technical innovations they pioneered, about the influence they\u2019ve exerted on successive generations of film-makers. Far less attention has been paid to the designers who created a visual identity for the films around their release. Prioritising the poster artists over the directors, listing them A to Z with a short biography for each one, Nourmand\u2019s book seeks to redress the balance. He and his managing editor at Reel Art Press, Alison Elangasinghe, have spent years researching these often obscure designers and illustrators, many of whom, he says, have not been written about before. With its blend of intellectualism, politics, sex, violence, sartorial elegance and ennui, the New Wave was an inimitably French movement. The artworks in the collection, though, were designed in different parts of the world, in Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Japan, the US and communist-era eastern Europe. Seen together, they provide a fascinating picture of how different countries represented and promoted these films. \u201cThe diversity of it was something that really excited me,\u201d says Nourmand. \u201cWhen you look at horror movie posters from the 1930s, the American and French versions will obviously be different, but they both have that same painterly aesthetic. But with a film like [Godard\u2019s] Weekend, the German poster, designed by Hans Hillman, is very typographical, whereas the Japanese poster, by Kiyoshi Awazu, could almost have been done by Warhol.

A peak audience of 4.6 million watched Johnson, Corbyn, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon battle a barrage of hostile questioning from an audience in Sheffield during the two-hour programme on Friday evening. The average number of viewers throughout the show was 4.23 million, representing a significant drop from the 6.7 million who switched on for ITV\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate on Tuesday, in which Johnson and Corbyn faced each other. However, the figures are higher than Question Time\u2019s normal audience of about 2-2.5 million. The special Question Time episode also drew nearly double that figure, and significantly more than the 2.4 million average audience of the popular Graham Norton chat show that was aired later in the evening. Fiona Bruce chaired a bruising night of live questioning from audience members on Friday, during which Corbyn revealed he would take a \u201cneutral stance\u201d should there be a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins the election. The Labour leader was also confronted with questions about his party\u2019s record on antisemitism and nationalisation plans. Johnson was wounded after questioning on his trustworthiness, and was also accused of fomenting racism with the inflammatory language he used in his newspaper columns, including one in which he described Muslim women wearing burqas as looking like \u201cletter boxes\u201d. The Liberal Democrat leader Swinson faced a torrid time as she was questioned about her voting record in the coalition government, as well as her party\u2019s pledge to revoke Brexit. Meanwhile, the Scottish National party leader and Scottish first minister Sturgeon confirmed she could support a Corbyn government in exchange for an independence referendum.

      "body": "<p>Back on home turf it was business as usual for Saracens, on the field at least, with six tries, a handful of World Cup stars returning \u2013 including an impressive debut for Elliot Daly \u2013 and a demonstration that they will not give up their European crown without a considerable fight. Premiership survival remains the priority this season but this emphatic bonus-point victory kick-starts Saracens\u2019 campaign on the continent and tees up a decisive double header with Munster next month.</p> <p>Rotimi Segun finished with two tries, Jack Singleton, Alex Lewington, Richard Barrington all one apiece with Saracens awarded a penalty try to boot but it was Daly who shone brightest on his first appearance. He teed up two tries for Segun and was the standout performer but the very fact the defending champions have added England\u2019s full-back to their already illustrious squad hardly leads to much sympathy for their plight amid the salary-cap scandal that hangs heavy over the club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/exeter-glasgow-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Henry Slade continues Exeter\u2019s promising start with Glasgow win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saracens chose to leave Billy Vunipola, Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje out of their matchday 23 but this was demonstration of their strength in depth, in contrast to the lack of reserves available to the Ospreys. The visitors have been hit hard by injuries \u2013 Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric, Gareth Anscombe and George North heading a list of notable absentees \u2013 and, for all that the XV selected stuck to the task, this was always likely to be a routine victory for Saracens given they had nine internationals in their starting lineup.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still ambitious to do well in the competition and we still want to win the games,\u201d said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. \u201cWe have just got some decisions to make along the way about when the internationals play and we will make those decisions.</p> <p>\u201cThe decisions we\u2019ve taken around who does and doesn\u2019t play had nothing to do with the salary-cap issue and everything to do with how they are. If we get through to the quarter-finals we\u2019ve got a chance, a good chance because my experience with this team in knockout rugby is pretty good.\u201d</p> <p>It was a scrappy start, notable only for just how quiet it was at Allianz Park in their first outing here since being hit with a \u00a35.4m fine and a 35-point deduction in the Premiership. Saracens supporters are not always the most vocal but one had to wonder whether the off-field controversies had shaken their fans\u2019 belief. The chairman, Nigel Wray, often uses his programme notes to make a statement and on this occasion opted to quote from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s If. In the opening stages, however, with Saracens sluggish, one could not say it had the desired effect and, if the players are trying to foster an us-versus-the-world attitude, on this evidence it has yet to spill on to the stands.</p> <p>Daly eventually opened the scoring, on target with a penalty beyond Manu Vunipola\u2019s range and the 19-year-old fly-half added another closer in soon after. Daly had a hand in Saracens\u2019 opening try too, gathering James Hook\u2019s high kick, peeling to the right wing and releasing Jackson Wray, who in turn found Ben Earl there. The flanker was stopped short by the covering Owen Watkin but the Ospreys were forced into conceding a lineout deep in their own 22. Nick Isiekwe gathered Singleton\u2019s throw and the England hooker was soon over in the right corner.</p> <p>Hook put the Ospreys on the board with a penalty before Saracens\u2019 second try, which had a touch of fortune to it. Vunipola\u2019s return pass to Tom Whiteley was off target but the scrum-half hacked the ball across field to Daly on the volley. Daly seized the opening ruthlessly, releasing Segun on the right to race clear. Segun then turned provider for Saracens\u2019 third, the returning captain, Brad Barritt, delaying his pass delightfully for the right wing, who shipped on to Lewington in the left corner.</p> <p>Saracens lost Titi Lamositele to injury just before half-time, the tighthead prop clutching his left elbow as he made way, but they secured the bonus point seven minutes into the second half \u2013 Segun arcing his way to the try-line after a clever offload from Daly. After a flurry of replacements in which Saracens introduced Richard Wigglesworth and Jamie George, they had their fifth try when the referee, Mathieu Raynal, wasted little time in running to the posts after the home side turned the screw at a close-range scrum and Barrington barrelled over to complete the rout. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Back on home turf it was business as usual for Saracens, on the field at least, with six tries, a handful of World Cup stars returning \u2013 including an impressive debut for Elliot Daly \u2013 and a demonstration that they will not give up their European crown without a considerable fight. Premiership survival remains the priority this season but this emphatic bonus-point victory kick-starts Saracens\u2019 campaign on the continent and tees up a decisive double header with Munster next month. Rotimi Segun finished with two tries, Jack Singleton, Alex Lewington, Richard Barrington all one apiece with Saracens awarded a penalty try to boot but it was Daly who shone brightest on his first appearance. He teed up two tries for Segun and was the standout performer but the very fact the defending champions have added England\u2019s full-back to their already illustrious squad hardly leads to much sympathy for their plight amid the salary-cap scandal that hangs heavy over the club. Saracens chose to leave Billy Vunipola, Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje out of their matchday 23 but this was demonstration of their strength in depth, in contrast to the lack of reserves available to the Ospreys. The visitors have been hit hard by injuries \u2013 Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric, Gareth Anscombe and George North heading a list of notable absentees \u2013 and, for all that the XV selected stuck to the task, this was always likely to be a routine victory for Saracens given they had nine internationals in their starting lineup. \u201cWe are still ambitious to do well in the competition and we still want to win the games,\u201d said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. \u201cWe have just got some decisions to make along the way about when the internationals play and we will make those decisions. \u201cThe decisions we\u2019ve taken around who does and doesn\u2019t play had nothing to do with the salary-cap issue and everything to do with how they are. If we get through to the quarter-finals we\u2019ve got a chance, a good chance because my experience with this team in knockout rugby is pretty good.\u201d It was a scrappy start, notable only for just how quiet it was at Allianz Park in their first outing here since being hit with a \u00a35.4m fine and a 35-point deduction in the Premiership. Saracens supporters are not always the most vocal but one had to wonder whether the off-field controversies had shaken their fans\u2019 belief. The chairman, Nigel Wray, often uses his programme notes to make a statement and on this occasion opted to quote from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s If. In the opening stages, however, with Saracens sluggish, one could not say it had the desired effect and, if the players are trying to foster an us-versus-the-world attitude, on this evidence it has yet to spill on to the stands. Daly eventually opened the scoring, on target with a penalty beyond Manu Vunipola\u2019s range and the 19-year-old fly-half added another closer in soon after. Daly had a hand in Saracens\u2019 opening try too, gathering James Hook\u2019s high kick, peeling to the right wing and releasing Jackson Wray, who in turn found Ben Earl there. The flanker was stopped short by the covering Owen Watkin but the Ospreys were forced into conceding a lineout deep in their own 22. Nick Isiekwe gathered Singleton\u2019s throw and the England hooker was soon over in the right corner. Hook put the Ospreys on the board with a penalty before Saracens\u2019 second try, which had a touch of fortune to it. Vunipola\u2019s return pass to Tom Whiteley was off target but the scrum-half hacked the ball across field to Daly on the volley. Daly seized the opening ruthlessly, releasing Segun on the right to race clear. Segun then turned provider for Saracens\u2019 third, the returning captain, Brad Barritt, delaying his pass delightfully for the right wing, who shipped on to Lewington in the left corner. Saracens lost Titi Lamositele to injury just before half-time, the tighthead prop clutching his left elbow as he made way, but they secured the bonus point seven minutes into the second half \u2013 Segun arcing his way to the try-line after a clever offload from Daly. After a flurry of replacements in which Saracens introduced Richard Wigglesworth and Jamie George, they had their fifth try when the referee, Mathieu Raynal, wasted little time in running to the posts after the home side turned the screw at a close-range scrum and Barrington barrelled over to complete the rout.",

      "body": "<p>Theatre director Jamie Lloyd was born in Poole, Dorset, in 1980. His first major production was Harold Pinter\u2019s <em>The Caretaker</em> in 2006, and he has become Britain\u2019s foremost Pinter interpreter, recently staging a four-month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/13/pinter-at-the-pinter-five-and-six-review-time-is-love-finborough-tiempo-es-amor-sheila-atim\" title=\"\">West End season</a> of all Pinter\u2019s short plays. In 2015, he founded the <a href=\"https://thejamielloydcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Jamie Lloyd Company</a>. His production of <em>Betrayal, </em>starring Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton and Charlie Cox, is currently on Broadway, and his recent <em>Evita </em>transfers to the West End next year. Next, he directs a new adaptation of Edmond Rostand\u2019s <em>C</em><em>yrano de Bergerac</em> (1897), translated by Martin Crimp and starring James McAvoy, <a href=\"https://www.fromtheboxoffice.com/city/2957-london/16D32-playhouse-theatre-london-cyrano-de-bergerac/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=redirect\" title=\"\">at London\u2019s Playhouse theatre</a> (3 Dec to 23 Feb). Lloyd lives in Hastings.</p> <p><strong>Tell </strong><strong>us about your new production of Cyrano\u2026</strong><br>There\u2019s a certain approach people expect: Cyrano is going to have a big prosthetic nose, a big hat, they\u2019re going to swordfight\u2026 Trying to banish all of that, and get to the very essence of what the play is about, is really the aim.</p> <p><strong>And what do you think that essence is?</strong><br>Cyrano has developed this carapace of exhibitionism, aggression, wit \u2013 which clearly masks something deeply painful and lonely. The reason the play has endured is that we all have an insecurity, something we\u2019re battling with. It\u2019s trying to understand that, rather than just delivering on the swash and buckle!</p> <p><strong>This is your fourth play starring James McAvoy. What\u2019s so special about that relationship? </strong><br>It\u2019s definitely the most significant working relationship of my career. He really comes alive in a rehearsal room: it\u2019s a director\u2019s gift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ffccff89a74f7151711f8b9bfa652c5e22e52a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ffccff89a74f7151711f8b9bfa652c5e22e52a/1721_0_3442_3442/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James McAvoy in rehearsal for Cyrano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James McAvoy in rehearsals for Cyrano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019re offering 15,000 free tickets to first-time theatregoers\u2026</strong><br>Being the son of a truck driver and a cleaner, I didn\u2019t go to the theatre when I was a kid. We want everyone to experience it. We\u2019re being very careful about targeting particular community groups and state secondary schools: I worry sometimes that accessibility is a box-ticking exercise, whereas it\u2019s got to be a very considered approach.</p> <p><strong>Your production of </strong><em><strong>Doctor Faustus</strong></em><strong> starring Kit Harrington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/14/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-defends-theatregoers-criticised-for-eating-and-talking\" title=\"\">attracted criticism</a> </strong><strong>of the behaviour of young audiences.<br></strong>All this belittling you read \u2013 normally written by middle-aged white men \u2013 it\u2019s just nonsense. My experience of younger audiences is they\u2019re incredibly disciplined, engaged and passionate. It makes me really upset and angry that anyone would want to diminish that. It\u2019s just another example of someone trying to keep theatre as the reserve of the elite.</p> <p><strong>Your production of </strong><em><strong>Betrayal</strong></em><strong> is now on Broadway. Does Pinter\u2019s work land differently in the US? </strong><br>Audiences are ready to laugh more. Charlie [Cox]\u2019s character says \u201cHow are you?\u201d and Zawe [Ashton] says \u201cOh, not too bad\u201d \u2013 and for some reason it gets a big laugh. Maybe it\u2019s<em> Downton Abbey</em> syndrome: Americans are so intrigued by English repression.</p> <p><strong>Chemistry is so important for that play. How do you know when you\u2019ve found the right actors?</strong><br>It\u2019s purely instinct: you just know. It\u2019s like putting together the ultimate rock band. <em>Betrayal</em> was beyond anything I\u2019d imagined \u2013 but can you imagine doing that play if you hated each other, or the men were trying to out-alpha each other. It would be awful. Actually, they\u2019re incredibly close: Zawe calls them \u201cthe thrupple\u201d, because they do hang out all the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b70653ec629be3c7bab98d977a7fdb3e6cab465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b70653ec629be3c7bab98d977a7fdb3e6cab465/0_101_5121_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Cox, Zawe Ashton and Tom Hiddleston in Betrayal, directed by Jamie Lloyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Cox, Zawe Ashton and Tom Hiddleston in Betrayal, directed by Jamie Lloyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What did you learn from spending so long immersed in Pinter\u2019s work?</strong><br>Awful loneliness unites all of the characters. They\u2019re frequently horrible to each other because, actually, they want to connect. That yearning was a surprising and amazing thing to discover. Also, stripping things back and intervening less as a director was a really significant lesson for me. I guess I\u2019ve been terrified of being boring \u2013 and maybe trying too hard to combat that, throwing everything at it.</p> <p><strong>Are you done with Pinter now?<br></strong>No: he really obsesses me. I want to make sure I do all of the plays.</p> <p><strong>Next year you\u2019ll be staging Ibsen\u2019s </strong><em><strong>A Doll\u2019s House</strong></em><strong>, starring Jessica Chastain. What can we expect? </strong><br>She\u2019s an incredibly powerful artist, and really up for challenging expectations. She\u2019s certainly not going to be doing a middle-of-the-road production.</p> <p><strong>The Jamie Lloyd Company has yet to stage any plays by women. As a commercial company, do you feel absolved from the need to consider representation? </strong><br>No, not at all. It\u2019s incredibly important to me. It\u2019s really tricky: what gives us the freedom to offer cheaper or free tickets is [high-profile] casting. It\u2019s not necessarily that those actors have not been sent plays by women; it just so happens that they\u2019ve responded to plays written by men. But we do have a play by a woman coming up.</p> <p>All the work we do around casting is about putting together the most exciting, diverse group of people. But what is also very important \u2013 and what we need to do more work on \u2013 is representation in terms of writers, and who makes the work, including unseen roles like stage management and crew.</p> <p><strong>We\u2019ve become accustomed to bold versions of classic plays \u2013 but is it harder to rework popular musicals, as you did recently </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/11/evita-regents-park-open-air-theatre-review\" title=\"\">with </a><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/11/evita-regents-park-open-air-theatre-review\" title=\"\">Evita</a></strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>We had to reinvent every moment: everyone knows what <em>Evita</em> is. But we\u2019re used to seeing Shakespeare and classical texts reinvented \u2013 so why not reinvent Andrew Lloyd Webber?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theatre director Jamie Lloyd was born in Poole, Dorset, in 1980. His first major production was Harold Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker in 2006, and he has become Britain\u2019s foremost Pinter interpreter, recently staging a four-month West End season of all Pinter\u2019s short plays. In 2015, he founded the Jamie Lloyd Company. His production of Betrayal, starring Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton and Charlie Cox, is currently on Broadway, and his recent Evita transfers to the West End next year. Next, he directs a new adaptation of Edmond Rostand\u2019s Cyrano de Bergerac (1897), translated by Martin Crimp and starring James McAvoy, at London\u2019s Playhouse theatre (3 Dec to 23 Feb). Lloyd lives in Hastings. Tell us about your new production of Cyrano\u2026 There\u2019s a certain approach people expect: Cyrano is going to have a big prosthetic nose, a big hat, they\u2019re going to swordfight\u2026 Trying to banish all of that, and get to the very essence of what the play is about, is really the aim. And what do you think that essence is? Cyrano has developed this carapace of exhibitionism, aggression, wit \u2013 which clearly masks something deeply painful and lonely. The reason the play has endured is that we all have an insecurity, something we\u2019re battling with. It\u2019s trying to understand that, rather than just delivering on the swash and buckle! This is your fourth play starring James McAvoy. What\u2019s so special about that relationship? It\u2019s definitely the most significant working relationship of my career. He really comes alive in a rehearsal room: it\u2019s a director\u2019s gift. You\u2019re offering 15,000 free tickets to first-time theatregoers\u2026 Being the son of a truck driver and a cleaner, I didn\u2019t go to the theatre when I was a kid. We want everyone to experience it. We\u2019re being very careful about targeting particular community groups and state secondary schools: I worry sometimes that accessibility is a box-ticking exercise, whereas it\u2019s got to be a very considered approach. Your production of Doctor Faustus starring Kit Harrington attracted criticism of the behaviour of young audiences. All this belittling you read \u2013 normally written by middle-aged white men \u2013 it\u2019s just nonsense. My experience of younger audiences is they\u2019re incredibly disciplined, engaged and passionate. It makes me really upset and angry that anyone would want to diminish that. It\u2019s just another example of someone trying to keep theatre as the reserve of the elite. Your production of Betrayal is now on Broadway. Does Pinter\u2019s work land differently in the US? Audiences are ready to laugh more. Charlie [Cox]\u2019s character says \u201cHow are you?\u201d and Zawe [Ashton] says \u201cOh, not too bad\u201d \u2013 and for some reason it gets a big laugh. Maybe it\u2019s Downton Abbey syndrome: Americans are so intrigued by English repression. Chemistry is so important for that play. How do you know when you\u2019ve found the right actors? It\u2019s purely instinct: you just know. It\u2019s like putting together the ultimate rock band. Betrayal was beyond anything I\u2019d imagined \u2013 but can you imagine doing that play if you hated each other, or the men were trying to out-alpha each other. It would be awful. Actually, they\u2019re incredibly close: Zawe calls them \u201cthe thrupple\u201d, because they do hang out all the time. What did you learn from spending so long immersed in Pinter\u2019s work? Awful loneliness unites all of the characters. They\u2019re frequently horrible to each other because, actually, they want to connect. That yearning was a surprising and amazing thing to discover. Also, stripping things back and intervening less as a director was a really significant lesson for me. I guess I\u2019ve been terrified of being boring \u2013 and maybe trying too hard to combat that, throwing everything at it. Are you done with Pinter now? No: he really obsesses me. I want to make sure I do all of the plays. Next year you\u2019ll be staging Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House, starring Jessica Chastain. What can we expect? She\u2019s an incredibly powerful artist, and really up for challenging expectations. She\u2019s certainly not going to be doing a middle-of-the-road production. The Jamie Lloyd Company has yet to stage any plays by women. As a commercial company, do you feel absolved from the need to consider representation? No, not at all. It\u2019s incredibly important to me. It\u2019s really tricky: what gives us the freedom to offer cheaper or free tickets is [high-profile] casting. It\u2019s not necessarily that those actors have not been sent plays by women; it just so happens that they\u2019ve responded to plays written by men. But we do have a play by a woman coming up. All the work we do around casting is about putting together the most exciting, diverse group of people. But what is also very important \u2013 and what we need to do more work on \u2013 is representation in terms of writers, and who makes the work, including unseen roles like stage management and crew. We\u2019ve become accustomed to bold versions of classic plays \u2013 but is it harder to rework popular musicals, as you did recently with Evita? We had to reinvent every moment: everyone knows what Evita is. But we\u2019re used to seeing Shakespeare and classical texts reinvented \u2013 so why not reinvent Andrew Lloyd Webber?",

It\u2019s as good (and maybe better) than the indelible Let It Go. The much awaited sequel to Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee\u2019s 2013 animated musical phenomenon sees Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) beckoned by a \u201csecret siren\u201d, whose disembodied soprano whistle leads her through the Enchanted Forest and to the River Ahtohallan to learn the difficult truth about her family\u2019s past. \u201cCan you face what the river knows?\u201d sings her late mother (Evan Rachel Wood) in the opening flashback\u2019s lullaby. A battle means the forest has been sealed off for decades by a magical fog; Elsa and co discover that trapped within are its indigenous people, the Northuldra. The spirits of earth, air, water and fire are also volatile; the animators demonstrate the beauty, terror and instability of the elements via a neon pink forest fire and an ethereal water horse that Elsa rides across the unruly, dark sea.

We were playing well, doing things we spoke a lot about. I think we are lucky that I have so many years of Premier League that I told the players at half-time, even if it is 3-0, minute 85 the game will be open, and I think they understood that. But for the last 20 minutes, fatigue, people coming from the national team, all the emotions of losing their manager, another one comes ... there was clearly fatigue. And we were playing a very good team with good players, and their coach tried different things, playing more direct to avoid our pressure. It was not easy. But I really liked very much our first 60 minutes. I enjoyed it. The most important thing was not to win 3-0 or 4-0, the three points were a mental barrier. The boys are happy, and I really wanted them to be back to happiness. Dele Alli is too good not to be in the national team, too good not to be one of the best players in the world. The best Dele has to be back.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd943e28f087b800b61fc0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T14:41:09.900Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dele Alli speaks:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week for us emotionally. We\u2019ve all spent a long time with Poch and were shocked when we heard the news. It was very sad. But we have a job to do. We have to go out and perform for the fans and for the club. No matter what happens, we have to stay together as a squad. In football things change.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Son Heung-min adds:</strong> \u201cFor almost five years we have tried to play from the back, but now we are trying something new. We adapted well, the lads did a really good job. We have to fight for the second ball.\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd941bd8f080fd59fb15f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T14:33:43.607Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That result catapults Tottenham up to sixth, at least for a couple of hours. </strong>West Ham are still stuck in 16th place, currently five points clear of the relegation zone. Should Watford beat Burnley later, though, that\u2019ll just be two. And as good as Spurs were for most of that game - Son and Alli were sensational in the first half - West Ham turned in the sort of performance that usually leads to a relegation scrap. Not a perfect day at the office for Mourinho, as it looked like being midway through the second half, but more than good enough. Onwards and upwards. West Ham by contrast are in all sorts of bother; those late goals don\u2019t mask anything. Manuel Pellegrini is on very thin ice.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd9414f8f083aa6d5789be6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T14:26:38.409Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: West Ham United 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But it\u2019s too late for West Ham.

You know Mourinho\u2019s USP: trophies are guaranteed. Here we go, then!</p> <p><strong>But let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves.</strong> Mourinho\u2019s first job is to rebuild stuttering Spurs\u2019 confidence, and get them back up the Premier League. He couldn\u2019t have picked a much better fixture to start with. Spurs have emerged victorious from their last three visits to the London Stadium, and today they\u2019ll face a West Ham team in abject form: five losses and two draws from their last seven games. Jose will fancy this one.</p> <p><strong>On the other hand, Spurs aren\u2019t in the greatest nick themselves. </strong>Hence poor Pochettino\u2019s sacking. They\u2019ve only won five games all season, and two of those were against a risible Red Star Belgrade rabble. Infamously, Tottenham haven\u2019t won on the road in the Premier League since January. And the Hammers are desperate to rise up the division themselves, and will take succour from the tail end of last season, when they became the first team to defeat Spurs in their sparkling new stadium.</p> <p><strong>So a no-holds-barred London derby awaits. </strong>It didn\u2019t need the extra spice that Mourinho will bring. But baby it\u2019s got it. This should be a whole world of fun. The Premier League is back after the international break ... and it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was our man out east today. He witnessed the dawning of a new age, and perhaps the end times of another. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM! The turn of the under-pressure Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cThere is frustration because we did not win a home game, especially because it is the derby against Tottenham. It\u2019s a victory we wanted to have for our fans, to return to a winning performance, but we couldn\u2019t. Antonio could not play the whole game, but we hope in the future he will contribute to a win. When you don\u2019t have the result you want, you must trust more than ever. Our players never gave up, they continued to fight until the last minute. The moment we have the first winning result, the pressure will be gone.\u201d And now a word with the man of the moment, Jose Mourinho! \u201cI was really happy for an hour. We were playing well, doing things we spoke a lot about. I think we are lucky that I have so many years of Premier League that I told the players at half-time, even if it is 3-0, minute 85 the game will be open, and I think they understood that. But for the last 20 minutes, fatigue, people coming from the national team, all the emotions of losing their manager, another one comes ... there was clearly fatigue. And we were playing a very good team with good players, and their coach tried different things, playing more direct to avoid our pressure. It was not easy. But I really liked very much our first 60 minutes. I enjoyed it. The most important thing was not to win 3-0 or 4-0, the three points were a mental barrier. The boys are happy, and I really wanted them to be back to happiness. Dele Alli is too good not to be in the national team, too good not to be one of the best players in the world. The best Dele has to be back.\u201d Dele Alli speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week for us emotionally. We\u2019ve all spent a long time with Poch and were shocked when we heard the news. It was very sad. But we have a job to do. We have to go out and perform for the fans and for the club. No matter what happens, we have to stay together as a squad. In football things change.\u201d Son Heung-min adds: \u201cFor almost five years we have tried to play from the back, but now we are trying something new. We adapted well, the lads did a really good job. We have to fight for the second ball.\u201d That result catapults Tottenham up to sixth, at least for a couple of hours. West Ham are still stuck in 16th place, currently five points clear of the relegation zone. Should Watford beat Burnley later, though, that\u2019ll just be two. And as good as Spurs were for most of that game - Son and Alli were sensational in the first half - West Ham turned in the sort of performance that usually leads to a relegation scrap. Not a perfect day at the office for Mourinho, as it looked like being midway through the second half, but more than good enough. Onwards and upwards. West Ham by contrast are in all sorts of bother; those late goals don\u2019t mask anything. Manuel Pellegrini is on very thin ice. But it\u2019s too late for West Ham. Spurs have their first away win since January ... though those late West Ham goals mean Jose Mourinho doesn\u2019t look quite as pleased with his team\u2019s performance as he was a little earlier. Antonio, who has been the one plus point for West Ham this afternoon, races along the byline to the left of goal. His low cross-cum-shot pinballs off Alderweireld and Gazzaniga. Half the ground celebrate a goal, but the ball has somehow squirted wide of the bottom left. No matter! From the resulting corner, Ogbonna loses Sanchez and slams a shot into the bottom left! 90 min +4: Kane purchases a cheap free kick from Noble in midfield. That\u2019s the pressure off Spurs, who are closing in on their first away win in the Premier League since January. 90 min +3: Another corner for West Ham. Snodgrass takes. Too long. Rice tries to recycle the ball from the right. Alderweireld clears. 90 min +2: West Ham have enjoyed 82 percent of possession in the last five minutes. Spurs fans better get used to matches ending like this, it\u2019s how Mourinho rolls. 90 min +1: There will be six added minutes. During the first, Snodgrass digs a cross out from a deep position on the left. Haller rises and heads straight at Gazzaniga. 90 min: ... West Ham score! Ogbonna rises highest. The ball\u2019s going wide left, but Rice turns it in by the post. The referee awards the goal ... but VAR snatches it away quickly. Rice was clearly offside, so much so that the home fans didn\u2019t really bother celebrating properly in the first place. 89 min: More good work by Antonio, who battles to win possession. Fredericks scoops a cross from the right. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, from which ... 87 min: However, after giving it some thought, Michael Oliver books Kane and Snodgrass, who, it should be pointed out, are both grown men. 86 min: West Ham refuse to put the ball out of play with Sissoko down injured. Kane has a nibble at Snodgrass, who reacts angrily and throws the Spurs man to the floor. Just for a second, it looks like developing into a bit of rough-house, but everyone calms down quickly enough. 84 min: Spurs are now sitting back. The plan presumably being to keep their shape, and keep hold of what they\u2019ve got. Cresswell crosses from the left, but Sanchez heads powerfully clear with ease. 82 min: Moura knocks Cresswell to the ground, and it\u2019s a free kick out on the left. West Ham load the box. Snodgrass can\u2019t find anyone, though. That\u2019s Moura\u2019s last act of the afternoon, as he\u2019s replaced by Sissoko. 81 min: Moura is bowled over by Sanchez, 25 yards out. Kane takes the free kick and belts it straight at Roberto, who gathers without fuss for once. The home crowd again with the ironic cheers. 79 min: Eriksen comes on for Alli, who takes his sweet time to leave the field of play. Noble gets up in the referee\u2019s grille, pointing out that he should have departed at the nearest point of exit. That may be reflected in the time added on. Or it may not. 77 min: Suddenly West Ham look lively. Noble launches long towards Antonio, who chests down on the edge of the box for Haller. Unfortunately Haller can\u2019t get any purchase on his snapshot, and Tottenham can clear. But this is better from the home side, who have finally turned up, just the 70-odd minutes late. 75 min: Davies injured himself while fouling Antonio back there. He limps off, to be replaced by Rose. Antonio has been West Ham\u2019s one success story this afternoon, putting himself about since coming on, a whirlwind of desire and talent. There\u2019s some pinball in the Spurs box. The ball breaks to him. He slips Alderweireld with a deft shimmy right, then slaps a low shot into the bottom left from the edge of the area! A lovely finish, and there\u2019s life in this match yet. 72 min: That was really brave from Kane, who resisted the temptation to raise his hands to save himself. He took that full in the face, standing firm. He\u2019s good to continue, though. 70 min: Cresswell belts the free kick very hard. It hits poor old Kane flush in his startled coupon. Ooyah, oof, that\u2019s going to hurt a lot. He lies face down in the turf awhile. Selflessly, the Spurs captain has given the put-upon West Ham fans something to cheer. 69 min: Antonio shines for West Ham, dribbling past Davies and Dier, cutting in from the right and drawing a foul from Davies, who had come back for more. A free kick in a dangerous position. 67 min: Aurier nutmegs Snodgrass out on the right wing, and scampers off tittering, like a cartoon character with a bag of sweeties. Snodgrass tilts his head back, scrunches his eyes, and emits a loud AW NO. It\u2019s been that sort of day for West Ham. 66 min: Spurs are strutting around like they own the place. Which, this afternoon, they sort of do. They\u2019re hogging possession, stroking it around in the grand manner. It\u2019s very easy on the eye. Could this day be going any better for Jose Mourinho? 64 min: Diop is put out of his misery, hooked for Carlos Sanchez, whose arrival isn\u2019t met with uniform enthusiasm by the West Ham faithful. 63 min: Now it\u2019s Son\u2019s turn to beat the West Ham offside trap. He scoots down the left and wins a corner. The set piece leads to nothing, but there are more goals in this for Spurs. 61 min: West Ham United force Gazzaniga into a save! Antonio glides in from the right and curls towards the top right. It\u2019s an easy catch for the keeper, who immediately launches long. Diop, who has been awful today, misjudges the flight of the long blooter, and allows Kane to tear clear on goal! To be fair to Diop, he mops up his own mess by powering back and blocking Kane, who dithered uncharacteristically. But still. What a mess. 60 min: Moura dinks a reverse pass down the left, nearly setting Kane clear. Fredericks does well to hook the ball away from danger. 58 min: West Ham have shown very little fight. Fornals tries to inject a bit of energy by bustling down the right, but nobody other than Noble seems particularly interested in joining in. The move peters out. 56 min: Yarmolenko isn\u2019t happy either. He\u2019s been totally anonymous today. But there he is anyway, a face like thunder as he\u2019s yanked for Fornals. 55 min: Cresswell slips a ball down the left in the hope of releasing Antonio, but the striker\u2019s gone too quickly and it\u2019s an easy offside decision for the linesman. The home crowd are restless. 53 min: West Ham are all over the shop. Alli is allowed to trundle down the right, and nearly releases Kane into the area with a deft flick. Diop is on point this time, and intercepts. This particular panic is over, but the Hammers can\u2019t keep on like this, or things could get extremely embarrassing. 51 min: Kane twisted his ankle while landing, but after a grimace and a rub, it looks as though he\u2019ll be fine to continue. Moura\u2019s miss matters not. Aurier is afforded space down the right. He crosses high. Kane rises and plants a downward header past the flapping Roberto. Kane beat a snoozing, dizzy Diop with ease there. 48 min: Antonio has clearly been given a remit to put himself about up front. He battles with Sanchez down the left and wins a free kick. Snodgrass\u2019s delivery is appalling, and Spurs clear easily ... then break at great speed. Moura exchanges passes with Son, and he\u2019s clear in the box. He should score, but drags a miserable effort across the face of goal and out to the left. He might have been trying to play in Alli, tearing down the inside left, caught in two minds. 47 min: Fredericks plays a ball down the right wing to nobody in particular. It dribbles out of play apologetically for a goal kick. Most of the folk in the London Stadium groan in unison, then fall silent. The misery is palpable. 46 min: Aurier slides through the back of Snodgrass in midfield. It should be a booking; it\u2019s not even a foul. There have been some strange decisions in this match. West Ham get the second half underway. Anderson has been hooked; Antonio comes on. Half-time entertainment. A full 45 minutes into the Jose Mourinho era, and a first Premier League away win for Spurs in ten months is on. As for the Manuel Pellegrini era at West Ham ... well, his coat\u2019s on a shoogly peg. His team are booed off. 45 min +2: A corner for Spurs down the right. From which, Sanchez heads towards the top right. It\u2019s going over, but Roberto takes no chances. He tips over the bar. And that\u2019s the end of the half. 45 min: Snodgrass has a speculative dig from distance. It forces Gazzaniga to scramble in a panic towards his left-hand post, but the ball\u2019s always whizzing wide. This is a great goal. Alli, falling backwards on the left touchline, keeps the ball in play by backheeling it towards Son from a prone position. Sensational! Bet his brother can\u2019t do that. Son tears off down the wing, his ankle seemingly fine, and curls a low cross towards the far post, where Lucas races in to slam home. West Ham are a shambles, but Spurs have been very impressive. 41 min: The resulting free kick is swung into the mixer. Roberto comes out to punch, succeeding only in clattering his own man Ogbonna. The ball drops to Alli, who hooks goalwards. Roberto sort of claws it away, just, but as the ball bounces around, the play\u2019s stopped and he gets away with it. Roberto should be soundtracked by this at all times: 40 min: Fredericks slides in late on Son, who was preparing to make off down the left. He studs Son on his planted ankle, and is booked. That really should have been a red card. It\u2019s checked by VAR, too, but the decision stands. A really sore one, and Son takes a while to recover. 38 min: Roberto offered no resistance to Son\u2019s shot, though take nothing away from the crispness of the finish. Son is such a fine player. Spurs come at West Ham again, Alli whipping a shot inches wide of the bottom left. Diop is stripped with embarrassing ease by Alli, out on the left. He feeds Kane, who is blocked by Rice. But Spurs come straight back at West Ham. Alli slides a pass down the inside left to release Son, who shimmies and shakes to confuse Diop, then whips a shot across Roberto, who might as well not be there, and into the bottom right. On the touchline, Jose punches the air. It\u2019s on! 34 min: A warm round of applause for West Ham season-ticket holder Lily Harris, who passed away recently. 33 min: Kane and Alli combine cutely in limited space down the inside-left channel, releasing Son into the box. Son is shaping to thread the ball into the bottom right when Rice slides in. A magnificent saving tackle, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. Spurs are knocking at the door. 32 min: Space for Son down the left. He earns a corner off Diop. One Winks corner leads to another. And another. Roberto punches the third to the feet of Alderweireld, who swivels to shoot but can\u2019t get anything meaningful away. West Ham finally clear their lines. 30 min: Spurs stroke it around the middle of the park awhile, subduing the crowd. At least Roberto\u2019s out of harm\u2019s way. 28 min: Kane drops deep to quarterback, nearly releasing Moura on goal with a long rake. Roberto comes to the edge of his box to claim, and is rewarded with ironic cheers from his own fans. Memories of Allen McKnightmare come flooding back. 26 min: Noble flicks a gorgeous first-time pass down the left wing, with the outside of his right foot, towards Anderson. What a spot! Anderson scampers down the wing and slips a pass inside for Haller. But it\u2019s a poor pass, just behind the striker, and the move breaks down. For a second there, West Ham were three on two, and Spurs were in a world of trouble. Full marks to Noble for both vision and execution. 24 min: Kane gets pelters from the crowd for needlessly shoving Fredericks to the ground, as the defender was ushering the ball out of play for a goal kick. He\u2019s lucky not to go in the book for that brazen nonsense. His manager will be pleased with the way he\u2019s putting himself about, though. 22 min: Anderson makes good ground down the left, but Aurier does well to stick to his task, and the winger runs out of space. A nice, breezy, open game, this, if not yet drama-packed. 20 min: Son is a sensational player, like that\u2019s breaking news. He conjures space out of nothing, just to the left of the D, and snaps a curler towards the top right. It\u2019s going in, and, fair\u2019s fair, the oft-hapless Roberto does well to punch it away from danger. 18 min: Yarmolenko curls a ball into the Spurs box from the right. Snodgrass prepares to head goalwards only to be nudged in the back by Aurier as he rises. Snodgrass falls over and demands a penalty. He\u2019s not getting it. You\u2019ve seen them given, though it would have been very soft. Even so, Aurier\u2019s challenge was clumsy; a little more force and the referee might have been minded to point to the spot. The man\u2019s an accident waiting to happen. 16 min: The game goes a little bit scrappy. On the bench, the all-new PR-friendly Mourinho makes a few notes, quietly and calmly. This can\u2019t last. It won\u2019t last. 14 min: More space for Fredericks down the right. He overruns the ball, which goes out for a goal kick before he can cross. Gazzaniga takes the goal kick ... and blooters it upfield. No playing out from the back for Mourinho, one senses. 12 min: An absurd decision by Michael Oliver, who books Diop after a battle with Kane out on the Spurs left. Kane had dragged Diop to the ground, the defender falling on the ball as he\u2019s fouled. But Spurs get the decision, and Diop is carded for handling the ball! Plenty of boos for that egregious double insult, and no wonder. The resulting free kick\u2019s swung in. Roberto flaps, misses an easy catch, and Sanchez heads wide right. The flag goes up for offside, but dear me, what dismal goalkeeping. 10 min: Spurs come straight back at the Hammers, Aurier making good ground down the right and cutting back ... to nobody in particular. Cresswell is able to scoop clear. This doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to be a goalless draw. 8 min: West Ham finally get their gamefaces on. Fredericks gets a bit of space down the right and crosses. Haller battles with Aurier and Sanchez for a header, six yards out. The defenders combine to win, and Gazzaniga claims. But that\u2019s much better from the home side. 6 min: Spurs have clearly been working on something in training. Again Alli slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Kane; once again he\u2019s just offside, as he rolls the ball across the face of goal, inviting a tap-in that never comes. Spurs have enjoyed nearly 80 percent possession so far. West Ham have hardly had a kick. 5 min: That disallowed goal momentarily sucked the life out of the stadium. The home fans are making noise again now, but not quite as much as they had been. Spurs have done a good job of quietening them down, dominating these early exchanges. 3 min: Alli, dropping deep on the left, slips a pass down the channel and releases Kane, who lashes a first-time shot into the top left! What a glorious finish. Sadly for Spurs and Mourinho, they\u2019re denied a perfect start, because Kane had gone way too early and was clearly offside. The flag goes up accordingly. 2 min: Spurs keep hold of the ball in the sterile style. Then it\u2019s shuttled down the left for Son, who twists and turns dangerously but can\u2019t quite get the better of Fredericks. The derby atmosphere continues to bubble away. Spurs get the ball rolling. Mourinho is back, then. And he\u2019ll be coming into contact with VAR in the Premier League for the very first time. It\u2019s made for solid-gold entertainment, this. The teams are out! The denizens of the London Stadium wish with all their heart they were back at the Boleyn welcome the two sides ahead of this huge London derby. Pretty bubbles in the air. West Ham sport their current claret-and-blue seventies pastiche, while Tottenham are in their favoured lilywhite. Both kits very easy on the eye. Mourinho made his presence felt in the tunnel, incidentally, still beaming, slapping the back of every player on both teams. A masterclass in passive aggression. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! contentment n. (k\u0259n\u02c8tent.m\u0259nt) a feeling of happiness or satisfaction. A slightly downbeat Manuel Pellegrini speaks. \u201cWe have to concentrate in our defending. The games we have lost at home, against Newcastle and Crystal Palace, and the draw against Sheffield United, we have conceded six goals and five of those from set pieces. We must concentrate on those sort of balls, and we must play well because we are playing a big team with good players. Fortunately for us, we have Michail Antonio ready. Maybe not to play the whole game, but some minutes.\u201d An extremely laid-back Jose gives his first pre-match interview as Spurs boss. \u201cSometimes people think when results are not good that it is something related to motivation, but that is not the case,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cThey are good professionals and they tried their best. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do. Tactically, of course there are not big changes. Just little, important things that we think can help them to get our objectives. The match today is very important, but our future is also very important. So I need to understand what is in Christian Eriksen\u2019s mind and heart, and we have to make the right decision for the club. But on top of that, I believe Lucas, Son, Alli and Kane are players with a good understanding. We are going to try to find, in the little time I have had to work, some dynamic to hurt the opposition. Let\u2019s see if we can do it. I like the ideas but I like to work the ideas. And today was more about ideas than working the ideas. So let\u2019s see if we can find happiness.\u201d Some typically enigmatic flourishes at the end, there. Mourinho at his gnomic best. He\u2019s back, baby. West Ham United make two changes to the side gubbed 3-0 at Burnley before the international break. Angelo Ogbonna comes in for Fabian Balbuena, while Andriy Yarmolenko replaces Pablo Fornals. Captain Mark Noble has passed a fitness test and is good to go. The much-maligned Roberto keeps his place in between the sticks. There are three differences between Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s last Spurs team and Jose Mourinho\u2019s first. Moussa Sissoko, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso are out of the XI named for the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United. Ndombele is injured, while the other two are benched. In come Toby Alderweireld, Harry Winks and Lucas Moura. Christian Eriksen is on the bench. West Ham United: Roberto, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Rice, Yarmolenko, Noble, Snodgrass, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Sanchez, Fornals, Martin, Ajeti, Antonio. Jose Mourinho\u2019s first Tottenham Hotspur selection: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies, Dier, Winks, Lucas Moura, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Rose, Walker-Peters, Sissoko, Lo Celso, Foyth, Eriksen, Austin. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Mourinho is in the building. Looking very relaxed, as well. He\u2019s even been high-fiving some young West Ham supporting kids. London Jose seems about ten years younger than Lowry Jose. When Jos\u00e9 met Dele he delved back into his old box of motivational tools \u2026 Well this doesn\u2019t need much building up, does it? And there we were, thinking Manchester City versus Chelsea was nailed on as the biggest event of the day. Yes, it\u2019s the long-awaited / dreaded (delete as you see fit) return of Jose Mourinho. The former Chelsea manager has pitched up on the north side of town, to see if he can bring Tottenham Hotspur the shiny silver success that proved tantalisingly out of poor old Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s reach. You know Mourinho\u2019s USP: trophies are guaranteed. Here we go, then! But let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Mourinho\u2019s first job is to rebuild stuttering Spurs\u2019 confidence, and get them back up the Premier League. He couldn\u2019t have picked a much better fixture to start with. Spurs have emerged victorious from their last three visits to the London Stadium, and today they\u2019ll face a West Ham team in abject form: five losses and two draws from their last seven games. Jose will fancy this one. On the other hand, Spurs aren\u2019t in the greatest nick themselves. Hence poor Pochettino\u2019s sacking. They\u2019ve only won five games all season, and two of those were against a risible Red Star Belgrade rabble. Infamously, Tottenham haven\u2019t won on the road in the Premier League since January. And the Hammers are desperate to rise up the division themselves, and will take succour from the tail end of last season, when they became the first team to defeat Spurs in their sparkling new stadium. So a no-holds-barred London derby awaits. It didn\u2019t need the extra spice that Mourinho will bring. But baby it\u2019s got it. This should be a whole world of fun. The Premier League is back after the international break ... and it\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

Addressing the Bar Council\u2019s annual conference in central London, the UK\u2019s most senior judge predicted that previous estimates by male counterparts would soon be proved wrong. Hale, 74, who steps down from her post in January, has been a pioneer of, and enthusiastic advocate for, greater diversity on the bench. The rate of improvement towards gender parity within the judiciary has been a point of fierce contention.

The Labour leader revealed during a Question Time leaders\u2019 special on Friday that he would not back either side, putting him at odds with senior party figures including John McDonnell, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, who have all said they would back remain.

Yellow weather warnings are in force across the country after showers in the south-west overnight, which will move north towards Scotland throughout the day. In the east Midlands and north-east, the Met Office is warning that flooding is likely until midnight as local communities continue the clean-up from the deluge earlier this month. Nine flood warnings are in place throughout England, predominantly in the south-west and north-east, alongside 85 less severe flood alerts. However, Wales, central and south-eastern England will escape the worst of the torrential rain. The wet weather is expected to subside for most of the UK on Sunday but two yellow weather warnings are in place for the east and north of Scotland until 9am tomorrow. Greg Dewhurst, a Met Office forecaster, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unsettled start to the weekend, and a very cloudy day today, with heavy rain pushing its way north throughout the day. \u201cSome places could see 40mm to 50 mm of rain.

The Environment Agency has advised people in areas at risk of flooding to turn off the gas, water and electricity in their property, move possessions upstairs and ensure that residents, pets and any vehicles are moved to safety. In Devon and Cornwall, firefighters warned drivers to stay away from flooded roads after a number of calls overnight to stranded cars. The army was called in earlier this month to assist stricken communities after towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield and parts of the Midlands were left devastated by heavy downpours. Doncaster council said 970 homes and businesses in the town were affected by the rain between 7 and 15 November. Met Office data up to 17 November show that Nottinghamshire has had 189% of its monthly average rainfall already, the highest proportion of any UK county.",

Behind Richard Dawson, pink with sweat, shimmers a backdrop of gold foil lam\u00e9. His new drummer and a bassist in a trucker cap look like they have wandered in from two different bands. Such incongruous details would not feel out of place in the lyrics of a Richard Dawson song. The 38-year-old singer-songwriter might deliver the information in a quavery Newcastle falsetto \u2013 alluding, elliptically, to the gentrification of Hackney, to the Memorable Order of Tin Hats (the Moths), the ex-servicemen who once drank here, while praising the amazing value of the craft beer on tap. Dawson\u2019s emotions would cast no obvious shadow until, suddenly, his guitar-playing might turn ugly and he might yell the words \u201cIronic! Gold! Glitter!\u201d as the drums beat mercilessly along. Everyday incongruities, especially those that speak volumes, form the basis of Dawson\u2019s latest, 2020, his sixth solo album. Released last month, it found him spinning tales of modern Britain from skeins of detail. His are uneasy songs for uneasy times, and 2020 has been likened to a Ken Loach film, voicing horror at the sort of thing we now regard as routine \u2013 exploitative working conditions, the dismantling of the welfare state, flooding \u2013 but from the perspective of ordinary people just bumbling along. The ground unexpectedly opens up underneath them as they discover a heart emoji on a text, or find their neighbours cleaning their mud-logged pub garden. On Civil Servant, tonight\u2019s first song, a despairing benefits assessor is forced to deny help to the public he believed he was serving. (Dawson, who has a degenerative eye condition, fell foul of the change from disability living allowance to personal independence payments and had to lodge appeal after appeal to get them reinstated.) The civil servant fantasises about braining a nasty colleague with the nearest blunt instrument \u2013 a Sellotape dispenser. \u201cThe swipe of the fob, the fob, the fob,\u201d is just one more dehumanising aspect of coming in to do \u201cthis dirty work\u201d.

Naturally, Dawson\u2019s entire set begins with a pummelling math-rock intro, a tactic designed, you suspect, to sort out the musically lily-livered from those who will follow him over the top. If you might imagine Guy Garvey of Elbow to be the Beyonc\u00e9 of compassionate northern witness-bearing, then Dawson is the Solange: tricksier, more oblique. Although Dawson is notionally a kind of folk singer, his DNA spans the gap between Faith No More, a fussy metal band, and Field Music, another difficult outfit from the north-east whose jarring time signatures declare their disdain for grooves and easy harmonies.

The couple got covered in itchy insulation material, she later told reporters, so they both took their tops off. At that point her three stepchildren (a 13-year-old boy, a 10-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy) walked in. The kids were mortified; Buchanan told them not to be. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sexual thing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/09/30/this-utah-woman-was/\">she remembers saying</a>. \u201cI should be able to wear exactly what my husband wears. You shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about this.\u201d</p> <p>The kids\u2019 birth mother didn\u2019t take quite such a blas\u00e9 view of the incident and complained to authorities. Criminal charges were filed against Buchanan. Under <a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter9/76-9-S702.5.html\">Utah law</a> a woman is guilty of lewdness involving a child if she exposes the part of her breast \u201cbelow the top of the areola\u201d in public or \u201cin a private place under circumstances the person should know will likely cause affront or alarm\u201d. If convicted she faces jail time and may have to register as a sex offender for 10 years, alongside rapists and pedophiles. The judge is expected to rule on the case in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/21/781703956/utah-woman-charged-with-lewdness-after-being-topless-in-her-own-home\">next few months</a>.</p> <p>The idea that being topless in your own home might land you in jail is outrageous and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah has intervened in Buchanan\u2019s case. Earlier this week, they asked a judge not just to dismiss the case but to change the state\u2019s lewdness law which, they argue, is unconstitutional and discriminates against women.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s part of [this law] that says this part of a woman is found inherently obscene and this part of a man isn\u2019t,\u201d an ACLU attorney told reporters outside court on Tuesday. \u201cThat really sets up an unequal and unfair dichotomy.\u201d</p> <p>It should be noted, by the way, some of the key facts of this case are in dispute. Buchanan says she was topless in the garage when the kids came in. The prosecution alleges she stripped in front of her stepchildren after stating that if it was OK for her husband to take his top off she should be able to do the same. It\u2019s perfectly possible that Buchanan may have exercised poor judgment; it\u2019s perfectly possible she isn\u2019t entirely blameless in all this. But that doesn\u2019t detract from the wider point: women\u2019s chests are sexualized and policed while men\u2019s chests aren\u2019t. This hasn\u2019t always been the case \u2013 it wasn\u2019t legal for men to be topless in public in New York until the 1930s.</p> <p>There\u2019s been a growing global movement to \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_the_Nipple_(campaign)\">Free the Nipple\u201d</a> and get society, social media and the law to treat men and women\u2019s chests equally.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for The week in patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Welcome to America: where nipples are more regulated than guns It started with DIY and ended with criminal charges. A couple of years ago Tilli Buchanan and her husband were installing drywall in their Utah garage. The couple got covered in itchy insulation material, she later told reporters, so they both took their tops off. At that point her three stepchildren (a 13-year-old boy, a 10-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy) walked in. The kids were mortified; Buchanan told them not to be. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sexual thing,\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cI should be able to wear exactly what my husband wears. You shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about this.\u201d The kids\u2019 birth mother didn\u2019t take quite such a blas\u00e9 view of the incident and complained to authorities. Criminal charges were filed against Buchanan. Under Utah law a woman is guilty of lewdness involving a child if she exposes the part of her breast \u201cbelow the top of the areola\u201d in public or \u201cin a private place under circumstances the person should know will likely cause affront or alarm\u201d. If convicted she faces jail time and may have to register as a sex offender for 10 years, alongside rapists and pedophiles. The judge is expected to rule on the case in the next few months. The idea that being topless in your own home might land you in jail is outrageous and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah has intervened in Buchanan\u2019s case. Earlier this week, they asked a judge not just to dismiss the case but to change the state\u2019s lewdness law which, they argue, is unconstitutional and discriminates against women. \u201cThere\u2019s part of [this law] that says this part of a woman is found inherently obscene and this part of a man isn\u2019t,\u201d an ACLU attorney told reporters outside court on Tuesday. \u201cThat really sets up an unequal and unfair dichotomy.\u201d It should be noted, by the way, some of the key facts of this case are in dispute. Buchanan says she was topless in the garage when the kids came in. The prosecution alleges she stripped in front of her stepchildren after stating that if it was OK for her husband to take his top off she should be able to do the same. It\u2019s perfectly possible that Buchanan may have exercised poor judgment; it\u2019s perfectly possible she isn\u2019t entirely blameless in all this. But that doesn\u2019t detract from the wider point: women\u2019s chests are sexualized and policed while men\u2019s chests aren\u2019t. This hasn\u2019t always been the case \u2013 it wasn\u2019t legal for men to be topless in public in New York until the 1930s. There\u2019s been a growing global movement to \u201cFree the Nipple\u201d and get society, social media and the law to treat men and women\u2019s chests equally. The movement has clocked up several victories; six states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas or Oklahoma) recently got rid of their bans on women being topless in public. The movement is bigger than breasts: it\u2019s about treating female bodies like human bodies, not sex objects. It\u2019s about bodily autonomy.

Outrage over all-male panel on feminism in Pakistan The Arts Council of Pakistan thought it would be an awesome idea if they convened an all-male panel to give the \u201cother perspective\u201d on feminism. Outrage ensued and the all-male panel has now been transformed into a mostly male panel. 137 women killed by their partners in France this year France has one of the highest femicide rates in Europe and there is a growing public outcry over the problem. \u201cI think French society is deeply sexist and it\u2019s difficult to make it evolve,\u201d the country\u2019s gender equality minister told CNN. \u201cWith the government, I\u2019m trying to win a cultural battle against sexism and misogyny, but it\u2019s true that it\u2019s very hard.\u201d Majority of murdered Irish women killed by male partners Eight-seven per cent of Irish women killed between 1996 and 2019 know their killer, according to a new report by Women\u2019s Aid.

      "body": "<p>Rose Hudson-Wilkin was just a baby in Montego Bay, Jamaica, when her mother left for the UK as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants seeking work. She didn\u2019t see her again until she was nine years old.</p> <p>\u201cSo many of my generation\u2019s parents left their little ones behind. I didn\u2019t know anything different,\u201d says Hudson-Wilkin. \u201cAs I got older, I learned that I had a mother in the UK, and then I eventually met her. It was a big moment. I remember standing beside her thinking, \u2018Oh, this is my mother, she\u2019s so pretty\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Last Tuesday, Hudson-Wilkin\u2019s mother, now in her 80s, was among hundreds at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to see her daughter smash a glass ceiling when she was consecrated as the Church of England\u2019s first black woman bishop.

Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful, as I minister among them, if any pre-judged thoughts people have were just to fall away?\u201d</p> <p>Referring to her appointment, she \u201clongs for the day when we stop having firsts. When we stop having firsts, then we will know it\u2019s normal.

And I was lucky to have been born and brought up in Montego Bay, because there I had all those wonderful, amazing images of people like myself in all walks of life. So it was very natural for me.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson-Wilkin has been outspoken about the poor representation of black and minority ethnic people in leadership positions in the church, accusing it of institutional racism. She is one of four minority ethnic bishops out of more than 120. The most senior, John Sentamu, archbishop of York, is retiring next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a176a7aeabf90c112787be94bc46eda822080de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a176a7aeabf90c112787be94bc46eda822080de/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hudson-Wilkin with Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson at the state opening of parliament in October\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hudson-Wilkin with Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson at the state opening of parliament in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, she says: \u201cThe church is engaging [with the issue], and wants to change, and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s always too slow, and those of us who are in a minority will always want to see change happening much faster.\u201d Institutional racism still exists in the C of E, she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not just a church thing. When you look across society, at any big organisation, you have to ask where are the minority ethnic people in leadership roles. I want little children to see images of themselves in leadership across society.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside her parish work, Hudson-Wilkin has spent the past nine years as chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the past 11 years as a chaplain to the Queen. In her time in parliament, she had been shocked \u2013 \u201clike many others\u201d \u2013 at the tone of political discourse.</p> <p>\u201cI was always saying to people, lots of different people, you\u2019ve got to rein this back. As their pastor, I would not criticise [MPs] in an open forum, in a public space. I\u2019d get alongside them and say what I needed to say. But did I have difficult conversations? Oh yes.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if she is relieved to have left the parliamentary bear-pit, she says: \u201cI would not use the word \u2018relief\u2019. I\u2019ve always loved the people that I\u2019ve been called to serve. In parliament, it wasn\u2019t just members of both houses but also the staff \u2013 the security team, cleaners, the people who work in the canteen, the workmen. You do not just abruptly stop loving people. So though I\u2019m no longer in that role, I still carry them all in my heart and will continue to pray for them.\u201d</p> <p>She enjoyed the pomp of grand parliamentary and royal occasions, but \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to see people as human beings. So they\u2019re human beings first, and then they\u2019re prime ministers or leaders of the opposition second. And that keeps me grounded. Even though I may enjoy the state opening of parliament, it\u2019s no more or less of an enjoyment when I\u2019m standing with someone in the canteen, or a cleaner, or someone from security.\u201d</p> <p>Her last weeks at Westminster were marred by the publication of internal emails in which she raised concerns about homeless people in a subway near parliament, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/chaplains-complaints-of-stench-created-by-homeless-arose-from-concern\" title=\"\">\u201congoing stench due to it being used as a urinal\u201d</a>. She says: \u201cI was very disappointed in the way the story was presented. Anyone who regularly used [the underpass] would know what I was saying. And anyone who knows me knows that I am particularly empathetic when it comes to those that are most vulnerable in society.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo homeless person should have to live in those conditions in modern society. In the fifth-richest nation, we have to ask ourselves why are we allowing people live in that condition. I think the focus should be on holding those in authority to account.\u201d</p> <p>In her new role she wants to encourage the Christian faith to be more outward-facing. \u201cIt should not be something we do occasionally or on Sundays; it\u2019s a way of life, it\u2019s part and parcel of who we are. And I want to encourage people of faith to ensure their faith is alive.\u201d</p> <p>That comes, she says, from her Jamaican childhood. \u201cMine was more than a churchgoing family. People didn\u2019t just go to church, it was part of our language, part of our behaviour, it connected with everything.</p> <p>\u201cI learned my theology in the home and in the community. There, I heard ordinary people speaking about God doing wonderful things. Even though they had difficulties and challenges to face, they were not letting go of God. That spoke volumes to me.\u201d</p> <h2>Her life story</h2> <p><strong>1961</strong> Born in Montego Bay, Jamaica.</p> <p><strong>1982</strong> Trained at the Church Army college in the UK.

It\u2019s always too slow, and those of us who are in a minority will always want to see change happening much faster.\u201d Institutional racism still exists in the C of E, she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not just a church thing. When you look across society, at any big organisation, you have to ask where are the minority ethnic people in leadership roles. I want little children to see images of themselves in leadership across society.\u201d Alongside her parish work, Hudson-Wilkin has spent the past nine years as chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the past 11 years as a chaplain to the Queen. In her time in parliament, she had been shocked \u2013 \u201clike many others\u201d \u2013 at the tone of political discourse. \u201cI was always saying to people, lots of different people, you\u2019ve got to rein this back. As their pastor, I would not criticise [MPs] in an open forum, in a public space. I\u2019d get alongside them and say what I needed to say. But did I have difficult conversations? Oh yes.\u201d Asked if she is relieved to have left the parliamentary bear-pit, she says: \u201cI would not use the word \u2018relief\u2019. I\u2019ve always loved the people that I\u2019ve been called to serve. In parliament, it wasn\u2019t just members of both houses but also the staff \u2013 the security team, cleaners, the people who work in the canteen, the workmen. You do not just abruptly stop loving people. So though I\u2019m no longer in that role, I still carry them all in my heart and will continue to pray for them.\u201d She enjoyed the pomp of grand parliamentary and royal occasions, but \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to see people as human beings. So they\u2019re human beings first, and then they\u2019re prime ministers or leaders of the opposition second. And that keeps me grounded. Even though I may enjoy the state opening of parliament, it\u2019s no more or less of an enjoyment when I\u2019m standing with someone in the canteen, or a cleaner, or someone from security.\u201d Her last weeks at Westminster were marred by the publication of internal emails in which she raised concerns about homeless people in a subway near parliament, referring to the \u201congoing stench due to it being used as a urinal\u201d. She says: \u201cI was very disappointed in the way the story was presented. Anyone who regularly used [the underpass] would know what I was saying. And anyone who knows me knows that I am particularly empathetic when it comes to those that are most vulnerable in society.\u201d \u201cNo homeless person should have to live in those conditions in modern society. In the fifth-richest nation, we have to ask ourselves why are we allowing people live in that condition. I think the focus should be on holding those in authority to account.\u201d In her new role she wants to encourage the Christian faith to be more outward-facing. \u201cIt should not be something we do occasionally or on Sundays; it\u2019s a way of life, it\u2019s part and parcel of who we are. And I want to encourage people of faith to ensure their faith is alive.\u201d That comes, she says, from her Jamaican childhood. \u201cMine was more than a churchgoing family. People didn\u2019t just go to church, it was part of our language, part of our behaviour, it connected with everything. \u201cI learned my theology in the home and in the community. There, I heard ordinary people speaking about God doing wonderful things. Even though they had difficulties and challenges to face, they were not letting go of God. That spoke volumes to me.\u201d Her life story 1961 Born in Montego Bay, Jamaica. 1982 Trained at the Church Army college in the UK. Met her husband, Ken. The couple have three children. 1994 Ordained in the C of E, the first year it allowed women priests. 1998 Became vicar in east London. 2008 Made a chaplain to the Queen. 2019 Consecrated as the C of E\u2019s first black female bishop.",

When we met for breakfast last month he was looking despondent.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone takes selfies these days,\u201d he said sadly, picking at his scrambled eggs. \u201cIt\u2019s never autographs any more. They just want photos of themselves with celebrities.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who has attended a red carpet event or watched one on TV, knows that selfies have firmly supplanted autographs, with fans lurching desperately towards celebrities with outstretched phones instead of pens and paper. Celebrities have adapted accordingly. In 2017, a video of Liam Payne went viral that showed him miserably working his way down a line of selfie-takers, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/tvshowbiz/video-1580244/Liam-Payne-doesnt-look-happy-taking-selfies-fans.html\" title=\"\">his smile lasting as long as it took for each fan to press click</a>.</p> <p>A photo of oneself with, say, Tom Cruise, feels more personal than a mere scribbled signature, which he could have given anyone (and could have been signed by anyone).

If you stand next to a celebrity and your friends don\u2019t like the photo, did it ever happen? Do you even exist?</p> <p>Instagram launched in 2010, four years after Twitter, six years after Facebook. Although social media was originally pitched as a way for people to keep in touch with their friends, it quickly also became a way for people to feel greater proximity to celebrities, and to flaunt this closeness to others. Facebook, with characteristic hamfistedness, attempted to monetise this in 2013, when it announced it was trialling a feature that would allow users to pay to contact celebrities for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/08/facebook-charging-users-celebrities\" title=\"\">a sliding scale of fees</a>: 71p for Jeremy Hunt, \u00a310.68 for Tom Daley. But there was no need for people to spend money for the privilege, because celebrities had already proven extremely keen to bend down low and share their lives with the peasants. When Demi Moore appeared on David Letterman in 2010, she was already so addicted to Twitter she continued to tweet while live on air to millions. (\u201cThis stinks,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0cjCDbxmQ\" title=\"\">Letterman griped</a>.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2014, Kanye said he and Kim spent four days of their honeymoon perfecting the filters on their wedding photo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The appeal of social media for a celebrity is obvious, in that it allows them to talk to the public without those awful middlemen: journalists. The past decade is littered with examples of why celebrities (and their publicists) now prefer social media (which they can control) to giving interviews (which they cannot.) It\u2019s unlikely that Michael Douglas would have tweeted that his throat cancer was caused by cunnilingus, as he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/02/michael-douglas-liberace-cancer-cunnilingus\" title=\"\">the Guardian\u2019s Xan Brooks in 2013</a> (and for which he later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/29/michael-douglas-i-was-sorry-for-effect-of-oral-sex-cancer-comments-on-my-wife\" title=\"\">publicly apologised</a> to his wife, Catherine Zeta Jones). It\u2019s even less likely that Liam Neeson would have made an Instagram story about the time he went out hoping to kill a \u201cblack bastard\u201d after a friend was raped, as he said<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/liam-neeson-rape-black-man-attack-cosh-cold-pursuit-sexual-assault-interview-a8760866.html\" title=\"\"> in an interview</a> this year. Why risk such disasters when, instead, you can just take a flattering photo, slap a filter on it and post it to your already adoring followers? Mega celebrities with a hyper-online fanbase \u2013 Justin Bieber, Beyonc\u00e9, Frank Ocean \u2013 can now go for years without giving an interview and their careers are helped rather than harmed for it.</p> <p>Instagram is an airbrushing app, one that lets people touch up their photos, specifically, and their lives, generally, by deciding what they choose to post. (When Jennifer Aniston finally joined social media last month, and momentarily broke the internet, she naturally chose Instagram over the bearpit of Twitter.) Some are more honest about this than others: after he married Kim Kardashian \u2013 the celebrity who more than any other has made a virtue out of artifice \u2013 Kanye West proudly told reporters in 2014 that the two of them spent four days of their honeymoon in Florence playing with the filters on the wedding photo, that they eventually<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lostinshowbiz/2014/jun/19/kanye-west-annie-leibovitz-kim-kardashian-wedding-photo.]\" title=\"\"> posted on Instagram</a>, \u201cbecause the flowers were off-colour and stuff like that\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62353bf2cee9f8c889e82dac7a245655ea824599\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62353bf2cee9f8c889e82dac7a245655ea824599/0_208_2798_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Ocean at the opening of Camp: Notes on Fashion, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, USA, 6 May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Ocean: a mega celebrity with a hyper-online fanbase. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You wonder what they\u2019d do with all that time if the internet didn\u2019t exist \u2013 cure cancer, perhaps? Musician John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen have established a new kind of fame for themselves with their regular social media posts: with Teigen complaining about Donald Trump on Twitter; both of them posting photos of their perfect family on Instagram. Teigen is considered more \u201creal\u201d than her friend Kardashian because she is funny and doesn\u2019t take money to advertise dodgy weight-loss supplements. But their photos are as idealised and managed as any Hello! shoot. The reason Teigen \u2013 a heretofore relatively little known model \u2013 has over 26 million followers on Instagram is because she hits that social media sweet spot, which is to be (to use two of the more grating buzzwords of the decade) aspirational and authentic.</p> <p>At the beginning of this decade, it was the aspirational side of the equation that was deemed more important \u2013 leading to the rise of a new kind of celebrity: the influencers. This bewildering group of people suggest their lives are so perfect that, by showing us photos of how they eat, dress, parent, travel, decorate, exercise, put on makeup and even cure themselves of illness, they will influence us to do the same. For the successful, the money was suddenly limitless, as brands realised that the public trusted influencers more than adverts, and so threw money at them to endorse their products; Kylie Jenner, a makeup influencer, currently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/31/kylie-jenner-makes-1-million-per-paid-instagram-post-hopper-hq-says.html]\" title=\"\">makes $1m per sponsored post</a>. This was always a delicate bubble and it finally began to burst last year, when the Advertising Standards Authority decreed that influencers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/16/social-media-stars-face-crackdown-over-money-from-brands\" title=\"\">need to spell it out</a> when they\u2019re being paid to promote something. Writing \u201cADVERT\u201d beneath that perfect photo of you chugging some Smart Water next to a waterfall doesn\u2019t really boost one\u2019s authenticity.</p> <p>Even more problematic were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\" title=\"\">Fyre Festival debacle</a> and the fall of YouTube stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/10/logan-paul-youtube-removed-premium-channel\" title=\"\">Logan Paul</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/25/pewdiepie-surpasses-100m-subscribers-youtube\" title=\"\">PewDiePie</a>, scandals that eroded the relationship between online celebrities and their followers. It turns out influencers weren\u2019t more trustworthy than adverts; in fact, in the unregulated world of the web, they were markedly less so.</p> <p>An older demographic has sneered at influencers, as they did with the previous decade\u2019s reality TV stars, suggesting they are not \u201creal\u201d celebrities. This is an absurd complaint, given that some influencers have more followers than traditional movie stars do. Yet influencers atomise audiences in a way traditional celebrities don\u2019t: even if you have never bought Vogue, you\u2019ll know who Cindy Crawford is; unless you follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chiaraferragni/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Chiara Ferragni</a> on social media you will likely have no idea who she is \u2013 and yet the fashion influencer has four times as many followers as Crawford.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cher has really come into her own on Twitter, gleefully sharing emoji-heavy thoughts on Trump and politics in general</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ironically, the rise of the influencer began with a very old-school celebrity, one who is frequently accused of being the embodiment of the worst kind of elitist privilege: Gwyneth Paltrow. When Paltrow launched her wellness website, Goop, in 2008, few would have predicted it would reshape both Paltrow\u2019s career and cultural notions of what constitutes an aspirational lifestyle. Paltrow helped usher out the 2000s trend for bling and Cristal, swapping them for yoga clothes and gluten-free kale crisps, making discreet asceticism the ultimate A-lister look. Which is more authentic is debatable, but the biggest swap Paltrow made was personal: she went from being an Academy Award-winning actor to online influencer. And, given that her company is now estimated to be worth $250m, she probably made the more lucrative choice.</p> <p>Happily, not everyone uses social media to hawk fantasy images of themselves. Occasional glimpses of reality peek through, to everyone\u2019s delight, and by \u201creality\u201d I mean \u201cfeuds\u201d. We\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-and-taylor-swift-feud-timeline\" title=\"\">Katy Perry and Taylor Swift\u2019s long-running snarky subtweets aimed at one another</a>. There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/feb/15/carrie-samantha-sex-and-the-city-3-sarah-jessica-parker-kim-cattrall\" title=\"\">Kim Cattrall\u2019s explicit swipes at Sarah Jessica Parker on Instagram</a>. After her brother died, she wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven\u2019t already.) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I\u2019m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your \u2018nice girl\u2019 persona.\u201d Most recently, Coleen Rooney accused \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-leaking-stories-sun\" title=\"\">Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account</a>\u201d of selling stories about her to the tabloids. One can only feel deep pangs of regret that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford died before either had access to an iPhone.</p> <p>As much as young celebrities tout the importance of authenticity, those who come across as most genuine tend to be the older ones \u2013 perhaps because they are less internet savvy, or, more likely, have fewer media managers. Bette Midler and, in particular, Cher have really come into their own on Twitter, gleefully sharing their often emoji-heavy thoughts on Trump and politics in general. (\u201cWhat do you think of Boris Johnson?\u201d one tweeter asked Cher. \u201cF-ing idiot who lied to the British ppl,\u201d the goddess replied, rightly.) And while Instagram may be best known for hyper-stylised photos of, say, Beyonc\u00e9 holding her newborn twins, the most purely enjoyable celebrity accounts belong to Glenn Close \u2013 she posts candid videos of herself and her dogs, always liked by Michael Douglas \u2013 and Diane Keaton, who posts decidedly unstylised photos of herself. \u201cYES, I AM WEARING [TROUSERS] UNDER A SKIRT\u201d is a typical all-caps caption. Ever wanted to know what Annie Hall would be like online? Now you know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c23d13ff19de9ce313275051e739fddc31bcc3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c23d13ff19de9ce313275051e739fddc31bcc3d/0_0_3500_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Sarah Jessica Parker arrives for the premiere of the film \u201cSex And The City 2\u201d in New York May 24, 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Jessica Parker, target of Instagram swipes from fellow Sex And The City star Kim Cattrall. Photograph: Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, the downside to being able to reach one\u2019s public directly is that the public can reach back. Stars from Stephen Fry to Nicki Minaj have publicly left social media sites after the audience proved a little less admiring than they hoped. \u201cStan\u201d \u2013 or obsessive fan \u2013 culture has blossomed. Sometimes this has been to the celebrity\u2019s benefit: Lady Gaga\u2019s fan squad, the Little Monsters, amped up her Oscar campaign for A Star Is Born. But if stans feel they have been let down by the object of their obsession, they will viciously bully the (usually female) star, as Katy Perry and Demi Lovato <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/04/they-just-wanted-to-silence-her-the-dark-side-of-gay-stan-culture\" title=\"\">have experienced</a>. As a result, many celebrities have turned off the comments on their accounts, so we can hear them but they can\u2019t hear us. So much for getting closer.</p> <p>And yet, for all the fascination social media currently exerts, the celebrity stories that will have the most enduring impact did not start there. There had been rumours about Harvey Weinstein for years, but he was ultimately undone by good old-fashioned investigative reporting, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/she-said-book-harvey-weinstein-twohey-kantor\" title=\"\">Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey</a> at the New York Times, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/12/the-day-i-confronted-harvey-weinstein-exclusive-extract-from-ronan-farrow-book\" title=\"\">Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker</a>. Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Woody Allen, Max Clifford, Kevin Spacey and Bryan Singer became pariahs (in Jackson\u2019s case, posthumously) when their accusers spoke to journalists. Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world, not on social media, but on the cover of Vanity Fair. When Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, the artist formerly known as Meghan Markle, spoke out against the \u201ccampaigns\u201d against her, they directed their anger towards the print media (and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday in particular</a>). Ironically, this could be seen as rather reassuring to the newspaper industry: sure, our sales are falling, but for a certain kind of celebrity, print is still what matters.</p> <p>Nonetheless, this decade has, in a very profound way, been shaped by the social media celebrity. Donald Trump did not emerge from the online world; he came to prominence through the traditional format of TV. But he has taken advantage of the way Twitter prioritises personality over expertise: it doesn\u2019t really matter what you say, as long as you say it in a way that captures the most attention; and the public has grown accustomed to this kind of communication. In the early part of the decade, Trump gave himself a Twitter makeover; it was a platform where he could move from being the embodiment of obnoxious Manhattan privilege (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxNkMkAe7F0\" title=\"\">bragging in interviews</a> that he wouldn\u2019t rent an apartment to anyone on welfare), to the say-it-like-it-is kinda guy, the one who tweets about the dangers of vaccination. When he ran for the presidency, Trump maintained this persona, and many people assumed that\u2019s all it was \u2013 a persona \u2013 and one he would drop once in office. Well, we all know how that turned out.</p> <p>Now he, and in this country, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, treat their offices as if they were a form of social media: they rely on the web to build a devoted following, and complain about journalists who venture anything but adoring coverage. They disdain traditional interviews, preferring instead to put out their messages via Facebook or Twitter, metaphorically turning off the comments, staying comfortably inside their respective bubbles. Social media was never supposed to reflect the real world, but the real world is increasingly being bent to reflect social media. And it\u2019s not only autograph sellers who will suffer for that.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

When Demi Moore appeared on David Letterman in 2010, she was already so addicted to Twitter she continued to tweet while live on air to millions. (\u201cThis stinks,\u201d Letterman griped.) The appeal of social media for a celebrity is obvious, in that it allows them to talk to the public without those awful middlemen: journalists. The past decade is littered with examples of why celebrities (and their publicists) now prefer social media (which they can control) to giving interviews (which they cannot.) It\u2019s unlikely that Michael Douglas would have tweeted that his throat cancer was caused by cunnilingus, as he told the Guardian\u2019s Xan Brooks in 2013 (and for which he later publicly apologised to his wife, Catherine Zeta Jones). It\u2019s even less likely that Liam Neeson would have made an Instagram story about the time he went out hoping to kill a \u201cblack bastard\u201d after a friend was raped, as he said in an interview this year. Why risk such disasters when, instead, you can just take a flattering photo, slap a filter on it and post it to your already adoring followers? Mega celebrities with a hyper-online fanbase \u2013 Justin Bieber, Beyonc\u00e9, Frank Ocean \u2013 can now go for years without giving an interview and their careers are helped rather than harmed for it. Instagram is an airbrushing app, one that lets people touch up their photos, specifically, and their lives, generally, by deciding what they choose to post. (When Jennifer Aniston finally joined social media last month, and momentarily broke the internet, she naturally chose Instagram over the bearpit of Twitter.) Some are more honest about this than others: after he married Kim Kardashian \u2013 the celebrity who more than any other has made a virtue out of artifice \u2013 Kanye West proudly told reporters in 2014 that the two of them spent four days of their honeymoon in Florence playing with the filters on the wedding photo, that they eventually posted on Instagram, \u201cbecause the flowers were off-colour and stuff like that\u201d. You wonder what they\u2019d do with all that time if the internet didn\u2019t exist \u2013 cure cancer, perhaps? Musician John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen have established a new kind of fame for themselves with their regular social media posts: with Teigen complaining about Donald Trump on Twitter; both of them posting photos of their perfect family on Instagram. Teigen is considered more \u201creal\u201d than her friend Kardashian because she is funny and doesn\u2019t take money to advertise dodgy weight-loss supplements. But their photos are as idealised and managed as any Hello! shoot. The reason Teigen \u2013 a heretofore relatively little known model \u2013 has over 26 million followers on Instagram is because she hits that social media sweet spot, which is to be (to use two of the more grating buzzwords of the decade) aspirational and authentic. At the beginning of this decade, it was the aspirational side of the equation that was deemed more important \u2013 leading to the rise of a new kind of celebrity: the influencers. This bewildering group of people suggest their lives are so perfect that, by showing us photos of how they eat, dress, parent, travel, decorate, exercise, put on makeup and even cure themselves of illness, they will influence us to do the same. For the successful, the money was suddenly limitless, as brands realised that the public trusted influencers more than adverts, and so threw money at them to endorse their products; Kylie Jenner, a makeup influencer, currently makes $1m per sponsored post. This was always a delicate bubble and it finally began to burst last year, when the Advertising Standards Authority decreed that influencers need to spell it out when they\u2019re being paid to promote something. Writing \u201cADVERT\u201d beneath that perfect photo of you chugging some Smart Water next to a waterfall doesn\u2019t really boost one\u2019s authenticity. Even more problematic were the Fyre Festival debacle and the fall of YouTube stars such as Logan Paul and PewDiePie, scandals that eroded the relationship between online celebrities and their followers. It turns out influencers weren\u2019t more trustworthy than adverts; in fact, in the unregulated world of the web, they were markedly less so. An older demographic has sneered at influencers, as they did with the previous decade\u2019s reality TV stars, suggesting they are not \u201creal\u201d celebrities. This is an absurd complaint, given that some influencers have more followers than traditional movie stars do. Yet influencers atomise audiences in a way traditional celebrities don\u2019t: even if you have never bought Vogue, you\u2019ll know who Cindy Crawford is; unless you follow Chiara Ferragni on social media you will likely have no idea who she is \u2013 and yet the fashion influencer has four times as many followers as Crawford. Ironically, the rise of the influencer began with a very old-school celebrity, one who is frequently accused of being the embodiment of the worst kind of elitist privilege: Gwyneth Paltrow. When Paltrow launched her wellness website, Goop, in 2008, few would have predicted it would reshape both Paltrow\u2019s career and cultural notions of what constitutes an aspirational lifestyle. Paltrow helped usher out the 2000s trend for bling and Cristal, swapping them for yoga clothes and gluten-free kale crisps, making discreet asceticism the ultimate A-lister look. Which is more authentic is debatable, but the biggest swap Paltrow made was personal: she went from being an Academy Award-winning actor to online influencer. And, given that her company is now estimated to be worth $250m, she probably made the more lucrative choice. Happily, not everyone uses social media to hawk fantasy images of themselves. Occasional glimpses of reality peek through, to everyone\u2019s delight, and by \u201creality\u201d I mean \u201cfeuds\u201d. We\u2019ve had Katy Perry and Taylor Swift\u2019s long-running snarky subtweets aimed at one another. There were Kim Cattrall\u2019s explicit swipes at Sarah Jessica Parker on Instagram. After her brother died, she wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven\u2019t already.) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I\u2019m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your \u2018nice girl\u2019 persona.\u201d Most recently, Coleen Rooney accused \u201cRebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u201d of selling stories about her to the tabloids. One can only feel deep pangs of regret that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford died before either had access to an iPhone. As much as young celebrities tout the importance of authenticity, those who come across as most genuine tend to be the older ones \u2013 perhaps because they are less internet savvy, or, more likely, have fewer media managers. Bette Midler and, in particular, Cher have really come into their own on Twitter, gleefully sharing their often emoji-heavy thoughts on Trump and politics in general. (\u201cWhat do you think of Boris Johnson?\u201d one tweeter asked Cher. \u201cF-ing idiot who lied to the British ppl,\u201d the goddess replied, rightly.) And while Instagram may be best known for hyper-stylised photos of, say, Beyonc\u00e9 holding her newborn twins, the most purely enjoyable celebrity accounts belong to Glenn Close \u2013 she posts candid videos of herself and her dogs, always liked by Michael Douglas \u2013 and Diane Keaton, who posts decidedly unstylised photos of herself. \u201cYES, I AM WEARING [TROUSERS] UNDER A SKIRT\u201d is a typical all-caps caption. Ever wanted to know what Annie Hall would be like online? Now you know. Of course, the downside to being able to reach one\u2019s public directly is that the public can reach back. Stars from Stephen Fry to Nicki Minaj have publicly left social media sites after the audience proved a little less admiring than they hoped. \u201cStan\u201d \u2013 or obsessive fan \u2013 culture has blossomed. Sometimes this has been to the celebrity\u2019s benefit: Lady Gaga\u2019s fan squad, the Little Monsters, amped up her Oscar campaign for A Star Is Born. But if stans feel they have been let down by the object of their obsession, they will viciously bully the (usually female) star, as Katy Perry and Demi Lovato have experienced. As a result, many celebrities have turned off the comments on their accounts, so we can hear them but they can\u2019t hear us. So much for getting closer. And yet, for all the fascination social media currently exerts, the celebrity stories that will have the most enduring impact did not start there. There had been rumours about Harvey Weinstein for years, but he was ultimately undone by good old-fashioned investigative reporting, by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey at the New York Times, and Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker. Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Woody Allen, Max Clifford, Kevin Spacey and Bryan Singer became pariahs (in Jackson\u2019s case, posthumously) when their accusers spoke to journalists. Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world, not on social media, but on the cover of Vanity Fair. When Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, the artist formerly known as Meghan Markle, spoke out against the \u201ccampaigns\u201d against her, they directed their anger towards the print media (and the Mail on Sunday in particular). Ironically, this could be seen as rather reassuring to the newspaper industry: sure, our sales are falling, but for a certain kind of celebrity, print is still what matters. Nonetheless, this decade has, in a very profound way, been shaped by the social media celebrity. Donald Trump did not emerge from the online world; he came to prominence through the traditional format of TV. But he has taken advantage of the way Twitter prioritises personality over expertise: it doesn\u2019t really matter what you say, as long as you say it in a way that captures the most attention; and the public has grown accustomed to this kind of communication. In the early part of the decade, Trump gave himself a Twitter makeover; it was a platform where he could move from being the embodiment of obnoxious Manhattan privilege (bragging in interviews that he wouldn\u2019t rent an apartment to anyone on welfare), to the say-it-like-it-is kinda guy, the one who tweets about the dangers of vaccination. When he ran for the presidency, Trump maintained this persona, and many people assumed that\u2019s all it was \u2013 a persona \u2013 and one he would drop once in office. Well, we all know how that turned out. Now he, and in this country, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, treat their offices as if they were a form of social media: they rely on the web to build a devoted following, and complain about journalists who venture anything but adoring coverage. They disdain traditional interviews, preferring instead to put out their messages via Facebook or Twitter, metaphorically turning off the comments, staying comfortably inside their respective bubbles. Social media was never supposed to reflect the real world, but the real world is increasingly being bent to reflect social media. And it\u2019s not only autograph sellers who will suffer for that. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

A video provided by International Justice Mission (IJM), a global organisation fighting human trafficking that provided assistance to the police, shows the daughter nearby, her head covered by a towel, nodding at police. The rest of the family watched. The mother did not deny her alleged crime, said Major Michael Virtudazo of the police Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division (ATIP-D). He is confident a court inspection of her mobile phone will confirm information they had been given by a specialised police unit more than 6000km away in Australia. The woman had allegedly been live-streaming her daughter posing in sexual positions to customers abroad, in exchange for cash she received through a nearby money transfer business. One of those customers is alleged to be an Australian from Sydney, who is accused of paying to watch her daughter. Technological advances have turned the Phillipines, a traditional destination for traveling sex offenders, into a hub of live-streamed sexual abuse. John Tanagho, IJM field director in the Philippines, said the country\u2019s robust money remittance infrastructure is one of the enabling factors that drive the crime \u2013 along with widespread internet access and the availability of cheap broadcast-capable mobile devices. The same financial facility that millions of overseas Filipino workers use to easily send money back home has allowed sex offenders to pay for live-streamed content. \u201cLivestreaming online sexual exploitation of children is not unique to the Philippines but it is believed to be worse in the Philippines than other countries,\u201d Tanagho told The Guardian. \u201cOne more critical factor is people speak English well.

At a meeting on Friday afternoon, Westpac\u2019s board decided to appoint what it described as \u201cindependent experts\u201d to investigate who was to blame for the breaches. \u201cThe notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,\u201d chairman Lindsay Maxsted said in his first public statement since Austrac filed its lawsuit on Wednesday morning. \u201cThe board unreservedly apologises.\u201d Austrac said Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and Southeast Asia for known child exploitation risks.

Hidden crime The arrest in Rizal was remarkable for a crime that is largely hidden, usually requiring police to take a deep dive into the dark corners of the internet. In this case, it was dedicated work by groups in Sydney and cooperation between police in Australia and the Philippines that led to an arrest. The investigation began in July when the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children referred to the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation an Australian user who uploaded child abuse material to social media. The Australian federal police commenced Operation Culgoa, resulting in the arrest of an unnamed 63-year-old Sydney man. A subsequent search of his home in the Sydney suburb of North Rocks showed electronic devices containing more child abuse materials that law enforcement would later trace to the town of Taytay in the Philippines.

      "body": "<p>When a Republican, even of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/opinion/trump-republicans.html\">Never Trump</a> variety, cautions the Democratic party against nominating a presidential candidate who is too far left to defeat President Trump in the 2020 election, progressive Democrats rarely respond favorably. They think: why should Democrats take advice from Republicans? Doesn\u2019t such advice amount to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/144447-what-is-concern-trolling-watch-out-for-this-subtle-form-of-shaming\">concern trolling</a>\u201d: a disingenuous attempt to undermine the opposing side by pretending to sympathize with it?

There are many factors driving Democrats left, not least the outrages of Trump. But one of the most important is the sense by many activists that critical issues were neglected (or at least insufficiently addressed) during the presidencies of moderate Democrats <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/politics-and-public-opinion/occupy-1990s-inequality-soared-during-bill-clinton/\">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-obamanauts\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>These issues differ somewhat from activist to activist, but they include growing income inequality, the inability of many workers (especially young people) to get ahead, continuing injustices perpetrated on women and immigrants and people of color, insubstantial efforts against climate change and inadequate healthcare for millions of Americans. In the progressive view, radical change is necessary to take on these challenges, not more incrementalism.</p> <p>I concede the progressives\u2019 premise but not their conclusion. I believe that far-reaching actions must be taken to address all of these challenges. But I also believe that a Democratic presidential candidate running on too far left a platform would have a considerable likelihood of turning off the <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-moderate-voters-trump-centrists-2020.html\">moderate middle</a> of American voters, resulting in Trump\u2019s re-election. That\u2019s not a risk Democrats should take.</p> <p>The (printable) progressive response to that argument is that Trump is vulnerable in 2020, since he has done nothing to expand his base and has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">never topped a 50% </a><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">approval rating</a>. Mushy moderates are boring and uninspiring and likely to lose, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But progressives who campaign unashamedly on big ideas and a program of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/24/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-remake-american-capitalism\">vast structural change</a>, like Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 or even <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18661708/bernie-sanders-definition-democratic-socialism-explained\">democratic socialism</a>, like Senator Bernie Sanders \u2013 will excite the base and hypercharge turnout. Dare to struggle, dare to win, Democrats.</p> <p>But not so fast \u2026 Former president Obama, who remains by far the most popular figure in the Democratic party, agrees that current candidates need to go beyond his accomplishments with new ideas. He recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-tells-democratic-candidates-to-ease-off-talk-of-revolution/2019/11/15/93569ddc-07fd-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html\">described</a> his healthcare law, for example, as a \u201creally good starter home\u201d.

Edsall also cites an October <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/us/politics/democrats-poll-moderates-battleground.html?module=inline\">New York Times/Siena College survey</a> of Democratic voters in six battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 which found that twice as many would prefer a candidate who promises \u201cto find common ground with Republicans\u201d to one who promises \u201cto fight for a bold progressive agenda\u201d. The survey also found a strong preference for a moderate candidate over a liberal one, and a 49% to 45% preference for a candidate who promises \u201cto bring politics in Washington back to normal\u201d as opposed to a candidate who promises \u201cto bring fundamental, systemic change to American society\u201d.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/268448/democrats-thinking-strategically-2020-nominee-choice.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication\">Gallup poll</a> also finds that six in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer the nomination of \u201cthe candidate with the best chance of beating President Donald Trump, even if that person does not share their views on key issues\u201d. By contrast, only 36% say they would rather have \u201ca candidate aligned with them on almost all the issues they care about, even if that person is not the most electable\u201d.</p> <p>At the risk of being taken for a concern troll, I would respectfully counsel my Democratic friends to take reality into account when considering their nominee. That means, in part, that they should consider <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/problem-mobilization-theory/599236/\">the electorate as it is</a> rather than as they might like it to be.</p> <p>It also means that they should consider the likelihood of their nominee actually being able to pass, and pay for, their legislative priorities. If the Democrats don\u2019t win a majority in the Senate in 2020, then not only is a Warren or Sanders Medicare for All plan a nonstarter, so too is the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/774716877/just-the-right-policy-pete-buttigieg-on-his-medicare-for-all-who-want-it-plan\">public-option healthcare plan</a> advanced by candidates like the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, and former vice-president Joe Biden.</p> <p>Even if the Democrats gain control of the Senate, they will need the support of conservative Democratic senators like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/kyrsten-sinema-arizona-democrats-060187\">K</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/29/kyrsten-sinema-arizona-democrats-060187\">yrsten Sinema</a> of Arizona and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/19/joe-manchin-congress-trump-energy-profile-1067311\">Joe Manchin</a> of West Virginia. Such senators are likely to balk at the huge tax packages that would be needed to finance the multiple <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/30/2020-democrats-trillion-dollar-proposals-007013\">trillion-dollar programs</a> of healthcare reform, student loan forgiveness, free public college, clean energy and other initiatives advanced by several moderate as well as progressive candidates. To expect billionaires alone to pay for all of this is quixotic \u2013 particularly since every progressive I know fully expects that billionaires and their lawyers would find some way of weaseling out of whatever taxes might come their way.</p> <p>A critical attribute of leadership is the avoidance of overpromising. The Republican party has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Right-Went-Wrong-Conservatism/dp/1476763801\">come to grief</a> in recent years because its leaders promised their base that if given congressional majorities as well as the White House they would usher in a rightwing utopia. But they failed because it\u2019s impossible to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-can-win-elections-but-they-cant-govern/2018/01/20/79beba98-fd42-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html\">govern</a> in a divided society without engaging in bipartisan negotiation and compromise.</p> <p>In fact, political scientists <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/nonparty-government-bipartisan-lawmaking-and-party-power-in-congress/5500EC62EA53CE786B3A69C51BB29E0C\">Frances Lee and James Curry</a> found that congressional majority parties hardly ever manage to pass their legislative agenda over minority opposition. They analyzed the legislative priorities of each congressional majority party between 1985 and 2016 and found that the majority party succeeded in passing only 4% of its policy priorities without support from a majority of the minority party and at least one member of its leadership. The party-line votes that passed the Democrats\u2019 <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Obamacare_overview\">Affordable Care Act of 2010</a> and the Republicans\u2019 <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/115th_Congress_on_taxes,_2017-2018\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> are the exceptions that prove the rule.</p> <p>So even if the Democrats benefit from another blue wave in 2020, they will have to negotiate with the Republicans to pass significant legislation. That admittedly seems rather unlikely right now, given the Republican <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/opinion/trump-impeachment-hearing.html\">stonewalling</a> in the recent impeachment hearings and Trump\u2019s lack of interest in cooperating with Democrats on anything. But the ability to return to some semblance of bipartisanship is another aspect on which the electorate is likely to judge the Democratic presidential nominee.</p> <p>The critical issue in the next election will not be income inequality, climate change or racial justice, important as all of those are. It will be the preservation of our democratic system that makes reform of those and other issues possible. By the time of the election, Trump most likely will have been impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate. If given a second term, he will be out for revenge and unrestrained by constitutional checks and the rule of law. Democrats shouldn\u2019t allow that to happen by nominating a candidate in 2020 who\u2019s too far left to win.</p> <ul> <li><p>Geoffrey Kabaservice is the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center in Washington DC as well as the author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party</p></li> </ul>",

That admittedly seems rather unlikely right now, given the Republican stonewalling in the recent impeachment hearings and Trump\u2019s lack of interest in cooperating with Democrats on anything. But the ability to return to some semblance of bipartisanship is another aspect on which the electorate is likely to judge the Democratic presidential nominee. The critical issue in the next election will not be income inequality, climate change or racial justice, important as all of those are. It will be the preservation of our democratic system that makes reform of those and other issues possible. By the time of the election, Trump most likely will have been impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate. If given a second term, he will be out for revenge and unrestrained by constitutional checks and the rule of law. Democrats shouldn\u2019t allow that to happen by nominating a candidate in 2020 who\u2019s too far left to win.

Both artists, decades later, tackled the Orpheus myth: Stravinsky in a ballet, Cocteau a film, out of which, in 1991, Philip Glass made an opera, <strong>Orph\u00e9e</strong>. This was <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/orphee/\" title=\"\">the last work</a> in English National Opera\u2019s current Orpheus season.

Cocteau\u2019s story is complicated, and Glass demands much, especially in Act 1, of the excellent singers: the celebrated poet Orph\u00e9e (Nicholas Lester) falls in love with a Princess (Jennifer France) who is Death. His wife, Euridyce (Sarah Tynan), finds comfort in the Princess\u2019s enchanting chauffeur, Heurtebise (Nicky Spence). The underworld, ashen and shadowy in Jones\u2019s depiction, offset by the fuchsia pink of the Princess\u2019s couture gown, perfectly reflects the eventually purposeful energy of Glass\u2019s dreamlike score.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2502150f2d070aaa479bac0eb41db909530412f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2502150f2d070aaa479bac0eb41db909530412f/0_0_4420_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Tynan (Eurydice), Nicholas Lester (Orph\u00e9e) and Nicky Spence (Heurtebise) in Orph\u00e9e by Philip Glass at the Coliseum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Tynan (Eurydice), Nicholas Lester (Orph\u00e9e) and Nicky Spence (Heurtebise) in Orph\u00e9e by Philip Glass at the Coliseum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the widespread criticism of this ENO season, I would praise both <em>Orph\u00e9e</em> and Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/26/mask-of-orpheus-birtwistle-eno-review-steve-reich-gerhard-richter-barbican-reich-richter\" title=\"\">The Mask of Orpheus</a></em>.

Their reputation is glitzy: how could an orchestra from LA whose two homes are the Hollywood Bowl and the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall not exude glamour? Yet their standards are of the highest, their commitment to new commissions and modern repertoire unrivalled among US orchestras. Dudamel, who is still music director of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra in his native Venezuela, has been with the LA Phil for a decade. He can still be a showman when the time is right \u2013 conducting their glorious encore, Sousa\u2019s The Liberty Bell, with little more than a swivelled hip and a bent knee \u2013 but his customary podium manner is sober, meticulous, clear. Opening with the Variaciones Concertantes, Op 23 by Alberto Ginastera (1916-83), the orchestra had plenty of chance to show off its soloists, especially the sonorous viola in the \u201cVariazione drammatica\u201d. It\u2019s a long piece, however, with many variations but not enough variety. Yuja Wang, now a Barbican featured artist, delivered the London premiere of Adams\u2019s Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes? (2018), written for her, with ferocious verve, capturing the limpid, short-lived lyricism of the central slow section with sensuous grace, hammering out the perpetual motion of the whole as if improvising jazz riffs rather than playing a notated score. Her encores ranged across the musical spectrum, from the witty \u201cDo You Come Here Often\u201d by the LA-born conductor-composer Michael Tilson Thomas to Liszt\u2019s transcription of a Schubert song, Gretchen am Spinnrade, D118. A Toccatina by the Russian jazz-pianist-composer Nikolai Kapustin (b1937), full of propulsive virtuosity, was a fitting bridge to The Rite of Spring. The French writer and artist Jean Cocteau was in the Paris audience in 1913 for the scandalous premiere of the Rite, providing an important eyewitness account as well as drawing a cartoon of Stravinksy rehearsing the piece at the piano in front of a bewildered salon crowd. Both artists, decades later, tackled the Orpheus myth: Stravinsky in a ballet, Cocteau a film, out of which, in 1991, Philip Glass made an opera, Orph\u00e9e. This was the last work in English National Opera\u2019s current Orpheus season. Expertly conducted (by Geoffrey Paterson), incisively played and sung, Glass\u2019s version may not add much to the 1950 film, but it has hypnotic charm. In the hands of Netia Jones \u2013 who is director, costume designer, video designer and co-translator \u2013 it grows richer and more resonant thanks to impeccable creative vision. Borrowing from the pictorial language of the movie, Jones has made a staging of monochrome beauty, illuminated with bright splashes of colour, mixing her own distinctive use of computer graphics and cinematic reference with live performance. Cocteau\u2019s story is complicated, and Glass demands much, especially in Act 1, of the excellent singers: the celebrated poet Orph\u00e9e (Nicholas Lester) falls in love with a Princess (Jennifer France) who is Death. His wife, Euridyce (Sarah Tynan), finds comfort in the Princess\u2019s enchanting chauffeur, Heurtebise (Nicky Spence). The underworld, ashen and shadowy in Jones\u2019s depiction, offset by the fuchsia pink of the Princess\u2019s couture gown, perfectly reflects the eventually purposeful energy of Glass\u2019s dreamlike score. Given the widespread criticism of this ENO season, I would praise both Orph\u00e9e and Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s The Mask of Orpheus. Returning to the Birtwistle for the final performance, I found Daniel Kramer\u2019s production had settled and coalesced. Musically it was faultless. Much that had seemed excessive, whether on stage or in the pit, now made sense. Worthwhile creations don\u2019t always reveal their secrets on first encounter. Star ratings (out of five) LA Phil/Dudamel \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Orph\u00e9e \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Orph\u00e9e is at the Coliseum, London, until 29 November",

My second-oldest brother is in prison.<strong> </strong>My other siblings are still young, studying or looking for work.</p> <p>I started supporting my family in high school in England, in dribs and drabs from school bursaries and state benefits.

My dad would say that between us all, we could be rich one day \u2013 as if we\u2019d signed up to a communal lottery ticket at birth.</p> <p>I was growing up between competing ideologies. One said that being successful meant autonomy: moving out, getting a job, your own house, a new family. The other said that success was sharing the fruits of your earnings.</p> <p>Every second-generation immigrant I know aspired to one day make enough money to support their moms, but that\u2019s not true of everyone.

Delaney went on to say that \u201cthe NHS is going to be on the table\u201d if \u201cwe leave the EU under the terms of Boris Johnson\u2019s disastrous Brexit deal\u201d, adding that \u201cDonald Trump is going to give it to Donald Trump Jr and Eric and Ivanka and they\u2019re going to divvy it up and sell it to private pharmaceutical companies, and the NHS as we know it will be gone.\u201d Earlier this month the US president made assurances that the NHS will not form part of post-Brexit trade deals. Speaking to Nigel Farage on LBC radio, Trump told listeners he was not interested in buying the NHS and denied Corbyn\u2019s claims it would mean the NHS was up for sale to American health corporations. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where [it] started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean, it\u2019s so ridiculous. I think Corbyn put that out there, but to even think, it was never even mentioned, I never even heard it until I went over to visit with the Queen,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A dramatic end to the WBBL as the Strikers get home - just - and book a finals berth. Chloe Tryon with a masterclass of big hitting, but the wheels came off in that final over, leaving the South African distraught as the Hobart Hurricanes missed out by a handful of runs. 44* off 22 her final knock but credit the final over bowling of Coyte. It finishes a drama-filled day of Sportwatch, where elsewhere Wellington Phoenix secured their first A-League win of the season, before Adelaide United sent a huge message to the league, dismantling Melbourne Victory 3-1 in the 50th iteration of the \u201cOriginal derby\u201d. A brace to Riley McGree and an own goal to the hapless Migden Basha off the terrific run and shot from Michael Maria cancelling out Ola Toivonen\u2019s impressive finish. Headaches ahead for Marco Kurz as his side languishes just a point from the bottom of the table, but delight for the Reds who rocket up to third. Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for more. But for now, that\u2019s Sportswatch! Gibson gets her one and scampers off strike. Second ball, but a first to Tryon and the South African thumps it for four. A big mix up on ball three - and it\u2019s a runout! They run on a leg bye, but Tryon realises she needs to stay on strike and sends back Gibson. Next ball from Coyte and it\u2019s another dot ball! Incredible drama. Tryon tries to force it down the ground, but Coyte just gets enough on the ball to slow it for one! Tryon settles for one - and she\u2019s at the wrong end for the final ball! They need five off one - and it\u2019s Vlaeminck facing her first delivery of the match! Can she hit a six. She can only get two! And they\u2019re off the hook, the Strikers! They\u2019re through to the finals, Strikers, but gee, didn\u2019t they do that the hard way. WBBL: Hobart 6/133 (19 overs) chasing 144, Gibson 2*, Tryon 39* Amanda Jade Wellington, the leggie, vs Tryon the clubber. It\u2019s a brilliant start to the over - just two off the first five deliveries, but on the final ball Tryon winds the arms and puts the spinner deep into the Ponting stand! A huge six. And now they need 11 off the final over, but it\u2019s Gibson on strike. What a final over we have here! WBBL: Hobart 6/124 (18 overs) chasing 144, Gibson 0*, Tryon 32* My, oh my. I thought this one was done and dusted - but Chloe Tryon has single-handedly turned this contest. She\u2019s just battered Bates for six and then four off consecutive balls. We are looking at 20 off 12 balls. That is entirely do-able. What a remarkable finish this would be from the South African! WBBL: Hobart 5/103 (16.1 overs) chasing 144, Moloney 0*, Tryon 17* Chloe Tryon has threatened to explode this game open! First delivery - four. Second delivery - four. She moves to 17 off eight. But with the wicket of Hall, they\u2019re five gone. It was a terrific catch from Price who anticipated the reverse sweep, moved early and took it comfortably. Hall, gone for 25 - another decent knock, but nobody\u2019s been able to go really big for the Hurricanes. WBBL: Hobart 4/83 (14 overs) chasing 144, Hall 18*, Tryon 4* And as they look to run down this increasing run rate, Carey looks to go big, but it\u2019s Devine who sticks out the mitts on the boundary - and with the fall of that fourth wicket, surely that\u2019s put it beyond the Hurricanes? Run rate above 10 now. But as we know, anything can happen in T20. 90 min: Some concerns as Nabbout goes down with a shoulder concern. He\u2019s had some issues with that recently, the Socceroo. And there\u2019s the whistle. Delight for the home fans, and long faces on the Victory bench. The 50th \u201cOriginal derby\u201d ends with the Reds very much on top. A good run of home games ahead for the Victory, but it\u2019s starting to look like they\u2019re a club in some real trouble. Just one point off the bottom of the table. But all the credit to Adelaide United - they\u2019re starting to play some superb football. And they make it 12 points from their past four games. WBBL: Hobart 3/56 (9.4 overs) chasing 144, Hall 2*, Carey 15* And unfortunately for the home fans, their efforts with the ball are not being matched with the bat. After the openers both went cheaply it was down to Carey and Knight to steer this run chase. But with Wellington snaring the Hurricanes No 3 for just 22 (off 26) its beginning to look like it\u2019s getting away from them. They need 90-odd off the last 60 balls. It\u2019s still very much doable, but have they left themselves too much to do? 85 min: Migden Basha stands over a freekick for Victory, and oh my. If there\u2019s a little vignette that sums up Kurz\u2019s underperforming foreign legion it\u2019s this. There\u2019s a one-man wall to beat - the teenage and pint-sized Louis D\u2019Arrigo - and the Albanian recruit thumps his delivery right into him. Sorry, but that\u2019s rubbish. 80 min: And a reminder that if this result stays as it\u2019s currently looking, then Adelaide United will move above Western Sydney Wanderers to third on the ladder - with just Melbourne City and Sydney FC above them. They\u2019ve already enjoyed an FFA Cup trophy this season, but could the Gertjan Verbeek era be really starting to hit its straps? Continue like this and he\u2019ll fast become Australia\u2019s favourite football Verbeek. Not that the competition\u2019s too hot, mind. 74 min: Plenty of aggro in some of these tackles - it\u2019s been a dramatic game already, but you get the sense there\u2019s some frustrated Melbourne Victory players out there. And there\u2019s more danger to come - on comes Al Hassan Toure, fresh from Olyroos action to bolster Adelaide\u2019s frontline. Blackwood makes way. Goal! Adelaide United 3-1 Melbourne Victory (McGree) 68 min: Ach, meine Gute. It\u2019s an A-League debut for the experienced German centre back Tim Hoogland, a veteran of six seasons in the Bundesliga, and his first contribution is to be shrugged by a youngster! Riley McGree chases a long ball and uses his body brilliantly to battle for the ball - and he leaves the German on the pitch, before jinking inside and thumping an effort past Thomas! What a mad few minutes - the home fans are in delirium. Goal! Adelaide United 2-1 Melbourne Victory (Maria) 62 min: Oh my. They\u2019d celebrated parity for about 60 seconds - more or less right from the re-start it\u2019s the Reds back in front! What a game this is turning into! It was a fortuitous touch that saw a ball fall into the path of the man from Curacao, Michael Maria, who drove from left back through a host of bodies in dark blue, before his shot took a kindly deflection past Thomas! That was a black cats walking under broken mirrors kind of goal for Marco Kurz - talk about when your luck is out! But credit Adelaide for the intent to strike right back. Goal! Adelaide United 1-1 Melbourne Victory (Toivonen) - 60\u2019 Cometh the hour, cometh the man - and honestly, if there was anyone that would get Victory back into this contest it was, once again, the skipper Ola Toivonen! It was superb work from Robbie Kruse, twisting and turning his fullback Ryan Strain inside-out before scooping a lovely cross over Izzo to the far post - and the Big Swede arrived late and thumped that home. Emphatic finish from a man who can\u2019t stop scoring in the A-League. WBBL: Hobart 2/10 (2.4 overs) chasing 144, Knight 1*, Carey 0* And it\u2019s not the ideal start to the run chase as first Devine and then Southern Stars bowler Megan Schutt, pick up the openers. Fran Wilson is caught and bowled by the Kiwi all-rounder, before Erin Fazackerley feathers one off Schutt into the gloves of the keeper. Not ideal! 52 min: And Marco Kurz does look to shuffle his pack, and it\u2019s the Burundi international, Elvis Kamsoba who comes on for youngster Brendon Lauton. Kamsoba does get it in the back of the net, but it\u2019s correctly ruled out - in fairness the Adelaide defence did stop playing there as well. And it\u2019s just a second sighting of Socceroo Robbie Kruse, who continues his own return from injury, as he comes off the bench to try and spark something for the Victory. NBL: Sydney Kings 90-86 South East Melbourne Phoenix And another thriller in the NBL, where the high-flying Kings were almost brought crashing to earth in Victoria, against the new kids on the block. Casper Ware again the main man, here\u2019s an excerpt from Australian Associated Press: Sydney remain on top of the NBL ladder, surviving a spirited second-half fightback from South East Melbourne to claim a 90-86 NBL victory. The NBL frontrunners maintained their stellar start to the season at Melbourne Arena on Saturday as they won their 10th game in 11 starts, extending their unbeaten streak to four matches. But it was not without drama as the Phoenix came back from 20 points down in the third quarter to take a one-point lead after John Roberson gave the home side their first lead of the game with 48 seconds left. Casper Ware answered with a baseline jumper to put the Kings back in front and Jae\u2019sean Tate added a free throw for an 88-86 advantage, before stopping the Phoenix on their final possession and Ware icing the game from the foul line. Ware finished with a team-high 25 points, while Tate made a series of crucial baskets in the fourth quarter on his way to 24 points and eight rebounds. Second half! Adelaide United 1-0 Melbourne Victory 45 min: And we\u2019re back on in Adelaide, in what could loom as a crucial half for Victory\u2019s season. Oh to have been a fly on the wall of Marco Kurz\u2019s dressing room. WBBL - End of innings: Adelaide 3/143 (20) They fire 16 off the last 9 balls to make it a little more respectable, but you\u2019d have to say, the home side have done well to restrict Adelaide, on a pitch where 160+ looked on the cards. Opening duo Devine and Bates threatened to go big, but only built steadily, with the fireworks lurking but never necessarily presenting. Now it\u2019s down to their batters - can they upset the apple card with a big scalp here today? If they do win, the Hurricanes, it won\u2019t change their season, but it could have a big effect on the top four spots, and who books a semi-final berth. Half-time: Adelaide United 1-0 Melbourne Victory Mileusnic flies through the heart of the Victory defence, but his finish is poor as he flashes wide. A big let off for the visitors, they could have easily found themselves further behind, but the whistle spares their blushes. A big test of Marco Kurz\u2019s side - they need to lift; but where will the spark come from? 43 min: Adelaide looking very comfortable at the back with ball at the feet - almost inviting the Victory to come press a little higher. They try to draw their visitors forward and at a turnover look to spring sharply on attack in transition but it comes to nought. 38 min: It\u2019s McGree lining up a freekick from a very handy range, and he puts it on the head of Blackwood - but Thomas saves! It was right at the \u2018keeper in truth, but he had to show sharp instincts to keep that out. That would have really been a blow for the Victory - in the form they\u2019re in you can\u2019t see them dragging back a result from a two-goal deficit, surely. WBBL: Adelaide Strikers 2/112 (16.3 overs), Patterson 0*, McGrath 5* And there\u2019s the big one for the Hurricanes - they\u2019ve picked up Bates! It\u2019s the spinner Knight with the breakthrough, with Vakarewa taking the catch. Around 20-odd balls to come, and if they can keep this tight they\u2019ve really slowed the Strikers. Nobody\u2019s really gone for too much so far - a very good bowling performance - if they can close it out. 30 min: Adelaide with a corner variation, playing it short and looking for Troisi just outside the box for a change of angle, but his ball in just evades the Reds attackers and Thomas rises comfortably to claim. They\u2019re on top, the home side, winning a host of corners, as Michael Jakobsen nods a header just past the far post. And that goal takes Riley McGree second on the A-League golden boot ladder - impressive for the midfielder, who grabs his fifth of the season. Daylight already the gap between Jamie Maclaren and the chasing pack - an incredible 9 goals in 4 games to start his season - the first player to score four consecutive braces (or more). And when you throw in his goals for the Socceroos in between you can tell this guy is just pure fire at the moment. Goal! Adelaide United 1-0 Melbourne Victory (McGree) 22 min: And it\u2019s been a lively start to this one, and Adelaide crown it with a goal! Strain with a good run and ball in to find the Norwegian Opseth - he turns a twists a shot through the legs of Traore across Thomas\u2019 goal - it clatters the post and bounces clear, but it\u2019s McGree that responds first to tuck home! Game on. WBBL: Adelaide Strikers 1/91 (12.2 overs), Bates 52*, McGrath 0 And a big wicket, as Vakarewa rattles the stumps of Sophie Devine! Lovely bowling, she\u2019s out for 31 off 35. But at the other end Bates continues here merry way, smashing another one to the boundary to bring up her 50. There still striking over 7 an over; can the Hurricanes grab a few more wickets to slow this? 16 min: Big save! Izzo, who I believe Adelaide are in the process of re-signing this week, has stuck out a big boot and produced a brilliant save from Nabbout. And at the other end, guess who, it\u2019s Troisi against his old club, but the finish is almost apologetic! No problem for Lawrence Thomas, his former teammate. 13 min: Adama Traore does well to fire a handy cross in for his skipper Toivonen, but the Big Swede can\u2019t get clear of the defence to fashion a shot on target. Interesting subplot as the travelling Victory fans tries to howl a chorus of boos at Troisi every time he gets the ball, but the Adelaide fans instantly drowning it out with a hail of cheers. Fun stuff. WBBL: Adelaide Strikers 0/71 (10.0 overs), Bates 37*, Devine 26* So at the halfway mark of the innings it\u2019s been steady if not quite spectacular stuff from the Kiwi duo, who have ticked over nicely at over 7 an over, but haven\u2019t quite put the foot on the throat of the Hurricanes. Some steady bowling, both with pace and spin, keeping them a little in check. A key patch of this innings now, you\u2019d imagine. 5 min: And an early booking for the Victory skipper, Ola Toivonen. Was that for back chat? Remarkable, if so to be bubbling this hot so early in such a key clash. But there\u2019s plenty at stake for a club that can lay claim to being Australia\u2019s biggest, but finds itself languishing in eighth spot early in the season. A-League: Kick-off! 1 min: And we\u2019re up and away in Adelaide. A decent looking crowd in to support the home side, and it\u2019s a very early chance involving their Norwegian striker Kristian Opseth, before Nikola Mileusnic also slices a shot wide! A bright start for the home side. And some team news ahead of the \u201cOriginal Derby\u201d. It\u2019s a relatively settled XI at Adelaide these days as Dutchman Gertjan Verbeek comes to know his chargers. George Blackwood returns to the starting side, while young gun Al Hassan Toure will have to settle for a spot on the bench after returning from Olyroos duty midweek. And it\u2019s a key return for Andrew Nabbout, while NZ\u2019s right back Storm Roux returns from international duty to bolster the Victory lineup: WBBL: Adelaide Strikers 0/49 (6.0 overs), Bates 23*, Devine 17* And Bates goes big with a huge blast over the rope! And they\u2019ve built a pretty good base, the visiting side, while starting to see off Hobart\u2019s opening quicks. They\u2019ve not been under too much pressure the Kiwi duo, so if they keep wickets intact they could explode here. We\u2019re not too far away from the second of three A-League fixtures today, and it\u2019s probably the pick of them: Adelaide United v Melbourne Victory. The \u201cOriginal Rivalry\u201d with the added flavour of being Marco Kurz\u2019s first match in charge against his old club. James Troisi also a man on the other side - having returned to home town Adelaide after four memorable seasons in the dark blue and white of Victory. WBBL: Adelaide Strikers 0/17 (3.0 overs), Bates 11*, Devine 5* It\u2019s a good start from the home side, with Belinda Vakarewa and Tayla Vlaeminck start well with the ball, keeping it tight, before Suzie Bates finally gets hold of the former and finds the boundary with two sharp jabs. And here\u2019s the match report from day three of the first Test, where Pakistan are well and truly on the ropes. 340 is the target they need to avoid the follow-on after Australia\u2019s huge first innings total. And they\u2019ve dropped a few wickets too: And we\u2019re off to Blundestone Arena, or Bellerive Oval in the old money, where the Hurricanes are about to host Adelaide Strikers in the WBBL. Great little arena for cricket that, have spent many a happy day on the grass there. (As in standing on it, not...) Took in my first ever T20 match there - and can happily report, couldn\u2019t tell you a single detail about that match, but Hurricanes man-and-boy, me. And it is the home side that wins the toss and elects to bowl first. Can they get the Kiwi duo of Bates and Devine quiet? It\u2019s a gorgeous looking batting pitch, so 160+ could be on the cards here. Now as mentioned in the preamble there\u2019s a business of cricket going on today (I believe that\u2019s the appropriate collective noun.. a parliament? A murder?). The first Test of the Australian summer is underway and the home side continue to have the wood on visitors Pakistan. Scott Heinrich was our man on the tools there, where I believe stumps has just taken place: It\u2019s a first win of the season for the Phoenix, and a first A-League win for coach Ufuk Talay in his debut season. It got tight at the end, but the NZ-based side did enough to hang on for the three points, even if Mauk\u2019s late goal denied them a first clean sheet of the season. It was a flat looking Brisbane Roar, especially coming off that rousing 4-3 win over table-toppers Melbourne City last weekend. It is a tough place to travel, Wellington, and maybe the Queensland side had it\u2019s own mini comedown after Das Wunder von Redcliffe, where four second-half goals saw them shock the A-League league leaders. Ufuk Talay and Robbie Fowler were old teammates at North Queensland Fury - but it\u2019s the Australian who emerges with the bragging rights. Goal! Wellington Phoenix 2-1 Brisbane Roar (Mauk) - 85\u2019 Hello. It was feet up and plain sailing for the Phoenix, courtesy goals from the skipper Steven Taylor and Mexican playmaker Ulises Davila, but it\u2019s turned into a nervous last few minutes. Having struggled to muster a shot on target for something like 80 minutes the Roar are finishing strong. Roy O\u2019Donovan had the ball in the net, but it was correctly ruled offside. But minutes later, Stefan Mauk does find the net. Can the man they call God muster a second come-from-behind miracle in as many weeks? Supercars: Shane van Gisbergen wins Newcastle 500 Supercars star Shane van Gisbergen has won race one at the Newcastle 500 from pole position, but a mistake from Triple Eight teammate Jamie Whincup has proved costly. The Holden duo were in prime position on Satuday for a one-two finish and close the gap in the teams\u2019 championship race, but Whincup misjudged a corner with 20 laps to go and dropped from second to seventh. It allowed DJR Team Penske\u2019s Scott McLaughlin and Fabian Coulthard to round out the podium and extend their teams\u2019 championship lead ahead of Sunday\u2019s season-ending second race. That\u2019s the write up from our colleagues at Australian Associated Press. A third win of the season for the Auckland-born driver, who sits second overall on the driver\u2019s championship behind McLaughlin. Hi all! Kia ora to our friends across the ditch, where there\u2019s a strong NZ flavour to today\u2019s Sportwatch. There is an early A-League fixture just concluding from the nation\u2019s capital in Wellington, where the home side, the Phoenix, could be about to secure a first win of the season. More on that, shortly. It is of course the NZ master-blaster, Sophie Devine, who could hold the hopes of Adelaide Strikers in the WBBL, and to continue the theme, the Kiwi driver Shane van Gisbergen has had a fine day in Newcastle in the Supercars. More on that as well soon. It\u2019s the penultimate weekend of the WBBL, as the Hobart Hurricanes host an Adelaide Strikers side looking to go clear second and try and cement their top four spot. In the A-League it\u2019s a tantalising \u201cOriginal Derby\u201d between Adelaide United v Melbourne Victory - the last one was a cracker where a passionate Marco Kurz enjoyed a solid win over Keisuke Honda\u2019s Victory. Now he\u2019s in the other tracksuit, and a man under pressure given Melbourne\u2019s start to the season. Can his new side kickstart their spluttering campaign against his old side? There\u2019s also plenty of cricket action flying around, and as always on Sportwatch who knows what else. So draw the blinds, plump the cushions and settle in.",

      "bodyText": "Homophobia is a serious and continuing problem, but it was difficult this week not to enjoy aspects of the hoo-ha over Strictly Come Dancing. In what felt like a historical re-enactment of classic 1970s\u2019 curtain-twitching, 189 viewers complained to the BBC about two men partnering each other on primetime telly, and it was hard to know what to laugh at first: the Mary Whitehouse tone of the complaints, the statement on Instagram by one of the dancers \u2013 realising the full dramatic potential of the moment \u2013 that \u201clove knows no boundaries\u201d, or the idea that the spectacle of two men dancing could ever be the gayest thing about Strictly. What, exactly, do these people think they\u2019ve been watching all these years? The numbers of complaints was low, relative to audience figures \u2013 even in its 17th season, Strictly can still pull in 8 million viewers on a good night. Nonetheless, there was something vaguely comforting about the fact that, particularly in the context of the recent LGBT teaching row, in mainstream culture at least, complaints of this kind about gay representation seem outdated to the point of absurdity. In schools, of course, the battle rages on. It can be easy to forget this.

At the time I was mostly known as being the quiet kid on the team. I remember telling Coach Orr what occurred and him shaking his head and saying that he was sorry that happened and that he would support me \u2013 but that I had to think first before I reacted, that I was too intelligent to give anyone that type of power over me and that now I put myself in a position where the media could demonize me the way they do. They could use language like <em>Etan Thomas brutally attacked or violently assaulted or maliciously mauled this poor innocent player</em> and encourage the powers that be to throw the book at me as far as a punishment. You put your fate in their hands, and more times than not, we will lose that battle. As much as I didn\u2019t want to hear it at the time, Coach Orr was 100% correct.</p> <p>Coach Boeheim had a somewhat different tactic when he approached me \u2013 but quickly understood that it wasn\u2019t the best time to berate me and quickly backed off.</p> <p>However, later on a few of my teammates told me that while they were going through the line after the game shaking hands with the other team, Coach Boeheim said to the player something along the lines of: \u201cYou know what you said to my player, and you were wrong\u201d.</p> <p>The newspapers asked me what happened in the locker room and I told them that I shouldn\u2019t have responded the way that I did, but that word should never come out of a white person\u2019s mouth any time for any reason. I added that I didn\u2019t even allow black people to use that word in my presence and with a history as ugly as this country has, it would be disrespectful to my ancestors if I allowed a white person to ever say it.</p> <p>Most of my coaches had my back the entire time, but not many other people were willing to believe me until someone in the media who was close to the court verified that they did in fact hear the player call me the N-word. I remember asking Coach Orr why would I need someone to validate my story in order for them to not believe that I was making the entire thing up. And he told me, unfortunately, that\u2019s just the way it works.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist\">When it comes to racially abusive fans, the NBA has a Utah problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enter: Myles Garrett.</p> <p>Garrett made an allegation during an appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday that alleged Rudolph called him the N-word prior to their altercation, a claim that Rudolph vehemently denies. Unfortunately for Myles, nobody else is backing his claim or offering him any type of support. His coach didn\u2019t support him the way Coach Boeheim and Coach Orr supported me, at least not publicly.</p> <p>Browns coach Freddie Kitchens on Thursday declined to address the incident or his conversations with Garrett regarding the incident.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Myles and I talk about stays between Myles and I,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Myles presented himself professionally, like he\u2019s done ever since the moment it happened [and] afterward. He\u2019s been nothing but professional in his responses.\u201d</p> <p>Not exactly a ringing endorsement.</p> <p>In addition, none of the players have come forward to support his claim.</p> <p>If even one person came forward and said that he heard it would definitely help his case, but for nobody to come forward and support him leads a large amount of the public to question the validity of his claim altogether. It doesn\u2019t mean his claims are untrue, but as I learned many years ago at Syracuse, it\u2019s beneficial to have a witness to validate your story.</p> <p>Another factor working against Garrett is the question of why he didn\u2019t shout this from the mountaintops immediately after the game. Why wait until a week later to make the allegation during the appeal process? Again, it doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen, but the optics are not in his favor.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Rudolph told reporters he didn\u2019t say or do anything to provoke Garrett or escalate the situation. Although we have all seen the video evidence of what started the altercation and can easily come to the conclusion that Rudolph is far from an innocent victim in this, he maintains that he did nothing wrong. The reality is, we can clearly see that Rudolph was attempting to pull Garrett\u2019s helmet off first and that he started the entire altercation. N-word or not, Rudolph picked a fight and Garrett finished it. And although rumors are swarming that a possible fine could be handed down in the near future, Rudolph hasn\u2019t been punished in any way, shape or form to this point and insists that he is completely unaware of any reason for Garrett to react in a violent manner towards him. Garrett asserts that all he wants to do is play football for the Browns and be the best human being he could be. (An exaggeration, but that\u2019s the picture he is painting with his comments.)</p> <p>Also against Garrett\u2019s favor, the Steelers issued a statement saying: \u201cMason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland. He will not discuss this accusation any further and his focus remains on preparation for Sunday\u2019s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\u201d</p> <p>To pile on even further, Rudolph\u2019s attorney, Timothy M Younger told reporters according to ESPN: \u201cIn his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur toward him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason\u2019s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension. This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett.</p> <p>\u201cThe malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason\u2019s integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment.\u201d</p> <p>Naturally, Rudolph\u2019s lawyer is putting a lot of extra on it and earning his fee while addressing the media about his client, but that\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do. All the chips are stacked against Garrett.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the NFL didn\u2019t budge on his appeal as they \u201cfound no such evidence\u201d that Rudolph used a racial slur. They also rejected what was probably a much better argument: that there were no witnesses, the coach didn\u2019t support his claim, and no teammate came forward in support either. According to ESPN\u2019s Dan Graziano, Garrett\u2019s team attempted to use a precedent-based argument pointing to the fact that the NFL\u2019s punishment of former Houston Texans defensive end Antonio Smith in 2013, when he swung a helmet at Richie Incognito of the Miami Dolphins, wasn\u2019t a suspension for the remainder of the season but only a ban of two preseason games and one regular-season contest.

      "bodyText": "The reported allegation that Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph directed a racial slur at Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett before their ugly brawl on Monday Night Football takes me back to my freshman season at Syracuse University. I was playing in a game and a white player on the other team called me the N-word. I remember walking away from him after a little tussle, then turning around and rushing towards him the moment I heard it exit his mouth. My teammates restrained me and I managed to get a push and a swing off \u2013 that didn\u2019t connect \u2013 before I was ejected from the game. After my ejection, our assistant coach Louis Orr came to me at halftime and asked me what happened to get me so upset, as it was out of character for me. At the time I was mostly known as being the quiet kid on the team. I remember telling Coach Orr what occurred and him shaking his head and saying that he was sorry that happened and that he would support me \u2013 but that I had to think first before I reacted, that I was too intelligent to give anyone that type of power over me and that now I put myself in a position where the media could demonize me the way they do. They could use language like Etan Thomas brutally attacked or violently assaulted or maliciously mauled this poor innocent player and encourage the powers that be to throw the book at me as far as a punishment. You put your fate in their hands, and more times than not, we will lose that battle. As much as I didn\u2019t want to hear it at the time, Coach Orr was 100% correct. Coach Boeheim had a somewhat different tactic when he approached me \u2013 but quickly understood that it wasn\u2019t the best time to berate me and quickly backed off. However, later on a few of my teammates told me that while they were going through the line after the game shaking hands with the other team, Coach Boeheim said to the player something along the lines of: \u201cYou know what you said to my player, and you were wrong\u201d. The newspapers asked me what happened in the locker room and I told them that I shouldn\u2019t have responded the way that I did, but that word should never come out of a white person\u2019s mouth any time for any reason. I added that I didn\u2019t even allow black people to use that word in my presence and with a history as ugly as this country has, it would be disrespectful to my ancestors if I allowed a white person to ever say it. Most of my coaches had my back the entire time, but not many other people were willing to believe me until someone in the media who was close to the court verified that they did in fact hear the player call me the N-word. I remember asking Coach Orr why would I need someone to validate my story in order for them to not believe that I was making the entire thing up. And he told me, unfortunately, that\u2019s just the way it works. Enter: Myles Garrett. Garrett made an allegation during an appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday that alleged Rudolph called him the N-word prior to their altercation, a claim that Rudolph vehemently denies. Unfortunately for Myles, nobody else is backing his claim or offering him any type of support. His coach didn\u2019t support him the way Coach Boeheim and Coach Orr supported me, at least not publicly. Browns coach Freddie Kitchens on Thursday declined to address the incident or his conversations with Garrett regarding the incident. \u201cWhat Myles and I talk about stays between Myles and I,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Myles presented himself professionally, like he\u2019s done ever since the moment it happened [and] afterward. He\u2019s been nothing but professional in his responses.\u201d Not exactly a ringing endorsement. In addition, none of the players have come forward to support his claim. If even one person came forward and said that he heard it would definitely help his case, but for nobody to come forward and support him leads a large amount of the public to question the validity of his claim altogether. It doesn\u2019t mean his claims are untrue, but as I learned many years ago at Syracuse, it\u2019s beneficial to have a witness to validate your story. Another factor working against Garrett is the question of why he didn\u2019t shout this from the mountaintops immediately after the game. Why wait until a week later to make the allegation during the appeal process? Again, it doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen, but the optics are not in his favor. Not surprisingly, Rudolph told reporters he didn\u2019t say or do anything to provoke Garrett or escalate the situation. Although we have all seen the video evidence of what started the altercation and can easily come to the conclusion that Rudolph is far from an innocent victim in this, he maintains that he did nothing wrong. The reality is, we can clearly see that Rudolph was attempting to pull Garrett\u2019s helmet off first and that he started the entire altercation. N-word or not, Rudolph picked a fight and Garrett finished it. And although rumors are swarming that a possible fine could be handed down in the near future, Rudolph hasn\u2019t been punished in any way, shape or form to this point and insists that he is completely unaware of any reason for Garrett to react in a violent manner towards him. Garrett asserts that all he wants to do is play football for the Browns and be the best human being he could be. (An exaggeration, but that\u2019s the picture he is painting with his comments.) Also against Garrett\u2019s favor, the Steelers issued a statement saying: \u201cMason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland. He will not discuss this accusation any further and his focus remains on preparation for Sunday\u2019s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\u201d To pile on even further, Rudolph\u2019s attorney, Timothy M Younger told reporters according to ESPN: \u201cIn his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur toward him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason\u2019s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension. This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett. \u201cThe malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason\u2019s integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment.\u201d Naturally, Rudolph\u2019s lawyer is putting a lot of extra on it and earning his fee while addressing the media about his client, but that\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do. All the chips are stacked against Garrett. To make matters worse, the NFL didn\u2019t budge on his appeal as they \u201cfound no such evidence\u201d that Rudolph used a racial slur. They also rejected what was probably a much better argument: that there were no witnesses, the coach didn\u2019t support his claim, and no teammate came forward in support either. According to ESPN\u2019s Dan Graziano, Garrett\u2019s team attempted to use a precedent-based argument pointing to the fact that the NFL\u2019s punishment of former Houston Texans defensive end Antonio Smith in 2013, when he swung a helmet at Richie Incognito of the Miami Dolphins, wasn\u2019t a suspension for the remainder of the season but only a ban of two preseason games and one regular-season contest. In addition, Garrett and the NFL players\u2019 union argued that an indefinite suspension was not legal under the guidelines of the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. So it comes as no surprise the NFL denied his appeal and upheld their original suspension. It doesn\u2019t mean that this didn\u2019t happen. But with no support, no one verifying the story and the coach not backing him, Garrett has painted himself into a corner where he\u2019s placed his fate in their hands. And as Coach Orr told me, more times than not, we will lose that battle.",

      "bodyText": "Consider the parsnip: fed to the pigs by the French and written out of Italian cuisine altogether. Unloved and overlooked, this root barely registers in British cooking, either, other than in the Christmas roast to keep the turkey and co company. But its sweet, starchy flesh can mash, crisp and roast as well as any potato. And here it binds a spell around flour to make excellent sweet and savoury gnocchi, which no Italian would ever recognise, but which work a charm with a hot-and-sour gochujang sauce. Parsnip and potato gnocchi with gochujang and hazelnuts Gochujang is a Korean red pepper paste that, once tasted, is never forgotten. It can be found in the world food aisle of larger supermarkets, most Asian food stores and online. The sauce needs no cooking, and can be adjusted to suit your own preferences.

Angela Merkel, with her quiet strength, dignity and abiding faith in the free world, shows us every day why we should choose optimism instead. Raised in an era of repression, stagnation and surveillance in East Germany, she has not wasted one breath of free air. She has spent her career in public life keeping alive the idea that we are bigger than our differences, that shared belief in powerful values can bind us closer than skin colour, or language, or national history.</p> <p>She has been an unshakable cornerstone of the European project. She has been a visionary advocate for carrying forward the fundamental right to privacy into the digital age. She has been a steady economic hand during years of crisis and rising uncertainty. And she has shown steadfast commitment to the values of freedom, inclusivity and the rule of law amid Europe\u2019s migration crisis. Through every twist and turn, through every seemingly intractable challenge, she has come out looking wiser, more prudent and more durable than those who have doubted her.</p> <p>Not merely a trailblazer as Germany\u2019s first female leader, she has become a great standard-bearer for what leadership ought to look like. In many instances, she could have made a much easier path for herself by banging on the podium and finding scapegoats, in trading long-term prosperity for short-term advantage. But she knows what lurks at the end of that road, and she has never been willing to take even a single step down it.</p> <p>I was fortunate to meet her for the first time in 2015, and every time we\u2019ve met since then she has been quick to flash that small, knowing smile, eyes crinkling with the conviction and confidence of a leader who has seen worse \u2013 and who knows, even when surrounded by doubters, that we are headed somewhere better. I admire her greatly, and I wish we had more like her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0350db9dd408abf293987adaf615ac6c33e5bff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0350db9dd408abf293987adaf615ac6c33e5bff/0_0_4242_2778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Ressa, talks to the media after posting bail at a Regional Trial Court following an overnight arrest by National Bureau of Investigation agents on a libel case, 14 February 2019 in Manila, Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Ressa faces the media in Manila after an overnight arrest on a libel case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bullit Marquez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Amal Clooney on Maria Ressa</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018She is a journalist who has chosen to risk her life to do her job and we are all better off as a result\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d05b1365ab40aa140f80fe56feb61fea1044af3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d05b1365ab40aa140f80fe56feb61fea1044af3f/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Amal Clooney\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amal Clooney</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied for Byline</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/amal-alamuddin\" title=\"\">Amal Clooney</a> is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London, </em><em>specialis</em><em>ing in international law and human rights. Here, she </em><em>nominates journalist Maria Ressa, who in 2012 co</em><em>founded <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/\" title=\"\">Rappler</a>, one of the first multimedia news websites in the Philippines.</em></p> <p>Maria Ressa is 5ft 2in, but she stands taller than most in her pursuit of the truth. Like any journalist in the Philippines, she has two choices: toe the government line and be safe; or risk her life to do her job. She has chosen the latter, and we are all better off as a result.</p> <p>Maria is a Filipino-American woman who became CNN\u2019s bureau chief in south-east Asia. Seven years ago, she teamed up with three female colleagues to set up the online news website Rappler. And very quickly it made waves.</p> <p>Rappler is now one of the most influential sites in the Philippines, and, like any responsible journalist, Maria has been critical of the government\u2019s record. Rappler has published reports on <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/214676-duterte-admits-role-philippine-navy-bong-go-frigates-issue\" title=\"\">corruption by President Duterte\u2019s administration</a>, his <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet\" title=\"\">weaponi</a><a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet\" title=\"\">sation</a><a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet\" title=\"\"> of social media</a> to silence critics, and his support for death squads that have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/philippines-war-drugs\" title=\"\">murdered</a> more than 27,000 Filipinos in the name of a war on drugs. The authorities have responded with the full weight of the state. Duterte has vilified Maria\u2019s reporting as \u201cfake news\u201d. He has helped amplify online attacks against her, and Rappler at one point had its operating licence revoked.</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s administration is now pursuing Maria through a series of prosecutions that seek to criminalise alleged sales of her company\u2019s stocks to a foreign entity, and directly target her reporting with charges of criminal libel. She now faces a sentence of up to 63 years behind bars. According to Maria\u2019s local lawyers, this is the first time in recent history that such laws have been used to target a journalist in one of Asia\u2019s oldest democracies. But it is a sign of things to come.</p> <p>This is why, Maria has told me, she has to defend herself against the charges. When I first met her, she was out on bail \u2013 as she is today \u2013 speaking at a conference in New York. When she asked me to act as her lawyer, I asked whether there was any judge in the Philippines who could be fair and independent enough to acquit her. She was not sure. I asked whether anyone other than Duterte would have the power to pardon her? They did not. Despite these odds, she went home. And I took the case. Because, as Maria explained, she is \u201cholding up the ceiling\u201d for anyone else who dares to speak.</p> <p>Doing so is already dangerous. The UN <a href=\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=23340\" title=\"\">has found</a> that there has been a \u201cdeterioration of the human rights situation\u201d under Duterte, including through the repeated targeting of journalists. The president has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-donald-trump-philippines-journalists-spies-human-rights-questions-asean-a8051946.html\" title=\"\">called journalists \u201cspies\u201d</a> and warned that they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/31/philippine-president-elect-says-corrupt-journalists-will-be-killed\" title=\"\">\u201cnot exempted from assassination\u201d</a>. If Maria, a US citizen, can now be locked up for doing her work, the message to other journalists and independent voices is clear: be quiet, or you\u2019ll be next.</p> <p>Maria\u2019s struggle is one that defines our times. Data gathered in the last few years shows more journalists being imprisoned and killed than at any time since records began, threatening the very foundations of democracy and a free society. Authoritarian leaders have every advantage over those they try to intimidate, yet people like Maria are fighting back.</p> <p>Maria is speaking truth to power. She is holding up the ceiling for others. If it comes crashing down, I will do all I can to get her out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e68c3ff173596e6358287d5f5e90e069b34f5d99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e68c3ff173596e6358287d5f5e90e069b34f5d99/0_541_4500_4780/941.jpg\" alt=\"Vitalik Buterin, programmer\" width=\"941\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vitalik Buterin: \u2018He is at the forefront of a new wave of globalism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Pines/The Forbes Collection/Contour RA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Micah White on Vitalik Buterin</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018People told me Occupy was a bad idea.

Here, he </em><em>nominates programmer Vitalik Buterin, who co</em><em>founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/blockchain-answer-life-universe-everything-bitcoin-technology\" title=\"\">cryptocurrency Ethereum.</a></em></p> <p>In activism, it\u2019s hard to break out of the consensus \u2013 to propose a new idea, and not let being shut down stop you. Vitalik Buterin has done just that. He\u2019s only 25. He invented Ethereum when he was 19 and studying Bitcoin. He basically wanted to embed a computer inside money, via programs known as smart contracts. The idea was rejected by the Bitcoin community, but he pushed forward, and now Ethereum is one of the decade\u2019s most promising technologies for social change.</p> <p>Vitalik is interested in how technology can be used for good. The Bitcoin community couldn\u2019t care less about that; they\u2019re just trying to make money. When I met Vitalik, he asked, \u201cDo you think we\u2019re going to be able to tokenise natural resources?\u201d What he meant was: can we take a natural resource and represent it as a cryptocurrency, so that the value of the coin increases if the resources are protected? This is a whole different direction for environmental activism.</p> <p>Ethereum is a system of smart contracts that are completely binding \u2013 they are unchangeable and publicly verifiable. Key aspects of international agreements, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">Paris </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">agreement to combat climate change</a>, could be more easily enforced if people could tell when promises had been broken. You\u2019d be shifting power away from corruptible international organisations. In that sense, Vitalik is at the forefront of a new wave of globalism.</p> <p>In the future we\u2019ll see other activists creating new forms of money that embody their economic ideals. I dream of redistributive currencies that automatically share a portion of each transaction with everyone in the economy. A lot of the ideas that have been floating around the left, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tobin-tax\" title=\"\">Robin Hood tax</a> on financial transactions, are hard to implement in the real world but easy to implement with a cryptocurrency. Imagine the reaction when governments realise global social movements are using Ethereum in ways that we never predicted.</p> <p>The most impactful changes come from the places that we least expect. When we came up with Occupy Wall Street, everyone told me it was a bad idea and they weren\u2019t interested. I see a similar reaction with Ethereum: people can\u2019t see its potential, and that is why it will defy them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6efe40873f0c27fc5e1f1f305500ed07e7e3e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6efe40873f0c27fc5e1f1f305500ed07e7e3e46/479_146_3477_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marai Larasi, activist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marai Larasi: \u2018She is there for people who have no one and nothing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Emma Watson on Marai Larasi</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018My abiding memory of the Globes?

She is all sorts of beautiful contradictions.</p> <p>She is contained, having carefully learned to wield her energy. She knows when to use it and when not to, and knows that \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence. She is passionately vegan, in the funniest, least self-aggrandising or patronising way possible. She just cocks her head sideways at people as if to say, \u201cWhat on earth are they doing, eating animals?\u201d She\u2019s a neat freak. Whatever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marie-kondo\" title=\"\">Marie Kondo</a> is on, Marai is on, too. Again, if the apocalypse comes, I\u2019m hiding out in Marai\u2019s room. She is heavy and light, old and young, an anvil that\u2019s fluid.</p> <p>My abiding memory of attending the Golden Globes with Marai? Two things. We picked tarot cards before we went, and she wore the best shoes I\u2019ve ever seen. I bought her fluffy Birkenstocks as a thank you gift, which her children think are an abomination. I am told she wears them anyway.</p> <p>I wish I could name the single most impactful thing she has done over the last decade, but I haven\u2019t known her long enough, and she is notoriously modest, rarely speaking about all that she is juggling. Personally, though, it was probably something incredibly simple she said to me the first time we met. We were at Imkaan and she introduced herself as a black lesbian feminist. Why, I asked, did she feel the need to define herself this specifically? She answered and later sent me an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\" title=\"\">Audre Lorde</a> quote explaining that it is our differences that make us more powerful, not weaker. Knowing our experiences are different doesn\u2019t fracture us; it makes us more intimate, stronger, more connected.</p> <p>I find her presence in the world profoundly comforting. I\u2019ve never met a woman I felt had more of the answers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70964eb84824271e8e7f838eb8fade8ccb635712\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70964eb84824271e8e7f838eb8fade8ccb635712/580_0_3083_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yann Lecun, AI scientist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"865\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yann LeCun: \u2018Image recognition wouldn\u2019t be possible without his work.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg/via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger on Yann LeCun</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018If you see a self-driving car, or scan a cheque with your bank\u2019s app \u2013 that\u2019s all down to Yann\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eeb5ac1a0c40f1446e0104b3d51c7801faea029d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb5ac1a0c40f1446e0104b3d51c7801faea029d/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kevin Systrom\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Systrom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied for Byline</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger </em><em>launched the photo-sharing app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> in 2010, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/25/instagram-founders-quit-amid-suspected-clash-with-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">stepping down last year</a>.

She has dedicated her life to it. I don\u2019t think enough people recognise how extraordinary she is. A lot of very famous women were credited [for #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up] and, while I\u2019m not undermining them, I do think the way in which we celebrated the movement could have included Tarana more. I didn\u2019t come across her work until a couple of years ago, because of her lack of privilege, and it\u2019s such vital work for our generation and the generations after.</p> <p>There has been tremendous, palpable progress with #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, and the topic is now mainstream. People who perhaps weren\u2019t well versed in the nuance of consent are now looking back on their own sexual history and wondering what they could have done to be more sensitive. It has changed sex. That\u2019s enormous in terms of an impact.</p> <p>I\u2019m a sexual assault survivor, and Tarana\u2019s work has meant the world to me because I feel a sense of community. She has afforded us a dignity and the right to speak out. There was a moment where women started to push back against men who claimed they were victims of sexual assault, too, and Tarana was one of the first people to step out and say #MeToo is for everyone. This isn\u2019t just a women\u2019s movement: this is for all survivors.</p> <p>A lot of people have stopped talking about #MeToo; we see less of the Time\u2019s Up logo, and conversations have moved on. But she hasn\u2019t. She goes to schools and talks to children. She is invested in the next generation, and I think that\u2019s truly the path to change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5aeade2e528d91eae28bd7c9468d63844fb8e3b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aeade2e528d91eae28bd7c9468d63844fb8e3b1/94_45_2784_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Fonda demonstrates in front of the White House during the Fire Drill Friday climate change protest on in Washington, DC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"906\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Fonda at a Fire Drill Friday climate change protest in Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Caitlyn Jenner on Jane Fonda</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018Jane and I had skin cancer at the same time.

She is setting a great example, at 81, that age shouldn\u2019t stop you standing up for what you believe in. Her activism on Capitol Hill, to fight climate change, is making the world a better place for younger generations, and setting an example for them, as well. I admire her commitment to a cause that is so important for our future.</p> <p>Jane and I went through a skin cancer scare at the same time. Hers was on her lip and mine was on my nose. Growing up in the 50s and 60s, sunscreen wasn\u2019t a big thing. My parents weren\u2019t lathering me up with SPF before I played outside. I admire how Jane had no qualms about doing press with a bandage on her face and speaking out about what she was going through. </p> <p>In 2005, [alongside Gloria Steinem and Robin Morgan] Jane founded the <a href=\"https://www.womensmediacenter.com/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Media Center</a>, a nonprofit organisation whose goal is to ensure women are represented in the media. Diversity in film and TV is an important cause to me, and I have been working on trans representation these past few years.</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that Jane\u2019s activism began long before this decade. She started speaking out on politics in the 1970s, and hasn\u2019t stopped being vocal about race equality, women\u2019s rights and the environment, whatever the consequences. The world is a better place with her in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abd47547ee44195f7fe3b08f5c2a194d7a0c8729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd47547ee44195f7fe3b08f5c2a194d7a0c8729/263_72_2029_1683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toyin Ojih Odutola, artist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"829\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toyin Ojih Odutola: \u2018A profound and masterfully skilled visual storyteller.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vicente Munoz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Solange Knowles on Toyin Ojih Odutola</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018We met as babies on Tumblr.

When I saw her images for the first time I was stunned and moved, and emailed her to tell her. We\u2019ve been friends ever since. Each year I learn more and more from her \u2013 she is boundless. I remember seeing <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/toyin-ojih-odutola-all-these-garlands-prove-nothing-viii\" title=\"\">All These Garlands Prove Nothing VIII</a> at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York in 2013, and the eyes followed me around everywhere I went. There were so many confrontations and complexities about identity that spoke to me and pierced me.</p> <p>Toyin is passionate and honest, and the most intelligent woman I know. She does not apologise for any of it. She dedicates herself to her work like no one else I\u2019ve seen, and both takes up and protects the space she deserves. When I\u2019m on the straw I think is my last, she always says something to remind me of my power. But within all of it, there is a beautiful, nurturing kindness that is so genuine and true. I strive to be more like her every day.</p> <p>Prior to creating my film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/01/solange-when-i-get-home-review-pharell-williams-sampha-tyler-the-creator\" title=\"\">When I Get Home</a>, Toyin and I would often speak about the limitlessness of blackness as a dimension, a space and universe. I was very comfortable with the palette I had been using, and comforted by the light and lightness in my work, but it couldn\u2019t have been further from where life was taking me. Toyin helped me reimagine and lean into the vastness and endlessness of blackness, and embrace that in film making.</p> <p>I remember her saying, \u201cHow do I make that whiteness \u2018other\u2019, so that it\u2019s no longer a black mark on a white ground but the other way around?\u201d Even in Toyin\u2019s early works, the materials she used \u2013 black ballpoint, graphite and charcoal \u2013 all speak very loud and clear to this. I thank her for ushering in new considerations of all the endless possibilities and ways to emphasise blackness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99a3fde62b8d9860d75475ae13d5aaf86b2bad86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a3fde62b8d9860d75475ae13d5aaf86b2bad86/0_0_2291_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Karr, writer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"856\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Karr: \u2018So many have been changed by her steady love.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Sandoval/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lena Dunham on Mary Karr</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018Time with Mary, though rare, leaves me dancing down the street.

Here, she </em><em>nominates</em><em> Mary Karr, who published The Art </em><em>Of Memoir in 2015, and teaches at Syracuse University in New York.</em></p> <p>When you hear the word changemaker, there are some obvious visuals: a politician visiting a foreign climate in a hazmat suit. The inventor of a cancer drug doing something with beakers. Someone testifying before Congress, loudly yelling, \u201cI object, sir!\u201d then emerging triumphant on to grey stone steps. But what of the quiet, private change that happens in mundane places, in church basements and on street corners with a cup of coffee, and sitting in sticky pleather chairs in a doctor\u2019s waiting room, a comforting hand on a shaking back? What about the people who quietly rescue others every day and, in a beautiful twist, tell no one?</p> <p>Mary Karr is a writer, memoirist and poet whose book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/24/biography.features\" title=\"\">The Liar\u2019s Club</a> burst on to the scene in 1995, sitting on the New York Times bestsellers list for over a year. In it, Karr details her appallingly rough childhood with the steel-trap sense of humour that has come to define her work. Since then she\u2019s explored issues of addiction, religion and self-actualisation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/24/biography.features1\" title=\"\">Cherry</a>, Lit and The Art of Memoir.</p> <p>I first met Mary six years ago, standing nervously to the side at a Christmas party, and found her affection so positively overwhelming that I teared up in the taxi home. I was pleased to find that the woman who had written such lines as, \u201cFor me, everything\u2019s too much and nothing\u2019s enough\u201d was as pithy and powerful as her pages.</p> <p>Our friendship was a casually intense one \u2013 time together, though rare, left me dancing down the street \u2013 until one day in early 2018 when, racked with fear and hooked on medication I\u2019d been told would make me well, I called her. I knew she was an alcoholic in recovery. I knew she helped others suffering from addiction. But I didn\u2019t have a plan for the call, just what was left of my voice, timid and quaking. Good thing she did have a plan, one she\u2019s executed countless times, and she single-handedly dragged me back to the world of the living by telling me there were places that addicts gathered and that those places would welcome me.</p> <p>She celebrated my milestones, even the tiniest ones, with candy and sushi and socks. She sat by my side in the hospital when early sobriety delivered a blow in the form of a health emergency. Somehow, she was there for me while also doing the same for others, and never forgetting to grade assignments or work on her own book.</p> <p>Before I knew Mary, her writing reminded me that memoir, especially memoir by women, has a purpose and a place. It\u2019s necessary to tell our stories and to listen to others\u2019. Mary writes, as she\u2019d say, like her hair is on fire: with an urgency, the need to expel and express. And she gives us permission to follow suit. She is also deeply engaged in making sure that addiction doesn\u2019t swallow any more into its giant whale\u2019s mouth. She does none of this for the glory of it all, because really there is none. </p> <p>\u201cMy head thinks it can kill me\u2026 and go on living without me,\u201d she writes in Lit, perfectly summing up the broken thinking of a drunk on the loose. But I cannot live without her, as a writer or as an addict. And I am one of so many \u2013 readers, students, people who bumped into her in the back room of a church \u2013 who have been changed by her steady love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a98370d9b0286b667335e0d81ed26324a5955b6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98370d9b0286b667335e0d81ed26324a5955b6c/442_0_4435_3344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg with other student environmental advocates during a strike to demand action be taken on climate change outside the White House on September 13, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Thunberg: \u2018She is the reason we are all talking about our planet.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tom Daley on Greta Thunberg</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018I want my son to have a future.

Here, he nominates German chancellor Angela Merkel. These are challenging times, and naysayers may tell you to measure this decade by its darkest moments. Angela Merkel, with her quiet strength, dignity and abiding faith in the free world, shows us every day why we should choose optimism instead. Raised in an era of repression, stagnation and surveillance in East Germany, she has not wasted one breath of free air. She has spent her career in public life keeping alive the idea that we are bigger than our differences, that shared belief in powerful values can bind us closer than skin colour, or language, or national history. She has been an unshakable cornerstone of the European project. She has been a visionary advocate for carrying forward the fundamental right to privacy into the digital age. She has been a steady economic hand during years of crisis and rising uncertainty. And she has shown steadfast commitment to the values of freedom, inclusivity and the rule of law amid Europe\u2019s migration crisis. Through every twist and turn, through every seemingly intractable challenge, she has come out looking wiser, more prudent and more durable than those who have doubted her. Not merely a trailblazer as Germany\u2019s first female leader, she has become a great standard-bearer for what leadership ought to look like. In many instances, she could have made a much easier path for herself by banging on the podium and finding scapegoats, in trading long-term prosperity for short-term advantage. But she knows what lurks at the end of that road, and she has never been willing to take even a single step down it. I was fortunate to meet her for the first time in 2015, and every time we\u2019ve met since then she has been quick to flash that small, knowing smile, eyes crinkling with the conviction and confidence of a leader who has seen worse \u2013 and who knows, even when surrounded by doubters, that we are headed somewhere better. I admire her greatly, and I wish we had more like her. Amal Clooney on Maria Ressa \u2018She is a journalist who has chosen to risk her life to do her job and we are all better off as a result\u2019 Amal Clooney is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London, specialising in international law and human rights. Here, she nominates journalist Maria Ressa, who in 2012 cofounded Rappler, one of the first multimedia news websites in the Philippines. Maria Ressa is 5ft 2in, but she stands taller than most in her pursuit of the truth. Like any journalist in the Philippines, she has two choices: toe the government line and be safe; or risk her life to do her job. She has chosen the latter, and we are all better off as a result. Maria is a Filipino-American woman who became CNN\u2019s bureau chief in south-east Asia. Seven years ago, she teamed up with three female colleagues to set up the online news website Rappler. And very quickly it made waves. Rappler is now one of the most influential sites in the Philippines, and, like any responsible journalist, Maria has been critical of the government\u2019s record. Rappler has published reports on corruption by President Duterte\u2019s administration, his weaponisation of social media to silence critics, and his support for death squads that have reportedly murdered more than 27,000 Filipinos in the name of a war on drugs. The authorities have responded with the full weight of the state. Duterte has vilified Maria\u2019s reporting as \u201cfake news\u201d. He has helped amplify online attacks against her, and Rappler at one point had its operating licence revoked. Duterte\u2019s administration is now pursuing Maria through a series of prosecutions that seek to criminalise alleged sales of her company\u2019s stocks to a foreign entity, and directly target her reporting with charges of criminal libel. She now faces a sentence of up to 63 years behind bars. According to Maria\u2019s local lawyers, this is the first time in recent history that such laws have been used to target a journalist in one of Asia\u2019s oldest democracies. But it is a sign of things to come. This is why, Maria has told me, she has to defend herself against the charges. When I first met her, she was out on bail \u2013 as she is today \u2013 speaking at a conference in New York. When she asked me to act as her lawyer, I asked whether there was any judge in the Philippines who could be fair and independent enough to acquit her. She was not sure. I asked whether anyone other than Duterte would have the power to pardon her? They did not. Despite these odds, she went home. And I took the case. Because, as Maria explained, she is \u201cholding up the ceiling\u201d for anyone else who dares to speak. Doing so is already dangerous. The UN has found that there has been a \u201cdeterioration of the human rights situation\u201d under Duterte, including through the repeated targeting of journalists. The president has called journalists \u201cspies\u201d and warned that they are \u201cnot exempted from assassination\u201d. If Maria, a US citizen, can now be locked up for doing her work, the message to other journalists and independent voices is clear: be quiet, or you\u2019ll be next. Maria\u2019s struggle is one that defines our times. Data gathered in the last few years shows more journalists being imprisoned and killed than at any time since records began, threatening the very foundations of democracy and a free society. Authoritarian leaders have every advantage over those they try to intimidate, yet people like Maria are fighting back. Maria is speaking truth to power. She is holding up the ceiling for others. If it comes crashing down, I will do all I can to get her out. Micah White on Vitalik Buterin \u2018People told me Occupy was a bad idea. Vitalik\u2019s cryptocurrency will defy people in the same way\u2019 Micah White founded the economic protest movement Occupy Wall Street in 2011. He published The End Of Protest: A New Playbook For Revolution in 2016. Here, he nominates programmer Vitalik Buterin, who cofounded the cryptocurrency Ethereum. In activism, it\u2019s hard to break out of the consensus \u2013 to propose a new idea, and not let being shut down stop you. Vitalik Buterin has done just that. He\u2019s only 25. He invented Ethereum when he was 19 and studying Bitcoin. He basically wanted to embed a computer inside money, via programs known as smart contracts. The idea was rejected by the Bitcoin community, but he pushed forward, and now Ethereum is one of the decade\u2019s most promising technologies for social change. Vitalik is interested in how technology can be used for good. The Bitcoin community couldn\u2019t care less about that; they\u2019re just trying to make money. When I met Vitalik, he asked, \u201cDo you think we\u2019re going to be able to tokenise natural resources?\u201d What he meant was: can we take a natural resource and represent it as a cryptocurrency, so that the value of the coin increases if the resources are protected? This is a whole different direction for environmental activism. Ethereum is a system of smart contracts that are completely binding \u2013 they are unchangeable and publicly verifiable. Key aspects of international agreements, such as the Paris agreement to combat climate change, could be more easily enforced if people could tell when promises had been broken. You\u2019d be shifting power away from corruptible international organisations. In that sense, Vitalik is at the forefront of a new wave of globalism. In the future we\u2019ll see other activists creating new forms of money that embody their economic ideals. I dream of redistributive currencies that automatically share a portion of each transaction with everyone in the economy. A lot of the ideas that have been floating around the left, like the Robin Hood tax on financial transactions, are hard to implement in the real world but easy to implement with a cryptocurrency. Imagine the reaction when governments realise global social movements are using Ethereum in ways that we never predicted. The most impactful changes come from the places that we least expect. When we came up with Occupy Wall Street, everyone told me it was a bad idea and they weren\u2019t interested. I see a similar reaction with Ethereum: people can\u2019t see its potential, and that is why it will defy them. Emma Watson on Marai Larasi \u2018My abiding memory of the Globes? We picked tarot cards together and she wore the best shoes\u2019 Actor Emma Watson was appointed UN Women goodwill ambassador in 2014 and helped launch HeForShe, a UN campaign for the advancement of gender equality. Here, she nominates Marai Larasi MBE, who was until recently the executive director of black feminist organisation Imkaan and co-chair of the End Violence Against Women coalition. In 2018, she and Watson attended the Golden Globes together as part of the launch of Time\u2019s Up. Marai Larasi is mother to Ikamara and Jahred, but she is a mother to many. She is the person on the frontline of the issues I care about in the UK \u2013 from feminism to LGBTQI+ rights. Throughout this decade, Marai has supported and championed women who have survived unimaginable abuses. She is there for people who have no one and nothing, in their hardest moments. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen in the next decade? If the apocalypse comes, I\u2019d ride into battle in her wake. This would definitely make her laugh because she is the least violent person I know, in word, gesture and thought, even though she speaks beautifully about rage. She is all sorts of beautiful contradictions. She is contained, having carefully learned to wield her energy. She knows when to use it and when not to, and knows that \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence. She is passionately vegan, in the funniest, least self-aggrandising or patronising way possible. She just cocks her head sideways at people as if to say, \u201cWhat on earth are they doing, eating animals?\u201d She\u2019s a neat freak. Whatever Marie Kondo is on, Marai is on, too. Again, if the apocalypse comes, I\u2019m hiding out in Marai\u2019s room. She is heavy and light, old and young, an anvil that\u2019s fluid. My abiding memory of attending the Golden Globes with Marai? Two things. We picked tarot cards before we went, and she wore the best shoes I\u2019ve ever seen. I bought her fluffy Birkenstocks as a thank you gift, which her children think are an abomination. I am told she wears them anyway. I wish I could name the single most impactful thing she has done over the last decade, but I haven\u2019t known her long enough, and she is notoriously modest, rarely speaking about all that she is juggling. Personally, though, it was probably something incredibly simple she said to me the first time we met. We were at Imkaan and she introduced herself as a black lesbian feminist. Why, I asked, did she feel the need to define herself this specifically? She answered and later sent me an Audre Lorde quote explaining that it is our differences that make us more powerful, not weaker. Knowing our experiences are different doesn\u2019t fracture us; it makes us more intimate, stronger, more connected. I find her presence in the world profoundly comforting. I\u2019ve never met a woman I felt had more of the answers. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger on Yann LeCun \u2018If you see a self-driving car, or scan a cheque with your bank\u2019s app \u2013 that\u2019s all down to Yann\u2019 Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger launched the photo-sharing app Instagram in 2010, before stepping down last year. Here, they nominate Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Facebook. Kevin Systrom When Mike and I left, we asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s had the most effect on Instagram over the years?\u201d And we both agreed it was machine learning. Yann LeCun is one of the very few people to move it from being a buzzword to something that really mattered to companies and academics alike. Machine learning revolutionised Instagram, from suggesting friends to follow, to watching out for objectionable content. Image recognition wouldn\u2019t be possible without Yann\u2019s work. It has transformed all sorts of industries. Being able to look at satellite data and understand global warming, or content on Instagram that needs to be followed up by law enforcement \u2013 the things that keep people safe or transform the world in a meaningful way wouldn\u2019t be possible without him. Mike Krieger Yann has been in the field of AI and machine learning since the late 80s, but it\u2019s only in the last 10 years that the rest of the industry has caught up; his impact is now everywhere. If you\u2019re on the street and you see a self-driving car, or you\u2019re on Instagram and you feel safe because something has been removed, or if you do something as trivial as scanning a cheque using your bank\u2019s app, that\u2019s all down to Yann. The whole area of how AI can keep us safe online will continue to be important as the amount of content posted on all of these networks grows. In the next 10 years, Yann will be able to take machine learning from something that was typically done on very large computers to something that runs on people\u2019s phones. It can help you take better photos because it knows what\u2019s in the image; it can help you solve all kinds of problems. Jameela Jamil on Tarana Burke \u2018I\u2019m a sexual assault survivor and Tarana\u2019s work has given me a sense of community\u2019 Jameela Jamil is an actor and activist behind the 2018 movement I Weigh. Here, she nominates civil rights activist Tarana Burke, who founded the original Me Too campaign in 2006. Tarana Burke is a woman who has used her own sexual assault as a tool to help and empower other survivors. She has dedicated her life to it. I don\u2019t think enough people recognise how extraordinary she is. A lot of very famous women were credited [for #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up] and, while I\u2019m not undermining them, I do think the way in which we celebrated the movement could have included Tarana more. I didn\u2019t come across her work until a couple of years ago, because of her lack of privilege, and it\u2019s such vital work for our generation and the generations after. There has been tremendous, palpable progress with #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, and the topic is now mainstream. People who perhaps weren\u2019t well versed in the nuance of consent are now looking back on their own sexual history and wondering what they could have done to be more sensitive. It has changed sex. That\u2019s enormous in terms of an impact. I\u2019m a sexual assault survivor, and Tarana\u2019s work has meant the world to me because I feel a sense of community. She has afforded us a dignity and the right to speak out. There was a moment where women started to push back against men who claimed they were victims of sexual assault, too, and Tarana was one of the first people to step out and say #MeToo is for everyone. This isn\u2019t just a women\u2019s movement: this is for all survivors. A lot of people have stopped talking about #MeToo; we see less of the Time\u2019s Up logo, and conversations have moved on. But she hasn\u2019t. She goes to schools and talks to children. She is invested in the next generation, and I think that\u2019s truly the path to change. Caitlyn Jenner on Jane Fonda \u2018Jane and I had skin cancer at the same time. I admired how she did press with a bandage on\u2019 Caitlyn Jenner is a former Olympic gold medalist who came out as a trans woman in 2015. She published her memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, in 2017 and founded the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation to promote equality and combat discrimination. Here, she nominates Jane Fonda, whom she first met at Studio 54 in the 70s. I want to applaud Jane Fonda\u2019s work as a female activist. She is setting a great example, at 81, that age shouldn\u2019t stop you standing up for what you believe in. Her activism on Capitol Hill, to fight climate change, is making the world a better place for younger generations, and setting an example for them, as well. I admire her commitment to a cause that is so important for our future. Jane and I went through a skin cancer scare at the same time. Hers was on her lip and mine was on my nose. Growing up in the 50s and 60s, sunscreen wasn\u2019t a big thing. My parents weren\u2019t lathering me up with SPF before I played outside. I admire how Jane had no qualms about doing press with a bandage on her face and speaking out about what she was going through. In 2005, [alongside Gloria Steinem and Robin Morgan] Jane founded the Women\u2019s Media Center, a nonprofit organisation whose goal is to ensure women are represented in the media. Diversity in film and TV is an important cause to me, and I have been working on trans representation these past few years. It\u2019s notable that Jane\u2019s activism began long before this decade. She started speaking out on politics in the 1970s, and hasn\u2019t stopped being vocal about race equality, women\u2019s rights and the environment, whatever the consequences. The world is a better place with her in it. Solange Knowles on Toyin Ojih Odutola \u2018We met as babies on Tumblr. Her early work \u2013 using ballpoint, charcoal \u2013 speaks loud and clear\u2019 Solange Knowles is a Grammy-award winning musician and visual artist. Here, she nominates the artist Toyin Ojih Odutola. Toyin Ojih Odutola is one of the most profound and masterfully skilled visual storytellers of my generation. Her drawings take the lives of the noble, the proud, the gentle and grounded, and make them all exceptional characters who speak to you from out of the frame. She dismantles the myths of \u201crepresentation\u201d and exhibits them in a language which is truly her own. We first met in 2011 as little babies on Tumblr. When I saw her images for the first time I was stunned and moved, and emailed her to tell her. We\u2019ve been friends ever since. Each year I learn more and more from her \u2013 she is boundless. I remember seeing All These Garlands Prove Nothing VIII at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York in 2013, and the eyes followed me around everywhere I went. There were so many confrontations and complexities about identity that spoke to me and pierced me. Toyin is passionate and honest, and the most intelligent woman I know. She does not apologise for any of it. She dedicates herself to her work like no one else I\u2019ve seen, and both takes up and protects the space she deserves. When I\u2019m on the straw I think is my last, she always says something to remind me of my power. But within all of it, there is a beautiful, nurturing kindness that is so genuine and true. I strive to be more like her every day. Prior to creating my film When I Get Home, Toyin and I would often speak about the limitlessness of blackness as a dimension, a space and universe. I was very comfortable with the palette I had been using, and comforted by the light and lightness in my work, but it couldn\u2019t have been further from where life was taking me. Toyin helped me reimagine and lean into the vastness and endlessness of blackness, and embrace that in film making. I remember her saying, \u201cHow do I make that whiteness \u2018other\u2019, so that it\u2019s no longer a black mark on a white ground but the other way around?\u201d Even in Toyin\u2019s early works, the materials she used \u2013 black ballpoint, graphite and charcoal \u2013 all speak very loud and clear to this. I thank her for ushering in new considerations of all the endless possibilities and ways to emphasise blackness. Lena Dunham on Mary Karr \u2018Time with Mary, though rare, leaves me dancing down the street. She writes as if her hair is on fire\u2019 Lena Dunham is an actor, writer and film-maker, and creator of HBO\u2019s Girls. Here, she nominates Mary Karr, who published The Art Of Memoir in 2015, and teaches at Syracuse University in New York. When you hear the word changemaker, there are some obvious visuals: a politician visiting a foreign climate in a hazmat suit. The inventor of a cancer drug doing something with beakers. Someone testifying before Congress, loudly yelling, \u201cI object, sir!\u201d then emerging triumphant on to grey stone steps. But what of the quiet, private change that happens in mundane places, in church basements and on street corners with a cup of coffee, and sitting in sticky pleather chairs in a doctor\u2019s waiting room, a comforting hand on a shaking back? What about the people who quietly rescue others every day and, in a beautiful twist, tell no one? Mary Karr is a writer, memoirist and poet whose book The Liar\u2019s Club burst on to the scene in 1995, sitting on the New York Times bestsellers list for over a year. In it, Karr details her appallingly rough childhood with the steel-trap sense of humour that has come to define her work. Since then she\u2019s explored issues of addiction, religion and self-actualisation in Cherry, Lit and The Art of Memoir. I first met Mary six years ago, standing nervously to the side at a Christmas party, and found her affection so positively overwhelming that I teared up in the taxi home. I was pleased to find that the woman who had written such lines as, \u201cFor me, everything\u2019s too much and nothing\u2019s enough\u201d was as pithy and powerful as her pages. Our friendship was a casually intense one \u2013 time together, though rare, left me dancing down the street \u2013 until one day in early 2018 when, racked with fear and hooked on medication I\u2019d been told would make me well, I called her. I knew she was an alcoholic in recovery. I knew she helped others suffering from addiction. But I didn\u2019t have a plan for the call, just what was left of my voice, timid and quaking. Good thing she did have a plan, one she\u2019s executed countless times, and she single-handedly dragged me back to the world of the living by telling me there were places that addicts gathered and that those places would welcome me. She celebrated my milestones, even the tiniest ones, with candy and sushi and socks. She sat by my side in the hospital when early sobriety delivered a blow in the form of a health emergency. Somehow, she was there for me while also doing the same for others, and never forgetting to grade assignments or work on her own book. Before I knew Mary, her writing reminded me that memoir, especially memoir by women, has a purpose and a place. It\u2019s necessary to tell our stories and to listen to others\u2019. Mary writes, as she\u2019d say, like her hair is on fire: with an urgency, the need to expel and express. And she gives us permission to follow suit. She is also deeply engaged in making sure that addiction doesn\u2019t swallow any more into its giant whale\u2019s mouth. She does none of this for the glory of it all, because really there is none. \u201cMy head thinks it can kill me\u2026 and go on living without me,\u201d she writes in Lit, perfectly summing up the broken thinking of a drunk on the loose. But I cannot live without her, as a writer or as an addict. And I am one of so many \u2013 readers, students, people who bumped into her in the back room of a church \u2013 who have been changed by her steady love. Tom Daley on Greta Thunberg \u2018I want my son to have a future. Greta inspires me\u2019 Tom Daley is a British diver who won two gold medals for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and took home bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Here, he nominates Greta Thunberg. There has been a lot of change in the past 10 years \u2013 marriage equality being a big one for me [Daley married Dustin Lance Black in 2017]. But the issue on everyone\u2019s lips is climate change. We\u2019ve all had a big wake-up call, thanks to Greta Thunberg. She is the reason we are all talking about our planet. She is the reason people are protesting all over the world. She has reached so many people, and that\u2019s how real change can be brought about. Greta\u2019s speech at the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit blew me away \u2013 seeing a young person holding older people accountable for what they are and are not doing. I want my son to have a planet he can live on, and his children, too. There are easy lifestyle changes we can all make. I\u2019ve reduced the amount of meat and dairy I eat; I recycle everything I can and I don\u2019t waste things. Wherever possible I use public transport, too. Greta has inspired me, and a new generation. \u2022 Interviews with Micah White, Kevin Systrom, Mike Krieger and Jameela Jamil by Martha Hayes.

      "body": "<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ruled out scrapping GP home visits after doctors backed the idea in a vote, arguing that they were too over-stretched to deliver the service.</p> <p>Delegates representing GPs across England at a British Medical Association conference voted to try to remove the duty from their standard contract, after complaints that they were wasting time driving around the country.</p> <p>The move clears the way for BMA representatives to lobby NHS England over the measure, but Hancock said the idea was a \u201ccomplete non-starter\u201d, and he was firmly opposed to the plan.</p> <p>\u201cThe GPs had a vote on what their opening negotiating position should be for the next GP contract. The idea that people shouldn\u2019t be able, when they need it, to have a home visit from a GP is a complete non-starter and it won\u2019t succeed in their negotiations,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, people need to be able to see their GP and we\u2019re putting huge amounts of extra resources into training, funding and hiring more GPs, and the other practice staff, which are also so important. But you do need, sometimes, for the GP to be able to go and see somebody.\u201d</p> <p>Challenged on whether it specifically needs to be an overstretched GP visiting, rather than another medical professional, Hancock replied: \u201cSometimes it should be somebody else.

      "bodyText": "The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has ruled out scrapping GP home visits after doctors backed the idea in a vote, arguing that they were too over-stretched to deliver the service. Delegates representing GPs across England at a British Medical Association conference voted to try to remove the duty from their standard contract, after complaints that they were wasting time driving around the country. The move clears the way for BMA representatives to lobby NHS England over the measure, but Hancock said the idea was a \u201ccomplete non-starter\u201d, and he was firmly opposed to the plan. \u201cThe GPs had a vote on what their opening negotiating position should be for the next GP contract. The idea that people shouldn\u2019t be able, when they need it, to have a home visit from a GP is a complete non-starter and it won\u2019t succeed in their negotiations,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cOf course, people need to be able to see their GP and we\u2019re putting huge amounts of extra resources into training, funding and hiring more GPs, and the other practice staff, which are also so important. But you do need, sometimes, for the GP to be able to go and see somebody.\u201d Challenged on whether it specifically needs to be an overstretched GP visiting, rather than another medical professional, Hancock replied: \u201cSometimes it should be somebody else. Indeed, most home visits are done by nurses and that\u2019s right but sometimes you need the GP.\u201d At the Local Medical Committee England Conference on Friday, a majority of delegates supported a proposal to remove home visits from the doctors\u2019 key contract.

      "body": "<p>In the decidedly un-macho tea room of a London members\u2019 club, Liam Williams is chronicling the evolution of that most contentious of contemporary archetypes: the modern lad. First came the humble variety: \u201ca Yorkshire or a Shropshire lad, there was an innocence and a pluckiness to it.\u201d Yet during the comedian\u2019s school days, lairy 1990s \u201cnew lad\u201d culture meant \u201cthere was already something a bit troublesome about it. And by the time I got to university there was the uni lad. It wasn\u2019t so anchored to pride in a working-class identity any more; it was much more about obnoxious masculinity. And then in the last 10 years, we\u2019ve had the sad lad subcultures, the irony lad.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Williams argues, the lad is rearing his ugly head in the political classes, with both Donald Trump and Boris Johnson practising \u201cthat laddish recklessness and fecklessness. Something close to laddish idiocy is dominating global politics.\u201d</p> <p>The lad is something Williams has been thinking about a lot lately. That\u2019s because the comedian is about to debut his new BBC Three comedy, Ladhood, a meditation on modern manhood adapted from his Radio 4 series of the same name. The show traces the impact of the teenage Liam\u2019s boyish scrapes in mid-00s Garforth (the Leeds suburb where he grew up) on his present-day life in London, where he says he remains coated in a \u201cresidue of laddishness, for better or worse. Largely for worse.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/04/liam-williams-edinburgh-festival-2014\">Liam Williams: 'I've had nervous breakdowns on stage'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At once a 00s nostalgia trip (the soundtrack features the likes of Lumidee\u2019s Never Leave You, while Williams put much effort into ensuring the characters\u2019 tracksuit bottoms had an authentic fit) and a serious examination of what it means to be a 21st-century man, Ladhood\u2019s voiceover also provides a chance to luxuriate in Williams\u2019s trademark droll lyricism.

He is fresh off the phone from a chat to his old friend Steve Parkin, now Sunderland\u2019s assistant manager and shakes his head at football\u2019s fragility. \u201cHow has a club as big as that fallen into League One?\u201d he muses.</p> <p>League One was Sheffield United\u2019s habitat when Wilder took over in the ninth year of their own top-tier exile. Among his first acts was the ripping down of motivational slogans festooning the training ground with particular disdain reserved for the message \u201cWelcome to Work.\u201d Many coaches swear by such psychological gambits but, as a nonconformist in an increasingly uniform world, Wilder delights in challenging popular convention and deemed them patronising.</p> <p>The 52-year-old has been around the block a few times, acquiring an intense dislike of artifice and spin or, as he terms it, \u201cbullshit\u201d along the way. Life in the eye of financial storms as the manager at Alfreton, Halifax and, later, Northampton \u2013 where he went unpaid for three months \u2013 acquainted him with the experience of having his card declined at a supermarket checkout and perhaps explains why he is not getting carried away by United\u2019s stunning start to the season. \u201cPoints wise, there\u2019s not a lot of difference between fifth and 15th,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some tough challenges ahead.\u201d</p> <p>For the moment, though, Wilder is being lauded as the Premier League\u2019s most original tactical innovator since Pep Guardiola while fielding sometimes exclusively British/Irish starting XIs trailing deep non-league and lower league roots.

      "bodyText": "Chris Wilder bounds up the stairs and declines an invitation to sample the exotic array of coffees available from the shiny new espresso machine sitting proudly on a corner table. It is shortly before 10am on Friday morning at Sheffield United\u2019s suburban hilltop training ground and slate grey rain clouds obscure the neat rows of semi-detached houses tumbling down to the heart of the city below. Wilder, though, has little need of a caffeine boost as he surveys the scene from the high veldt of fifth in the Premier League, two places above Manchester United before Sunday\u2019s meeting between the pair at Bramall Lane. Three years and two promotions after his installation in South Yorkshire, Sheffield United\u2019s manager jokes about \u201criding the wave\u201d with the small group of reporters gathered for his weekly media debrief but first makes a point of shaking everyone\u2019s hand and politely asking them individual questions while making engaging small talk. He is fresh off the phone from a chat to his old friend Steve Parkin, now Sunderland\u2019s assistant manager and shakes his head at football\u2019s fragility. \u201cHow has a club as big as that fallen into League One?\u201d he muses. League One was Sheffield United\u2019s habitat when Wilder took over in the ninth year of their own top-tier exile. Among his first acts was the ripping down of motivational slogans festooning the training ground with particular disdain reserved for the message \u201cWelcome to Work.\u201d Many coaches swear by such psychological gambits but, as a nonconformist in an increasingly uniform world, Wilder delights in challenging popular convention and deemed them patronising. The 52-year-old has been around the block a few times, acquiring an intense dislike of artifice and spin or, as he terms it, \u201cbullshit\u201d along the way. Life in the eye of financial storms as the manager at Alfreton, Halifax and, later, Northampton \u2013 where he went unpaid for three months \u2013 acquainted him with the experience of having his card declined at a supermarket checkout and perhaps explains why he is not getting carried away by United\u2019s stunning start to the season. \u201cPoints wise, there\u2019s not a lot of difference between fifth and 15th,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some tough challenges ahead.\u201d For the moment, though, Wilder is being lauded as the Premier League\u2019s most original tactical innovator since Pep Guardiola while fielding sometimes exclusively British/Irish starting XIs trailing deep non-league and lower league roots. French striker Lys Mousset \u2013 whose orange Lamborghini stands out in the cramped training ground car park \u2013 is an extremely rare foreign import, while a nucleus of the team were either free transfers or cost less than \u00a31m. \u201cTen of the 11 that played our last game [a draw] at Tottenham were in the Championship with us last season,\u201d says Wilder. \u201cBut then not a lot of us here had any Premier League experience before August.\u201d That apparent shortfall failed to prevent him from devising a complicated yet highly effective \u2013 and entertaining \u2013 system revolving around overlapping centre-halves, recently praised to the skies by, among others, J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Marcelo Bielsa. Wilder may be the poster boy for the merits of mud-on-boots localism in an otherwise largely global league yet, in some ways, his success is quintessentially continental. Significantly, he deploys the sort of intense training ground drilling favoured by leading European coaches \u2013 Louis van Gaal and Rafael Ben\u00edtez are prime examples \u2013 but often shunned by British managers fearful of bored players turning rebellious. He and his influential, thoughtful assistant Alan Knill are forensic analysts of games and tactics with their research prompting the modification of last season\u2019s 3-4-1-2 formation to a slightly more defensive out-of-possession 3-5-2 designed to thwart opponents playing between the lines. \u201cWe do a lot of work on the shape,\u201d emphasises midfielder John Lundstram, a one-time Everton reject who has played in all four divisions. \u201cA lot of drills focused on getting the ball wide, on overlapping, on creating overloads and getting the triangles right.

His refusal to acquire the affectations of Premier League power, let alone turn remotely precious, endeared him to both the club\u2019s former owner Kevin McCabe and his Saudi Arabian successor Prince Abdullah. Indeed the pair\u2019s affection for Wilder served as a rare point of agreement as the Blades\u2019 one-time co-owners fought a bruising court case \u2013 and the manager walked a diplomatic tightrope. It concluded with McCabe in the cold and United being taken over by its new chairman, Prince Abdullah\u2019s 26-year-old son-in-law Prince Musad, who is endeavouring to drum up investment from Saudi. Given that, under the terms of the high court ruling, Prince Abdullah must buy the club\u2019s \u00a340m property portfolio \u2013 including the stadium, adjacent hotel and training ground \u2013 by next July it is imperative that relegation is avoided this spring. Supporters Wilder chats to during post-match drinks at that Bramall Lane hotel will testify the manager wears the pressure reassuringly well but he is quick to acknowledge the role a certain former Manchester United counterpart played in getting him to this point. \u201cIt shows the class of the man that when Sir Alex Ferguson was winning Premier League and European titles he took time out to help young managers like me,\u201d he says. \u201cSir Alex used to call and give me little pointers. He even phoned the night before the Conference promotion play-off final with Oxford [against York in 2010] and passed on a couple of tips that helped us get the win.

Here I am, knowing who Gordon Sondland is and staring avidly at pictures of Mick Mulvaney like I\u2019m going to have to file a missing person\u2019s report on him at some point. Waking up my boyfriend at 6am to ask him what he thinks of Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s lovely speaking voice, does he think her and Ambassador Bill Taylor are friends, does he agree that \u201cKeith Kellogg\u201d sounds like a made-up name. Here I am behaving as if I have a long and weary familiarity with the attitudes and behaviours of a whole lot of people I had never heard of until a week ago. And I am doing this of my own volition! No one is forcing me to be reading three separate blow-by-blow accounts of what Kurt Volker said and what it might mean, or should mean, or could mean. But here I am. It\u2019s embarrassing, and possibly borderline pathetic. Not only am I not an American \u2013 I\u2019m a South African. One of the definitive features of the country I live in is that there is an extraordinary amount of news happening, all the time. We have news coming out of our ears, down here. There\u2019s always a story that demands total attention, always a good reason to be reading the paper for six hours and making loud worried noises while you do it. It is therefore ridiculous for me to be keeping such a beady eye on the impeachment process, especially when there is clearly so much more still to come. The US\u2019s always expanding sense of itself as the centre of the universe \u2013 not just the best country in the world but the only country in the world \u2013 is quite obviously a bad thing for the rest of us. Recently, I saw a South African acquaintance on Facebook post something about welcoming the hearings because \u201cthis man cannot be our president\u201d. (The acquaintance has not, as far as I know, so much as visited the US.) I didn\u2019t see anyone pointing out in the comments that Donald Trump was not, in fact, the president of South Africa, but perhaps they recognised that he was too far gone for that. Perhaps they didn\u2019t even notice. As a person who just spent a cool 20 minutes raking through Yovanovitch\u2019s Wikipedia page, I am certainly in no position to criticise such lapses in judgment. I can fully see that I am part of the problem and am fuelling the already out-of-control fire that is American exceptionalism by even thinking about all this as much as I do. It\u2019s very difficult to stop, though, especially knowing there is so much more of it to come, so many questions yet to be asked, and so many different ways to feel utterly confounded by every last aspect of the process. \u2022 Rosa Lyster is a writer who lives in Cape Town",

Nearly 1,000 costumed Dickens characters, from gentry to urchins, play their parts with real enthusiasm in the spruce-tree decked streets. You might bump into Bob Cratchit, say hello to Miss Havisham or share a stuffed potato or bag of roasted chestnuts with Scrooge. The picturesque Bergkwartier with its pretty shops twinkles with lights. Orchestras and choirs fill the churches with seasonal music, in addition to the outdoor carol singers. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://dickensfestijn.nl/\" title=\"\">dickensfestijn.nl </a></em><br><strong>roderic</strong></p> \n<h2>Wine bar with a sauna, Copenhagen <br></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a77d42a5826c7a4e815aaf6c2e0a4ce43861d2db\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a77d42a5826c7a4e815aaf6c2e0a4ce43861d2db/0_368_1119_671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sunset at banchina cafe and sauna copenhagen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>A little-known gem amid Copenhagen\u2019s many harbours and waterways is on the outskirts east of the Christiania free state. <strong>La Banchina</strong> is a cosy natural wine bar, with a small but tasty evening menu specialising in seafood.

I must admit being rather hesitant, but it proved to be an exhilarating experience and incredibly easy to master. We went on a couple of taster sessions and even a midnight guided tour. It\u2019s a great alternative to skiing for those of us less agile and something our kids loved too.

Ertlio Namas\u2019s six-course taster menu from down the centuries was particularly memorable, including a 15th-century dish of duck with gingerbread, celery porridge and dried apple sauce, and 18th-century quince sweets with poppies and cranberries. The bright building and cosy dining rooms were lovely too. We followed this with a 30-minute train trip to the historic town of Trakai to explore its hauntingly beautiful island castle and skate on the lake. And, possibly our favourite, a hot-air balloon ride, looking down on Vilnius\u2019s snow-covered roofs and spires. Sherry Snow biking, Austria We decided to try snow biking as an alternative to skiing after suffering a few aches and pains on previous ski trips. The shock absorption in the bike means you glide more easily over the bumps and it\u2019s a lot less strenuous. The delightful Austrian village of Obertauern, in the Salzkammergut, was our base. I must admit being rather hesitant, but it proved to be an exhilarating experience and incredibly easy to master. We went on a couple of taster sessions and even a midnight guided tour. It\u2019s a great alternative to skiing for those of us less agile and something our kids loved too. We learned with the SchiSchule Kokh whose taster two-hour sessions are \u20ac79pp. Lisa Anderson Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

British citizens who have lived, loved, parented and paid tax in the UK for decades begin to receive menacing text messages and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\" title=\"\">threatening letters from the</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\" title=\"\"> government</a>.

They go into work one day to be told that their new illegal status means they no longer have a job. People with ongoing health troubles turn up to scheduled treatments to be presented with a bill of tens of thousands of pounds before they can be seen. A visit to the jobcentre reveals that the benefits they are entitled to have been denied or revoked. They are even refused food bank vouchers. Many Britons are acquainted with the Windrush persecution. But this book by Amelia Gentleman, the Guardian journalist who broke the story, exposes it in its shocking reality.</p> <p>Gentleman meticulously details the specifics that led to one of the biggest political scandals of the decade, providing a context for her reports that even those who closely followed the story will find valuable. The Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policies attempted to inject hostility and suspicion into every interaction with the state. Through first-person accounts from the people affected, <em>The Windrush Betrayal</em> knits together a devastating picture of the human cost of punitive immigration policies.</p> <p>Gentleman provides a deft account of the relevant colonial history, of which many Britons are still ignorant. The targeted men and women had travelled to the UK as children, often on a parent\u2019s passport, at a time when their origin countries were imperial possessions. They were British subjects. The children grew up; lives were built while immigration acts changed. Fast forward to this decade, when Ukip\u2019s creeping influence on Conservative party policy led to what can only be described as a repatriation drive. (Consider the billboards that said \u201cGo Home or Face Arrest\u201d, and the Home Office tweet from 2013: \u201c#Rosesareredvioletsareblue, if your marriage is a sham we\u2019ll be on to you ... #happyvalentinesday\u201d.) Gentleman writes that 164 people were wrongly held in immigration detention, and 83 were wrongly removed from the country. All were stripped of dignity.</p> <p>By the time I had got to the middle of the book, with all the government incompetence exposed, I was feeling very angry. Gentleman tells the story of Jocelyn John, who was practically coerced into self-deportation by the government. She had arrived in Britain as a small child on her mother\u2019s passport in 1963. The country they had left, Grenada, was still under British rule. She has spent the vast majority of her life in Britain. A lost passport and family name change when she was a child left her vulnerable to the hostile environment. She began to receive letters informing her that she was illegal, and threatening her with impending detention. She gave up trying to prove her legitimacy in late 2016, acquiescing to Home Office officials who booked her on to a flight to a country she\u2019d last lived in when she was four.</p> <p>Many of us have lost or misplaced identity documents, but with no such dramatic consequence. The Kafkaesque situation that faced those caught up in the process of trying to prove that they had a right to live in Britain is simply mind-boggling. Many were never offered the chance to speak to a government official \u2013 a human being.</p> <p>The book tells the remarkable story of how Gentleman exposed a cruel and inhumane policy and forced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">resignation of home secretary Amber Rudd</a>.

Gentleman decides against the traditional non-fiction approach of dispassionate narration. Justice is what matters here. Her candid admissions of rage as she recalls the unfolding of the scandal are refreshing to read. Equally winning is her decision not to let this anger poison her view of Home Office staff. She tries to understand the pressures on those enforcing hostile environment policies, revealing poor practices, budget cuts and low morale. The compassionate approach works in her favour; one of her sources is revealed as a former employee of the department in charge of storing vital data.

The author opens with an account of his parents, but then focuses on other black Britons, as they recall their lives and schooling in the West Indies. We learn about the decisions taken to move to Britain in the middle of the century, and what it was like to make the journey. There are tales of arriving in England, trying to get settled and facing racism. Edwin Hilton Hall, an interviewee, bitterly recalls the extreme racism he faced around the time of the Notting Hill riots. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go quietly in a shop without them abusing us: \u2018blackie, nigger, moonshine\u2019.\u201d Another interviewee, Shirley Williams, speaks in a resigned manner about the realities of her nursing job: \u201cIf there was a derogatory remark made to you, it had to go over your head, you could not report it.

Jumping from story to story made me want a more continuous narrative, but Grant\u2019s collection of voices, like <em>The Windrush Betrayal</em>, exposes effectively the cruel logic of Britain\u2019s legacy of domination. Britishness was instilled in the colonies; interviewees speak of celebrating Empire Day at school; Britain was the mother country. Many of the narratives of those who left the places they were born in reveal an impermanence, a drive to be at the centre, their sense of waiting to arrive.

      "body": "<p>When my twin boys were born, four years ago, I took enormous pains to stock their bedroom with a wide range of books, and when I say \u201ctook enormous pains\u201d, I mean \u201cordered them online from my phone while lying in bed\u201d. (Do you think I left the house to go shopping? Did you miss the part when I said I had twins?)</p> <p>We are in the jumpy, high water days of identity politics, constantly told how important representation is in the stories we tell ourselves. I agree with all that. Hell, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Moves-Pretty-Fast-eighties/dp/0007585608\" title=\"\">I wrote a </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Moves-Pretty-Fast-eighties/dp/0007585608\" title=\"\">book about it</a>, in which I ranted about modern Hollywood movies, the ones where the white male heterosexual is still seen as the baseline norm. No <em>way</em> would my boys grow up thinking like that, I told myself, smugly, as I ordered brilliant books like Nadia Shireen\u2019s Billy And The Beast and Andrea Beaty\u2019s Ada Twist, Scientist. My children would never see any minority group as weird. But there was one thing I had overlooked, and that is what I shall call \u201cthe twin problem\u201d.</p> <p>The release of Dr Sleep, the sequel to The Shining, has sparked a renewed interest in the most infamous twins in cinematic history, the Grady twins, played in the original film by Louise and Lisa Burns. When it comes to the creepiness of twins, the Grady twins are, if not the original version (the Ancient Greeks and the Bible, followed by Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe, were also no slouches on the subject), then certainly the ultimate. And the Burns sisters have happily played up to that, <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a23889963/horror-movie-child-actors-what-its-like/\" title=\"\">as Cosmopolitan emphasised in a</a><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a23889963/horror-movie-child-actors-what-its-like/\" title=\"\"> recent interview</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re naturally spooky!\u201d they said. \u201cBut we did practise our timing, saying things in unison.\u201d</p> <p>Twins in literature are generally depicted as interchangeable (Erich K\u00e4stner\u2019s Lisa and Lottie, which inspired The Parent Trap; the Weasley twins in Harry Potter; Thompson and Thomson in Tintin), and/or creepy (Tweedledum and Tweedledee in Through The Looking Glass; Carrie and Cory in Flowers In The Attic). In film, there are the psychosexual gynaecologists in Dead Ringers, the evil censors who talk as one in Good Morning, Vietnam, and the goofy Kaufman brothers in Adaptation, none of whom I would exactly call role models. My boys are too young to read or watch any of this, but they do have Little Miss Twins from the Mr Men series. Like all Mr Men books, it is an intensely weird story, but this one especially so. The seemingly adult Little Miss Twins live together in total co-dependency, say everything twice, and \u2013 in a decidedly Pinter-esque plot twist \u2013 welcome in a strange man (Mr Nosey, for the record) who forces them to entertain him for the rest of the day. These are not messages I wish my boys to take on board.</p> <p>And yet, I can already see the messages starting to stick, as adults ask me if they\u2019re psychic (<em>hard side eye</em>) and their friends tell them how weird it is that they have the same birthday. My boys aren\u2019t identical yet still people tell me they can\u2019t tell them apart; as with Cosmo assuming twins always talk in unison, people hear the word \u201ctwins\u201d and think: \u201cDo my eyes deceive me? Double vision!\u201d Incidentally, while we\u2019re on this subject, here is a handy cut-out-and-keep guide of things not to say to a parent of twins: \u201cWow, how can you tell them apart?\u201d (I flip a coin.) \u201cMy kids are 14 months apart so they\u2019re basically twins, too!\u201d (Look, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a competition for parental endurance \u2013 there is: I win it \u2013 but unless you were pregnant with two babies at the same time and then had to learn the extremely sexy art of double-breastfeeding, then you do not have twins.) \u201cDo they have a secret language?\u201d (Yes, and they\u2019re saying that I should delete your number from my phone.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/09/ive-been-bingeing-on-a-25-year-old-sitcom-its-smart-modern-and-definitely-not-friends\">I\u2019ve been bingeing on a 25-year-old show.

But when my daughter was born over the summer, one of the first things my boys asked me was whether she was lonely, and I worry about that, too: only one baby in the cot, the pram, my arms?

      "bodyText": "When my twin boys were born, four years ago, I took enormous pains to stock their bedroom with a wide range of books, and when I say \u201ctook enormous pains\u201d, I mean \u201cordered them online from my phone while lying in bed\u201d. (Do you think I left the house to go shopping? Did you miss the part when I said I had twins?) We are in the jumpy, high water days of identity politics, constantly told how important representation is in the stories we tell ourselves. I agree with all that. Hell, I wrote a book about it, in which I ranted about modern Hollywood movies, the ones where the white male heterosexual is still seen as the baseline norm. No way would my boys grow up thinking like that, I told myself, smugly, as I ordered brilliant books like Nadia Shireen\u2019s Billy And The Beast and Andrea Beaty\u2019s Ada Twist, Scientist. My children would never see any minority group as weird. But there was one thing I had overlooked, and that is what I shall call \u201cthe twin problem\u201d. The release of Dr Sleep, the sequel to The Shining, has sparked a renewed interest in the most infamous twins in cinematic history, the Grady twins, played in the original film by Louise and Lisa Burns. When it comes to the creepiness of twins, the Grady twins are, if not the original version (the Ancient Greeks and the Bible, followed by Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe, were also no slouches on the subject), then certainly the ultimate. And the Burns sisters have happily played up to that, as Cosmopolitan emphasised in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re naturally spooky!\u201d they said. \u201cBut we did practise our timing, saying things in unison.\u201d Twins in literature are generally depicted as interchangeable (Erich K\u00e4stner\u2019s Lisa and Lottie, which inspired The Parent Trap; the Weasley twins in Harry Potter; Thompson and Thomson in Tintin), and/or creepy (Tweedledum and Tweedledee in Through The Looking Glass; Carrie and Cory in Flowers In The Attic). In film, there are the psychosexual gynaecologists in Dead Ringers, the evil censors who talk as one in Good Morning, Vietnam, and the goofy Kaufman brothers in Adaptation, none of whom I would exactly call role models. My boys are too young to read or watch any of this, but they do have Little Miss Twins from the Mr Men series. Like all Mr Men books, it is an intensely weird story, but this one especially so. The seemingly adult Little Miss Twins live together in total co-dependency, say everything twice, and \u2013 in a decidedly Pinter-esque plot twist \u2013 welcome in a strange man (Mr Nosey, for the record) who forces them to entertain him for the rest of the day. These are not messages I wish my boys to take on board. And yet, I can already see the messages starting to stick, as adults ask me if they\u2019re psychic (hard side eye) and their friends tell them how weird it is that they have the same birthday. My boys aren\u2019t identical yet still people tell me they can\u2019t tell them apart; as with Cosmo assuming twins always talk in unison, people hear the word \u201ctwins\u201d and think: \u201cDo my eyes deceive me? Double vision!\u201d Incidentally, while we\u2019re on this subject, here is a handy cut-out-and-keep guide of things not to say to a parent of twins: \u201cWow, how can you tell them apart?\u201d (I flip a coin.) \u201cMy kids are 14 months apart so they\u2019re basically twins, too!\u201d (Look, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a competition for parental endurance \u2013 there is: I win it \u2013 but unless you were pregnant with two babies at the same time and then had to learn the extremely sexy art of double-breastfeeding, then you do not have twins.) \u201cDo they have a secret language?\u201d (Yes, and they\u2019re saying that I should delete your number from my phone.) If the idea of two babies gestating inside a woman at the same time blows your mind, then rest assured, that\u2019s nothing to how the woman herself feels. But when my daughter was born over the summer, one of the first things my boys asked me was whether she was lonely, and I worry about that, too: only one baby in the cot, the pram, my arms? How unnatural! I\u2019ve met a lot of twins by now (twin parents gravitate towards one another, like people who have been through an earthquake or another extreme event). And yes, twins tend to be close, as siblings who have never known life without one another would be. But they are as individualised as any brother or sister, as sweet as you\u2019d expect from children for whom sharing has, since conception, been instinctive.

      "body": "<p>I am starting to question my relationship with binge-watching. Recently, I found myself knee-deep in the Netflix show Suits. I would hesitate to offer any kind of endorsement of the series, but I have now watched every single episode. Suits ticked a few boxes for me: it was easy to keep up with while looking at my phone; it didn\u2019t leave me feeling emotionally drained; and there were 10 seasons, which meant that it would eat up a lot of my pre-show hanging around time.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the tail began to wag the dog. What was initially meant to be a way to pass the time, became something that I was having to find time to do. It started innocently enough. I would get to the hotel after a show, and put on an episode before I went to sleep. But after one episode, Netflix said: \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep yet, Romesh, there are more episodes to watch and you don\u2019t even have to click anything.\u201d Next thing I know, it\u2019s 3am and I am only able to speak in brash American legal threats.</p> <p>Eventually, I was cramming in as many episodes as I could, just to get through them. It started to feel like a job. Every time I had a spare half an hour, I would put on an episode of Suits. I think I realised it was a problem when I found myself standing on a train platform watching the show on my phone. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s that great; getting through the show just appeals to my nerdy completist psychology.</p> <p>What makes it worse is that no one else is watching Suits. It leads to no water-cooler chat about anything, apart from the fact that Meghan Markle is in it, and how amazing it is that she can say lines and act even though she is now a royal. To give you an idea of how wilfully out of step I am, I have just started season two of Game Of Thrones, and will move on to Breaking Bad after that. \u201cBehind the curve\u201d feels aspirational at this point.</p> <p>Binge-watching also seems to have changed the way a lot of television gets made. Some of the worst examples have an ambling plot but jam enough of a hook in at the end for you to decide to move on to the next episode. When we were writing the second series of The Reluctant Landlord, we created storylines that we felt would suit binge-watching, as we knew it was going to drop all in one go. I am blessed with both a lack of urgency to get up and move and an addictive personality, which means I just have to pray that no one suddenly drops a box set of 1,000 episodes of something perfectly designed to be binged, as I will have to just say goodbye to my family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/14/romesh-ranganathan-do-tell-me-what-you-think-really-happened-mr-social-media-know-all\">Romesh Ranganathan: do tell me what you think happened, Mr Social Media Know-all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point I am trying to meander to, in the style of Suits\u2019 Mike Ross, is that I am not sure if I\u2019m more drawn to the content of a TV show or the medium through which we now consume them. I used to not give a toss about waiting a week for the next episode of something; now, that would feel borderline unethical. In a similar way, I listen to more music than ever before, but not because I am more passionate about it; it\u2019s just more immediately available.</p> <p>All I\u2019m asking for is a bit of help. Rather than shovelling more and more episodes in your face, I would love it if a warning popped up that said: \u201cAre you sure you want to watch another? Have you spoken to your wife, or actually done anything with your day?\u201d Obviously I would continue to watch, but at least I could send the family a text.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am starting to question my relationship with binge-watching. Recently, I found myself knee-deep in the Netflix show Suits. I would hesitate to offer any kind of endorsement of the series, but I have now watched every single episode. Suits ticked a few boxes for me: it was easy to keep up with while looking at my phone; it didn\u2019t leave me feeling emotionally drained; and there were 10 seasons, which meant that it would eat up a lot of my pre-show hanging around time. Unfortunately, the tail began to wag the dog. What was initially meant to be a way to pass the time, became something that I was having to find time to do. It started innocently enough. I would get to the hotel after a show, and put on an episode before I went to sleep. But after one episode, Netflix said: \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep yet, Romesh, there are more episodes to watch and you don\u2019t even have to click anything.\u201d Next thing I know, it\u2019s 3am and I am only able to speak in brash American legal threats. Eventually, I was cramming in as many episodes as I could, just to get through them. It started to feel like a job. Every time I had a spare half an hour, I would put on an episode of Suits. I think I realised it was a problem when I found myself standing on a train platform watching the show on my phone. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s that great; getting through the show just appeals to my nerdy completist psychology. What makes it worse is that no one else is watching Suits. It leads to no water-cooler chat about anything, apart from the fact that Meghan Markle is in it, and how amazing it is that she can say lines and act even though she is now a royal. To give you an idea of how wilfully out of step I am, I have just started season two of Game Of Thrones, and will move on to Breaking Bad after that. \u201cBehind the curve\u201d feels aspirational at this point. Binge-watching also seems to have changed the way a lot of television gets made. Some of the worst examples have an ambling plot but jam enough of a hook in at the end for you to decide to move on to the next episode. When we were writing the second series of The Reluctant Landlord, we created storylines that we felt would suit binge-watching, as we knew it was going to drop all in one go. I am blessed with both a lack of urgency to get up and move and an addictive personality, which means I just have to pray that no one suddenly drops a box set of 1,000 episodes of something perfectly designed to be binged, as I will have to just say goodbye to my family. The point I am trying to meander to, in the style of Suits\u2019 Mike Ross, is that I am not sure if I\u2019m more drawn to the content of a TV show or the medium through which we now consume them. I used to not give a toss about waiting a week for the next episode of something; now, that would feel borderline unethical. In a similar way, I listen to more music than ever before, but not because I am more passionate about it; it\u2019s just more immediately available. All I\u2019m asking for is a bit of help. Rather than shovelling more and more episodes in your face, I would love it if a warning popped up that said: \u201cAre you sure you want to watch another? Have you spoken to your wife, or actually done anything with your day?\u201d Obviously I would continue to watch, but at least I could send the family a text.",

In most cases, however, they cleared more space for the left than it could hold, either electorally or politically. Caffeinated through social media, these movements had a tendency to burn brightly only to fade, making space for whatever came next. They involved mostly the same people, shifting from one protest to the next \u2013 campaigning first about war, then inequality, then racism, then sexism \u2013 which lent the culture of protest an itinerant quality.</p> <p>The right was on the march, too. From Africa to South America, people mobilised against migrants, wealth redistribution and alleged corruption.

This decade was no different. We have witnessed some of the largest and most widespread leftwing protests in history, and we end the decade with the most rightwing governments in living memory. These contradictions are most evident in the US, which saw four of the five biggest demonstrations in its history in the second half of the decade \u2013 prompted primarily by the election of its most reactionary president.</p> <p>The source of this flammable liquid is no great mystery. At the end of 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/credit-crunch-boom-bust-timeline\" title=\"\">a huge financial crisis</a> \u2013 one that started in the US housing market \u2013 spread across the world like a virus. The only thing that could save free market capitalism from itself was the state. And while it was public money that rescued private capital, the public were the ones who suffered. Real wages, which had long been stagnant, fell \u2013 and in some places, including Britain, remain lower than they were when the crisis began.

Anita Dunn, White House communications director for Barack Obama, told a reporter in 2012 that Occupy Wall Street had \u201creframed the discussion nationally [because] it gave people permission to openly discuss something that had not really been openly discussed and gave many members of the Democratic party much more confidence in going to those places in the criticism of the Republican policies\u201d.

The right proved better at embedding themselves within pre-existing conservative structures and so ascended to positions of power \u2013 in the US, Italy, Brazil, Britain \u2013 far more quickly. Many protests, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">yellow vests</a> in France to those against government corruption in South America or pro-democracy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\" title=\"\">in Hong Kong</a>, don\u2019t necessarily fit easily into a left-right narrative.</p> <p>But austerity was not the only cause. Corruption and despotism was another. On 17 December 2010, a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/28/tunisia-ben-ali\" title=\"\">Mohamed Bouazizi</a>, went to the governor\u2019s office in Sidi Bouzid to protest at the petty harassment he was facing and demand that the scales confiscated from him earlier that day be returned.

      "bodyText": "In March 2011, I asked a class at an unemployed training centre in Madrid who would be prepared to emigrate to find a job. They all raised their hands. Youth unemployment in Spain stood at 43% \u2013 higher than both Egypt and Tunisia. Everyone in the room said most of their friends were unemployed. One in five of those under the age of 30 in Spain were still looking for their first job. Almost every young person I spoke to believed their lives would be harder than their parents\u2019. \u201cThis is the least hopeful and best educated generation in Spain,\u201d Ignacio Escolar, then 35 and author of the country\u2019s most popular political blog, told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like a national defeat that they have to travel abroad to find work.\u201d Why, I asked him, had they not taken to the streets? \u201cIt\u2019s like there is oil on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cAll it needs is a small spark and it could blow.\u201d The last decade has been a combustible one. Across the globe, millions of protesters have marched, sat down, sat in, camped out, occupied, filled jail cells, rioted, looted, chanted, petitioned, lobbied and hashtagged. These protests have toppled despots and overthrown governments, transformed geopolitics, led to the death or transformation of old political parties, and the birth and ascendancy of new ones. These demonstrations were largely led by progressives, liberals and leftists, often supporting the demands of the poor, the young, students, workers, minorities, the indigenous, women, trade unionists and migrants. In most cases, however, they cleared more space for the left than it could hold, either electorally or politically. Caffeinated through social media, these movements had a tendency to burn brightly only to fade, making space for whatever came next. They involved mostly the same people, shifting from one protest to the next \u2013 campaigning first about war, then inequality, then racism, then sexism \u2013 which lent the culture of protest an itinerant quality. The right was on the march, too. From Africa to South America, people mobilised against migrants, wealth redistribution and alleged corruption. Although at times equally chaotic, and less impressive in terms of numbers or strategy, the right has proved itself capable of building a more permanent presence. Fascism has reasserted itself as a mainstream ideology in Europe; in the US, neo-Nazis have marched by torchlight and killed in daylight; in Bolivia they staged a coup. It is in the nature of protests that, for the most part, they highlight problems they are not equipped to resolve. This decade was no different. We have witnessed some of the largest and most widespread leftwing protests in history, and we end the decade with the most rightwing governments in living memory. These contradictions are most evident in the US, which saw four of the five biggest demonstrations in its history in the second half of the decade \u2013 prompted primarily by the election of its most reactionary president. The source of this flammable liquid is no great mystery. At the end of 2008, a huge financial crisis \u2013 one that started in the US housing market \u2013 spread across the world like a virus. The only thing that could save free market capitalism from itself was the state. And while it was public money that rescued private capital, the public were the ones who suffered. Real wages, which had long been stagnant, fell \u2013 and in some places, including Britain, remain lower than they were when the crisis began. Everyone was affected, but not everyone was affected equally. Within a few years, the bonuses returned to the bankers, who had invested so venally and recklessly. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the decade, the median net wealth for women of colour in America was calculated at just $5. An entire generation of young people saw their future diminish, with Spanish youth being just one of the salient European examples. The notion that the subsequent hardships would result in social unrest, particularly in those countries that passed the pain directly on to the poorest by way of austerity, was not just predictable: it was predicted. Weeks before the decade began, the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s warned that future tax rises and spending cuts could unleash social unrest, a key risk identified by Christine Lagarde, who would soon become chair of the International Monetary Fund. In April 2010, the then Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, painted a bleak scenario during the election campaign: \u201cImagine the Conservatives... get an absolute majority, on 25% of the eligible votes. They then turn around in the next week or two and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to chuck up VAT to 20%, we\u2019re going to start cutting teachers, cutting police and the wage bill in the public sector. I think if you\u2019re not careful in that situation\u2026 you\u2019d get Greek-style unrest.\u201d The Tories got 23% of the eligible vote. They did not win an absolute majority but, with Clegg\u2019s help in the coalition government, it all happened anyway. Such was the highly flammable liquid, poured freely and knowingly over the turn of the decade. The sparks varied with each country, though there were some commonalities. Austerity was a key one. Greece began the decade with a newly elected centre-left government and a wave of strikes, demonstrations, bond downgrades and appeals for bailouts. By September 2010, they were joined by hundreds of thousands of protesters and strikers in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Ireland and Lithuania in a Europe-wide day of action against cuts. In Dublin, a man rammed a cement mixer into the gates of the Irish parliament. In Britain, not long after, students went into occupations across the country over an increase in tuition fees. Two months after I spoke to Escolar, Spanish youth occupied the main squares across the country, rallying to the slogan: \u201cWe are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers.\u201d They would become known as the Idignados (\u201cthe indignant ones\u201d) and formed the basis for a new political party, Podemos. The issue of inequality, global capitalism and who should pay for the crisis went global after an occupation in New York\u2019s Zuccotti park in September 2011, protesting against the venality of the 1% and solidarity with the 99%. Occupy Wall Street soon became a franchise that found homes around the world. From Ojota in Nigeria to Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in Iceland, via Vancouver, Melbourne, Boston and Bournemouth, encampments sprang up demanding wealth redistribution and systemic change. The ubiquity of these protests illustrated both their easily transferable popularity and the elusiveness of their target. Unrestrained by national borders or democratic accountability, neoliberal globalisation is a force without a face and a system without a centre. It is everywhere \u2013 in our pensions, mortgages and public spending cuts \u2013 until you try to hold people or institutions responsible for the mess we\u2019re in, and then it evaporates. This elusive quality also served as the basis for much of the right\u2019s advance. In a moment when those responsible for the financial crisis remained out of reach, more visible targets \u2013 religious and racial minorities, migrants, refugees \u2013 were identified by opportunist populists.

Major uprisings followed in Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Bahrain, as well as significant demonstrations in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan. The Arab spring, like the Prague spring before it, laid bare a crisis it could not resolve. Since revolutions demand not only the upending of the old order but the establishment of a new one, most of these uprisings did not complete their mission; many ended with increased authoritarianism under different management, civil war or reckless western intervention. In a year that started with the Arab spring and ended with Occupy Wall Street, it would be obtuse to understand the rioting of young Britons in August 2011 as an isolated, random moment of mass social deviancy.

And so the decade ended as it started, with demands for systemic change, led primarily by the young, and hundreds of thousands on the streets in Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Haiti, Peru, Sudan, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq and the US. As resistance grows to economic inequalities, state repression, bigotry and sexism, political cultures have become more polarised. With no systemic response to the financial crisis that would prevent it recurring, and no punishment for those who caused it, the world sits on the brink of yet another one. There is more oil on the streets and more sparks to ignite them. The next decade promises to be more combustible than the last. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

A satire of modern France, its protagonist, an antihero of antiheroes and a homeless guru of sorts, is the former owner of a Parisian record store, \u201ctrapped in the last century\u201d, and on a quest to uncover the secrets of a dead pop star, his friend Alex Bleach. Books one and two are already out in the UK, and volume three will hit the shelves in 2020. The Memory Police by Y\u014dko Ogawa, translated by Stephen Snyder (Harvill Secker) Originally published in 1994, the translation of this masterpiece by the acclaimed Japanese author into English this year is cause for celebration. Set on an unnamed island in which all kinds of objects and beings disappear \u2013 hats, flowers, birds \u2013 inhabitants live in terror of the \u201cMemory Police\u201d, whose job is to keep things forgotten. A young novelist and her editor, whom she is hiding under her floorboards, are the protagonists. Winter in Sokcho by Elisa Shua Dusapin, translated by Aneesa Abbas Higgins (Daunt Books) This is a punchy first novel set in desolate Sokcho, a tourist town on the border between South and North Korea. Originally written in French, the story centres on the relationship between a young French-Korean woman who works as a receptionist in an old guesthouse and a visiting French cartoonist. It was published in France in 2016 to wide acclaim, and is out here in February. The Eighth Life (for Brilka) by Nino Haratischwili, translated by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin (Scribe) A phenomenon in Georgia, Germany, Poland and Holland, this Georgian saga is published in the UK this week. Spanning six generations of a family between 1900 and the 21st century, its characters travel to Tbilisi, Moscow, London and Berlin in an epic story of doomed romance that combines humour with magic realism. Untold Night and Day by Bae Suah, translated by Deborah Smith (Jonathan Cape) Published in the UK in January, Bae Suah\u2019s hypnotic novel follows one summer night and day in the life of Kim Ayami. After losing her job in Seoul, she walks the hot city all night in search of her disappeared friend in an uncannily affecting and dreamlike story of parallel lives and worlds. Translator Deborah Smith won the Man Booker International prize for Han Kang\u2019s The Vegetarian. Elly by Maike Wetzel, translated by Lyn Marven (Scribe) Revolving around the disappearance of an 11-year-old girl, this slender German novel builds into a brutal, uncomfortable story, told from the alternating perspectives of family members. Just as the family has started to put itself back together the girl reappears, but is so different they begin to doubt whether she\u2019s even the same child. It won prizes in Germany and the translation is out in the UK in April. Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor, translated by Sophie Hughes (Fitzcarraldo) Set in a Mexican village, Melchor\u2019s novel, published in the UK in February, focuses on the murder of a woman known as the Witch, whose body is found by a group of boys. This is a dazzling novel and the English-language debut of one of Mexico\u2019s most exciting new voices. Crossing by Pajtim Statovci, translated by David Hackston (Pushkin) Pajtim Statovci was born in Kosovo and raised in Finland, and his debut My Cat Yugoslavia was an imaginative novel about the refugee experience. His second book, Crossing, was published in the UK in May. It is a complex story about identity, displacement and heartbreak set in the ruins of communist Albania, following two friends who escape the country to attempt a new life in Italy and, later, New York. Statovci inertwines Albanian myth with the grim reality of post-communism, and delivers a strikingly modern narrative where oppression is not just political but lived in the body.",

      "body": "<p>There are voices that speak to us across oceans and centuries with more intimacy than the people who surround us in our daily lives. These can speak directly with clarity and honesty: think of Elena Ferrante, whose feverishly awaited new novel <em>The Lying Life of Adults</em> is written from the perspective of an adolescent girl disillusioned by the \u201cunreliable animals\u201d inhabiting the adult world; or Natalia Ginzburg, writing in<em> The Little Virtues</em> that after the war \u201cwe cannot lie in our books and we cannot lie in any of the things we do\u201d. They can speak meanderingly out of troubled nights, entering our dreams: think of Vigdis Hjorth, writing in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/22/will-and-testament-by-vigdis-hjorth-review\" title=\"\">Will and Testament</a></em> that \u201cit is terrible that someone who has been destroyed spreads destruction, and how hard that is to avoid\u201d. Or they can speak precisely and carefully, allowing us to access our own hopes and fears by describing material surroundings in minute detail. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/20/territory-of-light-yuko-tsushima-review-tokyo-tales\" title=\"\">Territory of Light</a></em>, Y\u016bko Tsushima\u2019s autobiographical tale of motherhood in the wake of divorce, there are long descriptions of the flat where she lives alone with her daughter: \u201cThe apartment was filled with light at any hour of the day.\u201d</p> <p>From postwar Italy, from contemporary Norway, from 1970s Japan, these narrators speak of love, suffering and domestic labour. That we have access to these voices now is thanks to the work of translators and editors committed to bringing more women into the canon, to making the British literary world less parochial and to reminding us that contemporary trends such as autofiction are richly rooted in the past. Thanks to their efforts, consumption of translated works in Britain is on the rise.

The unexpected phenomena of Knausgaard and Ferrante had something to do with it.

For those of us who voted remain there was perhaps a moment of guilt amid the outrage, as we wondered if we were quite as European as we liked to think. Who is the Ali Smith, the Rachel Cusk, the Deborah Levy of France, Germany, Italy, Poland or Hungary?</p> <p>I, for one, didn\u2019t know the answers back in 2016. For decades, the European writers I\u2019d read regularly were more often male than female, more often writers who treated domestic life as suffused with grand themes and emphatic political magnitude. I had taken the canon I\u2019d been given as an undergraduate \u2013 Goethe and Mann, Flaubert and Proust \u2013 without questioning its assumptions. Now I wanted a fuller and more lively sense of our shared European heritage, and I was grateful to the publishers who were making that possible. Over the past few years, as well as Ernaux and Ginzburg, I\u2019ve discovered the Belgian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/14/marie-madeleine-bourdouxhe-review\" title=\"\">Madeleine Bourdouxhe</a>, who spent long periods of her life in France, and the Danish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/16/the-copenhagen-tirlogy-by-tove-ditlevsen-review\" title=\"\">Tove Ditlevsen</a>: a community of feminist writers committed to ordinary experience who cross borders of time and place.</p> <p>Smaller independent publishers have played a vital role in this, publishing translations not as fusty classics with quietly collectable covers, but as bold and vibrant new arrivals, ready to enter our contemporary scene as equal players.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5df596516101e75eeed83c68edd226f8e41b777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5df596516101e75eeed83c68edd226f8e41b777/0_0_1130_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalia Ginzburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Completely compelling \u2026 Natalia Ginzburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rediscovery of Natalia Ginzburg has been the work of \u017deljka Maro\u0161evi\u0107 at Daunt Books. Maro\u0161evi\u0107 (herself an immigrant from Bosnia who remains committed to breaking down national borders) made her name by bringing Maggie Nelson, author of<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/23/the-argonauts-maggie-nelson-review-harry-dodge-transgender\" title=\"\">The Argonauts</a></em>, to the British public in 2016, when Maro\u0161evi\u0107 was in her early 20s. It was Nelson who introduced her to Ginzburg, whom she found immediately compelling. She published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/25/the-little-virtues-by-natalia-ginzburg-review\" title=\"\">The Little Virtues</a></em> with an introduction by Cusk, whom Maro\u0161evi\u0107 wanted to show as writing autofiction that had links and parallels with European literature across previous decades. And then she published a series of novels, with Ginzburg\u2019s <em>Happiness, As Such</em> just out in a new translation by Minna Zallman Proctor.</p> <p>I ask Maro\u0161evi\u0107 what she thinks is behind the current enthusiasm for books from the past. \u201cMy generation thinks differently about the canon,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think in terms of the personal canon. Which writers speak to our lives? And if we look back, we\u2019re probably seeing some of those writers out of print.\u201d This is also the view of Ella Griffiths, recently appointed to a newly created post at Faber overseeing the backlist, who wants to make Faber\u2019s classics publishing \u201cmore diverse, less Eurocentric, more exciting\u201d. She\u2019s got her eye on Banana Yoshimoto (the pen name of the feminist Japanese writer Mahoko Yoshimoto) and French writers Am\u00e9lie Nothomb and Marie Darrieussecq. \u201cYou should open the book and it should feel vital and direct,\u201d Griffiths tells me; \u201clike having a telephone line to that author.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Postwar female writers used the grit of their lives and the rubble of a world that had been bombed to forge hard-won works of art</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For young feminists, these books also perhaps provide a reprieve from the exhaustion of online identity politics. Ginzburg and Ditlevsen speak from a world that was less polemically frontloaded, less binary in its moral positions and therefore arguably more vital than ours. These postwar female European writers used the grit of their lives and the rubble of a world that had been smashed and bombed to the ground to forge hard-won works of art.</p> <p>We may need that literature as the ruins become visible again now. As our political edifices teeter, the war-sharpened sensitivities of Ginzburg and Ditlevsen can help us to sharpen our own. And in so doing, we need to create ourselves anew as Europeans. However much many of us want to remain in the EU, it\u2019s still an imperfect and not particularly lovable entity (those scenes where dark suited European alpha males slapped Johnson on the back were as complacently patriarchal as much that we witness in the White House). As we fight to retain trade links with Europe, we need to fight too to forge a new and more vibrant vision of being European. Looking back on the origins of the EU, its architect Jean Monnet said, \u201cIf I were starting over, I would begin with culture\u201d. Perhaps, at this moment when it looks like we are starting again, this is just what we need to do.</p> <p>There are three European books published this autumn that take us back to that postwar world, when a new Europe and a new art were being forged from the rubble. At Pushkin \u2013 one of the forerunners among independent publishers of books in translation \u2013 publisher Laura Macaulay brings us Bourdouxhe\u2019s collection, <em>A Nail, A Rose</em>, translated by Faith Evans. These stories are often dream-like but are centred on the daily life of women. In \u201cLouise\u201d (first published in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/25/les-temps-modernes-closed-paris-mourns-de-beauvoir-journal\" title=\"\">Les Temps Modernes</a> in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir, a friend of Bourdouxhe\u2019s), the opening sentences inform us that \u201cwhen melted sugar falls on to the steel surface of a stove it\u2019s the very devil, it sticks like glue. To get it off you need steel wool and an emery cloth.\u201d The sensations of motherhood are quietly but acutely described. We\u2019re told that Louise\u2019s child gives her \u201cwarmth, a presence and a reason for living\u201d but doesn\u2019t offer relief from care: \u201cshe was more like a tender burden\u201d. The closing, magnificent story \u201c<em>Sous le Pont Mirabeau</em>\u201d describes a new baby born in the middle of war. The detail of teaching the baby to breastfeed gets as much space as the war scenes, which accrue poignancy from the intense bodily life flowing through them.</p> <p>There are scenes of new motherhood, too, in Ginzburg\u2019s <em>Happiness, As Such</em>, published in July, and in Ditlevsen\u2019s 60s The Copenhagen Trilogy, recently published by Penguin in a translation by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman. Ginzburg\u2019s novel is comprised of letters written between members of a disintegrating family. It begins with a middle-aged mother writing half-resentfully, half-lovingly to her son Michele as he moves from Italy to England. The language is as direct as ever. \u201cAfter a certain point in life a person has to dunk her regrets in the morning coffee, just like biscuits,\u201d she writes, while managing to blame her son for her disappointment nonetheless.</p> <p>The most memorable character here is Mara, the petulant new mother of a baby who might be Michele\u2019s. In a novel filled with opportunists, Mara is the most grandly opportunistic of all, determined to use anyone she encounters to supply free accommodation and provide her with company while she feeds her baby, which she finds depressing when she is alone. She\u2019s curiously vibrant, though, more so than the more insistently refined family of her former lover. And eventually Michele\u2019s family realise this enough to befriend Mara, even though it seems unlikely the baby is actually his. It is to Mara that Michele\u2019s sister says the line (there\u2019s always one of these in a Ginzburg novel) that cuts through to the misery underlying all this and in so doing offers a kind of hard-won hope. \u201cWe\u2019re all unreliable and broken somewhere inside and sometimes it seems desperately attractive to be unrooted and breathing nothing but your own solitude. That\u2019s how people find each other, and understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0314789b56046b34b9067f36bceddebec675509\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0314789b56046b34b9067f36bceddebec675509/121_0_2708_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tove Ditlevsen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slyly observant \u2026 Tove Ditlevsen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Petersen/Ritzau/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Ditlevsen, hope of this kind occurs less often through connection with others than through writing. The Copenhagen Trilogy is a catalogue of casual brutality and exploitation. The young Tove is told by an early mentor that everyone is trying to use each other for something, and Ditlevsen is open in taking this on as a way of life. In a <em>Moll Flanders</em>-like tale of chaotic multiple marriages that echoes the patterns of her own life, Ditlevsen uses one husband to get published, another to have a child, and another to procure the drugs that he (a doctor) gets her addicted to by offering her a shot of the opioid Demerol in their first sexual encounter.</p> <p>In the process, she loses as much as she gains from these men, becoming increasingly vulnerable to pain. However, as in much of the best autofiction, the protagonist\u2019s weakness is counterpoised by the strength of her voice \u2013 indeed the tenacity of that voice may in odd ways rely on the flaws of character that it lights up. This is a woman who, even when exhausted by her menial jobs, frightened by European politics (the trilogy begins during Hitler\u2019s rise to power) or incarcerated in a mental asylum, knows her own power. \u201cOn the sly, you observe the adults whose childhood lies inside them, torn and full of holes like a used and moth-eaten rug no one thinks about anymore or has any use for,\u201d she observes as a child. And as an adult, she is still observing slyly, speaking beyond the cruel and disappointing figures she encounters to us, her readers, awaiting her in another time and another place </p>",

We may need that literature as the ruins become visible again now. As our political edifices teeter, the war-sharpened sensitivities of Ginzburg and Ditlevsen can help us to sharpen our own. And in so doing, we need to create ourselves anew as Europeans. However much many of us want to remain in the EU, it\u2019s still an imperfect and not particularly lovable entity (those scenes where dark suited European alpha males slapped Johnson on the back were as complacently patriarchal as much that we witness in the White House). As we fight to retain trade links with Europe, we need to fight too to forge a new and more vibrant vision of being European. Looking back on the origins of the EU, its architect Jean Monnet said, \u201cIf I were starting over, I would begin with culture\u201d. Perhaps, at this moment when it looks like we are starting again, this is just what we need to do. There are three European books published this autumn that take us back to that postwar world, when a new Europe and a new art were being forged from the rubble. At Pushkin \u2013 one of the forerunners among independent publishers of books in translation \u2013 publisher Laura Macaulay brings us Bourdouxhe\u2019s collection, A Nail, A Rose, translated by Faith Evans. These stories are often dream-like but are centred on the daily life of women. In \u201cLouise\u201d (first published in Les Temps Modernes in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir, a friend of Bourdouxhe\u2019s), the opening sentences inform us that \u201cwhen melted sugar falls on to the steel surface of a stove it\u2019s the very devil, it sticks like glue. To get it off you need steel wool and an emery cloth.\u201d The sensations of motherhood are quietly but acutely described. We\u2019re told that Louise\u2019s child gives her \u201cwarmth, a presence and a reason for living\u201d but doesn\u2019t offer relief from care: \u201cshe was more like a tender burden\u201d. The closing, magnificent story \u201cSous le Pont Mirabeau\u201d describes a new baby born in the middle of war. The detail of teaching the baby to breastfeed gets as much space as the war scenes, which accrue poignancy from the intense bodily life flowing through them. There are scenes of new motherhood, too, in Ginzburg\u2019s Happiness, As Such, published in July, and in Ditlevsen\u2019s 60s The Copenhagen Trilogy, recently published by Penguin in a translation by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman. Ginzburg\u2019s novel is comprised of letters written between members of a disintegrating family. It begins with a middle-aged mother writing half-resentfully, half-lovingly to her son Michele as he moves from Italy to England. The language is as direct as ever. \u201cAfter a certain point in life a person has to dunk her regrets in the morning coffee, just like biscuits,\u201d she writes, while managing to blame her son for her disappointment nonetheless. The most memorable character here is Mara, the petulant new mother of a baby who might be Michele\u2019s. In a novel filled with opportunists, Mara is the most grandly opportunistic of all, determined to use anyone she encounters to supply free accommodation and provide her with company while she feeds her baby, which she finds depressing when she is alone. She\u2019s curiously vibrant, though, more so than the more insistently refined family of her former lover. And eventually Michele\u2019s family realise this enough to befriend Mara, even though it seems unlikely the baby is actually his. It is to Mara that Michele\u2019s sister says the line (there\u2019s always one of these in a Ginzburg novel) that cuts through to the misery underlying all this and in so doing offers a kind of hard-won hope. \u201cWe\u2019re all unreliable and broken somewhere inside and sometimes it seems desperately attractive to be unrooted and breathing nothing but your own solitude. That\u2019s how people find each other, and understand.\u201d For Ditlevsen, hope of this kind occurs less often through connection with others than through writing. The Copenhagen Trilogy is a catalogue of casual brutality and exploitation. The young Tove is told by an early mentor that everyone is trying to use each other for something, and Ditlevsen is open in taking this on as a way of life. In a Moll Flanders-like tale of chaotic multiple marriages that echoes the patterns of her own life, Ditlevsen uses one husband to get published, another to have a child, and another to procure the drugs that he (a doctor) gets her addicted to by offering her a shot of the opioid Demerol in their first sexual encounter. In the process, she loses as much as she gains from these men, becoming increasingly vulnerable to pain. However, as in much of the best autofiction, the protagonist\u2019s weakness is counterpoised by the strength of her voice \u2013 indeed the tenacity of that voice may in odd ways rely on the flaws of character that it lights up. This is a woman who, even when exhausted by her menial jobs, frightened by European politics (the trilogy begins during Hitler\u2019s rise to power) or incarcerated in a mental asylum, knows her own power. \u201cOn the sly, you observe the adults whose childhood lies inside them, torn and full of holes like a used and moth-eaten rug no one thinks about anymore or has any use for,\u201d she observes as a child. And as an adult, she is still observing slyly, speaking beyond the cruel and disappointing figures she encounters to us, her readers, awaiting her in another time and another place",

      "body": "<p>A sea change is under way in governments worldwide, and no one is talking about it. Algorithms and artificial intelligence are taking over welfare payments systems, and with this shift to automation the last vestige of dignity for poor and vulnerable people is being attacked.</p> <p>These changes are often made quietly, with little or no public debate or accountability. Yet in the process, the lives of millions of people across the globe are being affected.</p> <p>Last month, the Guardian ran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/automating-poverty\">a series, Automating Poverty,</a> that sought to cast a light on the way digital innovation is threatening the poor. The series came about through our reporting on the work of Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.</p> <p>We first came in contact with Alston when he was conducting a UN audit into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/america-extreme-poverty-un-special-rapporteur\">extreme poverty in the US</a>. His report was so excoriating of the Trump administration and its tax cuts that he provoked a furious reaction from the US state department, which we also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/nikki-haley-un-poverty-report-misleading-politically-motivated\">covered</a>.</p> <p>We then followed Alston as he researched and wrote an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/un-report-compares-tory-welfare-reforms-to-creation-of-workhouses\">equally devastating</a> account<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/amber-rudd-to-lodge-complaint-over-un-austerity-report\"> </a>of austerity in the UK \u2013 with a similarly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/amber-rudd-to-lodge-complaint-over-un-austerity-report\">splenetic response</a> from Westminster.</p> <p>In the wake of those groundbreaking and headline-creating studies, Alston decided that his next big venture would be into a subject both more global and more insidious: the emergence of what he calls the \u201cdigital welfare state\u201d. The development has huge implications for low-income and vulnerable people, yet virtually nobody appears to be paying attention to it.</p> <p>When the Guardian learned that Alston was thinking along these lines, our ears pricked up. This seemed a natural fit, not only given our emphasis on reporting on poverty but also taking into account our conviction that major social change should always occur with full transparency, not in the dark, as seemed to be the case here.</p> <p>We also had the reporting muscle in place to take on a global phenomenon. With major offices in the UK, US and Australia, and correspondents located around the world, we saw the opportunity to turn our spotlight on how the digital welfare state is unfolding in both industrialised and developing countries.</p> <p>Our correspondent Rebecca Ratcliffe travelled almost 1,000 miles from New Delhi to Dumka in the east of India to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/glitch-india-biometric-welfare-system-starvation\">investigate</a> the country\u2019s vast biometric ID scheme, Aadhaar. When she reached the village, she was immediately led by Alabati Devi to a patch of land where, in May, her husband, Motka Manjhi, had collapsed and died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf24321f3eecfb55cee29d0e2aa70b99307e4cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf24321f3eecfb55cee29d0e2aa70b99307e4cc/0_0_6585_3951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Devi is convinced Manjhi died from starvation after his food subsidies were stopped because his thumbprint wasn\u2019t recognised by the Aadhaar biometrics database.</p> <p>\u201cThe Aadhaar system is almost completely opaque,\u201d Ratcliffe told us after she had returned to New Delhi. \u201cIn Jharkhand, one of India\u2019s poorest states, vast numbers are affected, yet when we were reporting this story, no government officials returned our calls.\u201d</p> <p>In Australia, our Melbourne-based reporter Luke Henriques-Gomes has been covering inequality and welfare for the past year. After reporting on families who have been informed by text message that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/automated-messages-welfare-australia-system\"> their payments have been suspended</a>, sometimes in error and with no human to complain to, he was shocked by how little scrutiny those changes have received.</p> <p>Even though the controversy around automated welfare debt has been bubbling for years in Australia, the government has managed to use similar technologies to cut the welfare budget with very little attention: in just 12 months, welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times.</p> <p>\u201cWhat became clear after talking to people affected by this is how hard these automated systems are to navigate, especially for the vulnerable,\u201d Henriques-Gomes says. \u201cWelfare recipients were completely resigned to the fact these advancements in technology were designed to police their lives and punish them. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, Robert Booth and Sarah Marsh spent the best part of six weeks digging into the automation of welfare systems. The early days were hard going: the terrain was murky, complicated and riddled with IT jargon. Most of the people who knew what was really going on didn\u2019t want to talk. The Department of Work and Pensions declined to answer freedom of information requests, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/15/councils-using-algorithms-make-welfare-decisions-benefits\">councils such as Sunderland</a>, which had abandoned a multimillion-pound algorithmic-welfare project, clammed up.</p> <p>What kept the reporters going amid these hurdles were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/14/computer-says-no-the-people-trapped-in-universal-credits-black-hole\">experiences of claimants</a>. \u201cWatching people with learning difficulties being moved to tears of frustration by the vagaries of the \u2018digital by default\u2019 system was galvanising,\u201d Booth says. \u201cThe more people we spoke to in Rochdale, London, Gateshead and Manchester, the clearer the problems with the existing systems seemed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a61baa70fbaba34c9d7eace6350b9e04c49f33f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a61baa70fbaba34c9d7eace6350b9e04c49f33f1/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman scanning her fingerprints for use in India\u2019s Aadhaar biometric ID scheme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman scanning her fingerprints for use in India\u2019s Aadhaar biometric ID scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saumya Khandelwal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As they dug further into the story, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/14/fears-rise-in-benefits-system-automation-could-plunge-claimants-deeper-into-poverty\">clear themes started to emerge</a> about what authorities were up to. Better data and more candid responses began to come in and the reporters\u2019 understanding grew. \u201cFinally it felt like we had a toehold on the story, albeit with a sense that there is so much more still to find out,\u201d Booth says.</p> <p>That comment chimed with the sentiment shared by everyone who worked on the Automating Poverty project: we had alighted on a line of reporting that has only just begun.</p> <p>That sense was also expressed in the scores of emails that we received in the wake of publishing the series, from social scientists, government officials \u2013 and, crucially, welfare recipients \u2013 from all around the world. </p> <p>At the end of the week that the series ran, Alston\u2019s report was published and presented at the United Nations general assembly in New York. Marking the occasion, the Guardian mediated a panel discussion to debate the human rights challenges of the digital age. The panel consisted of Alston; Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights; Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook; Kumi Naidoo, the secretary general of Amnesty International; and the writer and scholar Shoshana Zuboff.</p> <p>Bachelet summed up the feeling that the world had glimpsed a radical shift that needed to be dragged into the light. \u201cThe dark end of the digital spectrum threatens not just privacy and safety, but undermines free and fair elections; jeopardises freedom of expression, information, thought and belief; and buries the truth under fake news. The stakes could not be higher,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe must ensure that the digital revolution is driven by people, not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A sea change is under way in governments worldwide, and no one is talking about it. Algorithms and artificial intelligence are taking over welfare payments systems, and with this shift to automation the last vestige of dignity for poor and vulnerable people is being attacked. These changes are often made quietly, with little or no public debate or accountability. Yet in the process, the lives of millions of people across the globe are being affected. Last month, the Guardian ran a series, Automating Poverty, that sought to cast a light on the way digital innovation is threatening the poor. The series came about through our reporting on the work of Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. We first came in contact with Alston when he was conducting a UN audit into extreme poverty in the US. His report was so excoriating of the Trump administration and its tax cuts that he provoked a furious reaction from the US state department, which we also covered. We then followed Alston as he researched and wrote an equally devastating account of austerity in the UK \u2013 with a similarly splenetic response from Westminster. In the wake of those groundbreaking and headline-creating studies, Alston decided that his next big venture would be into a subject both more global and more insidious: the emergence of what he calls the \u201cdigital welfare state\u201d. The development has huge implications for low-income and vulnerable people, yet virtually nobody appears to be paying attention to it. When the Guardian learned that Alston was thinking along these lines, our ears pricked up. This seemed a natural fit, not only given our emphasis on reporting on poverty but also taking into account our conviction that major social change should always occur with full transparency, not in the dark, as seemed to be the case here. We also had the reporting muscle in place to take on a global phenomenon. With major offices in the UK, US and Australia, and correspondents located around the world, we saw the opportunity to turn our spotlight on how the digital welfare state is unfolding in both industrialised and developing countries. Our correspondent Rebecca Ratcliffe travelled almost 1,000 miles from New Delhi to Dumka in the east of India to investigate the country\u2019s vast biometric ID scheme, Aadhaar. When she reached the village, she was immediately led by Alabati Devi to a patch of land where, in May, her husband, Motka Manjhi, had collapsed and died. Devi is convinced Manjhi died from starvation after his food subsidies were stopped because his thumbprint wasn\u2019t recognised by the Aadhaar biometrics database. \u201cThe Aadhaar system is almost completely opaque,\u201d Ratcliffe told us after she had returned to New Delhi. \u201cIn Jharkhand, one of India\u2019s poorest states, vast numbers are affected, yet when we were reporting this story, no government officials returned our calls.\u201d In Australia, our Melbourne-based reporter Luke Henriques-Gomes has been covering inequality and welfare for the past year. After reporting on families who have been informed by text message that their payments have been suspended, sometimes in error and with no human to complain to, he was shocked by how little scrutiny those changes have received. Even though the controversy around automated welfare debt has been bubbling for years in Australia, the government has managed to use similar technologies to cut the welfare budget with very little attention: in just 12 months, welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times. \u201cWhat became clear after talking to people affected by this is how hard these automated systems are to navigate, especially for the vulnerable,\u201d Henriques-Gomes says. \u201cWelfare recipients were completely resigned to the fact these advancements in technology were designed to police their lives and punish them. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d In the UK, Robert Booth and Sarah Marsh spent the best part of six weeks digging into the automation of welfare systems. The early days were hard going: the terrain was murky, complicated and riddled with IT jargon. Most of the people who knew what was really going on didn\u2019t want to talk. The Department of Work and Pensions declined to answer freedom of information requests, while councils such as Sunderland, which had abandoned a multimillion-pound algorithmic-welfare project, clammed up. What kept the reporters going amid these hurdles were the experiences of claimants. \u201cWatching people with learning difficulties being moved to tears of frustration by the vagaries of the \u2018digital by default\u2019 system was galvanising,\u201d Booth says. \u201cThe more people we spoke to in Rochdale, London, Gateshead and Manchester, the clearer the problems with the existing systems seemed.\u201d As they dug further into the story, clear themes started to emerge about what authorities were up to. Better data and more candid responses began to come in and the reporters\u2019 understanding grew. \u201cFinally it felt like we had a toehold on the story, albeit with a sense that there is so much more still to find out,\u201d Booth says. That comment chimed with the sentiment shared by everyone who worked on the Automating Poverty project: we had alighted on a line of reporting that has only just begun. That sense was also expressed in the scores of emails that we received in the wake of publishing the series, from social scientists, government officials \u2013 and, crucially, welfare recipients \u2013 from all around the world. At the end of the week that the series ran, Alston\u2019s report was published and presented at the United Nations general assembly in New York. Marking the occasion, the Guardian mediated a panel discussion to debate the human rights challenges of the digital age. The panel consisted of Alston; Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights; Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook; Kumi Naidoo, the secretary general of Amnesty International; and the writer and scholar Shoshana Zuboff. Bachelet summed up the feeling that the world had glimpsed a radical shift that needed to be dragged into the light. \u201cThe dark end of the digital spectrum threatens not just privacy and safety, but undermines free and fair elections; jeopardises freedom of expression, information, thought and belief; and buries the truth under fake news. The stakes could not be higher,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must ensure that the digital revolution is driven by people, not the other way around.\u201d",

Then things got weird. McDonald\u2019s, never ones to shy away from a publicity stunt, brought Roiland\u2019s favourite condiment back for one day only in 2017. It sold out immediately, and demand was so high in some branches that police had to be called out to deal with fans angrily chanting: \u201cWe want sauce.\u201d</p> <p>Such is the strange power of Rick and Morty, one of the decade\u2019s more unlikely success stories. Since its debut in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/18/adult-swim-television-channel-too-many-cooks\">Adult Swim</a>\u2019s seemingly niche cartoon has been obsessed over by everyone from Kanye West to its army of young fans. The most popular comedy among US millennials when its third season launched in 2017 (ahead of both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/27/how-we-made-modern-family-christopher-lloyd-steve-levitan\">Modern Family</a>), it has the clout not just to lay waste to branches of McDonald\u2019s but to make or break bands; just ask Blonde Redhead, whose song For the Damaged Coda was catapulted into the upper reaches of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rock chart nearly two decades after its release due to an appearance on the show. </p> <p>Rick and Morty\u2019s popularity is made even more remarkable by the fact that it exists so purposefully outside the mainstream. Sure, on paper it might sound wholesome: a genius scientist takes his grandson on dimension-hopping adventures. Except that these adventures are all horrifyingly twisted and surreal, the scientist (Rick) is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, and the grandson (Morty) regularly experiences levels of trauma that would send most people catatonic. Both tonally and visually, the whole thing is an eye-popping, stomach-churning \u2013 and very funny \u2013 assault on the senses; one that also somehow finds time to muse on the nature of existence. As Morty says in one memorable episode: \u201cNobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody\u2019s going to die.

The seeds for the show were planted in 2006 when Roiland presented his crudely drawn sketch The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti \u2013 a Back to the Future parody that was the precursor to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/03/rick-and-morty-how-the-worlds-most-ingenious-animation-punkd-fans-perfectly\">Rick and Morty </a>\u2013 at Harmon\u2019s gonzo short film festival Channel 101. Over the next few years, the two worked on their own projects \u2013 Harmon created fan-favourite sitcom Community, while Roiland became known as the voice of Lemongrab in cult kids\u2019 cartoon Adventure Time \u2013 but were reunited when Adult Swim asked Harmon to make an animated show.

      "bodyText": "Back in 1998, McDonald\u2019s launched a limited-edition Szechuan dipping sauce to tie in with the release of Disney\u2019s Mulan. Few noticed when the sauce was quietly discontinued soon after, but one man never gave up hope that it might return. That man was Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty, and his love for the sauce was such a running joke in the writers\u2019 room of the hit animated comedy that it made it into the show\u2019s third season as a major plot point. Then things got weird. McDonald\u2019s, never ones to shy away from a publicity stunt, brought Roiland\u2019s favourite condiment back for one day only in 2017. It sold out immediately, and demand was so high in some branches that police had to be called out to deal with fans angrily chanting: \u201cWe want sauce.\u201d Such is the strange power of Rick and Morty, one of the decade\u2019s more unlikely success stories. Since its debut in 2013, Adult Swim\u2019s seemingly niche cartoon has been obsessed over by everyone from Kanye West to its army of young fans. The most popular comedy among US millennials when its third season launched in 2017 (ahead of both The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family), it has the clout not just to lay waste to branches of McDonald\u2019s but to make or break bands; just ask Blonde Redhead, whose song For the Damaged Coda was catapulted into the upper reaches of Billboard\u2019s Hot Rock chart nearly two decades after its release due to an appearance on the show. Rick and Morty\u2019s popularity is made even more remarkable by the fact that it exists so purposefully outside the mainstream. Sure, on paper it might sound wholesome: a genius scientist takes his grandson on dimension-hopping adventures. Except that these adventures are all horrifyingly twisted and surreal, the scientist (Rick) is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, and the grandson (Morty) regularly experiences levels of trauma that would send most people catatonic. Both tonally and visually, the whole thing is an eye-popping, stomach-churning \u2013 and very funny \u2013 assault on the senses; one that also somehow finds time to muse on the nature of existence. As Morty says in one memorable episode: \u201cNobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody\u2019s going to die. Come watch TV.\u201d The credit for the show\u2019s success can be laid squarely at the feet of co-creators Roiland and Dan Harmon, the former of whom also voices the two eponymous stars, although in reality his timbre is closer to long-suffering 13-year-old Morty than his sadistic grandpa. The seeds for the show were planted in 2006 when Roiland presented his crudely drawn sketch The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti \u2013 a Back to the Future parody that was the precursor to Rick and Morty \u2013 at Harmon\u2019s gonzo short film festival Channel 101. Over the next few years, the two worked on their own projects \u2013 Harmon created fan-favourite sitcom Community, while Roiland became known as the voice of Lemongrab in cult kids\u2019 cartoon Adventure Time \u2013 but were reunited when Adult Swim asked Harmon to make an animated show. He thought of Roiland straight away, and the two of them set about making Roiland\u2019s gross-out style more palatable to a wider viewership. Acclaim and awards soon followed, notably an Emmy for outstanding animated programme, a hotly contested category in this classic era of adult animation. Roiland and Harmon, speaking over the phone from LA, suggest that their working relationship is one of balance, creative integrity, and a good dose of taking the piss (\u201cHe\u2019s grown very distant and cold,\u201d Harmon jokes of Roiland). Bar the odd squabble over \u201ca tonal thing or a joke\u201d, the pair have \u201cnever disagreed to any great extent over anything truly important,\u201d Roiland says. It is a relationship that, it\u2019s fair to say, is far healthier than that of Rick and his grandson. Over the course of the show, Rick has wiped Morty\u2019s mind, trapped him in a series of Saw-like murder rooms and caused the separation of his parents. For the most part, poor old Morty has reacted to this litany of horrors with the same terror and disbelief.

The hosts amassed 580 in their first innings, even with Steve Smith contributing a team-low four runs, before tightening their hold on Pakistan with three wickets late in the day. The visiting side, with two days to play, are at the foot of a mountain, trailing by 276 runs with seven wickets still in hand. The star of the show on Saturday was Marnus Labuschagne, who struck not only his maiden Test century but also his highest first-class score. It was the innings of a young man who promises to be scoring runs for Australia for years to come. Pakistan have pulled big batting performances out of the bag before, even here in Australia, but they\u2019ll do well to avoid anything other than an innings defeat. Thanks for your company and good cheer.

Interesting, but it started so wide of Warner\u2019s off stump that it didn\u2019t threaten. Imran, the right-armer, has come around the wicket to the left-hander after spending all of yesterday bowling over the wicket. That\u2019s how Stuart Broad created all the problems he did for Warner. Imran looks a bit better already, as another ball wobbles slightly in the air. Needs to get closer to the stumps though. Warner watched that last ball intently, all the way through to the keeper. Too wide for a third time from Imran. A touch closer for the final delivery, but Warner isn\u2019t tempted.

Scene: EXT, the Gabba cricket ground. The day is hot and sunny. The Australian team will continue batting for as long as they feel like it, unless the very tired Pakistani bowlers can conjure nine wickets where yesterday they managed one. The key characters for today\u2019s play each contain a key question. Can WARNER go on to bat really long and make a big score, given this is only the second time he has batted through a full day, and the other time he was out early the next day? Will MARNUS move on from making useful fifties to making a first Test hundred? And will STEVE SMITH explode from having to wait three days to have a bat? All this and more, in today\u2019s episode of Test cricket. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here is the day-three report. And the report of New Zealand\u2019s fightback against England \u2026 Another day with Australia\u2019s name written all over it. The hosts amassed 580 in their first innings, even with Steve Smith contributing a team-low four runs, before tightening their hold on Pakistan with three wickets late in the day. The visiting side, with two days to play, are at the foot of a mountain, trailing by 276 runs with seven wickets still in hand. The star of the show on Saturday was Marnus Labuschagne, who struck not only his maiden Test century but also his highest first-class score. It was the innings of a young man who promises to be scoring runs for Australia for years to come. Pakistan have pulled big batting performances out of the bag before, even here in Australia, but they\u2019ll do well to avoid anything other than an innings defeat. Thanks for your company and good cheer. See you tomorrow. 17th over: Pakistan 64-3 (Shan Masood 27, Babar Azam 20) Last over of the day. Hazlewood to bowl. Babar plays at one he should probably have left, but his thick edge splits gully and third slip before racing to the third-man fence. Babar sees off the remaining deliveries and that is stumps. Pakistan trail by 276 runs with seven second-innings wickets in hand. 16th over: Pakistan 60-3 (Shan Masood 27, Babar Azam 16) Too wide from Lyon and Shan makes him pay with a boundary through the covers. Lyon then beats the bat with a huge turner and follows up with another, this time beating Paine also but not Smith, who claims the \u2018catch\u2019 at first slip. Confusion abounds, nobody is sure if Shan hit it or if it carried, but Australia decide to review the not-out decision. The evidence is not conclusive enough to overturn it and Shan is not out. 15th over: Pakistan 56-3 (Shan Masood 23, Babar Azam 16) A slower one from Hazlewood but he overpitches at the same time, allowing Babar to drive through the covers for three. Around the wicket now to the left-handed Shan. No breakthrough but the thought was there. 14th over: Pakistan 52-3 (Shan Masood 22, Babar Azam 13) Shadows lengthening, Lyon comes on for a bowl. And, men around the bat, he\u2019s instantly good. A maiden to start. Three overs left in the day. 13th over: Pakistan 52-3 (Shan Masood 22, Babar Azam 13) Three more for Babar, square driving Hazlewood behind point. Pretty to watch. Abhijato Sensarma writes in with this to say: \u201cBabar Azam stands between Australia and an innings victory. If he and Pakistan somehow make the opposition bat again, it\u2019s going to be a victory in itself for the demoralised team. Question is - how realistic is that possibility? The lesser it is, the more likely Pakistan are to pull it off.\u201d I like your last point, Abhijato. If anyone can get something out of this, it\u2019s Pakistan. But you\u2019d have to be a real cricket romantic, or possessed of a wild imagination, to think this is anything other than an innings victory for Australia. But I\u2019ve been wrong before. 12th over: Pakistan 47-3 (Shan Masood 21, Babar Azam 10) Starc back in the attack, from the opposite end to his damaging opening spell. He goes shot to Babar, conceding a no-ball with the third of the over above shoulder height. 11th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Shan Masood 20, Babar Azam 7) Close! Again! Shan steps into a straight drive but mistimes it badly and inside edges just past his stumps, picking up a single down to fine leg. Babar then helps himself to a juicy half volley from Cummins, driving to the fence in what is the shot of the innings to this point. Two balls later he drives again, this time through the covers for three. Pakistan trail by 298 runs. 10th over: Pakistan 32-3 (Shan Masood 19, Babar Azam 0) Close! Not sure what he was thinking, but Shan goes after a rising short ball from Hazlewood, gets very little of it, and fortuitously clears the man at mid-on. Could easily have been on his way. Hazlewood then does Babar for pace and misses the top of middle stump by millimetres. Outstanding fast bowling. 9th over: Pakistan 29-3 (Shan Masood 16, Babar Azam 0) Shan gets a fair chuck of this pull shot, taking Cummins for three, before Babar shows admirable restraint to keep the Aussie quick at arm\u2019s length. 8th over: Pakistan 26-3 (Shan Masood 13, Babar Azam 0) Shan get a thick outside edge off Hazlewood but it lands just in front of the man at fourth slip. One run from the over. 7th over: Pakistan 25-3 (Shan Masood 12, Babar Azam 0) Cummins switches ends, replacing the wicket taker. Not sure how Starc might feel about that. Tail up, got the taste, now off to fine-leg you go! Cummins beats Asad\u2019s inside edge with a nice off cutter before getting his man next ball thanks to a thick outside edge that finds its way to Smith at third slip. In all seriousness, unless the ball is heading towards the stumps, I\u2019d advise Pakistan to keep bat away from ball tonight. Done for bounce, Asad on his way for a risible duck. Not that there are any good ones, I guess. 6th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Shan Masood 12, Asad Shafiq 0) Hazlewood on for Cummins. Hate to state the bleeding obvious, but Pakistan are in all shades of strife here. Starc has now done the double on Haris this match. Hazlewood opens with a maiden. 5th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Shan Masood 12, Asad Shafiq 0) Haris sits and waits on the back foot to Starc, opening the face for a nice boundary but then it all goes to pot next ball as he wafts at one outside off stump and is caught behind. The batsman stays at the crease for some time, no doubt cursing his own profligacy. 4th over: Pakistan 18-1 (Shan Masood 9, Haris Sohail 4) Haris picks up three off Cummins before ducking under a bouncer last ball. Good bowling from Starc in the previous over: dish up a shocker, lull the batsman into a false sense of security and then trap him with a fast, straight one. 3rd over: Pakistan 14-1 (Shan Masood 8, Haris Sohail 1) Starc overpitches, and is wide to boot, leaving Azhar with no option but to pummel him through the covers for four. But the next ball is straighter, much straighter, trapping the Pakistan captain in front of his stumps. The appeal goes up for leg before and he is out. A review follows, but the ball is legitimate, is pitching in line and goes down as umpire\u2019s call for height, meaning Pakistan don\u2019t lose a review for the failure. 2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Shan Masood 8, Azhar Ali 1) Cummins at the other end for Australia, and as a fully paid-up member of the Pat Cummins fan club you won\u2019t hear any disagreement from me. Azhar picks up a single before the paceman tries to tempt the left-handed Shan from over the wicket, but nothing doing. Kev M tweets in with this: \u201cHow often do you see Steve Smith with the lowest score in the innings?\u201d That\u2019s a good question, Kev. Would be a rarity. Anyone got the answer without delving deep, deep into the books? 1st over: Pakistan 8-0 (Shan Masood 8, Azhar Ali 0) Starc opens for Australia with three slips, a gully and a point. His first ball cannons into Shan\u2019s hip, just above the thigh pad. Leather on bone. His pain is palpable but mind soon beats matter as he turns Starc through midwicket, and then past square, for successive boundaries. Pakistan trail by 332 runs. So Pakistan will have 17 over to face this evening. Plenty of time for plenty to happen. Ripper of a tweet here from Messy Jez. Yep, MJ, just how good is cricket. And that is the end. Hazlewood is given out leg before, after which he launches an unsuccessful review, leaving Australia with a 340-run first-innings lead. And they\u2019ll have a good chuck of time to get at Pakistan\u2019s top order before stumps. Yasir ends up with figures of 4-205 from 48.4 overs. He\u2019ll sleep soundly tonight. 157th over: Australia 575-9 (Lyon 8, Hazlewood 5) Not sure what Australia have to gain by adding a few extra runs onto what is already a huge pile, but continuing they are. Just a single from Imran\u2019s over. C\u2019mon, Tim, please declare. These are fertile times for wicket taking. 156th over: Australia 574-9 (Lyon 7, Hazlewood 5) A Yasir misfield off his own bowling hands Lyon a single and Hazlewood keeps the leggie at bay before opening the shoulders last ball and driving him past mid-on for four. That\u2019s a double century of sorts for Yasir: 3-200 from 48 overs. Australia\u2019s lead is 334 runs. 155th over: Australia 569-9 (Lyon 6, Hazlewood 1) Cummins flashes his blade outside off, nicking Imran into the safe gloves of Rizwan. But no declaration is coming. Hazlewood is on his way to the middle. 154th over: Australia 567-8 (Cummins 7, Lyon 5) Lyon cuts late and hard, sending Yasir to the fence. With the last ball of his 47th over, the leggie gains prodigious turn - no doubt to the lip-licking excitement of Lyon. He\u2019ll be let loose on this deck sometime soon. 153rd over: Australia 563-8 (Cummins 7, Lyon 1) Lyon gets off the mark with (not) the GOAT single you\u2019ve ever seen, and Cummins follows up with two more through the covers. When will the declaration come? Must be soon, methinks. 152nd over: Australia 559-8 (Cummins 4) Yasir continues, and frankly we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Starc gets off the mark with a cut past point for three and Cummins follows up with three more through the covers. Four byes and a leg glance for two follow, and a highly eventful over comes to an end with Starc missing a defensive prof and being trapped leg before. Starc asks for a review but the decision stands. That\u2019s now three wickets for the tireless Yasir. 151st over: Australia 546-7 (Cummins 0, Starc 0) Labuschagne plays a loose, tired-looking shot at a wide one from Shaheen, opening the face and picking out Babar at gully. Labuschagne holds his ground, possibly waiting for a no-ball call, but the delivery is legit and he\u2019s on his way. Labuschagne falls just short of his double century. A wonderful, breakthrough dig from the young man. 150th over: Australia 546-6 (Labuschagne 185, Cummins 0) Just a single off the 150th over of the innings, with Yasir\u2019s return now standing at 2-182 from 45 overs - and just one maiden. 149th over: Australia 545-6 (Labuschagne 184, Cummins 0) Labuschagne drives on the up to Shaheen, doesn\u2019t get all of it, but clears mid on and collects two runs for his troubles. And now that\u2019s his highest first-class score. But the story\u2019s not so good for Paine, who plays a half-hearted pull shot but bottom edges onto his own legs and into the hands of second slip. 148th over: Australia 542-5 (Labuschagne 181, Paine 13) Yasir begins his 44th over, the poor bloke. He\u2019ll be ripping leggies in his sleep tonight. It\u2019s a tidy over but the batsmen are in no way threatened. One run from it. 147th over: Australia 541-5 (Labuschagne 180, Paine 13) Welcome back. Allan Border has just said he would like 50 minutes at Pakistan this evening. Obviously not literally, but if he were captain. It\u2019s AB, so that\u2019s good enough for me. Out in the middle, Labuschagne greets Shaheen with a couple of glorious boundaries through midwicket, the first of which was picked up from near off. He\u2019s seeing them like beach balls. Australia\u2019s lead is 301 runs. A very eventful session and a big one for Australia. They might have lost a couple of wickets, but wickets aren\u2019t an issue when your lead is this big. The hosts racked up 137 runs in the afternoon, with Labuschagne going on his merry way. A double looks his for the taking. Catch you in a few moments. 146th over: Australia 532-5 (Labuschagne 171, Paine 13) Haris positively races through a maiden over and there is nothing more to be said than it\u2019s time for tea. 145th over: Australia 532-5 (Labuschagne 171, Paine 13) Paine gets down on one knee but plays all around his attempted sweep and is struck on the thigh. Iftikhar, and Rizwan in particular, are highly animated in their appeal for leg before, but the answer is no and no review is forthcoming. Missing leg it seems. 144th over: Australia 530-5 (Labuschagne 170, Paine 12) I wonder if Paine\u2019s words to Labuschagne were along the lines of, \u2018Step on it, son, happy for you to get your double ton but I\u2019m thinking of declaring sometime soon\u2019. If so, Labuschagne has picked up the clue phone, hitting Haris for successive fours. Paine then joins his partner in the boundary club, making it 14 runs from the over. 143rd over: Australia 516-5 (Labuschagne 161, Paine 7) Iftikhar returns to the attack. Paine picks up his first boundary of the Australian Test summer, putting away a loose one through extra cover. Lovely shot from the skipper. 142nd over: Australia 511-5 (Labuschagne 161, Paine 2) Haris continues his tidy spell and is worked around for a couple of singles. Australia\u2019s lead is 271 runs. 141st over: Australia 508-5 (Labuschagne 160, Paine 0) Labuschagne is interviewed on air as Paine walks out to the middle - how very T20! - and is asked what the plan might be from here. The skipper\u2019s on his way, says Labuschagne, so I\u2019ll find out shortly. Or words to that effect. Labuschagne pulls Imran for a couple, the only runs in the over. 140th over: Australia 506-5 (Labuschagne 158, Paine 0) Head\u2019s cameo knock comes to an end, caught behind of a thin edge trying to work Haris down to fine leg off his pads. A bit of a nothing dismissal but excellent keeping from Rizwan. 139th over: Australia 505-4 (Labuschagne 157, Head 24) Imran returns to the attack as Yasir is spelled. Labuschagne opens the shoulders and really middles one past point, but the stopper is out there and a very good shot brings just the one run. It\u2019s a similar story for Head later in the over. Pakistan look as interested now in stemming the flow of runs as they do in taking wickets. 138th over: Australia 502-4 (Labuschagne 155, Head 23) And that\u2019s the 500 up for Australia, for the loss of only four wickets and with Steve Smith a non-contributor. Quite incredible when you think about it. Haris is worked around for a two and a single. 137th over: Australia 499-4 (Labuschagne 152, Head 23) Yasir wraps one up for Head, puts a bow on it, and gets what he deserves for what is a really bad ball - driven through extra cover for another boundary. These two have already put on 31 in only five overs. 136th over: Australia 491-4 (Labuschagne 150, Head 17) Labuschagne\u2019s ripping innings reaches another milestone as he steers Haris past point for one. Huge plaudits also for Rizwan, who earlier in the over (pads and all) chased a thick outside edge all the way to the fence and saved a run. Well played! 135th over: Australia 486-4 (Labuschagne 149, Head 13) More runs for Head and this time it\u2019s more convincing as he rocks back and cuts Yasir past point for four. 134th over: Australia 479-4 (Labuschagne 149, Head 6) Head looks intent on picking up where Wade left off, attacking from the outset and picking up his first boundary with an attempted cover drive that ends up being a thick edge that races to the third-man fence. 133rd over: Australia 473-4 (Labuschagne 148, Head 1) Labuschagne goes after Yasir but gets very little of his lofted off drive, and for a brief moment he looks like he might be in strife, but the ball lands safely. Five from the over. 132nd over: Australia 468-4 (Labuschagne 144) Haris over the wicket to Wade, who opens the face and tries to finesse the ball to third man but manages only a fine edge to the keeper - who gloves it off his own leg. Something of a soft way to go but that was still an innings for the moment from Wade. Score briskly, support Labuschagne, give his skipper options. 131st over: Australia 466-3 (Labuschagne 143, Wade 59) Shaheen continues, and he\u2019s been pretty good today. A single marks the over, as well as a stinger on the hand for Wade from a throw at the stumps after said single. Much appreciated, Geoff. Splendid calling. In golf the third day of play is known as moving day. The same can be said about this Test match, insomuch as Australia are moving further and further out of Pakistan\u2019s sight. As Tim Rogers once asked, how much is enough? In all likelihood, too much won\u2019t be enough. From here Australia could probably bat as long as they please, but the impression is festering they might like a few overs at Pakistan this evening. Either way, the home side will be planning on not having to bat again until Adelaide. Looking forward to your company today. By all means, drop me an email or a tweet 130th over: Australia 465-3 (Labuschagne 143, Wade 58) It\u2019s time for the reverse sweeps and laps now. Wade tries a couple of them, twice getting the top edge, once just evading Shaheen at backward point and going for four, the other time hitting the keeper on the full and bouncing away. You do you, I guess? That\u2019s drinks, Australia lead by 225. I\u2019m out of here, and Scott Heinrich will take over. 129th over: Australia 459-3 (Labuschagne 142, Wade 53) Marnus happy to take on the short ball again from Shaheen, pulling two more runs to midwicket. He gets drawn into a big wide drive though and beaten by a slower ball, throwing his head back in consternation as that goes past his edge. Reverts to his compact self to guide a run behind point. 128th over: Australia 455-3 (Labuschagne 139, Wade 52) Yasir Shah is back after a break that began just before lunch. He\u2019s bowled a lot of overs already. Wade stretches towards a low full toss to paddle it fine for one. Labuschagne drives three through midwicket. The run tally keeps mounting. More so when Marnus opens the face to glide past slip for four! 127th over: Australia 446-3 (Labuschagne 132, Wade 50) You can\u2019t keep Wade quiet for too long. Shaheen bowls full enough for Wade to drive, which he duly does to the point boundary for four. Then knocks the straighter ball to leg for a single to raise his milestone, his fifth Test fifty. Impressive from Wade after two Ashes tons. 126th over: Australia 441-3 (Labuschagne 132, Wade 45) It\u2019s easier to make up those runs against Haris Sohail. Marnus works him both sides of the wicket, opening up his stance to late-cut with finesse, then twice working into the leg side, picking up two runs for each of those strokes. 125th over: Australia 435-3 (Labuschagne 126, Wade 45) Shaheen is able to keep the scoring down, making Wade play when he pitches up, then making Wade duck when he pitches short. 124th over: Australia 434-3 (Labuschagne 125, Wade 45) Shouts for a catch at leg slip as Wade gets an inside edge from Iftikhar onto the thigh pad, but it lands safe. Marnus tries a cross-bat swat over cover against the spinner but finds one of two men there, so he goes the sweep instead next ball and draws another misfield from Shaheen, this time allowing a third run. Wade sweeps again, top edge, bouncing and spinning but saved in the deep. Definitely trying to press the pedal down now. He believes he can deduce which is the velocitator and which the deceleratrix. 123rd over: Australia 428-3 (Labuschagne 121, Wade 43) Marnus is not going to give this innings away. Wants a proper score, not a small ton. He resolutely defends Imran on the front foot until the bowler gets too short, then flips his pull shot away behind square for four. Creates the overpitched ball, and creams it straight past the bowler for another. High elbow, on the up, full Kookaburra sticker down the lens. Then defends the final ball. Lovely batting. 122nd over: Australia 420-3 (Labuschagne 113, Wade 43) If you can\u2019t get them off the seamer, get them off the spinner! Down the wicket comes Wade and lifts Iftikhar for six. Long and straight, after a three-step shuffle towards the bowler, waiting for the looped delivery to drop. Adds a brace to long-on. Runs and Wade have gone together for the last couple of years. The score is 420. Blaze one up, brrrrrrap! 121st over: Australia 411-3 (Labuschagne 112, Wade 35) Imran is starting to frustrate Wade. The Australian keeps getting that angle across him and not wanting to play, so eventually he takes a couple of steps across his stumps in an effort to nudge the ball into the leg side. Couldn\u2019t get far enough across to get any purchase. Finally Wade does get across and get a couple of runs, but the other four balls he has to leave alone. 120th over: Australia 409-3 (Labuschagne 112, Wade 33) Iftikhar to continue, leg-stumpish and Marnus is quickly down on the sweep and zinging it towards deep backward square. Shaheen has a fair distance to cover but can\u2019t get enough purchase on the ball as he dives across, and it follows him into the rope. Wade almost bookends the over with another boundary but Shan Masood puts in a great sprint and slide and tap-back to keep the cut shot to three runs. 119th over: Australia 401-3 (Labuschagne 107, Wade 30) Overpitched from Imran, whipped for one off the ankle by Labuschagne. Wade is watchful against the steep angle across him as a left-hander, shouldering arms four times in succession. Recognising the threat to him and neutralising it. 118th over: Australia 400-3 (Labuschagne 106, Wade 30) So that over from Haris might have been to allow Iftikhar to change ends. The off-spinner ties down Marnus, who can only manage the single to raise Australia\u2019s 400. Get set for another three hours of Australian batting, I reckon. 117th over: Australia 399-3 (Labuschagne 105, Wade 30) Imran Khan the seam option from the other end after lunch. As is his wont, quite wide on the crease and angling in at the right-hander, across the left. They work a few singles without trouble. Australia\u2019s lead is 159. 116th over: Australia 396-3 (Labuschagne 103, Wade 29) Haris Sohail continuing after lunch rather than one of the quicks. Interesting choice. Marnus takes a single. Wade tries a reverse lap, misses, gets the ball into his pad and it rolls past his leg stump. Classic first over after lunch stuff. A much better session for Pakistan, bowling well and picking up the big wickets of Smith and Warner. But they\u2019re still miles behind in the match, and still shipped 87 runs in the two hours. Wade made sure that kept moving at the end, while Labuschagne provided all the momentum at the start. He has slowed since nearing his hundred, but has passed that milestone for the first time. Massive advantage Australia, and they\u2019re in a good position to bat long. But Pakistan have to at least try to keep taking wickets and deny Australia the right to declare, even if the deficit will be huge either way. We\u2019ll be back after the sandwiches. 115th over: Australia 395-3 (Labuschagne 102, Wade 29) Then another spin change, with Iftikhar Ahmed on to bowl off-breaks. This will be the last over before lunch. Again Wade comes across and flicks the sweep shot fine, this time only taking two runs with a sweeper having moved finer. That\u2019s the only score from the over though, and that is lunch. 114th over: Australia 393-3 (Labuschagne 102, Wade 27) Yasir needs that lunch break too, by the looks of things. Three singles from the over, then he drops very short and lets Wade plonk him away with a pull shot behind square. Four more. 113th over: Australia 386-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 21) We\u2019re officially in coasting mode before lunch, as Haris Sohail comes on for an over of part-time left-arm ortho. 112th over: Australia 385-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 20) Slightly T20 shot there, as Wade moves across to Yasir and flicks a sweep shot fine. Nearly chips a return catch thereafter though, beaten by the dip. Yasir groans as he takes the ball on the half volley. 111th over: Australia 380-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 15) A much, much better day for Pakistan with the ball. Shaheen Afridi bowls another tight over. The lines have been good, the lengths more consistent. The glaring flaw, still, is how few overs have been bowled by Imran Khan, which clearly concedes that it was a mistake to pick him ahead of Mohammad Abbas, who has an incredible Test record and demolished Australia in the UAE only a year ago. 110th over: Australia 379-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 14) The game does tend to move along when Wade is at the crease. Yasir gets a bit short, Wade guides it away through backward point. It\u2019s not perfectly timed so it teases two pursuing fieldsmen into the rope, but gets there. Job done, Wade gets off strike. 109th over: Australia 374-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 9) Labuschagne is trying to reset after his celebration. Facing Shaheen over the wicket, the batsman leaves and blocks most of the over, but then goes for a big drive and edges just short of the cordon. Was that Azhar Ali diving down at third slip? No run, and eventually a maiden for Shaheen. 108th over: Australia 374-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 9) Ok, I was wrong about Wade playing straight. He has a wander and wallops Yasir Shah over the leg side for four. And why not? 107th over: Australia 370-3 (Labuschagne 101, Wade 5) They make him wait for a while, with the stacked cordon and the ring field and Shaheen bowling a tight left-arm line, but eventually Labuschagne can\u2019t wait any longer and aims a big drive. Gets a big edge. Gets four runs, and his first Test century! It\u2019s taken him ten Tests to get there. The accidental find really during the Ashes, demanding his spot by performance when most around him were not. Now he\u2019s got the reward for the hard work that let him play that way. 106th over: Australia 366-3 (Labuschagne 97, Wade 5) Yasir tries to unsettle the left-handed Wade, starting with a googly to confuse him, then back to the leg-break. But it comes unravelled when the bowler slips too full, and Wade carves a cover drive for four. 105th over: Australia 361-3 (Labuschagne 96, Wade 1) Was Smith thinking about fast runs for a declaration? It seems a bit premature, but Australia have sent Wade out at five rather than Travis Head, and that seems like an attacking move as well. Perhaps wanting to rattle up the score quickly. Wade doesn\u2019t start with a bang though. Just a single from his first five balls. 104th over: Australia 358-3 (Labuschagne 94, Wade 0) Well, what a busy over. It started with a different wicket, but that was overturned on review! Yasir Shah has been building the pressure on Labuschagne over the last few overs, drying up his scoring, drawing some streaky shots. Finally he got a ball to zip through and hit the pad in front of off stump. Richard Illingworth gave it out, but Marnus naturally reviewed on 93, and the replay showed he got an inside edge just before it had the pad. If Yasir was disappointed, that vanished a few balls later when he ran through the greatest batsman of the era for couch change. He\u2019s got Smith! The biggest wicket of them all! And for nothing, for only four runs. Goodness me, what a turn-up. Smith must have been left off balance by having to wait so long to bat. He comes out much more aggressively than normal, skipping down to loft Yasir over the leg side for four. But he tries to repeat the shot next ball, to a fuller ball without advancing, and simply misses it as it nearly yorks him and takes out his stumps. Yasir Shah! 103rd over: Australia 353-2 (Labuschagne 93, Smith 0) Naseem tries the short-pitched attack again, but Marnus pulls him for a single and Smith just gets out of the way. Bowling short to Smith early in his innings has been mooted as a plan. There aren\u2019t many plans to Smith though. 102nd over: Australia 352-2 (Labuschagne 92, Smith 0) Things settle into calm after the wicket over, with the new pair defending against Yasir. 101st over: Australia 351-2 (Labuschagne 91, Smith 0) And at equally long last, Steve Smith gets a chance to have a bat. His first on home turf since his sandpaper ban. He\u2019s back, on the third day of a match when he would have hoped to have been batting on the first morning. He counts the field, counts his boys, checks his kit, taps his pads. Taps his helmet, taps his bat, bobs his knees, bobs his knees. Wafts his backlift, holds it still, steps across, and plays a defensive push back to the bowler. Classic Smith. Prepare to see this 200 more times. That\u2019s the over. At long, long last, Naseem gets his man! Had him caught behind a hundred runs ago but it was off a no-ball. This time the bowler\u2019s foot is behind the line. The fast bowlers have looked much more threatening around the wicket to Warner today. He hasn\u2019t faced much, has barely scored at all. This over, Naseem roasts him on the outside edge twice, seaming the ball away from a full length. Then having created that doubt, delivers a proper short ball: nasty, fast, angled in from wide. Warner is trying to sway out of the way but he isn\u2019t expecting it and he\u2019s just a bit late to react. Can\u2019t drop his gloves enough, turns his head away, and the ball ends up taking the bottom edge of his bat as it hands in limbo land. Rizwan takes the tumbling catch, Naseem shouts in celebration, and the teenager\u2019s first Test wicket will, after a long interregnum, be David Warner after all. 100th over: Australia 351-1 (Warner 154, Labuschagne 91) That\u2019s a dubious shot from Labuschagne. They\u2019re talking it up on the commentary but to my eye it looked a bit desperate. Yasir landed one close to the pads, and the batsman swats across the line and is good enough or lucky enough to get good contact on it, out through midwicket for four. 99th over: Australia 347-1 (Warner 154, Labuschagne 87) Loves the strike this morning, does Marnus! Faces out five dots from Naseem and then ticks a single from the sixth. Warner is waiting at the other end, and the cameras cut to Smith waiting in the dressing room. Quality line from Kerry O\u2019Keeffe on that shot: \u201cThat\u2019s like Dracula waiting outside the Blood Bank.\u201d 98th over: Australia 346-1 (Warner 154, Labuschagne 86) A rare error from Labuschagne, getting a thick inside edge into his pads as he tries to drive Yasir. A couple of singles from the over as he moves closer to the unprecedented three figures. This is already his highest Test score. 97th over: Australia 344-1 (Warner 153, Labuschagne 85) Three balls in a row to face for Warner from Naseem, who not only takes his second run for the morning, but goes past an interesting mark of 286 balls faced. That makes this his longest ever Test innings, moving past the only other time when he batted a full day, against New Zealand at the WACA in 2015 when he made 253. 96th over: Australia 343-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 85) Gorgeous from Labuschagne! Yasir Shah on to bowl his leg-breaks. Lands one too full just outside off stump. Marnus had read the flight early, gets his back foot around and well out of the way to open up his body towards the ball, then brings the bat through across his stumps and connects with his cover drive for four. That was such good anticipation, and it beats both the infield and the sweeper. A similar shot to follow brings two more runs. That\u2019s now 30 runs today for Marnus to Warner\u2019s 1. The latter has barely had the strike. A pretty comfortable way to bat. 95th over: Australia 337-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 79) Shaheen produces a couple of errors, but can\u2019t make either of them terminal. A really good ball outside off zips from back of a length and beats the batsman\u2019s push. Then one going the other way takes the edge into his pads, though the batsman takes a pair of lucky runs. 94th over: Australia 334-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 76) Goodness. The Schagne Train is reaching runaway levels. Another short ball, this time at Imran\u2019s friendly pace, and the batsman leans back and pounds it over the leg side for four. Paddy Myer has hit the email. \u201cMorning Geoff, I\u2019m writing about the injustice of bails staying put when the stumps have been hit. There certainly seems to have been a spate of incidents recently. If a batsman can be out on the evidence of snicko when the ball hits the bat, why not the same when the stumps are hit? I have a great uncle called Bails, and he is also very hard to dislodge. It must be related.\u201d As it so happens, Paddy, I not only agree with your contention but I\u2019ve conveniently already written the argument for the prosecution of the Laws: namely that the bails only exist to show an umpire if the stumps have been hit, and thus should be made redundant and charmingly ceremonial in professional cricket. 93rd over: Australia 329-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 71) Shaheen, left-arm, bowling over the wicket to Labuschagne. Tries the bouncer, but it\u2019s not short enough and Marnus nails the pull shot, a couple more runs as the deep square sweeper gets around to midwicket. That was well struck. Follows up with a tip-run single to keep the strike. So the first drop batsman has added 16 this morning while the opener has added 1. 92nd over: Australia 326-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 68) Marnus is doing all of the scoring, Warner all of the running for him. Another three here, clipped off the ankles from Imran out behind square leg. 91st over: Australia 323-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 65) Marnus evokes the first \u201cShawwtt!\u201d of the day from around the stands. Shuffling forward, getting his front foot to the pitch, then driving cleanly through the overpitched delivery down the ground for four. Top shot. As if to celebrate, he follows up by driving Shaheen through cover for another quadruple. 90th over: Australia 314-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 56) A bit of inswing for Imran with the newish ball. Interesting, but it started so wide of Warner\u2019s off stump that it didn\u2019t threaten. Imran, the right-armer, has come around the wicket to the left-hander after spending all of yesterday bowling over the wicket. That\u2019s how Stuart Broad created all the problems he did for Warner. Imran looks a bit better already, as another ball wobbles slightly in the air. Needs to get closer to the stumps though. Warner watched that last ball intently, all the way through to the keeper. Too wide for a third time from Imran. A touch closer for the final delivery, but Warner isn\u2019t tempted. A maiden. Australia\u2019s lead is 74. 89th over: Australia 314-1 (Warner 152, Labuschagne 56) Marnus takes the first run of the day, driving to mid-off and and darting through. Warner takes a few balls to look at Shaheen, before digging out a near-yorker and dashing a run to mid-on. 88th over: Australia 312-1 (Warner 151, Labuschagne 55) We begin today much as we began yesterday. Warner leaves Imran Khan alone for the most part, watching out a maiden, except at the end he can\u2019t help going for a wide one and nearly chops onto his stumps. He had a couple of close escapes in that fashion yesterday. Remember you can email me at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or tweet me at @GeoffLemonSport. Brian Withington is first off the rank this Australian morning, as so often. \u201cTypical Australian selection chicanery - resurrect an opening batsman from obscurity after the stand-ins spent the Ashes tour toiling against the Dukes ball, and he immediately destroys the opposition on home soil in a 222-run stand facing the friendly Kookaburra. Where have you been hiding him? And that Joe Burns guy did ok, too.\u201d It was a hard day\u2019s work yesterday for Pakistan. Shaheen Afridi bowled 18 overs, young Naseem Shah bowled 16 of them at pace, and Yasir Shah the spinner bowled 28. They\u2019ll need to somehow find the reserves to go again today. Yasir looked good at times but bowled too many release balls. The two faster bowlers had good spells but couldn\u2019t break through. Imran Khan, who bowled so well in the tour match, was largely ineffective with his wide-of-the-wicket release point. Something has to change dramatically today. In the meantime, our friends across the Ditch are making a decent fist of resistance against Olde Englande. Niall McVeigh has you covered on the late shift from London if you\u2019d like to keep up to date there. And much later today, the pink-ball Test from Kolkata will resume with Virat Kohli at the crease against Bangladesh. It\u2019s a big Test week. Here is the wires report from last night to summarise the second day\u2019s play, should you need a refresher. Hello again, and welcome to Day 3. Scene: EXT, the Gabba cricket ground. The day is hot and sunny. The Australian team will continue batting for as long as they feel like it, unless the very tired Pakistani bowlers can conjure nine wickets where yesterday they managed one. The key characters for today\u2019s play each contain a key question. Can WARNER go on to bat really long and make a big score, given this is only the second time he has batted through a full day, and the other time he was out early the next day? Will MARNUS move on from making useful fifties to making a first Test hundred? And will STEVE SMITH explode from having to wait three days to have a bat? All this and more, in today\u2019s episode of Test cricket.",

      "bodyText": "Partisan rancour, smoke and mirrors and damning evidence about the misconduct of the US president \u2013 all these were expected from this week\u2019s impeachment inquiry hearings and were provided in spades. But a narrative that caught many by surprise was the role played by immigrants, the power of their origin stories and their unshaken faith in the ideal of America, even in the \u201cbuild the wall\u201d era of Donald Trump. At seven hearings over five days, spread over the course of two weeks, this was not only a congressional investigation; it was a nation holding a mirror up to itself. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that it is immigrants who believe in and love America the most,\u201d said Julissa Arce, an immigration rights advocate who came to the US from Mexico when she was 11. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to risk our lives and leave everything behind to come to this country and give everything. The bravest people who came up to testify at the hearings were the ones who said you have to fight to keep our democracy alive.\u201d Three of the 12 witnesses who testified before the House intelligence committee highlighted their immigrant backgrounds in compelling opening statements. They told how their families\u2019 experiences led them to public service and a patriotic sense of duty to defend America\u2019s national security. Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert, described how his family fled to the US from the Soviet Union when he was three years old. As children, Vindman and his twin brother were briefly interviewed in a 1985 Ken Burns documentary about immigration. Vindman, an army officer who was awarded the Purple Heart, said he and his brothers felt compelled to serve in the military to repay the country that had offered them refuge from authoritarian oppression. \u201cIn Russia, my act of expressing concern to the chain of command in an official and private channel would have severe personal and professional repercussions, and offering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life,\u201d he told the committee. Vindman also expressed gratitude for his \u201cfather\u2019s brave act of hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of being an American citizen and public servant, where I can live free, free of fear for mine and my family\u2019s safety\u201d. Poignantly and powerfully, he added: \u201cDad, I am sitting here today in the US Capitol, talking to our elected professionals. Talking to our elected professionals is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d The line was so striking that later Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democratic congressman from New York, asked Vindman to reread that message and explain why he felt able to tell his father not to worry. The witness replied: \u201cCongressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\u201d Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, moved to America from Canada when she was three. Her mother had grown up in Nazi Germany. Her father had fled the Soviet Union. \u201cTheir personal histories, my personal history gave me both deep gratitude towards the United States and great empathy for others like the Ukrainian people who want to be free,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cMy service is an expression of gratitude for all that this country has given to me and to my family.\u201d The star witness Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, described how his parents had fled Europe during the Holocaust, first moving to Uruguay and then settling in Seattle. \u201cLike so many immigrants, my family was eager for freedom and hungry for opportunity,\u201d he said. Another perspective was offered by the British-born Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert at the White House. \u201cI am an American by choice, having become a citizen in 2002. I was born in the north-east of England, in the same region that George Washington\u2019s ancestors came from.\u201d The coalminer\u2019s daughter continued: \u201cI can say with confidence that this country has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England.

In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement.\u201d But the accent \u201cnever set me back in America\u201d, Hill added.

And this is what, for me, really does make America great.\u201d Following Hill\u2019s statement, Adam Schiff, chairman of the committee, was moved to comment: \u201cThe few immigrant stories that we have heard just in the course of these hearings are among the most powerful I think I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cCol Vindman and others are the best of this country and you came here by choice.

      "body": "<p>It is winter in the 1970s. Richard and Juliette Willoughby have taken their young son from the city to live in the bleak and isolated house on the Yorkshire moors where Richard grew up. Juliette felt certain her family would find sanctuary and freedom at Starve Acre, but with the sudden and devastating death of five-year-old Ewan, the strangeness and loneliness of the place have become oppressive, symbolising the widening distance between the grieving couple.</p> <p>Unable to come to terms with the loss of her child, Juliette becomes increasingly involved with a local spiritualist group called the Beacons and their leader, Mrs Forde, who claims the ability to open a bridge between the living and the dead. Demoralised by Juliette\u2019s retreat into what he sees as superstitious claptrap, Richard camps out in the mysteriously barren field that gives <em>Starve Acre </em>its name. He is digging for the remains of the Stythwaite Oak, an ancient tree that forms the subject of a series of peculiar wood engravings and that was once the site of a notorious public hanging. He has half-convinced himself that the oak was somehow the cause of the sinister personality changes that affected Ewan shortly before his death, and is possibly the lair of the malevolent nature-spirit Jack Grey, with whom the boy had become obsessed. When Richard discovers the skeleton of a hare in the place where the tree once grew, he cannot escape the suspicion that the two deaths are linked.</p> <p>Horror fiction thrives on its classic scenarios, of which troubled-couple-move-to-cursed-mansion is a perennial favourite. What sets <em>Starve Acre</em> apart from more mundane examples is the quality of Hurley\u2019s writing, his landscape writing in particular:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sound of shotguns and whistles doubled in air that was uncannily still and expectant after the blizzard. The storm had lasted for hours and the extent of its fury was marked by icy cornices blown over the dry-stone walls. They were wild jagged crests, like those of a sea surge breaking on inadequate defences.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such evocative passages typify Hurley\u2019s almost preternatural sense of place, and are stunningly effective in conjuring the pervasive, escalating tension that defines his story. Hurley\u2019s feel for landscape as a defining characteristic of horror must count as a large part of what made his 2014 debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/28/the-loney-andrew-michael-hurley-review-gothic-novel\" title=\"\">The Loney</a></em> so successful. If anything, <em>Starve Acre</em> demonstrates an evolution and concentration of his ability to summon a world divided and defined by the uncanny. If I have a problem with this novel, it has less to do with literary technique than with the ultimate direction and purpose of the narrative itself.</p> <p>In terms of its language and chilling atmosphere, Hurley\u2019s 2017 follow-up to <em>The Loney</em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/26/devils-day-by-andrew-michael-hurley-review\" title=\"\">Devil\u2019s Day</a></em>, was as persuasive as ever. The plot, though, seemed more flatly generic, a bitter little tale of a professional city woman bullied into subservience by a bunch of rural patriarchs, told seemingly without irony. <em>Starve Acre</em> is compromised by similar issues: on this occasion it is Juliette who enforces the decision to move to the \u201cbad place\u201d but we are left in no doubt as to how irrational we are supposed to find her behaviour, while Richard \u2013 poor, patient, put-upon Richard \u2013 is suggested as the worthy recipient of our sympathies. His deluded mother and Juliette\u2019s domineering sister are similarly derided. Such retrograde gender politics quickly becomes tiresome, as does the endlessly rehashed cliche about unfriendly villagers: how many more hostile local yokels does horror fiction need?</p> <p>It could be argued that the dated tone is a deliberate attempt to evoke the more openly parochial attitudes of the time in which the novel is set \u2013 the manner in which the book\u2019s one homosexual character is ostracised, for example, and the unthinking, blanket divide between \u201clocals\u201d and \u201cincomers\u201d. Hurley\u2019s understanding of and love for 70s horror is clear. Such a love should not preclude political engagement, however, and from an author as gifted as him I would have hoped for more counter-argument and less mimicry. Most of all, I would have liked the novel to reveal some substance and identity aside from the skilful reiteration of tropes already familiar from the books and films that defined this brand of rural horror the first time around.</p> <p><em>Starve Acre</em> was originally conceived for the Eden Book Society project, a crowd-funded initiative set up by independent publisher Dead Ink to publish \u201clost\u201d works of horror fiction from the past hundred years. The project\u2019s supporters were well aware that the cover story was something of a metafictional device: these works were not cult classics, but new books by contemporary writers hiding behind pseudonymous identities. The first tranche of titles released were ostensibly from the 1970s and <em>Starve Acre</em> was one of them, the true name of its author quickly becoming an open secret.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/15/andrew-michael-hurley-devils-day-the-loney\">Andrew Michael Hurley: \u2018It\u2019s not about whether you want to write. It\u2019s an urgent necessity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This new, slightly expanded edition tones down some of the more overt horror elements that characterised the original, but while the novel is an enjoyable addition to the canon of \u201cEnglish Weird\u201d, its origins in pastiche present the critic with something of a dilemma. Should we read it as a well-executed homage to the era-defining horror of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/02/guardianobituaries.media\" title=\"\">Nigel Kneale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/12/brief-survey-short-story-robert-aickman\" title=\"\">Robert Aickman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/14/pendas-fen-heresy-horror-pastoral-horror\" title=\"\">David Rudkin</a>, or as a novel that unwittingly reveals the new folk horror as a nostalgic, not to say regressive exercise, defined and underpinned by assumptions that feel faded and irrelevant?</p> <p>Horror is regularly vilified for being a conservative genre. This accusation is often without merit, as recent novels by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/24/out-with-vampires-in-with-haunted-houses-ghost-stories-are-back\" title=\"\">Catriona Ward</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/05/melmoth-sarah-perry-review\" title=\"\">Sarah Perry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/09/science-fiction-and-fantasy-novels-roundup\" title=\"\">Sarah Maria Griffin</a> amply demonstrate. Yet it can still be the case that the very seductiveness of its tropes \u2013 the haunted houses, the bleak moorlands, the ancient burial grounds \u2013 can prevent writers from sufficiently questioning what they are for. Hurley is a graceful, confident stylist and for this reason alone he is a joy to read. But I would hope to see him being a little more adventurous \u2013 and less accommodating \u2013 on his next outing.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Nina Allan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/02/the-dollmaker-nina-allan-review\" title=\"\">The Dollmaker</a> is published by Riverrun.

When Richard discovers the skeleton of a hare in the place where the tree once grew, he cannot escape the suspicion that the two deaths are linked. Horror fiction thrives on its classic scenarios, of which troubled-couple-move-to-cursed-mansion is a perennial favourite. What sets Starve Acre apart from more mundane examples is the quality of Hurley\u2019s writing, his landscape writing in particular: The sound of shotguns and whistles doubled in air that was uncannily still and expectant after the blizzard. The storm had lasted for hours and the extent of its fury was marked by icy cornices blown over the dry-stone walls. They were wild jagged crests, like those of a sea surge breaking on inadequate defences. Such evocative passages typify Hurley\u2019s almost preternatural sense of place, and are stunningly effective in conjuring the pervasive, escalating tension that defines his story. Hurley\u2019s feel for landscape as a defining characteristic of horror must count as a large part of what made his 2014 debut The Loney so successful. If anything, Starve Acre demonstrates an evolution and concentration of his ability to summon a world divided and defined by the uncanny. If I have a problem with this novel, it has less to do with literary technique than with the ultimate direction and purpose of the narrative itself. In terms of its language and chilling atmosphere, Hurley\u2019s 2017 follow-up to The Loney, Devil\u2019s Day, was as persuasive as ever. The plot, though, seemed more flatly generic, a bitter little tale of a professional city woman bullied into subservience by a bunch of rural patriarchs, told seemingly without irony. Starve Acre is compromised by similar issues: on this occasion it is Juliette who enforces the decision to move to the \u201cbad place\u201d but we are left in no doubt as to how irrational we are supposed to find her behaviour, while Richard \u2013 poor, patient, put-upon Richard \u2013 is suggested as the worthy recipient of our sympathies. His deluded mother and Juliette\u2019s domineering sister are similarly derided. Such retrograde gender politics quickly becomes tiresome, as does the endlessly rehashed cliche about unfriendly villagers: how many more hostile local yokels does horror fiction need? It could be argued that the dated tone is a deliberate attempt to evoke the more openly parochial attitudes of the time in which the novel is set \u2013 the manner in which the book\u2019s one homosexual character is ostracised, for example, and the unthinking, blanket divide between \u201clocals\u201d and \u201cincomers\u201d. Hurley\u2019s understanding of and love for 70s horror is clear. Such a love should not preclude political engagement, however, and from an author as gifted as him I would have hoped for more counter-argument and less mimicry. Most of all, I would have liked the novel to reveal some substance and identity aside from the skilful reiteration of tropes already familiar from the books and films that defined this brand of rural horror the first time around. Starve Acre was originally conceived for the Eden Book Society project, a crowd-funded initiative set up by independent publisher Dead Ink to publish \u201clost\u201d works of horror fiction from the past hundred years. The project\u2019s supporters were well aware that the cover story was something of a metafictional device: these works were not cult classics, but new books by contemporary writers hiding behind pseudonymous identities. The first tranche of titles released were ostensibly from the 1970s and Starve Acre was one of them, the true name of its author quickly becoming an open secret. This new, slightly expanded edition tones down some of the more overt horror elements that characterised the original, but while the novel is an enjoyable addition to the canon of \u201cEnglish Weird\u201d, its origins in pastiche present the critic with something of a dilemma. Should we read it as a well-executed homage to the era-defining horror of Nigel Kneale, Robert Aickman and David Rudkin, or as a novel that unwittingly reveals the new folk horror as a nostalgic, not to say regressive exercise, defined and underpinned by assumptions that feel faded and irrelevant? Horror is regularly vilified for being a conservative genre. This accusation is often without merit, as recent novels by Catriona Ward, Sarah Perry and Sarah Maria Griffin amply demonstrate. Yet it can still be the case that the very seductiveness of its tropes \u2013 the haunted houses, the bleak moorlands, the ancient burial grounds \u2013 can prevent writers from sufficiently questioning what they are for. Hurley is a graceful, confident stylist and for this reason alone he is a joy to read. But I would hope to see him being a little more adventurous \u2013 and less accommodating \u2013 on his next outing. \u2022 Nina Allan\u2019s The Dollmaker is published by Riverrun.

I feel blessed to live in a council flat which I was given when my children and I were living in a bedsit. My rent is \u00a3145 a week. I pay \u00a3166 as I was in arrears for years. I still have a habit of living like I\u2019m in prison so I\u2019ll often just stay in one room. I spend about \u00a350 a week on food. Although I\u2019m in a takeaway right now, I\u2019m trying to get in the habit of cooking at home as I need to save more money. I was in a lot of debt but I\u2019ve slowly become better at handling money. I continued claiming benefits and tax credits for my children after they moved out but the government found out so I had to set up a payment plan to pay back \u00a320 every two weeks. I thought credit cards would help but then I ended up with \u00a32,000 of debt. There\u2019s also been telephone and mobile phone debt. But I\u2019ve since changed things around by paying off most of my debt and setting aside 10% of my income for the future. I met a financial coach who generously gave me four hours of her time for free. She encouraged me to write out my life goals and it really made me dig deep and think. I told her I wanted to buy my council flat and she advised me to pay off my debt first instead of saving. Before I didn\u2019t understand budgeting. Money would just come in and go out and I\u2019d never have enough for the rest of the month. My spending was a bit nuts. But now I feel fantastic. I\u2019ve done a lot of soul-searching and I think a lot of my past behaviour stems back to things that happened to me as a child. But now I\u2019m happy in myself, I love my job, and I\u2019m on track to buy my flat.

We live in the capital so the relative silence of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland strikes me every time.

There is plenty to do in the countryside, but often I just love to walk my dog in the surrounding forest. Sometimes I go cross-country skiing straight from our house.

It is guarded by the mythical figure of Krakono\u0161 \u2013 a grey bearded, staff-carrying old man who protects the region against poachers and magical treasure hunters. He was Tolkien\u2019s inspiration for Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings \u2013 and the gift shops are packed with Krakono\u0161-based souvenirs.</p> <p>We head to \u010cern\u00e1 hora (Black Mountain) ski resort.

The most exciting feature for us though is the 3km sledge track that snakes scarily down Sn\u011b\u017eka. At one point it crosses the ski slope so you have to get off and tiptoe your way across without getting taken out by a snowboarder. And then you\u2019re back, flying down again, digging your heels in so you don\u2019t fly off the edges.

      "bodyText": "Sweden: \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland Malin Nyberg, 35, from Stockholm I spend my winter holidays on an idyllic 17th-century farm in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland province, 200km south-west of Stockholm (two hours by car, or train to Link\u00f6ping and then bus). We live in the capital so the relative silence of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland strikes me every time. I met my partner Daniel four years ago and the farm has been in his family for generations. Growing up in the city, I never thought I would end up loving a place like this \u2013 but I guess you change with age. There is plenty to do in the countryside, but often I just love to walk my dog in the surrounding forest. Sometimes I go cross-country skiing straight from our house. Riding on an Icelandic horse through snow is one of the most magical things you can do during the winter (nearby Uggletorp has horses that you can ride). In summer and autumn we forage for blueberries, as well as chanterelle mushrooms, and often swim in nearby G\u00e5rasj\u00f6n lake. The city of Link\u00f6ping is a 20-minute drive from the farm. Sim\u00f8n\u2019s Rosteri and Bageri is a great place for indulging in the Swedish tradition of fika with coffee and homebaked cinnamon buns, when it\u2019s cold and dark outside. \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland has plenty of flea markets to browse around, such as 73:ans loppis \u2013 and there is secondhand shopping in the city of Link\u00f6ping. But I tend to just stay at the farm most of the time \u2013 I really see no reason to ever leave a place like this. Especially during winter \u2013 when the landscape glistens with snow. Stay Elite Stora Hotellet Link\u00f6ping (doubles from about \u00a3100 B&amp;B) is a historic landmark built in 1852 and has views of Link\u00f6ping\u2019s medieval market square.

Interview by Lola Akinmade \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m Czech Republic: Krkono\u0161e mountains Dominika Tup\u00e1, 29, from Hole\u0161ov, Moravia Czech people adore winter, and at weekends we disappear to the countryside to go downhill or cross-country skiing, or to just go for a snowy hike. There are many beautiful mountain regions to explore, but for me and my boyfriend, Jakub, Krkono\u0161e is our big winter love. Krkono\u0161e is a vast, unspoiled national park on the Polish border 130km north-east of Prague. It is guarded by the mythical figure of Krakono\u0161 \u2013 a grey bearded, staff-carrying old man who protects the region against poachers and magical treasure hunters. He was Tolkien\u2019s inspiration for Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings \u2013 and the gift shops are packed with Krakono\u0161-based souvenirs. We head to \u010cern\u00e1 hora (Black Mountain) ski resort. At an altitude of around 1,200 metres it has a variety of blue and red slopes \u2013 fine for me \u2013 and steeper black slopes \u2013 terrifying for me but great for Jakub! From there you can also get to the summit of 1,603-metre peak Sn\u011b\u017eka, the Czech Republic\u2019s highest mountain, using a cable car. The most exciting feature for us though is the 3km sledge track that snakes scarily down Sn\u011b\u017eka. At one point it crosses the ski slope so you have to get off and tiptoe your way across without getting taken out by a snowboarder. And then you\u2019re back, flying down again, digging your heels in so you don\u2019t fly off the edges. This year we\u2019re planning to do the nighttime sledge \u2013 where you have to wear a headlamp (\u20ac15 per person, skiresort.cz). The Krkono\u0161e region is also known for its beer. There are lots of small breweries, competing to serve the best apr\u00e8s-ski lagers. In Vrchlab\u00ed \u2013 a good base to stay in \u2013 there\u2019s an excellent brewery called Medv\u011bd (Bear). Tucked inside the Hotel Pivovarsk\u00e1 Ba\u0161ta, the pub\u2019s restaurant is a cosy, stone-clad cavern with tables dotted around the huge copper brewing tanks. There are lots of great Medv\u011bd varieties to choose from, though our favourite is a tasty IPA called HopBi. For a day trip away from the slopes, we often visit the town of Trutnov \u2013 and always tie it in with the Christmas markets (16-22 December). We have lunch there at Hosp\u016fdka u Rozmar\u00fdnku: a plate of hot beef goulash and a pint of Krakono\u0161. Afterwards we might look for tree decorations and have some trdeln\u00edk \u2013 a cylindrical sugar-coated pastry. Stay After working your way through the Medv\u011bd tasting list you can always crash in one of the hotel\u2019s modest guest rooms (doubles from \u00a347 B&amp;B). Interview by Mark Pickering Spain: Bo\u00ed, Pyrenees Olga Pratginestos, 44, from Barcelona Whenever we get the chance to get away from city life for a few days, we go to Bo\u00ed \u2013 a small village in the Pyrenees, about four hours\u2019 drive north-west of Barcelona. My parents discovered Bo\u00ed in the 1990s and loved it so much they decided to buy an apartment there. I\u2019ve been visiting ever since, and these days I bring my own family \u2013 my husband, Oscar, and our two children. The village is in Vall de Bo\u00ed, right on the doorstep of the Aig\u00fcestortes national park, where you can go hiking amid spectacular scenery. Vall de Bo\u00ed is also famous for its nine 12th-century Romanesque churches. One is in Bo\u00ed itself and another two in the neighbouring village of Ta\u00fcll. The original church frescoes are unique and so valuable that some were removed and sold to museums abroad in the early 20th century. In Sant Climent, in Ta\u00fcll, they have created a wonderful video projection of the frescoes onto the apse showing their evolution over the centuries. At the top of the valley is the Bo\u00ed Ta\u00fcll ski resort. It\u2019s the highest in the Pyrenees at 2,751 metres and also faces north, which means better snow for longer. Our children learned to ski there on the beginner slopes but it\u2019s good for experienced skiers too. The best thing is that there are no crowds. We\u2019ve started a family tradition of skiing on the morning of New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 we have the slopes to ourselves and it is absolutely glorious \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a better way to start the year. Cerveseria Tribulos is a craft beer bar in Ta\u00fcll that also serves fondue. It has a great view of Sant Climent church and the mountains. The kids\u2019 favourite place is Ca la Pepa, a tiny little restaurant in Bo\u00ed serving sweet and savoury crepes. Stay The best place to stay if you\u2019re visiting with children is Apartmentos els Arenys de Bo\u00ed (from about \u20ac110 a night, sleeps family of four) in the centre of the village. Interview by Annette Pacey Germany: Black Forest Daniela Sch\u00f6nle, 41, from Berlin I was born and grew up in the northern part of the Black Forest, in a small town between Karlsruhe (to the north), Freiburg (to the south) and Stra\u00dfburg (to the west). As a teenager I remember there being not much to do \u2013 especially if you didn\u2019t have a car \u2013 but as I got older I started to enjoy the area much more, and now I go back at least twice a year. I go to see my family and also to let my kids become immersed in nature and introduce them to the stories of woods and witches. We always visit the Mummelsee: it\u2019s a little lake below the Hornisgrinde, at 1,164 metres the highest mountain in the area. It\u2019s mesmerising, and even more so in winter, when everything around it is white except the lake, which appears like a black mirror. According to folklore the water is inhabited by a nix, a shape-shifting water spirit. The North Black Forest national park (Naturpark Schwarzwald Mitte/Nord) is a treasure trove of mixed woodlands, with characteristic silver firs, swamps, tarns, and heaths, and is very popular for winter sports, from skiing and sledging to hiking (you also can rent any gear you need from various park visitor centres and outdoor shops). When I was a kid I got a voucher for skiing classes as a Christmas present but it didn\u2019t snow that year, nor for the two years that followed. And, so, I am probably one of the few people in the area who can\u2019t ski. But I still slide down the hills, usually on a plastic bag. Kniebis, Ruhestein, Mehliskopf, or Hundseck are fantastic places \u2013 with ski lifts \u2013 where everyone, beginners and families included, can have fun in the snow. If you are not into the outdoors, then you should take the opportunity of a short trip to Baden-Baden, where you can visit a spa and check out the great German and American abstract expressionism at the Frieder Burda Museum. The town also has a contemporary collection at Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, and a casino, which was famously frequented by Dostoevsky. No one should really leave Baden-Baden without eating a piece of schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte at Caf\u00e9 K\u00f6nig. However, this suggestion comes with its own warning: please do not drive afterwards \u2013 the cake is soaked in schnapps. Stay Hotel Liberty in Offenburg (doubles from \u20ac150 B&amp;B) is a former prison that has been converted into a boutique hotel. In Baden-Baden, good value Hotel Qeuellenhof Sofia (doubles from \u20ac60 B&amp;B) is just 50 metres from the Friedrichsbad baths. Interview by Paul Sullivan Norway: R\u00f8ros Tore Stenberg Falch, 58, from Oslo Winter in the old copper mining town of R\u00f8ros, five hours\u2019 drive north of Oslo, is magic. My father-in-law built our log cabin in the 1970s. I have since installed water and electricity, and it\u2019s now like our second home. We have 20 or so neighbours and some of their cabins come with turf roofs and small pine trees on top, although there are several hundred more holiday homes in the area. R\u00f8ros is inland and around 600 metres above sea level with guaranteed snow, so skiing conditions are perfect for four or five months a year. Every Easter for the last 25 years I have taken part in an informal ski race through the beautiful highland scenery. It is for people of all ages and participants carry backpacks with sandwiches, oranges and hot chocolate in a thermos. The race finishes at a cluster of wooden huts where we have our lunches. Those who prefer downhill skiing are spoilt for choice just across the border in Sweden or at the small ski resort at Hummelfjell, 15km away. The coldest day on record was in 1914 and saw -50C. Minus 20 or 30C is more common these days but the climate is so dry that -10C on the coast actually feels much colder. We\u2019ve celebrated Christmas with our extended family in the cabin a few times. It\u2019s like being in a Christmas card with candles or torches, frosted windows and Christmas trees inside and out. The first weekend of December there\u2019s a traditional Christmas market. We have reindeers, horse-pulled sleighs and market stalls in the streets. And Santa, of course. R\u00f8ros winter fair deserves a mention, too. It\u2019s a legendary five-day party in February that\u2019s been going since 1854. We get few foreign visitors, except from Sweden. Most come to see the old wooden houses in the idyllic town, which is a world heritage site due to the historically important copper mines that can still be explored. Small food producers have made their mark here recently through cured reindeer meat, fermented fish, flatbread, herbs and cheeses. We often eat local produce at Vertshuset and 1748-founded Kaffestuggu has a great menu, too. Stay Erzscheiderg\u00e5rden Hotel (doubles from \u00a385 B&amp;B) in a 17th-century building next to iconic R\u00f8ros Church is cosy, or rent a log cabin at R\u00f8ros Camping (two to four people from \u00a330-115, not all en suite). Interview by Gunnar Garfors France: Strasbourg Nathalie Juni\u00e8res, 37, from Carros, Provence I couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else but Strasbourg at Christmas. I was born there and studied there, then moved to Carros on the French Riviera six years ago for work, but always return for the winter holidays. It\u2019s such a special period for Strasbourg, site of the original Chriskindelsm\u00e4rik (Christmas market). I remember visiting the chalets when I was a girl and buying pastries, hot chocolate and aprons, baubles and cuddly storks \u2013 one of the symbols of Alsace. Nothing has changed. Decorations go up at the end of November and last until the start of January. I love the streets around the cathedral square and the Petite France district but it feels as if the whole city is covered in fairy lights, snowflakes and decorations. The giant fir tree in Place Kl\u00e9ber is one of the biggest in Europe. Part of the tradition of winter time in Strasbourg is to fl\u00e2ner (stroll) the illuminated streets, stopping for pretzels, iced gingerbread, Black Forest gateau, kouglof (Alsatian brioche) and enjoy a caf\u00e9 kuchen (coffee and cake) with friends at Chez Suzanne. Every corner of Strasbourg has a cauldron of mulled red wine and, because it\u2019s Alsace, there\u2019s also mulled white wine with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. There are outdoor concerts, choirs singing and musicians playing in the streets, ice-skating, storytelling and merry-go-rounds for children. Sometimes we even walk across the bridge over the Rhine into Germany (too cold to cycle) where the Jardin des Deux Rives links the two countries. Every year, we faire des bredele \u2013 spend time making biscuits with family and friends, box them up and offer them as gifts. My favourite places to eat are the Ancienne Douane, which serves flammekueche savoury tart, and the Maison Kammerzell, a timber-framed hotel and restaurant where you can enjoy a choucroute (sausages with cabbage and other veg) or spaetzle gratin with munster cheese and oyster mushrooms. A short train ride from Strasbourg is the town of Colmar, which also has a famous Christmas market. We love to visit Saint-Hippolyte, a village known for its wine and Kirrwiller, whose Royal Palace cabaret puts on a special Christmas show. There are no big ski resorts near Strasbourg so people enjoy what\u2019s going on in the city. Strasbourg sees itself very much as the Capitale de No\u00ebl and (unlike the rest of France) we even have a public holiday on 26 December. Stay The Cour du Corbeau near the cathedral dates from the 16th-century and is one of the oldest hotels in Europe (doubles from around \u20ac145) Interview by Jon Bryant Italy: San Candido, South Tirol Carolyn Pettenello, 54, from Venice During the February carnival Venice is invaded by tourists, so my family and I (pictured, Carolyn\u2019s husband Andrea) flee 190km north to our secret spot: the mountain village of San Candido, it\u2019s high up in the Dolomites. It is a brilliant ski station in the Three Peaks nature park, down-to-earth and perfect for families compared with the more glamorous Cortina, less than an hour away. The resort is in a breathtaking landscape of jagged peaks and wooded hills, and we stay in an apartment that my in-laws bought 30 years ago. As with many Venetians they don\u2019t drive, and chose San Candido because you can get there by train from Venice (via Verona or Bolzano), a fabulous journey through the mountains that puts you in the mood for a holiday. Our children, Julia and Nicholas, have been on skis since the age of three, and the moment we arrive they\u2019re off on the slopes. San Candido has a ski lift 50 metres from the town centre, up to the Baranci ski area. Another great advantage that we find here is that the resort is comprensorio, which means that all 110km of slopes are connected by lifts, so you can spend the whole day out skiing. And the resort also has excellent cross-country and snow-shoe trails, especially one through the beautiful Val Fiscalina, coming out at a great place for lunch, the Rifugio Fondovalle. Only 3,000 people live in San Candido, and it\u2019s quite a traditional town with three Catholic churches, so there\u2019s no ski instruction on Sunday morning when many people worship. The Austrian border is a mere 10km away and sometimes it really feels like being in a different country \u2013 as more people speak German or the South Tyrolean dialect than Italian. I give cooking classes back in Venice, and I\u2019d describe the food here as much more Mittel Europa. We love the fabulous dishes at traditional restaurants, such as Wiesthaler and Hotel Schopenhof. The cuisine can come as a culture shock; giant canederli dumplings with spinach and locally-smoked speck ham, a delicious plate of formaggio alla piastra, melted mountain cheese with grilled wild mushrooms and creamy polenta, and once I even tried a wonderfully aromatic risotto pino mugo, made with pine needles! Stay In San Candido, Residence Wachtler (from \u20ac85 a night) has apartments that are perfect for families; it\u2019s in the town centre, near a bakery and just five minutes\u2019 walk from the slopes. Interview by John Brunton Slovenia: Velika Planina Ezav Mrgole, 23, from Kamnik I learned how to ski and snowboard on Velika Planina, a mountain plateau in the Alps near my home town, Kamnik. My friends and I like to kick off our snowboarding season there. We\u2019ll drive up, just about as high as we can, hike to the highest point of the mountain, then board back down. We head up in the morning, board until lunchtime, then take a break at one of the inns on the plateau. Our favourite is Zeleni Rob (the Green Edge). Some of our friends have now got cottages up there; there\u2019s a mixture of self-catering cottages for rent, as well as locals\u2019 weekend homes. Everyone\u2019s doors are usually open and people invite whoever is around in for a warming cup of mountain tea or schnapps. If we choose to stay over, one of the best things to do is night sledding. On Christmas Eve, there\u2019s also a mass held in an idyllic wooden church up there, and everyone walks to it carrying torches. On a snowy Christmas Eve, it doesn\u2019t get any more magical. There\u2019s an absolutely amazing view from Velika Planina: it\u2019s down to the valley towards Ljubljana looking south and right up in the face of the Kamnik-Savinj Alps to the north. For centuries, cowherds have brought their stock up there for the summer \u2013 and because of that the area has developed its own microcosm of culture, which you\u2019ll see in strange-looking costumes, like a sort of ancient rain cloak that herdsman wear. There are particular foods associated with the area. Herdsman would eat mostly dairy, since that was all that was available, and so a speciality has become this hard cheese called trni\u010d and sour milk, which tastes like sour cream. I love the chance to combine hiking with off-piste snowboarding and I also love filming what I come across in the alpine winters \u2013 so this is the place for me. It\u2019s dotted with these Hobbit-like houses unique to Velika Planina. You can stay there overnight and in winter it\u2019s extra cosy. You keep warm by the fire, a lot of the houses have no electricity, so you pull up a candle, melt some snow, and go old school. Stay Chalet Zlatica Velika Planina (sleeps six, from about \u20ac170) has a hot tub, great views and has two ski lifts within a short walk. Also see koca.si for a range of cottages. Interview by Noah Charney Austria: Salzkammergut Claudia Braunstein, 54, from Salzburg I\u2019ve been going to the area around Altaussee and Grundlsee (both about 80km east of Salzburg), in the culturally rich Salzkammergut region, since the 1970s, when I\u2019d spend New Year\u2019s Eve there with my parents. The Grundlsee, the largest lake in Styria state, is a mystical, almost meditative place in winter when the mist settles over the water. Ice-skating on the Grundlsee is great fun and hiking around another nearby lake, Altausseer See, has also become a winter highlight for me. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, too. And if you can\u2019t do without downhill skiing, there\u2019s a small skiing area at Loser, a 1,838-metre mountain close to Altaussee. At Christmas there are many local traditions, such as the Gl\u00f6cklerlauf (5 January 2020), which involves people in white garments wearing huge, colourful, handmade light caps and bells \u2013 a custom that\u2019s supposed to drive away evil winter spirits. Christmas markets can be found in many of the local villages, such as Altaussee and Bad Aussee. Picturesque Bad Ischl is only a short drive away and there you\u2019ll find a thermal bath \u2013 along with gorgeous pastries at the traditional confectioner Zauner. Try the house speciality, the zaunerstollen, made of hazelnuts and chocolate. It was created in 1905 when confectioners Viktor Zauner and Josef Nickerl decided to make something new from leftover wafers. Stay Seehotel Grundlsee (doubles from \u20ac180 B&amp;B) has beautiful views over the lake and of the surrounding mountains. Interview by Carolina Gnigler Poland: Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska Jacek Smulczyk, 53, from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a I have spent my winter holidays in Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska, a small village in the Tatra mountains of southern Poland, for more than 30 years. It all started on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1986 when I was in high school and visited for the first time with my girlfriend Magda. Now she is my wife and we still love it so much that we drive down there from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (five hours) twice a year: once at Christmas and again during our daughter Zosia\u2019s winter break from school. When we started to come here it was a small village with beautiful nature and landscapes but not much to do. Now it has a lot of accommodation options and a huge variety of attractions, most important of which is great skiing. Options include short ski slopes for beginners such as the one at Wierch Olsza\u0144ski, where my daughter and I learned how to ski. Right behind this slope is my favourite bar, U Danusi, where I usually have mulled wine or rum tea and where really good regional food is served. For more advanced skiers there are slopes such as Wierch Rusi\u0144-Ski, where Magda (who learned how to ski years before I did) and I tend to go. If you are tired from skiing or the weather is not so good, Termy Bukovina, a huge complex of thermal pools, is a perfect place to relax. Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska is also close to lots of other interesting places, such as Zakopane, a town 20km away. It\u2019s often described as Poland\u2019s winter capital, thanks to its great ski slopes (particularly for beginners) and fine apr\u00e8s scene. There\u2019s also Morskie Oko (Eye of the Sea), which is the largest lake in the Tatras in the Rybi Potok (the Fish Brook) valley. Our favourite local restaurants are Pod Stancyjom and Bury Mi\u015b, which have great local cheeses, barberry (a soup made from sauerkraut and meat: kwa\u015bnica in Polish), sour rye soup (\u017curek in Polish, served with boiled eggs and white sausage) and potato pancakes with goulash. Another place we love is Bigos\u00f3wka \u2013 famous for trout. Stay We\u2019ve been going to the Maria Stasik Guest House (from \u00a37.95 per person per night, half board deals available) for 20 years \u2013 we are good friends with the owner and know the rest of the regulars well, spending evenings together, going on sleigh rides or sitting around bonfires. There are also modern hotels to stay in such as Harna\u015b Hotel (doubles from about \u00a355 B&amp;B). Interview by Kit Macdonald Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Deanna Mitchell, the park superintendent, said she reassures tourists that the visitor centre has been built on a relatively elevated piece of land with sea-level rise in mind.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful facility and the landscape is beautiful, too,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I go to work I\u2019m immediately in a mode of reflection.

      "bodyText": "On the flat, marshy stretches of Maryland\u2019s eastern shore, not a huge amount has changed since Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery here 170 years ago. Rivers and streams lace a wedge of land dotted with wood-board churches and small towns. Crabs and oysters are plucked from the adjacent Chesapeake Bay. The climate crisis is set, however, to completely transform low-lying Dorchester county, threatening to submerge some of the key heritage associated with Tubman, the celebrated abolitionist whose daring missions helped free scores of slaves from bondage in her homeland. If planet-warming emissions aren\u2019t radically scaled back then swaths of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad national historical park, only established in 2013, will be inundated at high tide by 2050, according to projections by University of Maryland scientists. A $22m (\u00a317m) Tubman visitor centre, completed in 2017, is set to be severely menaced by the rising waters, the analysis finds, along with several churches connected to Tubman and Joseph Stewart\u2019s canal, where timber was transported from a business that had enslaved her father. \u201cDorchester county is a poster child as to what the rest of the world can expect with flooding,\u201d said Peter Goodwin, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. The county doesn\u2019t rise more than 1.5 metres (5ft) above sea level and is exposed on three sides to the bay, which can act as a funnel to push storms on to the land. The seas could swell by as much as 60cm by 2050, a situation compounded by the fact the land is sinking, a hangover caused by the retreat of ice sheets from the last ice age. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cThe county is beautiful but it\u2019s going to look very different. If we can get ahead of things and plan for the future then you can help define what the shoreline will look like. The problem is if you don\u2019t do that then people are going to drift away and the culture will be eroded.\u201d The situation is causing alarm among those who have highlighted Tubman\u2019s legacy. \u201cThese landscapes are rapidly vanishing because of climate change,\u201d said Kasi Lemmons, director of Harriet, a new film based on Tubman\u2019s life. \u201cLosing landmarks such as these underscores the need to protect and preserve the land and our national history for the generations to come.\u201d Proximity to water for communication, transportation and food has long been intrinsic to Dorchester county but flooding is increasingly chipping away at the routines of day-to-day life. High-tide water lapped in residents\u2019 front yards and is now reaching porches. Carelessly parked cars can end up sodden. School buses struggle to get down roads that are in constant repair. The storms are getting fiercer, as the water and atmosphere warms. The encroaching tides now also imperil the cultural touchstones of Tubman\u2019s life. The former slave was born in Dorchester county in 1822 and despite suffering a severe head injury managed to escape to Philadelphia as a young woman. She then helped guide more than 70 enslaved people north to freedom via a network of safe houses and routes known as the Underground Railroad. Several locations on the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a driving loop of important Tubman sites, are already being eroded, according to Tubman\u2019s biographer Kate Clifford Larson. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have those landscapes to tell those amazing stories if something doesn\u2019t happen quickly,\u201d Larson said. \u201cIn the 20 years I\u2019ve been to these sites I\u2019ve seen them start to disappear because of the water seeping in. \u201cSome of the roads become impassable and you have to wait out until the water recedes. And some of the precious, really precious, African-American historical and cultural sites are at the most danger right now because they are in the lowest-lying areas.\u201d Larson frets about where the resources will come to protect places such as the New Revived Methodist church in Smithville, in the heart of Tubman\u2019s former community that often has a waterlogged graveyard. \u201cThey are going to need to move the graves and that costs a lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening how quickly these sites are becoming threatened.\u201d The Rev Darlene Dixon has only been the pastor of the New Revived for five months but has already experienced being temporarily cut off from her church by a storm that pushed 15cm of water on to the roads and on to the cemetery. \u201cPeople are concerned, and naturally I am, too,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cThe biggest part of their angst the unknown \u2013 which storm, which high tide will cause major damage.\u201d Dixon said a seawall may have to be erected to protect the church but that may not stop the surrounding community, already one of the poorest in Maryland, crumbling away as the flooding intensifies. \u201cPeople here have big hearts but there are not many people left in the community because they want to make a living. There\u2019s the fear of the water too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing change occur before our eyes.\u201d The National Park Service, which oversees the Tubman park, is putting together an assessment of the threats it faces. Deanna Mitchell, the park superintendent, said she reassures tourists that the visitor centre has been built on a relatively elevated piece of land with sea-level rise in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful facility and the landscape is beautiful, too,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I go to work I\u2019m immediately in a mode of reflection. I see that with visitors, too. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we can address whatever comes our way if people can come together on this. We are nine miles away from Chesapeake Bay, which gives us a sort of buffer. But that\u2019s not a cure-all. There\u2019s no way to deny that there\u2019s sea-level rise.\u201d",

Roughly one in six children and young people are obese in Norway, compared with one in three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/10/severe-obesity-among-children-aged-10-to-11-record-high-england\">in the UK</a>.</p> <p>Linda Granlund, the divisional director of public health at the <a href=\"https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/\">Norwegian health directorate in Oslo</a>, said the country\u2019s sugar tax \u2013 first introduced in 1922 to raise revenue for the state, rather than improve the health of the nation \u2013 was one of many factors behind the fall.</p> <p>\u201cFor several years now, we\u2019ve also had a very successful voluntary partnership with both Norwegian and some international food and drinks manufacturers, 98 of them now, who have signed a letter of intent to improve the diet of Norway\u2019s population, including a commitment to sugar reduction,\u201d Granlund told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s helped us cut the sugar in added-sugar soft drinks by 30%, for example. We\u2019ve also worked intensively on food guidelines in schools and preschools, both to make sure the food children eat there is healthy and on educational programmes.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, Granlund said, Norwegian authorities have \u201ccommunicated continuously, for many years now and through many channels, about the need for a healthy diet. As a result, 80% of Norwegians now say they want to avoid consuming too much sugar.\u201d</p> <p>Norway is considered a leader on advertising regulation, with food manufacturers and suppliers agreeing in 2013 to voluntarily ban the marketing of unhealthy foods and drinks to children younger than 13.</p> <p>The dramatic rise in the sugar tax on confectionery and sweetened drinks may well have contributed in the past year, Granlund said.</p> <p>Not all consumers disapprove. Silje Kristiansen, 47, a school secretary from Sandvika west of Oslo, agreed the rise was \u201chuge\u201d, but said healthy eating \u2013 especially for children \u2013 mattered more. \u201cWe know sugar is a killer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that helps us cut down is good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d64de21e34e922a06d17184ca9af2fb257eb1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d64de21e34e922a06d17184ca9af2fb257eb1ac/0_1444_4431_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gottebiten.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gottebiten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gottebite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the border, retailers were certainly smiling. The tax increase had \u201cquite an impact on our sales\u201d, said Idbratt, whose giant sweet emporium is part of a <a href=\"https://www.newsinenglish.no/2019/09/06/shopping-in-sweden-sets-a-new-record/\">booming cross-border trade</a> that earned Swedish businesses \u2013 some owned by Norwegian investors \u2013 SEK16.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) last year, 10% more than in 2017.</p> <p>Idbratt said Gottebiten, founded by three entrepreneurial brothers in 1997, had \u201cseen more customers, and existing customers are buying more\u201d. Norwegian shoppers made 9.2m trips across the border last year, according to Statistics Norway.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the health directorate proudly reported this week that consumption of confectionery in Norway, which trebled from 5kg per person per year in 1960 to 15kg in 2008, had fallen to just over 12kg last year, while sales of sugary soft drinks were down from 93 litres per person in the late 1990s to 47 litres.</p> <p>It is not just Norway\u2019s consumers, however, who are unhappy at the ever-increasing cost of indulging their sweet tooth. Confectionery producers are indignant, too, arguing that they have already done their bit by substantially cutting sugar content and the higher tax rate represents a double punishment.</p> <p>One major manufacturer, <a href=\"https://norwaytoday.info/finance/hval-chocolate-lost-1-million-kroner-increased-sugar-fee/\">Hval, said this year</a> the sugar tax increase had triggered a 27% slump in sales and forced it to lay off a third of the staff at one factory. \u201cPoliticians must understand that they have gone too far,\u201d said the plant manager, Rune Forsberg.</p> <p>The food and drink branch of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, NHO, is <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/norge/utvalg-vil-avvikle-sukkeravgiften-1.14509570\">lobbying for the sugar tax to be scrapped entirely</a>, arguing it is outmoded, harmful to Norwegian industry, a boon for Swedish businesses across the border and \u2013 with sugar content and consumption both sharply down \u2013 no longer necessary.</p> <p>But the health directorate is instead promoting what it believes would be a more effective charge levied on the healthiness \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of a food or drink product rather than just its sugar content, which experts argue treats some relatively healthy products unfairly and allows other junk foods through the net.</p>",

Unhappy they may be, but experts say the exorbitant cost of sweets and sodas in Norway may be part of the reason why sugar consumption in the Scandinavian country has fallen to a historic low of 24kg per person per year \u2013 down from 43kg in 2000, and by 27% in the past decade. In Britain, meanwhile, Public Health England says sugar consumption rose 2.6% between 2015 and 2018, an increase it blamed on people eating more very sugary products \u2013 of which there are more and more in the shops. Roughly one in six children and young people are obese in Norway, compared with one in three in the UK. Linda Granlund, the divisional director of public health at the Norwegian health directorate in Oslo, said the country\u2019s sugar tax \u2013 first introduced in 1922 to raise revenue for the state, rather than improve the health of the nation \u2013 was one of many factors behind the fall. \u201cFor several years now, we\u2019ve also had a very successful voluntary partnership with both Norwegian and some international food and drinks manufacturers, 98 of them now, who have signed a letter of intent to improve the diet of Norway\u2019s population, including a commitment to sugar reduction,\u201d Granlund told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s helped us cut the sugar in added-sugar soft drinks by 30%, for example. We\u2019ve also worked intensively on food guidelines in schools and preschools, both to make sure the food children eat there is healthy and on educational programmes.\u201d Finally, Granlund said, Norwegian authorities have \u201ccommunicated continuously, for many years now and through many channels, about the need for a healthy diet. As a result, 80% of Norwegians now say they want to avoid consuming too much sugar.\u201d Norway is considered a leader on advertising regulation, with food manufacturers and suppliers agreeing in 2013 to voluntarily ban the marketing of unhealthy foods and drinks to children younger than 13. The dramatic rise in the sugar tax on confectionery and sweetened drinks may well have contributed in the past year, Granlund said. Not all consumers disapprove. Silje Kristiansen, 47, a school secretary from Sandvika west of Oslo, agreed the rise was \u201chuge\u201d, but said healthy eating \u2013 especially for children \u2013 mattered more. \u201cWe know sugar is a killer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that helps us cut down is good.\u201d Across the border, retailers were certainly smiling. The tax increase had \u201cquite an impact on our sales\u201d, said Idbratt, whose giant sweet emporium is part of a booming cross-border trade that earned Swedish businesses \u2013 some owned by Norwegian investors \u2013 SEK16.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) last year, 10% more than in 2017. Idbratt said Gottebiten, founded by three entrepreneurial brothers in 1997, had \u201cseen more customers, and existing customers are buying more\u201d. Norwegian shoppers made 9.2m trips across the border last year, according to Statistics Norway. Nonetheless, the health directorate proudly reported this week that consumption of confectionery in Norway, which trebled from 5kg per person per year in 1960 to 15kg in 2008, had fallen to just over 12kg last year, while sales of sugary soft drinks were down from 93 litres per person in the late 1990s to 47 litres. It is not just Norway\u2019s consumers, however, who are unhappy at the ever-increasing cost of indulging their sweet tooth. Confectionery producers are indignant, too, arguing that they have already done their bit by substantially cutting sugar content and the higher tax rate represents a double punishment. One major manufacturer, Hval, said this year the sugar tax increase had triggered a 27% slump in sales and forced it to lay off a third of the staff at one factory. \u201cPoliticians must understand that they have gone too far,\u201d said the plant manager, Rune Forsberg. The food and drink branch of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, NHO, is lobbying for the sugar tax to be scrapped entirely, arguing it is outmoded, harmful to Norwegian industry, a boon for Swedish businesses across the border and \u2013 with sugar content and consumption both sharply down \u2013 no longer necessary. But the health directorate is instead promoting what it believes would be a more effective charge levied on the healthiness \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of a food or drink product rather than just its sugar content, which experts argue treats some relatively healthy products unfairly and allows other junk foods through the net.",

      "body": "<p>You can take President Trump\u2019s impeachment to the bank but his actual removal from office is the longest of shots. Most likely, as Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton did before him, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9a1639c-fbd6-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\">will survive a trial in the Senate</a>. A year from now, expect to see his name on the ballot. Even as Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">leads Trump in the polls</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election\">betting lines</a> give the edge to the president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/trump-impeachment-inquiry-fiona-hill-david-holmes-testimony\">Fiona Hill: stop \u2018fictional narrative\u2019 of Ukraine meddling in US election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Substantively, the public impeachment hearings have been devastating. The bottom line is yes, there was a quid pro quo on aid to Ukraine. According to uncontroverted testimony, Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, drove the bus at his client\u2019s behest, and no, Ukraine did not interfere in the 2016 election. It was Russia, no surprise. Trump, however, stands defiant, his base unmoved and intact.</p> \n<p>Into America\u2019s cold civil war jumps Neal Katyal, once Barack Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/neal-katyal-on-defending-obamacare/2012/03/28/gIQAHpksgS_blog.html\">acting solicitor general</a>, with Impeach. Subtitled \u201cThe Case Against Donald Trump\u201d, the book is a thoughtful and well-researched polemic that advocates Trump\u2019s removal. Among other things, it provides a highly readable history on the origins and evolution of impeachment, and offers answers to questions that surround the process.</p> \n<p>But like the current impeachment hearings, its capacity to persuade will probably be limited. By definition, impeachment is political. These days, it is also highly partisan. The social cohesion and trust that girded the move to impeach Richard Nixon and led to his resignation in the summer of 1974 has been ground to dust. E pluribus unum has its limits.</p> \n<p>Relying on the constitutional debates, English legal history and the bloody aftermath of the duel between Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president, and Alexander Hamilton, founding father par excellence, Katyal convincingly argues that impeachable conduct \u2013 \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, in the parlance of the constitution \u2013 should be understood to mean offenses that violate the public trust.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=false&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe1cdf147f91488cb86400a4541a53c45c18a2bc1%3Fcrop%3D0_0_332_499&amp;title=Impeach%3A%20The%20Case%20Against%20Donald%20Trump&amp;author=Neal%20Katyal&amp;publisher=Mariner&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FImpeach-Case-Against-Donald-Trump%2Fdp%2F0358391172\" data-alt=\"Book link\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=false&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe1cdf147f91488cb86400a4541a53c45c18a2bc1%3Fcrop%3D0_0_332_499&amp;title=Impeach%3A%20The%20Case%20Against%20Donald%20Trump&amp;author=Neal%20Katyal&amp;publisher=Mariner&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FImpeach-Case-Against-Donald-Trump%2Fdp%2F0358391172\">Book link</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In other words, it is not necessarily about criminality or the penal code. Although bribery and treason definitely make the cut. For support, Katyal quotes Hamilton \u2026 and Mike Pence.</p> \n<p>In Federalist No 65, Hamilton wrote that impeachable offenses are those \u201cwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust \u2026 as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4821752/user-clip-mike-pence-describes-high-crimes-misdemeanors\">As for Pence, back when he was a congressman</a>: \u201cThis business of high crimes and misdemeanors goes to the question of whether the person serving as president of the United States put their own interests, their personal interests, ahead of public service.\u201d Irony definitely abounds.</p> \n<p>To bolster his contention, Katyal observes that Burr was not impeached after shooting Hamilton dead in Weehawken, New Jersey. Ultimately, that was deemed to be private conduct, beyond Congress\u2019s purview. In that sense, it was a fatal forerunner to the clash over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.</p> \n<p>Impeach also records how framers rejected the contention that elections and term limits should be the sole remedy for presidential wrongdoing. There, Katyal chillingly quotes Benjamin Franklin: \u201cWhat was the practice before this in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious? \u2026 Assassination.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is something to be said for safety valves. Ask Charles I or Louis XVI.</p> \n<p>Katyal also weighs in as to whether impeachment is subject to review by the supreme court. His answer is \u201cNo, Congress has the final word.\u201d There, Katyal points to the impeachment and removal of Walter Nixon from the federal bench in 1989, and the <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/506/224.html\">supreme court holding</a> that the \u201cjudiciary, and the supreme court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some of Trump\u2019s minions remain undeterred. Harvard\u2019s Alan Dershowitz has argued that impeachment charges <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/446394-dershowitz-supreme-court-could-overrule-an-unconstitutional-impeachment\">may be scrutinized</a> by the judiciary, relying, in part, upon a concurring one-man opinion written in the Nixon case by David Souter, a George HW Bush appointee to the supreme court. Dershowitz failed to reference the broader decision.</p> \n<p>Until recently, Dershowitz represented Jeffrey Epstein and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/business/media/michael-wolff-book-siege.html\">reportedly</a> was sought by Trump too. On Thursday, Trump strung together \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201chuman scum\u201d in the same sentence. Talk about getting into the spirit of things.</p> \n<p>As for the substance of Trump\u2019s impeachment, Katyal relies upon a series of damning documents. He points to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, the \u201ctranscript\u201d of the president\u2019s infamous 25 July 2019 telephone conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, and text messages from such luminaries as Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"302cd72de0a226f2856d34cac70a29b9b9b10236\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/302cd72de0a226f2856d34cac70a29b9b9b10236/0_83_5957_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies before the House intelligence committee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies before the House intelligence committee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Mills/Pool/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In hindsight, all that was just the tip of the iceberg. The rot went all the way to the top. Trump infected all. Think Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and possibly Vice-President Pence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/nov/20/donald-trump-news-today-live-impe\">As Sondland testified</a>, \u201ceveryone was in the loop\u201d and \u201cwe followed the president\u2019s orders\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/22/donald-trump-resurfaces-debunked-theory-ukraine-interfered-2016-election\">Trump resurfaces debunked theory Ukraine interfered in 2016 election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Politically, Katyal can appear tone deaf. At the outset, he proclaims, \u201cI am not a partisan\u201d \u2013 despite a record of <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=Neal+Katyal&amp;cycle=&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=&amp;cand=\">donating</a> to the Democratic National Committee and the Obama and Clinton campaigns. He has contributed more than $12,000 over the past decade to political causes. Said differently, being a law professor does not immunize one from being a partisan.</p> \n<p>Katyal also fails to grapple with just how we have reached this historic point. He acknowledges that America today is historically reminiscent of the 1850s, and yet he does not delve into how we got there. The Trump presidency did not emerge out of thin air.</p> \n<p>Regardless, abuse of power and venality appear to be hallmarks of the Trump era. Against the backdrop of the impeachment hearings, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, noted Trump booster and friend of the Kushner clan, was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and quid pro quo bribery.</p> \n<p>Misery loves company. Expect Trump to be impeached by Christmas.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You can take President Trump\u2019s impeachment to the bank but his actual removal from office is the longest of shots. Most likely, as Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton did before him, Donald Trump will survive a trial in the Senate. A year from now, expect to see his name on the ballot. Even as Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, leads Trump in the polls, the betting lines give the edge to the president. Substantively, the public impeachment hearings have been devastating. The bottom line is yes, there was a quid pro quo on aid to Ukraine. According to uncontroverted testimony, Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, drove the bus at his client\u2019s behest, and no, Ukraine did not interfere in the 2016 election. It was Russia, no surprise. Trump, however, stands defiant, his base unmoved and intact. Into America\u2019s cold civil war jumps Neal Katyal, once Barack Obama\u2019s acting solicitor general, with Impeach. Subtitled \u201cThe Case Against Donald Trump\u201d, the book is a thoughtful and well-researched polemic that advocates Trump\u2019s removal. Among other things, it provides a highly readable history on the origins and evolution of impeachment, and offers answers to questions that surround the process. But like the current impeachment hearings, its capacity to persuade will probably be limited. By definition, impeachment is political. These days, it is also highly partisan. The social cohesion and trust that girded the move to impeach Richard Nixon and led to his resignation in the summer of 1974 has been ground to dust. E pluribus unum has its limits. Relying on the constitutional debates, English legal history and the bloody aftermath of the duel between Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president, and Alexander Hamilton, founding father par excellence, Katyal convincingly argues that impeachable conduct \u2013 \u201cHigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, in the parlance of the constitution \u2013 should be understood to mean offenses that violate the public trust. In other words, it is not necessarily about criminality or the penal code. Although bribery and treason definitely make the cut. For support, Katyal quotes Hamilton \u2026 and Mike Pence. In Federalist No 65, Hamilton wrote that impeachable offenses are those \u201cwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust \u2026 as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself\u201d. As for Pence, back when he was a congressman: \u201cThis business of high crimes and misdemeanors goes to the question of whether the person serving as president of the United States put their own interests, their personal interests, ahead of public service.\u201d Irony definitely abounds. To bolster his contention, Katyal observes that Burr was not impeached after shooting Hamilton dead in Weehawken, New Jersey. Ultimately, that was deemed to be private conduct, beyond Congress\u2019s purview. In that sense, it was a fatal forerunner to the clash over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Impeach also records how framers rejected the contention that elections and term limits should be the sole remedy for presidential wrongdoing. There, Katyal chillingly quotes Benjamin Franklin: \u201cWhat was the practice before this in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious? \u2026 Assassination.\u201d There is something to be said for safety valves. Ask Charles I or Louis XVI. Katyal also weighs in as to whether impeachment is subject to review by the supreme court. His answer is \u201cNo, Congress has the final word.\u201d There, Katyal points to the impeachment and removal of Walter Nixon from the federal bench in 1989, and the supreme court holding that the \u201cjudiciary, and the supreme court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments\u201d. Some of Trump\u2019s minions remain undeterred. Harvard\u2019s Alan Dershowitz has argued that impeachment charges may be scrutinized by the judiciary, relying, in part, upon a concurring one-man opinion written in the Nixon case by David Souter, a George HW Bush appointee to the supreme court. Dershowitz failed to reference the broader decision. Until recently, Dershowitz represented Jeffrey Epstein and reportedly was sought by Trump too. On Thursday, Trump strung together \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201chuman scum\u201d in the same sentence. Talk about getting into the spirit of things. As for the substance of Trump\u2019s impeachment, Katyal relies upon a series of damning documents. He points to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, the \u201ctranscript\u201d of the president\u2019s infamous 25 July 2019 telephone conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, and text messages from such luminaries as Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland. In hindsight, all that was just the tip of the iceberg. The rot went all the way to the top. Trump infected all. Think Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and possibly Vice-President Pence. As Sondland testified, \u201ceveryone was in the loop\u201d and \u201cwe followed the president\u2019s orders\u201d. Politically, Katyal can appear tone deaf. At the outset, he proclaims, \u201cI am not a partisan\u201d \u2013 despite a record of donating to the Democratic National Committee and the Obama and Clinton campaigns. He has contributed more than $12,000 over the past decade to political causes. Said differently, being a law professor does not immunize one from being a partisan. Katyal also fails to grapple with just how we have reached this historic point. He acknowledges that America today is historically reminiscent of the 1850s, and yet he does not delve into how we got there. The Trump presidency did not emerge out of thin air. Regardless, abuse of power and venality appear to be hallmarks of the Trump era. Against the backdrop of the impeachment hearings, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, noted Trump booster and friend of the Kushner clan, was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and quid pro quo bribery. Misery loves company. Expect Trump to be impeached by Christmas.",

TPG Capital is an investor in Spotify, Blackstone owns Sesac Holdings and the Harry Fox Agency, two groups that disburse royalties. Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala has a stake in EMI Music. Swift\u2019s tweet specifically asked \u201cfor help from The Carlyle Group, who put up money for the sale of my music to these two men\u201d. Following the message the company\u2019s Twitter account and phone lines were inundated by Swift fans pressing them to intervene.</p> <p>The shot across Carlyle\u2019s bow will add pressure to negotiations if and when the two sides start discussing the Netflix deal and Swift\u2019s re-recordings. Longer-term the idea that artists like Swift will seize control of their works may rattle those investors even more. Sammataro said he expected the masters contracts of major artists \u2013 once \u201cpretty boilerplate\u201d \u2013 will now be much more carefully lawyered.</p> <p>Swift may have won this round but there will be more battles ahead. On Sunday she is expected to address the controversy head on.

TPG Capital is an investor in Spotify, Blackstone owns Sesac Holdings and the Harry Fox Agency, two groups that disburse royalties. Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala has a stake in EMI Music. Swift\u2019s tweet specifically asked \u201cfor help from The Carlyle Group, who put up money for the sale of my music to these two men\u201d. Following the message the company\u2019s Twitter account and phone lines were inundated by Swift fans pressing them to intervene. The shot across Carlyle\u2019s bow will add pressure to negotiations if and when the two sides start discussing the Netflix deal and Swift\u2019s re-recordings. Longer-term the idea that artists like Swift will seize control of their works may rattle those investors even more. Sammataro said he expected the masters contracts of major artists \u2013 once \u201cpretty boilerplate\u201d \u2013 will now be much more carefully lawyered. Swift may have won this round but there will be more battles ahead. On Sunday she is expected to address the controversy head on. Swift is planning a \u201cfierce show of female artistic strength and empowerment\u201d, music industry sources told the New York Post. \u201cHer friends are all going to be pushing her message on the red carpet. Taylor\u2019s going to play dirty with elegance and grace,\u201d the source said. Whatever she plays, she will be playing to win.",

      "bodyText": "In a recent experiment, American participants were asked: \u201cPlease describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d and \u201cWrite down as specifically as you can what you think will happen to you physically as you die and once you are dead.\u201d Moments later, those who had been asked to contemplate their mortality reported more negative attitudes towards immigrants, greater opposition to a mosque being built in their neighbourhood, and a greater likelihood of voting for Donald Trump for president. What could possibly explain these findings? In The Denial of Death (1973), cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker argued that while humans share a basic biological predisposition towards self-preservation with all life forms, we are unique in our capacity for symbolic thought, including self-awareness. This gives rise to the unsettling realisation that death is inevitable, can occur at any time, and that we are ultimately no more significant or enduring than turtles or turnips. The unvarnished awareness of death engenders potentially debilitating existential terror, which humans manage by embracing cultural worldviews \u2013 for example, a religious identity such as Christianity, or a national identity such as \u201cEnglishness\u201d. These worldviews confer a sense that one is a person of value in a world of meaning, and hence eligible for immortality (either literally, through the heavens, afterlives and souls central to most religions; or symbolically, by being a member of a great and enduring tribe or nation, having children, amassing great fortunes or producing noteworthy works of art or science).

But Abbott said he was the first of many Labour politicians to mishandle the issue \u2013 including Corbyn\u2019s predecessor Ed Miliband, whose 2015 general election campaign produced red mugs bearing the slogan \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat it is, the people who say, \u2018ooh, you know, migration is very difficult, people say this or that on the doorstep\u2019 \u2013 they really influenced poor Ed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was Ed, as a person. But you had the immigration control mugs; you had a whole party political broadcast on migration, which I\u2019ve not seen before or since. He also made at least two major speeches on migration.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s like benefits.

      "bodyText": "A Labour government would make values, not numbers, the driving force behind immigration policy, and challenge the \u201cedge of fear\u201d that has characterised the debate for decades, according to the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. \u201cWhat I would say is different about Jeremy [Corbyn] \u2013 and myself as home secretary \u2013 is we want to talk about values,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it flows from your values, actually, if you hold them genuinely, what sort of immigration system that you have.\u201d Abbott spoke to the Guardian at her home in Hackney, the day after Labour\u2019s manifesto launch in Birmingham, at which Corbyn unveiled plans for a dramatic increase in public investment. With less than three weeks to go until polling day, she welcomed newspaper headlines calling it Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto for decades. \u201cThe Labour party\u2019s under new management,\u201d she grinned. She says fairness, and the importance of keeping families together, will guide the party\u2019s approach. Labour will ditch rules that mean in some cases the partner of a British resident can be deported if they don\u2019t meet an income threshold, for example. Abbott would not to be drawn about the practical details of a new \u201cwork visa\u201d approach mentioned in the document; but says she and Corbyn believe it is time to change the national conversation about migration, on the left as well as the right. \u201cAll my life, the political debate around migration has had an edge of fear to it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first big political debate on migration I remember, was the debate around the east African Asians: and that was Callaghan.\u201d As Labour home secretary in 1968, under pressure from opposition figures including Enoch Powell, Callaghan introduced legislation to curb migration from east Africa. Callaghan claimed at the time, the \u201corigin of this bill lies neither in panic nor prejudice, but in a considered judgement of the best way to achieve the ideal of a multiracial society\u201d. But Abbott said he was the first of many Labour politicians to mishandle the issue \u2013 including Corbyn\u2019s predecessor Ed Miliband, whose 2015 general election campaign produced red mugs bearing the slogan \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. \u201cWhat it is, the people who say, \u2018ooh, you know, migration is very difficult, people say this or that on the doorstep\u2019 \u2013 they really influenced poor Ed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was Ed, as a person. But you had the immigration control mugs; you had a whole party political broadcast on migration, which I\u2019ve not seen before or since. He also made at least two major speeches on migration.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s like benefits. If the Labour party\u2019s going on and on about benefits scroungers, people say, \u2018oh, benefits scroungers, what a problem\u2019. But if the Labour party dials it down, it polls as less of an issue.\u201d Abbott argued that the Windrush scandal, and the wave of public outrage it provoked, created the opportunity to have a different kind of debate, based on fairness. \u201cI think that the Windrush scandal, and even the fact that the Tories had to say, \u2018this is awful\u2019, showed that the British people are better than the tabloid newspapers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the Windrush scandal gives you a chink of light, where you can start to explain to people. \u201cI think it is possible to make the case that these are human beings, and we do have to treat them fairly, and have a system that reflects our values. Not least because the existing system, which is all about numbers, has failed. The Tories have never once met their migration target.\u201d Conservative manifestos have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration \u2013 the number of people who arrive, minus the number who leave, each year \u2013 to less than 100,000. Boris Johnson has now ditched that aspiration, and is promising to create an \u201cAustralian-style points system\u201d, though details are scant. After a radical pro-migration motion was passed at party conference, the Conservatives had relentlessly attacked Labour as preparing to ditch any controls on immigration at all. Labour strategists were anxious about the impact of the party appearing too liberal, and Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, insisted the party must address voters\u2019 worries about an influx of cheap migrant workers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with the issues and concerns, we will create a vacuum that will be filled by a far right seeking to become the voice of the white working class,\u201d he warned. Abbott said: \u201cLen\u2019s entitled to his views, and he does represent a thread of thinking in the Labour party.\u201d She acknowledged that the manifesto does not go as far as some of the campaigners who brought the free movement motion to conference had hoped. A carefully drafted passage leaves much of the detail of the future migration regime to be determined after the issue of Brexit has been resolved. \u201cIf we remain in the EU, freedom of movement will continue,\u201d it says. \u201cIf we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad \u2013 and we will seek to protect those rights.\u201d The party would also close down two of the most notorious migrant detention centres, Yarl\u2019s Wood and Brook House, and review the future of the others. \u201cI think we\u2019re acting in the spirit of those party members that voted for that composite, who want to see a fairer migration system,\u201d Abbott said. She has held three meetings in recent days with senior civil servants preparing for the possibility of a Labour government \u2013 standard practice during general election campaigns. \u201cThey want to know whether we really mean it or not - and I said, \u2018yes, we are going to close Yarl\u2019s Wood down: we really mean that.\u2019\u201d Labour remain well behind the Conservatives in the polls, but Abbott insisted her longtime political friend and ally Corbyn is ready for Downing Street. \u201cI think in the debate, with Boris, he looked very prime ministerial,\u201d she said. \u201cThis man will be PM in a few weeks: that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England has ordered an independent review into its handling of a sexual abuse case that resulted in four bishops and an archbishop being accused of failing to respond properly to a victim\u2019s disclosures. The review will focus on the case of Trevor Devamanikkam, a vicar who was accused of raping a teenage boy more than three decades ago. Devamanikkam killed himself in June 2017, the day before he was due to appear in court on three counts of buggery and three counts of indecent assault. Matthew Ineson, who made the allegations against Devamanikkam and who has waived his right to anonymity, has said he disclosed, either directly or indirectly, his account of being raped at the age of 16 to four bishops and the archbishop of York. Ineson, who was ordained as a priest in his 20s, said that between 2012 and 2013 he gave accounts of the alleged abuse in the 1980s to Peter Burrows, the bishop of Doncaster; Steven Croft, who at the time was bishop of Sheffield and is now bishop of Oxford; and Martyn Snow, the then archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham and now bishop of Leicester; but nothing came of his reports. He went on to make two written disclosures to Croft, copying his letter to John Sentamu, archbishop of York, and Glyn Webster, bishop of Beverley. Sentamu briefly responded to Ineson, saying he would pray for him and sending best wishes. Ineson lodged formal complaints of misconduct against the bishops and archbishop in 2016 for allegedly failing to act on his disclosures, but they were dismissed by the church, which cited a one-year time limit for such complaints. Since waiving his right to anonymity, Ineson has become one of the most persistent and outspoken critics of the church over its shortcomings in dealing with cases of sexual abuse. In a letter to Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, in 2017 Ineson said: \u201cThe Church of England has made me fight at every step to try to achieve both justice and the further prevention of abuse by my abuser. By doing this, you have added to my abuse. The bishops have actively colluded together to attempt to ignore, discredit and get rid of me.\u201d Earlier this year, Sentamu admitted to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse that the church\u2019s treatment of Ineson had been \u201cshabby and shambolic\u201d but denied he had made personal mistakes in the case. The C of E announced on Friday it had appointed Jane Humphreys, a safeguarding consultant with more than 30 years experience, to review its handling of the allegations relating to Devamanikkam. She would take written and verbal evidence from \u201cthe survivor who brought the original allegation of abuse\u201d and would \u201cmake contact with the relevant archbishop and bishops as well as those safeguarding professionals in the church who dealt with the allegations,\u201d the C of E said. Ineson told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the church should be appointing anyone to investigate it \u2013 it should be truly independent, which it isn\u2019t. The church, the ones who are being investigated, are trying to control the whole thing. The church is steam rollering ahead without regard to anybody including the victim. I\u2019d very much welcome a genuinely independent review but this is not the way to do it. I can\u2019t say whether I\u2019ll cooperate with the process until I know more.\u201d The C of E said it hoped the review would be completed and published next year.",

A vey odd day from England. The first half of the day, England had their chance: they didn\u2019t bowl Archer at the start, and then to not bowl him with the second new ball after lunch was strange, and then for Ben Stokes to only bowl four overs before tea when you\u2019re looking for something to happen - he\u2019s one of those players who does that. I thought England looked a bit flat and lethargic.\u201d</em></p> <p>That\u2019s a fair enough summary - England frayed round the edges, Joe Root didn\u2019t ring the bowling changes like he did yesterday, while New Zealand through Watling, with support from De Grandhomme and Santner, battled towards a strong position.

The confusion is that the numbers don\u2019t match the batting order (which would have been my rather dull preferred option), so you have to have a scorecard which tells you who is wearing which number. The players chose their own numbers, eg Joe Root - 66 (Root 66).

      "bodyText": "And Australia are putting Pakistan to the sword \u2026 A wonderful innings from BJ Watling - batting all day to take New Zealand from an unpromising yesterday to a happy today and a handy lead. Mike Atherton is talking: \u201cWatling\u2019s a real scrapper, you can almost bank on him to produce in a scrappy situation. It was an excellent hundred on a pretty flat pitch. A vey odd day from England. The first half of the day, England had their chance: they didn\u2019t bowl Archer at the start, and then to not bowl him with the second new ball after lunch was strange, and then for Ben Stokes to only bowl four overs before tea when you\u2019re looking for something to happen - he\u2019s one of those players who does that. I thought England looked a bit flat and lethargic.\u201d That\u2019s a fair enough summary - England frayed round the edges, Joe Root didn\u2019t ring the bowling changes like he did yesterday, while New Zealand through Watling, with support from De Grandhomme and Santner, battled towards a strong position. That\u2019s it from me, thanks for all your emails and Santa stories, good night! 141st over: New Zealand 394-6 (Santner 31, Watling 119) Stokes bowls the last over of the day. He throws in a short ball that spits off the pitch and Santner struggles to defend with high hands. Then another, which Santner swats leg-side, nearly hitting his stumps with his flailing bat, but a harmless bouncer finishes off the evening\u2019s play. Leach and Stokes shake hands with Watling and the batsmen walk happily off the field, pocketing a lead of 41. 140th over: New Zealand 393-6 (Santner 31, Watling 118) Broad hauls his tired old body in for one last over. The crowd lounge on the grassy banks. Santer and Watling prod. Denly fumbles in the field and can\u2019t face looking at Broad. One over left. 139th over: New Zealand 390-6 (Santner 30, Watling 116) Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot Dot-that-just-falls-to-the-right-of-Ollie-Pope-under-the-helmet, from Stokes 138th over: New Zealand 390-6 (Santner 30, Watling 116) We\u2019re all getting weary now. Joe Root risks life and limb by throwing the ball to Stuart Broad. Joe Denly then risks the hairdryer by letting the ball through his fingers at cover. Broad reacts with remarkable equanimity and cheers up furtherwhen he beats Watling with an absolute cracker that swings away. 137th over: New Zealand 388-6 (Santner 30, Watling 114) Santner shuffles here, Santer shuffles there, but manages to survive Archer\u2019s over. Just, I think, the four overs to go in the day. 136th over: New Zealand 388-6 (Santner 30, Watling 114) Another Leach maiden, but, more importantly, good news on the Villa Park Santa. Greetings from New York. While the parachuting Santa at Villa Park in over 113 that Rob Buckley saw did lose a leg, he did survive and married the RAF nurse that helped with his rehab and had they had children. Also he took part in rowing across the Atlantic, got his pilots license and got back into scuba diving so he has definitely lived a full life after that day! Thanks Rory! That\u2019s wonderful news. 135th over: New Zealand 388-6 (Santner 30, Watling 114) A smart delivery that from Archer, the knuckle ball according to commentary, but Watling lives to fight another over. He was, remember, dropped on 31. Watling is given out lbw to a ball from Archer that swings in towards his stumps. He immediately reviews and sure enough, got an inside edge. Review overturned. 134th over: New Zealand 386-6 (Santner 29, Watling 113) Leach wheels in again uncomplainingly. Santner forces three, and the overs tick on. Phil writes: So is Jofra Archer still God\u2019s gift to English/world cricket? Ooh Phil, that\u2019s harsh. He\u2019s only in his first year of international cricket, he\u2019s allowed the odd off game. The interesting thing will be, does he learn from it. I reckon he will. 133rd over: New Zealand 383-6 (Santner 26, Watling 113) Archer forces Santner into an awkward pancake style scythe short of gully, but then Watling back-foot punches him to the boundary for four. Archer\u2019s gold chain has slipped on top of his collar, he puts his hand on his hips and sighs. Eight overs left. 132nd over: New Zealand 378-6 (Santner 25, Watling 109) Something there for Leach to hold on to at last. He lands one in the footprints and it rips out, beats Satner, and Buttler too. Then Watling sends him scurrying away to the boundary. 131st over: New Zealand 371-6 (Santner 25, Watling 105) Archer mixes things up with a slower ball, but things just not working for him today. I think I\u2019d retire him gently to pasture after this over. 130th over: New Zealand 370-6 (Santner 24, Watling 105) Watling plays out a Leach maiden as the barmy army stands and hits peak voice, sorry Mount Maunganui. Another email from a light sleeper. Hi Tanya, James here in wet, windy and cold Dublin. Winter is here in earnest. Quick question. What are the chances we get a world cricket test league? Something run during the year involving all the test countries. 9 games per year. And also, should Root and Stokes bowl more, I always wonder why Stokes is not used sooner. Hi James, hope you\u2019ve got a hot water bottle keeping you company. I think they\u2019ll give the World Test Championship a good go first - though of course these Tests don\u2019t, confusingly, count towards it. 129th over: New Zealand 370-6 (Santner 24, Watling 105) Jofra\u2019s just not got found his zing today. Another over passes harmlessly by. The Santner-Watling partnership reaches 54. 128th over: New Zealand 370-6 (Santner 24, Watling 105) Watling cover drives Leach with far more style than a man who has been at the crease for over 250 deliveries should be doing. Tim writes from Lombok. Hi Tim! Referencing Santa sporting calamities. Basin Reserve, Pakistan touring, late nineties, and at tea Santa comes out on the ground with a sack of lollies for the great Kiwi tradition of the lolly scramble. All\u2019s well at the start, as a small number of kids start to follow him. And then the pack grows and Santa gets nervous. He quickens his stride as more kids join the pack and then starts to run, in full regalia, and trips over in his oversized gummies at which point the hyenas pounce and feast on his sack of lollies. One of the funniest things I\u2019ve ever seen at a cricket ground. Tim - can you find this on youtube anywhere? I need to see it! 127th over: New Zealand 366-6 (Santner 24, Watling 101) And so we have Archer, for what will probably be his final spell with 45 minutes left of play. He ambles in in his usual way, hitting about 81/82 mph. He varies the length a bit, mostly the shorter side of full, and that\u2019s a maiden. 126th over: New Zealand 366-6 (Santner 24, Watling 101) Another Leach over that retains control, but doesn\u2019t really threaten. JEA Wallace adds some bah to our humbugs: Please tell Mike Strange that in this New Yorker\u2019s opinion the numbers on the shirts are the work of the devil; as is music blaring between overs, sponsor\u2019s names on the pitch, and anyone who plays a bloody trumpet at a cricket match... I like the numbers but I\u2019m with you with the trumpet - apart from the St George\u2019s brass band at Port Elizabeth. That\u2019s wonderful. 125th over: New Zealand 364-6 (Santner 23, Watling 100) Watling turns Curran through the covers for four, a couple of singles later and he\u2019s done it! Well played, 251 balls of application with the odd stylish flouish on top. A game-changing innings for New Zealand. It\u2019s the first century at this new Test ground, and his eighth in all. He pulls off his helmet, raises his bat and gets a hug from Santner, and a standing ovation from the crowd. And that\u2019s drinks! 124h over: New Zealand 355-6 (Santner 20, Watling 94) Root ringing the changes, he steps back, Leach steps up. Just one from the over. 123rd over: New Zealand 354-6 (Santner 20, Watling 93) And so Sam Curran gets a chance to find the spark as Ben Stokes is retired after a typically full-on spell. In he skips, Watling nicely leg-glances him down to the boundary, then with another single New Zealand slide into a first-innings lead. Well batted Black Caps - much tenacity and skill. 122nd over: New Zealand 349-6 (Santner 20, Watling 88) Root whizzes through another over without incident. News from the dressing-room, Burns won\u2019t field again today but will be fit to bat tomorrow. 121st over: New Zealand 344-6 (Santner 17, Watling 86) Ben Stokes has a really distinctive swing to his arms as he marches back to his mark, the arms cross the body rather than swinging from side to side. On the radio, Mark Ramprakash is wondering where the energy is coming from, in a team of introverts ( I paraphrase) other than Stokes. Ian Forth has a bee in his bonnet about Ian Smith\u2019s tea pronouncements. Ian Smith, expert analyst, has concluded England\u2019s problem is \u2018not bowling straight\u2019. You could forgive the proverbial man from Mars being confused. Perhaps that guy with the swingometer will announce at the end of the election that the losing party \u2018failed to get enough votes\u2019. After a century of books on Scott\u2019s expedition to the South Pole, by the way, one book I read concluded he\u2019d underestimated how cold it was going to be. The Antarctic, of all places! Poor old Captain Scott, not to mention the rest of his team, what a way to go -freezing/starving to death because he\u2019d underestimated the weather. 120th over: New Zealand 344-6 (Santner 17, Watling 86) Root brings himself on. Santer has a gander for a few balls, then crunches him back over his head for six. Time for a touch of Jofra? 119th over: New Zealand 337-6 (Santner 10, Watling 86) Stokes sends down five dot balls, but Watling launches into a shorter one and biffs the ball through backward point for four, despite a valiant dive by sub fielder (for Burns) Zak Crawley. This from Australia! 118th over: New Zealand 333-6 (Santner 10, Watling 82) A looser over from Leach. First Archer uncharacteristically lets a ball through his fingers at extra cover and the batsmen go through for two, then Santner, specs visible through his helmet grill, eyes up a shorter ball from his fellow glasses-wearer, goes onto the back foot and crashes him through the covers for four. 117th over: New Zealand 325-6 (Santner 3, Watling 81) Stokes tosses the ball from hand to hand and charges in, in that rather hobbling way he has. Short ball follows, short ball. And that\u2019s a maiden. Brian Withington is still awake! \u201cIn the spirit of full disclosure I did switch to the latest revealing episode of The Good Place before the tea interval. And from that I have learnt from the moral philosopher Chidi that \u2018There is no \u201canswer\u201d\u2019. And that the answer is Eleanor. Not sure if that helps Joe Root with the next session, but it\u2019s given me the strength to cling on a little longer. Eleanor? Hmmm, I\u2019m trying desperately to think of an amusing cricketing reference, but the cogs aren\u2019t turning smoothly at this ungodly hour. 116th over: New Zealand 325-6 (Santner 3, Watling 81) Santner gets some lighr relief by playing out a maiden from Leach. 115th over: New Zealand 325-6 (Santner 3, Watling 81) Santner is being tormented here by Stokes, ducking into and away from a variety of snorters, until he turns away, takes his eye off the ball and is crunched in the ribs. Ouch. An email: My name is Mike Strange and I am following the match on the Guardian website. I live in Raleigh North Carolina. Just a small point. I noticed that the players have numbers on their shirts like footballers. I cannot understand what purpose these numbers can have. Can you enlighten me? Hi Mike, the numbers are there to aid identification, mostly at the ground where from the long boundaries players can be hard to distinguish. The confusion is that the numbers don\u2019t match the batting order (which would have been my rather dull preferred option), so you have to have a scorecard which tells you who is wearing which number. The players chose their own numbers, eg Joe Root - 66 (Root 66). Hope that helps. 114th over: New Zealand 323-6 (Santner 2, Watling 81) Tim Southee manspreads in the New Zealand dressing room as Leach floats up and pings in. 113th over: New Zealand 321-6 (Santner 1, Watling 80) Stokes is fired up and Santner is hit by a bouncer and dancing all over the place. He hasn\u2019t settled in yet. Rob Buckley writes with a horrifying tale: Just wanted to say that I hope the Santa / helicopter event goes better than the Santa parachuting into Villa Park I witnessed a few (lot) of years back. I think he got a blown off course by the wind and hit the roof of the Trinity Rd stand. Villa were 2-0 down at the time and there were hopes the game might be called off. It wasn\u2019t. After a lengthy delay, the teams re-started and Villa eventually beat Arsenal 3-2. I think the Santa parachutist survived, but with life-changing injuries. Terrible to see. Hopefully the helicopter\u2019s been checked out before it takes off with Santa a-board. Oh, that\u2019s awful, that poor Santa. Much love to him from OBO towers. Must have been traumatising to watch too. 112th over: New Zealand 320-6 (Santner 1, Watling 79) Leach\u2019s first ball beats batsman and wicketkeeper, spinning out of the rough and down for a couple of byes. Interesting. Santner immediately seems fazed and plays a couple of ugly swipes. 111th over: New Zealand 317-6 (Santner 1, Watling 79) That came from nowhere! De Grandhomme\u2019s concentration obviously not quite switched on post-tea and a really super leaping one-handed grab from Sibley, who is well over six foot tall. The deficit is 35. Stokes\u2019 very first ball after tea! A loosener from Stokes, which de Grandhomme sent flying to gully where Sibley took a diving catch to his right just a newspaper\u2019s width from the ground. The players potter on for the final session, and while we\u2019re here a big shout out to my niece and nephew in Auckland who were off to the Sirens and Sounds festival in Auckland today, where Father Christmas was due to land in a helicopter whilst throwing lollies out of his coat pocket and my nephew was last year chased by a police dog. Perhaps Santa might deliver the England dressing-room something - gumption? - as an early Christmas present on his way home? 110th over: New Zealand 316-5 (De Grandhomme 65, Watling 79) Leach rolls out an over and that\u2019s tea! Well played New Zealand - 92 runs in the session, they\u2019re now just 37 behind England. Time for a regroup, a rubdown and a rethink. On the radio Ian Smith has penciled in England\u2019s two errors: not bowling straight and split fields. The only England bowler to have taken an over today is Joe Root. I\u2019m off to replenish my mug, see you back here in ten! 109th over: New Zealand 315-5 (De Grandhomme 64, Watling 79) Curran is cross with himself after losing his line, Watling sends him down to the fine-leg boundary and they plod on. And a gruesome update on Rory Burns - he is having his thumb glued back together but should be ok to bat. 108th over: New Zealand 311-5 (De Grandhomme 64, Watling 75) Well bowled Stuart Broad, he draws de Grandhomme into a play and miss - another maiden - can New Zealand resist having a pop in the ten minutes or so before tea? Morning Tanya, writes Simon. Morning Simon! The lethargy and body language are awful.Is Joe too nice to be Captain ? Nasser, Vaughny...and even Cooky would be igniting some fires (or kicking bottoms) among their bowlers and fielders ! Did Cook kick ass? I can\u2019t imagine it but perhaps you\u2019re right. Root is a fairly un demonstrative man - I guess it depends if his nurturing streak makes up for it. It must be nearly impossible for a mild-mannered man to lose his shit at a group of pros in a convincing way. Anyway, you\u2019re right, the body language says - blaghghg. 107th over: New Zealand 311-5 (De Grandhomme 64, Watling 75) Curran must be Root\u2019s best chance of a breakthrough. His scamper and unpredictability seem to play on the mind of the batsmen, especially big guys like these two who must fancy smashing the wee chap out of the ground. Archer has riled Brian Withington too. In reply to the dicing Danny Doyle\u2019s delicious diatribe, at this point in proceedings I\u2019d be thrilled if Archer could manage just the intimidation bit. It\u2019s not an ideal pitch for him admittedly, but he did look lost when the short ball didn\u2019t work. 106th over: New Zealand 309-5 (De Grandhomme 66, Watling 73) A couple of runs, Broad isn\u2019t at his speediest this afternoon. A sense of drift seems to have fallen on England\u2019s fielders. 105th over: New Zealand 307-5 (De Grandhomme 63, Watling 72) Root shuffles the pack again, and pulls out the man with the golden arm, Sam Curran. He zips his very first ball across de Grandhomme who has a slightly wild go and sends the ball flying to Rory Burns at gully who can\u2019t grab it with his right hand and actually cuts his hand with the force of the shot and walks off the field. Things just not dropping for England this afternoon. 104th over: New Zealand 304-5 (De Grandhomme 62, Watling 70) Watling moves into the lead in his cat and mouse battling battle with de Grandhomme. Broad drifts into a wide half volley and Watling twists the face and sends the ball skimming across the grass. He also knocks Dom Sibley at cover off his feet with the force of a cut. 103rd over: New Zealand 300-5 (De Grandhomme 62, Watling 66) Something between a ripple and a roar of applause loops round the ground as Watling sends Leach to the fine leg boundary to knock up the 100 partnership between these two and then goes through for a single to bring up the 300. Danny Doyle dices with OBO opprobrium: At the risk of being hounded out of the OBO, is Archer in danger of becoming a show pony? Seems his primary goal is to intimidate, what focus os there on hitting top of off? Or getting the batsmen play and miss? 102nd over: New Zealand 294-5 (De Grandhomme 61, Watling 61) And Archer does get his rest as Root turns to his old pro, Stuart Broad. On the telly they note that the wind has changed, and Broad is now bowling into it - nevertheless he immediately gives Root the control he wanted. A maiden. 101st over: New Zealand 294-5 (De Grandhomme 61, Watling 61) Leach offers up a full toss which Watling sweeps on one knee. Another three runs trickle by and I\u2019m starting to regret how long I left my teabag to stew. An email! You know who from. \u201cThis is so grim from an England perspective that I\u2019m seriously thinking of switching to the latest episode of The Good Place, writes Brian Withington. \u201c Quite appropriate really - [spoiler alert] you think you\u2019re in heaven and it turns out to be hell after all.\u201d 100th over: New Zealand 290-5 (De Grandhomme 59, Watling 59) Archer again, but he looks weary. His first ball is wide and Watling clips him through cover for four. He gets one to rear up and surprise Watling later in the over. And that\u2019s the hundredth over bowled. 99th over: New Zealand 286-5 (De Grandhomme 59, Watling 55) Joe Root jogs onto the pitch at the start of the over, he must have taken a tactical toilet break. We are shown an amusing side-on shot of him chatting to Chris Silverwood, who has broadened from runner bean to potato in recent years. A couple off Leach\u2019s over. 98th over: New Zealand 284-5 (De Grandhomme 57, Watling 53) Good morning/afternoon/witching hour! Well, New Zealand are doing rather well here, I must admit to be expecting to potter downstairs to take over from Niall and find England\u2019s openers out in the middle again. Anyway, Archer has the ball and he doesn\u2019t look the happiest. He pings a few short ones and de Grandhomme plays a great little periscope glide down to the third man boundary. 97th over: New Zealand 281-5 (De Grandhomme 56, Watling 53) Somewhat inevitably, De Grandhomme overtakes his partner despite facing less than half the number of balls. He does so by crashing a short Leach ball through point. That\u2019s drinks, and time for me to hand over to Tanya Aldred, who will see through to stumps. 96th over: New Zealand 276-5 (Watling 53, De Grandhomme 51) REVIEW! Archer finally finds a delivery that zips across Watling and clatters his pads - but did it cut back too far? Root waits, and waits, and then reviews. It\u2019s heading between middle and leg, but a fraction too high! England lose their second review of the day. The crowd think he\u2019s done it first-ball, but it goes down as five (!) wides from Archer. No matter, he pulls a short one away, and that\u2019s an excellent half-century. 95th over: New Zealand 268-5 (Watling 53, De Grandhomme 49) Stokes cuts off an attempted sweep from Watling, but New Zealand still run two off Leach, who really doesn\u2019t look like making the breakthrough. 94th over: New Zealand 265-5 (Watling 51, De Grandhomme 48) It\u2019s all very quiet in the England ranks. Hands on hips, eyes on the ground. A hefty CdG sweep earns a single. The Bay Oval is practically silent, save for the thud, thud, thud of Archer\u2019s deliveries, which are actually starting to pick up speed. It\u2019s a strange atmosphere. 93rd over: New Zealand 264-5 (Watling 51, De Grandhomme 47) This is intriguingly poised; you can\u2019t really argue that England have any kind of edge any more, but a couple of quick wickets would change that. No luck for Leach here, a couple of singles as the ball refuses to turn. There has been plenty of clamour for Archer to be used more today, but maybe Root knows something we don\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t look quite right, and that was a morale-sapping over. Jack Leach will take up the fight from the other end. Quite the contrast in styles. 92nd over: New Zealand 262-5 (Watling 50, De Grandhomme 46) It\u2019s Jofra time, with England\u2019s lead about to slip to less than a hundred. Can he conjure something from a pitch that\u2019s refusing to come to life? Not really. CdG fends him off, then steers a bouncer effortlessly for six! Archer isn\u2019t happy, and rejigs his field - only for De Grandhomme to drive his next four four. 91st over: New Zealand 252-5 (Watling 50, De Grandhomme 37) Another sweetly timed drive, this time off Broad. He can grind it out with the best of them, but he\u2019s doing well as the aggressor alongside Watling, who got a little bogged down next to Nicholls. 90th over: New Zealand 245-5 (Watling 50, De Grandhomme 30) Curran continues in search of De Grandhomme\u2019s inside edge, but it\u2019s not quite happening. Jack Leach and Mitch Santner signing bats beyond the outfield. This session hasn\u2019t caught fire yet. A tuck into the on-side, gets the job done. Fine work from the 34-year-old, not always pretty and not quick, but exactly what New Zealand needed. 89th over: New Zealand 243-5 (Watling 49, De Grandhomme 29) CdG is certainly being more expansive than Watling - and he\u2019s lucky that a wild top-edge drops a few feet short of the fielder. Watling on strike, and he waits patiently before snaffling a single. That half-century inching ever closer, like a glacier. 88th over: New Zealand 240-5 (Watling 48, De Grandhomme 28) Curran learns from his last over and keeps his lines tight against CdG - then finds that inside edge again! It\u2019s a fine line - that\u2019s an inch from being driven through the covers, and an inch from crashing into the stumps. 87th over: New Zealand 240-5 (Watling 48, De Grandhomme 27) There\u2019s some movement for Broad, a snorter that shapes away and has Watling swinging at thin air! CdG with another punchy late drive, a little square, and it\u2019s retrieved at the boundary. 86th over: New Zealand 236-5 (Watling 47, De Grandhomme 24) Another Curran ball cuts back in, but Watling leans back and nudges it away. He\u2019s creeping towards a very hard-earned 50. In search of swing, Curran goes full, and De Grandhomme crunches an excellent cover drive. Next ball, same result, and England\u2019s frustration deepens. 85th over: New Zealand 227-5 (Watling 46, De Grandhomme 16) It\u2019s Stuart Broad from the other end, rather than Archer. He\u2019s 0-21 from 15 runs, but can he find a wicket? He tempts Watling into an edgy single, while CdG, feet firmly planted, isn\u2019t interested. Broad\u2019s pace creeping up, and one from the over. 84th over: New Zealand 226-5 (Watling 45, De Grandhomme 16) England take the new ball! And it\u2019s Sam Curran who will kick off the afternoon, as he did this morning. He gets movement straight away, CdG edging into his pads. He repeats the trick, de Grandhomme looking a little twitchy. The players will be heading out any minute now. Potentially a big old session coming up ... Sky are showing an excellent interview with Mark Wood, reliving the Cricket World Cup final. He says he was so nervous, he put on far too much kit, then sprinted to the middle in an effort to warm up. There are some nice insights from inside the home dressing room - Jason Roy throwing trail mix, Jos Buttler punching the wall in frustration. On the winning moment: \u201cWhen we won, running on the field ... it\u2019s like when you\u2019re a kid, at the top of a hill, and you just run, faster than your legs can go.\u201d It\u2019s well worth a watch. \u201cSpotted a classic bi-plane flyover just now - that rascal Lord Gower cocking an aristocratic snook at the low energy Sky coverage? Proper (turgid) test cricket,\u201d Brian Withington wrote, just before those two overs. \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d he added, but I\u2019d say the original email stands. That session belonged to the purists, and to New Zealand, who have chipped 75 runs off their deficit for the loss of just one wicket. They\u2019ve been helped by England\u2019s lethargy in the field, and some curious tactics as Joe Root pondered whether to stick or twist. But with the new ball surely coming after lunch, it should liven up. More soon. Don\u2019t forget to join Geoff Lemon for live coverage of Australia v Pakistan: 83rd over: New Zealand 224-5 (Watling 45, De Grandhomme 14) Forgive my ignorance, but what was the point of racing through overs to get the new ball before lunch, and then not using it? Watling sweeps a couple more off Root, and that\u2019s lunch. 82nd over: New Zealand 222-5 (Watling 43, De Grandhomme 14) Ten minutes until lunch, and Leach continues, finding no spin and causing no concern for the men at the crease. Watling is edging towards 50, in a quickfire 130 balls. 81st over: New Zealand 221-5 (Watling 42, De Grandhomme 14) Root will carry on, and the new ball goes into the umpire\u2019s pocket, where it\u2019ll stay until the afternoon, I\u2019ll wager. His first delivery catches De Grandhomme napping, but the rest are handled with minimal fuss. 80th over: New Zealand 219-5 (Watling 41, De Grandhomme 13) Leach with a maiden that won\u2019t trouble the highlight reel. Broad is back on the field - and here comes the new ball, with lunch a few minutes away! 79th over: New Zealand 219-5 (Watling 41, De Grandhomme 13) Penultimate over before the new ball, which Root whips through in under two minutes. His haste costs him on the final delivery, which strays wide and is punished by CdG. Broad is off the field, with Zak Crawley on as a sub fielder. Not entirely sure why. 78th over: New Zealand 213-5 (Watling 40, De Grandhomme 8) De Grandhomme will wait all day for the kind of short, wide gift Leach dishes out mid-over here. He cuts it away dismissively for four, 77th over: New Zealand 208-5 (Watling 40, De Grandhomme 3) A maiden from Root, with Watling defending smartly. He may have only added 30 runs all morning, but it could prove a crucial knock. 76th over: New Zealand 208-5 (Watling 40, De Grandhomme 3) Five overs until the new ball. Might we see it before lunch? New Zealand milk six runs from this Leach over, as thoughts in the crowd turn to refreshments. 75th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Watling 38, De Grandhomme 1) Colin de Grandhomme thinks we\u2019ve seen enough excitement, thanks very much, and waits 14 balls to clock up his first run, off a Root delivery he digs out from under his pads. 74th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Watling 37, De Grandhomme 0) Leach continues at a cost of only one run, the wily Watling pouncing on a shorter one. 73rd over: New Zealand 201-5 (Watling 36, De Grandhomme 0) A maiden from Root, England zipping through the overs in order to get the new ball in play ASAP after lunch. 72nd over: New Zealand 201-5 (Watling 36, De Grandhomme 0) A tidy over from Leach, spoiled by a drifting delivery that Watling sweeps to the rope. Safe to say things are livening up a little. 71st over: New Zealand 197-5 (Watling 32, De Grandhomme 0) It\u2019s the Big Man to the crease next, and he sees out the over. More happened in those last two overs than in the rest of the session combined. Captaincy 101 here from Root, doing the job himself just as the terrors were starting to spread through the England field. A sliding, straight ball finds that inside edge, and this time Nicholls walks! Dropped catch! Joe Root has seen enough, and will have a bowl himself. Watling edges second ball to Stokes at slip - and he drops an absolute dolly! But his blushes may be spared ... 70th over: New Zealand 192-4 (Nicholls 41, Watling 27) Leach looks to have made the breakthrough, beating Nicholls\u2019 inside edge - and the finger goes up! Nicholls reviews - this will be close - it\u2019s just outside the line of off-stump. What a review that is! England denied. A run-out chance follows immediately after, but Archer misfields and Nicholls scurries back. If Leach was unlucky, that was a little careless. 69th over: New Zealand 186-4 (Nicholls 36, Watling 26) Watling getting some joy from Stokes, clattering a wider ball through the covers for four. England are sinking into the mire, so who else to call on but Jack Leach ... 68th over: New Zealand 181-4 (Nicholls 36, Watling 22) Archer with a bouncer that loops roughly one mile over Watling\u2019s head, and way beyond Buttler too. Another four byes, followed by a no ball. England are making this easy; Nicholls and Watling aren\u2019t having to do much to keep the scoreboard moving. 67th over: New Zealand 176-4 (Nicholls 36, Watling 22) Stokes to resume, and he serves up an overstep and a no-ball. Fifteen extras in this innings, and 13 of them byes. Nicholls, who I should mention came through concussion protocols last night, finds the gap and punches through the offside for four. New Zealand are halfway to England\u2019s total ... 66th over: New Zealand 170-4 (Nicholls 32, Watling 21) Sky are chatting about Free Solo, the white-knuckle documentary on mountain climbing. But is it more exciting than this? You decide. Archer can\u2019t tempt Nicholls here. The batsman has looked really composed, considering the absolute wallop he took late yesterday. A maiden, and drinks. \u201cReasons to like watching cricket in NZ? They\u2019re playing Ladyhawke at the ground!\u201d cheers Kevin Wilson. I\u2019ve also heard the Doobie Brothers and - not so good - Ed Sheeran. This pitch is a bit of a Sheeran, so far today at least. 65th over: New Zealand 170-4 (Nicholls 32, Watling 21) Will these two start opening up a little, with the bowlers toiling? Nicholls does have a nibble at a short, wide offering from Stokes, but that\u2019s about it. 64th over: New Zealand 169-4 (Nicholls 31, Watling 21) Archer changes tack, with the bouncers not really working (see below). This over is fuller, angled in, but a slower ball slips beyond Buttler and trundles away for four byes. That sums it up for England; all a little lethargic. 63rd over: New Zealand 162-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 19) Ben Stokes comes in for Broad, with England in need of a little inspiration. He does at least offer a little more sauce, mixing up length and speed, but it\u2019s seen off for another maiden. 62nd over: New Zealand 162-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 19) \u2018Maiden Without Menace\u2019 sounds like a decent Judas Priest album. Anyway, Archer to Watling, the bowler hitting 86mph but leaking a boundary, as a defensive shot squirms away behind the wicket. An appeal, as a fuller one clips Nicholls\u2019 pads, but there seemed to be an edge. Root reviews. That looks hopeful. Third umpire Paul Wilson initially throws it out quicksmart, then takes a little more time to make sure. Bottom line, it hit the bat, he\u2019s not out, and England have one review left. 61st over: New Zealand 157-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 14) Was keeping Archer under wraps for the first half-hour a mistake? It feels like we\u2019ve slipped into an attritional funk very early on here. Another maiden largely without menace from Broad. 60th over: New Zealand 157-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 14) Archer comes in, which is interesting. Looks like Root may have abandoned the waiting game. The short, nasty stuff is promptly delivered, although not quite fast or tricky enough to trouble Watling, who profits from a Sibley misfield. \u201cEngland\u2019s reserve plan must be to take two or three wickets in this session, then be batting again by tea,\u201d reckons John Starbuck. \u201cThe rest can be left to happenstance, but they do need to take this match, for self-respect as well as kudos. If they fail? = changes.\u201d 59th over: New Zealand 155-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 12) Broad continues, but isn\u2019t getting much joy from this pitch, which is looking a little flat so far. Sky\u2019s JofraCam shows our man going through some stretches. Last time, he was yawning, so that\u2019s an improvement. 58th over: New Zealand 155-4 (Nicholls 30, Watling 12) Curran the Kane Slayer drifts off line, and Watling flicks one artfully off his pads. Nicholls follows suit and they run two. Looking settled now, although Watling prods at an outswinger as Curran mixes things up. 57th over: New Zealand 151-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 11) From the commentary box, a list of things that are good about being in New Zealand on a Saturday morning. Sunshine, sea breeze, laid-back vibes. Thanks, we get the picture. Watling breaks the barren run with a scrappy cut that yields one run. 56th over: New Zealand 150-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 10) The next three in the pavilion: Santner, De Grandhomme, Southee. Plenty of beef in the middle order for England to gnaw through. Curran fires in a bouncer, but Nicholls is unfazed. Three maidens on the bounce ... 55th over: New Zealand 150-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 10) Not to say this is lacking intensity, but Ian Smith has been waxing lyrical about the speed of the Bay Oval bag-checking process. Broad at least gives Watling something to think about, finding a better line that angles in sharply. Another maiden, although there are maidens and maidens, and this was the former. 54th over: New Zealand 150-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 10) Curran with a full, sliding ball that clips Nicholls on the pads. It\u2019s sliding down, and only Buttler offers any kind of appeal. Curran, the breeze at his back, is bowling 20kph quicker than Broad as Archer waits in the wings. Maiden. 53rd over: New Zealand 150-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 10) Bumble correctly predicts that it\u2019s Broad, rather than Archer, to be handed the cherry next. Coming round the wicket to Nicholls, he strays down leg for a bye. 150 up for the hosts, and offers nothing to tempt Watling outside his off stump. 52nd over: New Zealand 149-4 (Nicholls 27, Watling 10) Curran kicks things off, with the Barmy Army offering a sleepy chorus of Jerusalem from one of the grass banks. BJ Watling flicks off his pads, past square-leg for a settling four. The teams are out right on cue at a sun-kissed Bay Oval. Tim Southee speaks! \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of guys at the crease who know how to scrap. We knew this pitch would get tougher to bat on as the Test went on. It\u2019s a big day for us.\u201d From 7,000 miles to 700 yards (I\u2019m guessing), here\u2019s Graeme Simpson: \u201cKia ora from just over the hill, inland from the Mount. I\u2019d go over but am stuck with domestic duties. In spite of the outcome at the World Cup (and the deja vu ending of the T20 series), there seems to be genuine mutual respect between these two squads. Bring on day three!\u201d \u201cFollowing the progress of this game from a very wet Medellin,\u201d writes the intrepid Will West. \u201cStill Friday afternoon here, so just caught up with yesterday\u2019s match report, followed by a scroll through the OBO. Great to see plucky Sam Curran among the wickets, and a particular treat to see Kim Thonger\u2019s famous hound Dakkers! A real ambassador for the game. More of both today please...\u201d Medellin is 7,474 miles from Tauranga, and 5,253 miles from London. Will, you may be our most far-flung reader. Welcome! \u201cThe first new ball is really crucial,\u201d says Sam Curran. \u201cWe need to get rid of Nicholls and De Grandhomme. If it doesn\u2019t swing, I can come around the wicket, try to trap them in the crease.\u201d He\u2019s also talking up his hopes of cementing a Test place. I remember visiting the Oval for the last day of the county season in 2015, seeing the Currans in action, and thinking they would surely both play for England soon enough. That one rattles around all alone in my \u201caccurate sporting predictions\u201d file. Peter Gibbs writes: \u201cI had noted the welcome relief, like that of a collective settling into one\u2019s favourite armchair, that poured out on OBO as things got underway two nights ago. \u201cYou were back, transporting us away from this misery to another hemisphere, to a time where matches were measured in days, openers were compared to Gower immediately before departing via outside off. and England collapses were of metronomic persistence. \u201cBut now with Willamson in the shed I have this \u201cno idea what is going to happen\u201d uneasy feeling - like there\u2019s a glitch in the matrix. Most unsettling.\u201d ICYMI, here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s wrap of the day two action: Hello and welcome, wherever you are. England have the edge here after two days of play, with Kane Williamson gone for 51 and New Zealand resuming on 144-4, still some 200 runs behind. All that remains is for the tourists to tidy up the tail, then glide into an imperious lead before sunset. Of course, this being The England Cricket Team, nothing could ever be so straightforward. The pendulum has already swung plenty in an evenly-matched affair. A textbook batting collapse surrendered England\u2019s advantage on day two, only for Sam Curran to snatch it back with that precious Williamson wicket. The year\u2019s great sporting rivalry is sure to throw up some more twists and turns yet, and it could easily be the hosts who end up on top at the end of another absorbing day. Whatever happens in this bucolic corner of the planet, which feels like a parallel universe to this Greater London-based nighttime OBOer, it should be a pleasure to watch. Play starts at 11am local, 10pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, says a Chinese spy who has offered a trove of intelligence information to Australia may have \u201ca legitimate claim for asylum\u201d. On Saturday, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age revealed a Chinese spy who claimed to have been involved in political interference in Hong Kong and Taiwan had held a number of meetings with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and was seeking to defect. The spy, Wang \u201cWilliam\u201d Liqiang, is the first Chinese intelligence operative to blow his cover. He has reportedly offered a trove of inside information, including on intelligence operations within Australia. Albanese said the reports were \u201cof real concern\u201d and that he would seek a briefing from security agencies. \u201cWe need to make sure that Australia\u2019s national sovereignty is protected,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will await processes with the government and one of the things that we will be seeking next week is a briefing from the appropriate authorities on these issues.\u201d Asked whether he believed Wang should be offered asylum, Albanese said it would be a decision for the government but that he was \u201csympathetic with the circumstances\u201d. \u201cWe know that he has outlined a range of activities which clearly put him in a circumstance whereby it\u2019s a legitimate claim for asylum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will have appropriate briefings next week in Canberra. \u201cWe support human rights. We are a democracy. We support freedom of expression. And these things need to be dealt with on their merits. And Australia has obligations under the principles of the way that we operate as a democracy.\u201d According to the report in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age, Wang provided a sworn statement to Asio in October stating he had \u201cpersonally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities\u201d. The statement reportedly details efforts to infiltrate Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement, manipulate Taiwan\u2019s elections and information about Chinese intelligence operations in Australia. In interviews with the newspaper, Wang also describes the use of listed companies to fund intelligence operations overseas and claims that the Chinese government has infiltrated major media organisations in Hong Kong. He says he faces certain detention and possible execution if he returns to China. Wang told Nine the Chinese Communist party \u201cinfiltrates all countries in areas such as military, business and culture, in order to achieve its goal\u201d. Wang is currently at an undisclosed location in Sydney on a tourist visa, telling Nine he is seeking urgent protection from the Australian government, a plea he says he has made in multiple meetings with Asio. Senior government minister Josh Frydenberg said the matter was now in the hands of appropriate law enforcement agencies and said he would not comment on individual cases. \u201cBut I would say the government makes no apologies for the strong measures that we have taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place, that we are resourcing our law enforcement intelligence agencies like never before,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday. \u201cWe will always stand up for our national interests, whether it\u2019s on matters of foreign policy, foreign investment or other related issues.\u201d The attempted defection follows a warning from retired Asio chief Duncan Lewis that the Chinese government was seeking to use \u201cinsidious\u201d foreign interference operations to \u201ctake over\u201d Australia\u2019s political system, and was likely to open a new chapter in the already tense relationship between the two countries. Last week two Liberal Party MPs, Andrew Hastie and James Paterson, said the Chinese government had rejected their plans to visit the country on a study tour next month because of objections about their \u201cfrankness about the Chinese Communist party\u201d.

All Mag can do is keep her daughter down to keep her at home, and Hazlehurst launches these attacks with shrewd folksiness. Outside, Ireland is economically depressed, and there\u2019s no work in Leenane; everyone is leaving for London or Boston if they can.

Mag, of course, has no time for those dreams \u2013 she\u2019s completely reliant on Maureen, and treats Maureen\u2019s life as her own.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a wrinkle in the status quo that grows into a tear; for a moment, McDonagh lets in the light. Young Ray Dooley (Shiv Palekar, barrelling through the play with meaty fecklessness) brings a message from his brother Pato \u2013 an invitation for Maureen. A party in town. Mag tries to block the message from reaching Maureen, but reach her it does \u2013 she is furious with her mother but elated for a glimmer of escape \u2013 and as hope blossoms across Stone\u2019s grim, guarded face, all we can feel is dread.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The audience, in concert, heaved held breaths.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paige Rattray directs this production not with a thirst not for blood \u2013 which is easy to do in a black comedy like this, lean into the hideousness \u2013 but for deep, unspeakable vulnerability. Mag and Maureen are still cruel, and Hazlehurst pulls everyone\u2019s strings while barely moving from her chair, but they are lonely and near-forgotten, too, hopeless and helpless and trapped by their need for each other. When affable Pato (Hamish Michael) comes home with Maureen after the party, his tenderness is almost unbearable. There\u2019s no place for it in this cottage, where gentler impulses have dried out into bitterness, sugar turned to salt and forced down the gullet.</p> <p>This is beautiful craft, this Beauty Queen of Leenane. Renee Mulder\u2019s design is detailed, resisting prettiness at every turn; around the cottage, the sky is roiling. Paul Jackson\u2019s lights and Steve Francis\u2019s sound traps in moodiness; the creeping savagery is oppressive, and the only thing that lifts it is Michael\u2019s Pato, that first wavering finger of sunshine after a storm. It\u2019s got no hope of surviving, but it\u2019s there for as long as it can be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"419e7a8b97513138a9d1db8ffcdb31aaf5e9d369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/419e7a8b97513138a9d1db8ffcdb31aaf5e9d369/0_318_1260_1572/802.jpg\" alt=\"Noni Hazlehurst and Yael Stonein Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s The Beauty Queen of Leenane in 2019.\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maureen (Yael Stone) and Mag (Noni Hazlehurst) are trapped in a living purgatory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cast give performances that dig deep and intelligently into character; there\u2019s no easy line reading, no cheap unearned laugh, no slipping into sentimentality. Rattray has attuned them to each other; their frequencies complement and intersect \u2013 Hazlehurst\u2019s cunning, Stone\u2019s volatility, Palekar\u2019s frustration, Michael\u2019s sensitivity. They lift each other up.</p> <p>As her life opens up and then swiftly falls apart, Stone\u2019s Maureen shatters in such an open, bare way that we see every shard splinter and fall. The play is 23 years old now, so its twists aren\u2019t the shock they were once were \u2013 it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll know them walking into the production \u2013 but here, they land like we never saw them coming. In one critical moment that changes everything we think we know, Maureen touches her mother. And Stone makes this small gesture with her hand as she does it \u2013 deliberate, near affectionate \u2013 that seems to break us apart, too. The audience, in concert, heaved held breaths. Some gasped.</p> <p>This is Rattray\u2019s doing more than it is McDonagh\u2019s \u2013 she and her actors have found a new way into The Beauty Queen of Leenane that vibrates on an emotional level: there\u2019s an ugliness to needing and wanting as much as there is grace. The great tragedy here is one of isolation. If Maureen and Mag didn\u2019t live on a steep hill away from town. If the town was thriving. If Maureen\u2019s sisters and their families visited. If Pato wasn\u2019t too shy to reach out to Maureen earlier. If, if, if.</p> <p>But there is no relief, no community, and we are left with this: a mother and a daughter alone, taking turns twisting the knife and twisting underneath it.</p>",

But there\u2019s a wrinkle in the status quo that grows into a tear; for a moment, McDonagh lets in the light. Young Ray Dooley (Shiv Palekar, barrelling through the play with meaty fecklessness) brings a message from his brother Pato \u2013 an invitation for Maureen. A party in town. Mag tries to block the message from reaching Maureen, but reach her it does \u2013 she is furious with her mother but elated for a glimmer of escape \u2013 and as hope blossoms across Stone\u2019s grim, guarded face, all we can feel is dread. Paige Rattray directs this production not with a thirst not for blood \u2013 which is easy to do in a black comedy like this, lean into the hideousness \u2013 but for deep, unspeakable vulnerability. Mag and Maureen are still cruel, and Hazlehurst pulls everyone\u2019s strings while barely moving from her chair, but they are lonely and near-forgotten, too, hopeless and helpless and trapped by their need for each other. When affable Pato (Hamish Michael) comes home with Maureen after the party, his tenderness is almost unbearable. There\u2019s no place for it in this cottage, where gentler impulses have dried out into bitterness, sugar turned to salt and forced down the gullet. This is beautiful craft, this Beauty Queen of Leenane. Renee Mulder\u2019s design is detailed, resisting prettiness at every turn; around the cottage, the sky is roiling. Paul Jackson\u2019s lights and Steve Francis\u2019s sound traps in moodiness; the creeping savagery is oppressive, and the only thing that lifts it is Michael\u2019s Pato, that first wavering finger of sunshine after a storm. It\u2019s got no hope of surviving, but it\u2019s there for as long as it can be. The cast give performances that dig deep and intelligently into character; there\u2019s no easy line reading, no cheap unearned laugh, no slipping into sentimentality. Rattray has attuned them to each other; their frequencies complement and intersect \u2013 Hazlehurst\u2019s cunning, Stone\u2019s volatility, Palekar\u2019s frustration, Michael\u2019s sensitivity. They lift each other up. As her life opens up and then swiftly falls apart, Stone\u2019s Maureen shatters in such an open, bare way that we see every shard splinter and fall. The play is 23 years old now, so its twists aren\u2019t the shock they were once were \u2013 it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll know them walking into the production \u2013 but here, they land like we never saw them coming. In one critical moment that changes everything we think we know, Maureen touches her mother. And Stone makes this small gesture with her hand as she does it \u2013 deliberate, near affectionate \u2013 that seems to break us apart, too. The audience, in concert, heaved held breaths. Some gasped. This is Rattray\u2019s doing more than it is McDonagh\u2019s \u2013 she and her actors have found a new way into The Beauty Queen of Leenane that vibrates on an emotional level: there\u2019s an ugliness to needing and wanting as much as there is grace. The great tragedy here is one of isolation. If Maureen and Mag didn\u2019t live on a steep hill away from town. If the town was thriving. If Maureen\u2019s sisters and their families visited. If Pato wasn\u2019t too shy to reach out to Maureen earlier. If, if, if. But there is no relief, no community, and we are left with this: a mother and a daughter alone, taking turns twisting the knife and twisting underneath it.",

Horowitz</strong>, uncovered errors and omissions in documents related to the wiretapping of a former Trump campaign adviser, <strong>Carter Page</strong> \u2014 including that a low-level lawyer, <strong>Kevin Clinesmith</strong>, altered an email that officials used to prepare to seek court approval to renew the wiretap, the people said. ...<br></p> \n   <p>More broadly, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report, to be made public on Dec. 9, portrays the overall effort to seek the wiretap order and its renewals as sloppy and unprofessional, according to the people familiar with it. He will also sharply criticize as careless one of the F.B.I. case agents in New York handling the matter, they said.</p> \n   <p>At the same time, however, the report debunks a series of conspiracy theories and insinuations about the F.B.I. that Mr. Trump and his allies have put forward over the past two years, the people said, though they cautioned that the report is not complete. The New York Times has not reviewed the draft, which could contain other significant findings.</p> \n   <p>In particular, while Mr. Horowitz criticizes F.B.I. leadership for its handling of the highly fraught Russia investigation in some ways, he made no finding of politically biased actions by top officials Mr. Trump has vilified like the former F.B.I. director <strong>James B.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me! Thanks for joining us for this momentous week in US politics. Here are the biggest stories of the day: Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, would not rule out the possibility of additional public impeachment hearings as his panel begins to draft its report on the inquiry. Trump said in a Fox and Friends interview that he wants a trial in the impeachment inquiry, which would require the House to impeach him first. The president argued a trial would allow him to call Schiff and the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the inquiry as witnesses. As Trump\u2019s Republican allies air baseless claims that Ukraine may have meddled in the 2016 election, a report emerged that senators were recently recently on a Russian disinformation campaign to blame Kyiv for its own election interference. The justice department inspector general\u2019s widely anticipated report on the origins of the Russia investigation is expected to criticize lower-level FBI officials while debunking the president\u2019s claims that senior leaders\u2019 anti-Trump bias affected their handling of the probe. Joe Biden said his former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham should be \u201cembarrassed\u201d for his role defending Trump against the impeachment inquiry. Michael Bloomberg is preparing to launch his presidential campaign with a huge ad blitz. If there\u2019s one thing that Bloomberg\u2019s entrance into this race portends, it\u2019s more discussion about billionaires and money in politics. Followers of Michael Bloomberg\u2019s mayoralty in New York City may remember the billionaire\u2019s attempts to speak Spanish during important announcements and natural disasters \u2013 and the parody Twitter account, @ElBloombito, that it inspired. So eyebrows were certainly raised when El Bloombito appeared to get bumped off as Bloomberg began his presidential campaign. But worry not! According to BuzzFeed News editor Mat Honan, it\u2019s all just an error on Twitter\u2019s side. The Republican National Committee spent nearly $100,000 on copies of Donald Trump Jr\u2019s book, the New York Times reports, citing campaign finance disclosures. The book, Triggered, appeared at No 1 on the New York Times bestseller list when it debuted, but was marked with a dagger symbol that the Times uses to indicate that a title\u2019s sales benefited from bulk orders. Trump Jr has repeatedly criticized Hunter Biden for benefiting from nepotism. Bernie Sanders has expressed his \u201cdisgust\u201d with Bloomberg\u2019s massive ad buy. Hi everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, picking up the blog for the final stretch of this incredibly eventful week. Michael Bloomberg is preparing to launch an extraordinary ad blitz, according to reports. New York Times reporter Astead Wesley has a source suggesting Bloomberg\u2019s initial $31m spend on one week of advertising could be \u201cjust the beginning\u201d, with the billionaire prepared to spend between $500m to $1bn. That\u2019s it from me after another very eventful week in Washington. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, would not rule out the possibility of additional public impeachment hearings as his panel begins to draft its report on the inquiry. Trump said in a Fox and Friends interview that he wants a trial in the impeachment inquiry, which would require the House to impeach him first. The president argued a trial would allow him to call Schiff and the whistleblower whose complaint initiated the inquiry as witnesses. As Trump\u2019s Republican allies air baseless claims that Ukraine may have meddled in the 2016 election, a report emerged that senators were recently recently on a Russian disinformation campaign to blame Kyiv for its own election interference. The justice department inspector general\u2019s widely anticipated report on the origins of the Russia investigation is expected to criticize lower-level FBI officials while debunking the president\u2019s claims that senior leaders\u2019 anti-Trump bias affected their handling of the probe. Joe Biden said his former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham should be \u201cembarrassed\u201d for his role defending Trump against the impeachment inquiry. Julia will have much more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Buckle up because more public impeachment hearings could be on the way. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, would not rule out the possibility of additional hearings as his panel drafts its report in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe\u2019re not foreclosing the possibility of additional depositions or hearings, but we\u2019re also not willing to wait months and months and let them play rope-a-dope with us in the courts,\u201d Schiff told the LA Times. But the California Democrat would not weigh in on when the committee might release its report or whether he believes articles of impeachment against Trump are merited. John Bolton has provided more details on how he allegedly wrested back control of his personal Twitter account from the White House after his September departure. According to the former national security adviser, the White House never handed the account back to Bolton. Instead, the fomer official allegedly had to rely on Twiter\u2019s community standards to regain access. The Justice Department inspector general has reportedly concluded that the FBI\u2019s senior leadership did not act out of anti-Trump bias in its handling of the Russia investigation, although the IG criticiczed some lower-level officials\u2019 actions at the onset of the probe. The New York Times reports: Investigators for the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, uncovered errors and omissions in documents related to the wiretapping of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page \u2014 including that a low-level lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, altered an email that officials used to prepare to seek court approval to renew the wiretap, the people said. ... More broadly, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report, to be made public on Dec. 9, portrays the overall effort to seek the wiretap order and its renewals as sloppy and unprofessional, according to the people familiar with it. He will also sharply criticize as careless one of the F.B.I. case agents in New York handling the matter, they said. At the same time, however, the report debunks a series of conspiracy theories and insinuations about the F.B.I. that Mr. Trump and his allies have put forward over the past two years, the people said, though they cautioned that the report is not complete. The New York Times has not reviewed the draft, which could contain other significant findings. In particular, while Mr. Horowitz criticizes F.B.I. leadership for its handling of the highly fraught Russia investigation in some ways, he made no finding of politically biased actions by top officials Mr. Trump has vilified like the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy who temporarily ran the bureau after the president fired Mr. Comey in 2017; and Peter Strzok, a former top counterintelligence agent. Trump will likely latch on to some of the IG\u2019s findings to again claim the existence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d working against his presidency. However, if history is any indication, Trump is unlikely to abandon his accusation that top FBI officials were acting out of bias against him, despite the IG\u2019s conclusions. In his CNN interview set to air tonight, Joe Biden also mocked the newly formed presidential campaigns of Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick. \u201cCome on. I welcome the competition,\u201d Biden told Don Lemon. \u201cThe idea that I\u2019m not in better shape than Mayor Bloomberg, physically and otherwise?\u201d \u201dLook, this -- Trump is so bad as a President, and so corrupt as a president, that everybody in America who has ever been involved in politics, especially if they have a billion dollars, thinks they could beat Trump. Maybe they could,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cAnd so what do you have to do? I\u2019m the guy sitting on the top of the pyramid. I get it. I\u2019m a big boy. Never complain, never explain.\u201d Biden also jabbed Patrick for canceling an event at Morehouse College after only two people showed up for it. \u201cI like Deval. I really do. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a solid guy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut I think this is about deciding who is ready for day one to unite this country and demonstrate that they could, and number two, who in fact is ready on day one to be commander-in-chief.\u201d Joe Biden had harsh words for his former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham, who has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most prominenet defenders against the House impeachment inquiry. \u201cLindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he\u2019s going to regret his whole life,\u201d Biden in a CNN interview. \u201cI say Lindsey, I just -- I\u2019m just embarrassed by what you\u2019re doing, for you. I mean, my Lord.\u201d Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, requested documents this week about Joe and Hunter Biden, apparently following through on Trump\u2019s request to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the former vice president and his son. \u201cI am disappointed, and quite frankly I\u2019m angered, by the fact -- he knows me; he knows my son; he knows there\u2019s nothing to this,\u201d Biden said of Graham. \u201cTrump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t yield to. The Ukrainians would not yield to, quote, \u2018investigate Biden\u2019 -- there\u2019s nothing to investigate about Biden or his son.\u201d John Hendrickson, who wrote the incredible Atlantic article on Joe Biden\u2019s history with stuttering, said in an MSNBC interview that he has received dozens of emails thanking him for exploring the topic. Hendrickson, who also stutters, said it was his \u201cnightmare\u201d to be doing a television interview and acknowledged he admired Biden for for participating in presidential debates despite his history of stuttering. \u201cI admire his courage,\u201d Hendrickson said. If you haven\u2019t read Hendrickson\u2019s piece yet, it\u2019s well worth your time. Here is an excerpt: Maybe you\u2019ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like [the July debate] in Detroit, Biden\u2019s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters\u2014if slightly\u2014on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. Before addressing the debate specifically, I mention what I\u2019ve just heard. \u2018I want to ask you, as, you know, a \u2026 stutterer to, uh, to a \u2026 stutterer. When you were \u2026 talking a couple minutes ago, it, it seemed to \u2026 my ear, my eye \u2026 did you have \u2026 trouble on s? Or on \u2026 m?\u2019 Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. \u2018But, you know, I haven\u2019t stuttered in so long that it\u2019s hhhhard for me to remember the specific\u2014\u2019 He pauses. \u2018What I do remember is the feeling.\u2019 As the vaping roundtable was wrapping up, Trump was asked whether he intended to vote for the bill meant to support Hong Kong protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s being sent over. We\u2019re going to take a very good look at it,\u201d Trump told reporters. But the president suggested during his \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview this morning that he may veto the legislation. \u201cWe have to stand with Hong Kong, but I\u2019m also standing with President Xi [Jinping],\u201d Trump said. \u201cI stand with all of the things that we want to do, but we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history. And if we could do that, that would be great.\u201d The comment sparked at least one warning from a Republican senator who supported the legislation, Ted Cruz. Without mentioning Trump\u2019s name, the Texas Republican predicted the legislation would become law regardless because it passed both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities. Trump is currently having a lively debate about vaping in the cabinet room, discussing a potential flavor ban with industry executives and (surprisingly) senator Mitt Romney. The rountable discussion comes less than a week after the New York Times reported Trump was abandoning the flavor ban he had proposed two months earlier after advisers warned him the policy could have negative political repercussions. According to the pool report, Trump raised concerns that a flavor ban could lead to a rise in black market products with fewer safety restrictions. Romney chimed in that only younger vaping customers used flavored products, which the executives contradicted. The Utah senator then complainted about one vaping company creating a flavor called \u201cunicorn poop\u201d to appeal to children, and a Google search revealed that yes, such a product does indeed exist. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has a long way to go with black voters if he wants to win the Democratic nomination, and he just suffered another defeat in that department. Oliver Davis, the longest-serving African American man on the South Bend, Indiana, Common Council, announced he is endorsing Joe Biden for president -- even though Buttigieg is the mayor of his city. \u201cIn times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it\u2019s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,\u201d Davis said in a statement released by the Biden campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am very pleased to support Vice President Joe Biden to be our next President of the United States of America.\u201d Davis also criticized Buttigieg for struggling to connect with voters of color. \u201cFor us, this has been a consistent issue that has not gone away,\u201d Davis told Politico. Buttigieg has surged in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, he is hitting close to 0% with black voters in South Carolina, the first southern state of the Democratic primary. Buttigieg will need to win over non-white voters if he wants a shot at the nomination, and currently Biden is the only candidate attracting consisent support from black Democrats. Trump\u2019s Republican allies on the House intelligence committee have used the public impeachment hearings to air baseless allegations that Ukraine may have meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The US intelligence community has thoroughly confirmed it was Russia that inteference in the 2016 election, and senior intelligence officials reportedly informed senators in a recent briefing that the Kremlin has led a disinformation campaign to blame Ukraine for the meddling. The New York Times reports: The Republican defense of Mr. Trump became central to the impeachment proceedings when Fiona Hill, a respected Russia scholar and former senior White House official, added a harsh critique during testimony on Thursday. She told some of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders in Congress that they were repeating \u2018a fictional narrative\u2019 \u2014 and that it likely came from a disinformation campaign by Russian security services, which themselves propagated it. In a briefing that closely aligned with Dr. Hill\u2019s testimony, American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow\u2019s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials. The briefing came as Republicans stepped up their defenses of Mr. Trump in the Ukraine affair. When John Bolton first started tweeting this morning about regaining access to his Twitter account, the national security council declined to comment on the former Trump official\u2019s renewed social media presence. The former national security adviser may simply be trying to attract attention before releasing his new book, which he signed a deal for earlier this month. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who resigned (or was fired, depending on who you ask) in September, is offering more details on the resurrection of his Twitter account. Bolton took to Twitter in September to claim that he had not been fired, as Trump claimed, but had instead offered his resignation as he and the president increasinly diverged on foreign policy. But his Twitter account has been conspicuously silent since then, prompting questions about why Bolton was not offering more details on his departure. The former official now says the White House blocked access to his personal Twitter account after he left the administration. Happy Friday, live blog readers! This is Joanie Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt. Among Trump\u2019s many complaints during his morning \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview was that Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, allegedly took more than a year to hang his official picture up at the Kyiv embassy. However, a member of the longtime diplomat\u2019s legal team has now chimed in to deny Trump\u2019s claim, asserting Yovanovitch hung the photos of the president, vice president and secretary of state \u201cas soon as they arrived\u201d at the embassy. \u2022Donald Trump addressed the issue of impeachment this morning, claiming: \u201cI want a trial.\u201d A trial in the Senate is the next step should the House vote to impeach the Trump. \u2022Trump expressed his desire during a bizarre, near hour-long interview on Fox &amp; Friends. Trump also said his own EU ambassador\u2019s sworn testimony on Wednesday hearing was \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d. \u2022Elsewhere in his Fox &amp; Friends appearance Trump said people had praised former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch because \u201cshe\u2019s a woman, you have to be nice\u201d, and described Rudy Giuliani as \u201cone of the great crime fighters of all time\u201d. \u2022In other news, former national security adviser John Bolton has sparked intrigue by returning to Twitter. Bolton, who Democrats are keen to hear from as part of the impeachment inquiry, said he was \u201cglad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned........\u201d Elizabeth Warren has announced three female, first-term members of Congress as her campaign co-chairs. Deb Haaland, Katie Porter and Ayanna Pressley were all elected in 2018. Haaland is one of the first two Native American women to be elected to Congress, Pressley is a Squad member who has been attacked by Donald Trump, and Porter studied law under Warren at Harvard. Time for some Democrat news! Amy Klobuchar, campaigning in New Hampshire today, has been scooping up staff from the embers of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential campaign. Klobuchar, undeterred by polls showing she has just 1.5% support nationally, has hired Marina Negroponte to serve as her Nevada state director, and Cameron Miller to serve as her Nevada political director, according to Associated Press. Nevada votes third in the Democratic primaries. Klobuchar is polling better in the state than she is nationally, at 2% of the vote. Pete Buttigieg, flying high in the Iowa polls, flying low in states which have a significant population of people of color, has had his South Bend office taken over by protesters this morning. Garrett Blad, from the Sunrise Movement climate organization, says the occupation is to urge Buttigieg to adopt a Green New Deal for South Bend. The Washington Post just posted this TikTok showing Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker assaulting a man in an airport: (I\u2019m kidding, it\u2019s not assault, it\u2019s clearly staged.) Shephard Smith, the former Fox News anchor who resigned in October, is to donate $500,000 to a non-profit press freedom group, according to the New York Times. For years Smith was one of the few centrist journalists on Fox News, sometimes clashing with the network\u2019s right-wing hosts. The Times reported that Smith pledged the $500,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists while speaking at the group\u2019s annual dinner in Manhattan. \u201cWe know that journalists are sometimes wary of being perceived as activists for some cause,\u201d the Times reported Smith as saying. \u201cBut press freedom is not the preserve of one political group or one political party. It\u2019s a value embedded in our very foundational documents. Journalists need to join hands to defend it.\u201d The Trump administration is withholding more than $100 million in US military assistance to Lebanon, according to Associated Press \u2013 aid that has been approved by Congress and is favored by his national security team. From AP: It\u2019s an assertion of control of foreign aid similar to the delay in support for Ukraine that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. State Department and Pentagon officials and lawmakers have been complaining about it for weeks, according to officials. The $105 million in Foreign Military Funding for the Lebanese Armed Forces has languished for months, awaiting approval from the Office of Management and Budget. This is despite the congressional approval, an early September notification to lawmakers that it would be spent and overwhelming support for it from the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council. John Bolton, former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has posted a couple of cryptic messages on Twitter this morning. Bolton\u2019s name has come up often recently during the House impeachment inquiry. Yesterday Fiona Hill, a former national security official, said Bolton had described Rudy Giuliani as a \u201chand grenade that was going to blow everyone up\u201d. The accounts of Hill and others have put Bolton at the center of the controversy, and have intensified calls for him to come forward and give his version of events. Before today Bolton\u2019s most recent tweet was on September 10, when he said he had offered his resignation to Trump. Trump later claimed he had fired Bolton. Earlier this month Bolton\u2019s lawyer said the former adviser has \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of meetings and conversations \u201cthat have not yet been discussed in testimonies thus far\u201d. Bolton is reportedly refusing to testify until a judge rules in a case between the House committees and the Trump administration. Bolton signed a book deal \u2013 reportedly worth $2m \u2013 after leaving the White House. As yet there is no release date. The under-fire White House adviser Stephen Miller said in a 2016 radio interview that immigration could see America lose its sovereignty and be \u201cdecimated\u201d, echoing racist and white nationalist themes at the heart of a current scandal that has seen growing demands for him to resign. In the 17-minute radio interview with Breitbart in February of that year, Miller claimed that Obama-era trade and immigration policies, which had bipartisan support, would \u201cdecimate\u201d the US, give amnesty to dangerous immigrants, and end US sovereignty. Miller claimed \u201cthe sovereign powers of the United States have been bled away\u201d in the interview with Breitbart\u2019s then executive chairman, Steve Bannon. Miller\u2019s extreme language in public is under renewed scrutiny following a series of reports by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that revealed how leaked emails showed the White House aide espousing white nationalist views and injecting that agenda into Breitbart. More than 80 members of Congress, 55 civil rights groups and Democratic presidential candidates have demanded Miller resign in response to the leaked emails. President Donald Trump is still promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s evidence-free claim came a day after former White House security adviser Fiona Hill called the Ukraine interference theory a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d. Here\u2019s the clip: Barack Obama has warned Democrats against adopting \u201cpurity tests\u201d in the primary race, saying the party needs to be able to appeal to a wide range of voters. Speaking at a question-and-answer session with DNC chair Tom Perez in California, Obama said: \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything.\u201d He added: \u201cWhich is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.\u201d Obama praised the historic diversity of the Democratic field \u2013 which includes five women, and has three black candidates, a Latino man, an Asian-American man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation\u2019s first black president. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election just like I did,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate: \u2018Look, I\u2019m part of an American tradition ... of opening up opportunity.\u201d Another extraordinary moment: Trump insisting that he wants to go on trial \u2013 ie he wants to be impeached. The president complained that Republicans couldn\u2019t call witnesses during the House impeachment hearings, and suggested a trial would enable him to quiz the whistleblower and House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff. \u201cWe wanna call the whistleblower. But you know who I want as the first witness, because frankly, I want a trial,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou want a trial?\u201d Fox &amp; Friends host Brian Kilmeade asked incredulously. \u201cOh I would ...\u201d Trump said, before trailing off and then beginning an attack on Schiff. Here\u2019s the clip: Well that interview was unusual. Even by Trump\u2019s standards. The president actually sounded quite tired at the beginning, but whipped himself up pretty quickly as he rattled through a range of topics. One thing Trump was particularly animated about was Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Government officials have lined up to praise Yovanovitch, who Trump recalled from her role, over the past two weeks. But to Trump\u2019s mind, she was simply benefitting from sexism. Trump was particularly upset about Yovanovitch allegedly taking too long to hang his picture up in the US embassy. He mentioned it (at least) three times: Trump attacked Yovanovitch on Twitter as she was giving testimony last week. Speaking about Trump\u2019s smears against her Yovanovitch told the House intelligence committee: \u201cthe effect is intimidating\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to live coverage of today\u2019s political news. Donald Trump has had quite a morning of it already. The president called into Fox &amp; Friends for an extraordinary, at times bizarre, 55-minute interview during which Trump: \u2022Reiterated the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election \u2022Said his own EU ambassador\u2019s sworn testimony was \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d \u2022Called Nancy Pelosi \u201ccrazy as a bedbug\u201d \u2022Suggested he wanted to be impeached, saying: \u201cI want a trial\u201d \u2022Complained that former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch took too long to hang his picture in the Ukraine embassy \u2022Said people praised Yovanovitch \u2013 a highly regarded official \u2013 because \u201cshe\u2019s a woman, you have to be nice\u201d \u2022Described Rudy Giuliani as \u201cone of the great crime fighters of all time\u201d The Fox &amp; Friends hosts were largely bystanders during what effectively became a Trump monologue. Trump sounded slightly hoarse as he ran through some of his greatest hits: his 2016 election victory, how much he has invested in the military and the highly dubious claim that \u201cno one\u201d has done as much during their first term. We\u2019ll get some video clips up shortly. It really was something to behold. In other political news ... the Democratic candidates are fanned out around the key primary states today \u2013 no rest for the wicked, etc. Each of them will be out hassling potential voters in their own unique ways. Iowans can look out for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, while those in New Hampshire are treated to Tulsi Gabbard, Cory Booker, Bill Weld and Amy Klobuchar. Andrew Yang, and presumably his Gang, is in South Carolina; Marianne Williamson, who apparently is still running, is in Arkansas for some reason; and Joe Walsh, ploughing a lonely furrow in his Republican primary bid against Trump, is in Texas.",

With the benefit of hindsight I guess the win at Sheffield United looks better than the run-of-the-mill victory against a newly promoted side it felt like at the time. An entertaining game (much better than the 1-0 scoreline suggests), a clean sheet and a Goal of the Month winner.</p> <p><strong>And the worst? </strong>Leicester: pathetic from first whistle to last. The sum total of three fouls in the entire 90 minutes is probably the most eye-opening stat. That and the nine goals.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>He\u2019s playing a mediocre hand pretty badly. Chopping and changing the defence, playing players out of position \u2026 if we were to have one whole match with square pegs in square holes, I think we\u2019d actually stand a chance.</p> <p><strong>Why I love \u2026 Sofiane Boufal </strong>Genuinely exciting. He\u2019ll take on players, then beat them again just for good measure. Some say that\u2019s frustrating, but with such slim pickings we\u2019ll take what entertainment we can get.</p> <p><strong>What is \u201cthe Southampton way\u201d? </strong>Buying bang average players, giving them more money than their talents deserve, and then not being able to sell them on because of that salary. Yeah, this has all gone south pretty quickly\u2026</p> <p><strong>Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? </strong>A defender with stature. Van Dijk \u2013 if he bothered to put in more than 10% effort this time \u2013 or Dean Richards.</p> <p><strong>How are you feeling about VAR? </strong>Perhaps our one success story this season. By my reckoning, opponents have had six goals disallowed. But, quite frankly, nobody should be remotely surprised that Mike Riley is making a complete pig\u2019s ear of how it\u2019s implemented in this country. The staggering arrogance of PGMOL to think that they can do it their own way without properly testing rather than do it the same way everyone else across the world has been using it is incredible.</p> <p><strong>Funniest moment so far \u2026 </strong>At Fratton Park, an upset Pompey fan getting involved in a full Benny Hill chase with stewards round the North Stand.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Steve Grant </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-624988137\" title=\"\">Total Saints Podcast</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveGrant1983\" title=\"\">@SteveGrant1983</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d6f82ee58f87ddc07f03ef17f84ea014e27dfcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6f82ee58f87ddc07f03ef17f84ea014e27dfcd/0_123_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sofiane Boufal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sofiane Boufal: genuinely exciting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tottenham</h2> <p><strong>Best performance? </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/06/red-star-belgrade-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">4-0 win in Belgrade</a>.

Not least because it hasn\u2019t (yet) been tarnished by anything that followed. Honourable mention for the draw at Spurs, which deserved rather more.</p> <p><strong>And the worst? </strong>Being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">caned 8-0 at Manchester City</a>. A perfect storm of unfavourable circumstance, from the early undefendable opener to the fragile confidence of the side, to the ghosts of the Cup final. A long way back from that.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>Flores was brought in to sort the defence and has certainly done that \u2013 if we\u2019re not quite miserly then we\u2019re certainly credible. Three goals shipped in five now, a dodgy one at Spurs and two to free-scoring Chelsea. What we need now is a goal threat. Troy returning will help, with Sarr and Welbeck to come.</p> <p><strong>Why I love \u2026 Daryl Janmaat </strong>Has kept his chin up when others\u2019 have dropped. A rhinoceros of a right-back.</p> <p><strong>What is \u201cthe Watford way\u201d? </strong>On the pitch there have been many different Watford ways, and more than one successful.

It looked like Anderson, Lanzini, Haller and Yarmolenko would trouble a lot of teams and we could have a shot at the top six. Sadly it\u2019s been downhill ever since.</p> <p><strong>And the worst? </strong>The home defeat to Newcastle. Roberto was at fault for two goals, poor old Zabaleta got embarrassed for speed by Saint-Maximin and we let Voldemort/Shelvey score. Burnley away was almost as bad.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>He\u2019s been unlucky to lose Fabianski, but is increasingly under pressure. Is he worth his \u00a38m a year? He needs to deliver some rollickings, find a decent reserve goalkeeper, stabilise a dodgy defence, get Haller firing again, restore Anderson\u2019s confidence and find a role for Fornals.</p> <p><strong>Why I love \u2026 Lucasz Fabianski </strong>With every game Roberto plays, Fabianski looks better and better.</p> <p><strong>What is \u201cthe West Ham way\u201d? </strong>Playing attacking football, beating good teams, losing to bad teams, and being terrorised by Chris Wood.</p> <p><strong>Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? </strong>A rampaging Billy Bonds. He\u2019d gee up our side of fancy dan playmakers.</p> <p><strong>How are you feeling about VAR? </strong>There\u2019s no common sense. Refs should go to the monitors themselves.

I\u2019ve never seen us look so bad at the back under Nuno.</p> <p><strong>Happy with the manager? </strong>It\u2019s amazing that he\u2019s taken some flak from some Wolves fans after a couple of defeats.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City Best performance? By default, probably the 8-0 win over Watford \u2013 but we played our best football against Spurs in that (incredibly unjust) 2-2 draw at home. We tore them apart. And the worst? The 2-0 loss at home against Wolves. Shambolic defending, misplaced passes, individual errors \u2013 that performance had it all. Happy with the manager? Despite the three losses, Pep hasn\u2019t done too much wrong \u2013 other than the team selection against Wolves, and failing to sign a centre-half in the summer. Lots of City fans will point at Txiki and say he\u2019s the one responsible for recruitment, but Pep still has ultimate sign-off. He could have developed the team more, too: David Silva has played too often; Foden hasn\u2019t played nearly enough. Why I love \u2026 Ederson Not only is he the best keeper with his feet I think we\u2019ve ever seen, he\u2019s a world\u2011class shot-stopper too. His saves against West Ham and Everton were incredible. How we could have done with him at Anfield \u2026 What is \u201cthe City way\u201d? Never being afraid of taking risks. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Vincent Kompany. How are you feeling about VAR? It\u2019s managed to make everything worse. In its current iteration, it\u2019s an absolute shambles. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Pep\u2019s antics on the touchline at Anfield. \u2022 Lloyd Scragg NinetyThreeTwenty.com @lloyd_scragg Manchester United Best performance? Brighton at home. Fast, entertaining \u2013 we could have hit them for six if our finishing was better. And the worst? Newcastle away. We saw plenty of the ball but still couldn\u2019t break down a really average team. Happy with the manager? We know how Ole wants to set up, but the squad lacks quality and leadership. His next two transfer windows will be pivotal. Why I love \u2026 Daniel James Such a positive impact: definitely the bargain of the season. There\u2019s so much more to his game than just pace. What is \u201cthe Manchester United way\u201d? Attacking football and developing young players. Both are slowly returning. Hopefully Ole will be given time and resources: some Reds forget how dull the football was here under Mourinho. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Sir Alex would get the best out of this bunch, and deal with the overblown egos. As Roy Keane said in April, there are still too many \u201cbluffers\u201d: Fergie would never have tolerated them. How are you feeling about VAR? We\u2019ve benefited from it this season but it kills the atmosphere. I\u2019m not a fan. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Pep Guardiola\u2019s two-finger dance at Anfield. \u2022 Shaun O\u2019Donnell Observer reader Newcastle Best performance? The win over Man United: organised, determined, gritty. Matty Longstaff\u2019s fairytale winner reminded us how magical football can be. And the worst? The 3-1 defeat to Norwich. It was shambolic and aimless, the antithesis of Ben\u00edtez-style football. Happy with the manager? It was hard to have confidence in Bruce after that Norwich defeat and truly awful showings against Brighton and Wolves, but there have been positives, too. And he\u2019s not to blame for our chronic lack of investment in the final third. Why I love \u2026 Allan Saint-Maximin The jury\u2019s out on his end product but he definitely gets fans off their seats. What is \u201cthe Newcastle way\u201d? Fast-flowing, scintillating football with a talismanic striker banging in the goals. We\u2019re a long way from that. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Kevin Keegan: player/manager, ideally. A man who could galvanise an entire city, never mind just a football club. How are you feeling about VAR? It\u2019s been positive for us, so fine \u2013 but it\u2019s hardly been a seamless introduction. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Matt \u201cRadgie\u201d Ritchie congratulating Christian Atsu for a fine interception by booting him up the backside. \u2022 David and Richard Holmes Observer readers Norwich Best performance? The win against Manchester City: the obvious pick of a fairly rotten bunch. To think we went home from that so full of belief and hope \u2026 And the worst? A few to choose from, but it has to be the 2-0 home defeat by Watford. The 5-1 by Villa runs it close but against the Hornets we were so devoid of confidence, ideas and belief. Happy with the manager? Farke has done OK with the hand he\u2019s been dealt. A horrendous injury crisis has limited his options, as did the lowest Premier League transfer kitty known to man. Why I love \u2026 Tim Krul A leader, a mentor to our youngsters and a shot-stopper extraordinaire. What is \u201cthe Norwich way\u201d? Patient, progressive, passing football. The official \u201cmission\u201d is to serve fans and the community, and it does that well. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Darren Huckerby, in his pomp, roaring down that left wing. If you can arrange that, that\u2019d be awesome. How are you feeling about VAR? I\u2019m fine with the principle but not the way it\u2019s being used. \u201cClear and obvious\u201d has to be the bottom line and the decisions have to be owned by the ref and not Stockley Park. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Guardiola thanking Michael Oliver \u201csooo much\u201d at Anfield. \u2022 Gary Gowers NorwichCity.myfootballwriter.com @gary_gowers Sheffield United Best performance? The demolition of Burnley: our most complete performance. They didn\u2019t have a sniff and we cut through them at will. And the worst? The 0-0 draw at Watford was a grind, although the home defeat to Southampton hasn\u2019t aged well. Happy with the manager? Wilder\u2019s stock just keeps rising. He\u2019s a major part of our great start to this season. Why I love \u2026 David McGoldrick Still waiting for that first top-flight goal, but he\u2019s a dream to watch. His ability to drop into midfield areas and allow other players to burst past him have caused havoc for more than a few opponents. What is \u201cthe Sheffield United way\u201d? Blending tactical and positional fluidity \u2013 yes, there\u2019s our left wing-back playing centre-forward \u2013 with never-say-die defending. It\u2019s what got us promoted and it\u2019s why we have 17 points after 12 games. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? One of my only regrets is that we never got to see Harry Maguire powering down the wing in Wilder\u2019s side. How are you feeling about VAR? Even accepting that its decisions are correct, it\u2019s an awful experience. There have been times where I\u2019ve barely celebrated goals because the referee\u2019s immediate signal is something needs to be checked. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Making pundits look silly. We were told we \u201cweren\u2019t taking the Premier League seriously\u201d, that our style would be \u201cannihilated,\u201d and that we\u2019d be \u201cworse than Huddersfield\u201d. So far \u2026 not so much. And our reply to Liverpool fans boasting about European success raised a few smiles, too: \u201cChampions of League One, you\u2019ll never sing that.\u201d \u2022 Ben Meakin UpTheBlades.com @bladespod Southampton Best performance? A limited pool to choose from. With the benefit of hindsight I guess the win at Sheffield United looks better than the run-of-the-mill victory against a newly promoted side it felt like at the time. An entertaining game (much better than the 1-0 scoreline suggests), a clean sheet and a Goal of the Month winner. And the worst? Leicester: pathetic from first whistle to last. The sum total of three fouls in the entire 90 minutes is probably the most eye-opening stat. That and the nine goals. Happy with the manager? He\u2019s playing a mediocre hand pretty badly. Chopping and changing the defence, playing players out of position \u2026 if we were to have one whole match with square pegs in square holes, I think we\u2019d actually stand a chance. Why I love \u2026 Sofiane Boufal Genuinely exciting. He\u2019ll take on players, then beat them again just for good measure. Some say that\u2019s frustrating, but with such slim pickings we\u2019ll take what entertainment we can get. What is \u201cthe Southampton way\u201d? Buying bang average players, giving them more money than their talents deserve, and then not being able to sell them on because of that salary. Yeah, this has all gone south pretty quickly\u2026 Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? A defender with stature. Van Dijk \u2013 if he bothered to put in more than 10% effort this time \u2013 or Dean Richards. How are you feeling about VAR? Perhaps our one success story this season. By my reckoning, opponents have had six goals disallowed. But, quite frankly, nobody should be remotely surprised that Mike Riley is making a complete pig\u2019s ear of how it\u2019s implemented in this country. The staggering arrogance of PGMOL to think that they can do it their own way without properly testing rather than do it the same way everyone else across the world has been using it is incredible. Funniest moment so far \u2026 At Fratton Park, an upset Pompey fan getting involved in a full Benny Hill chase with stewards round the North Stand. \u2022 Steve Grant Total Saints Podcast @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham Best performance? The 4-0 win in Belgrade. It felt like a new beginning. And the worst? After a hairline VAR decision had ruled out a deserved Sheffield United equaliser in Poch\u2019s final game, our players let them amble the length of the pitch to score another. Shocking. Happy with the manager? The run to the Champions League final glossed over the need for a major reboot \u2013 but whether Mourinho is the right man for the job is the subject of heated debate. No trophy for Poch but oh, what a journey. We are bereft. Why I love \u2026 Danny Rose Always gives everything. And the fans will never forget that volleyed screamer against Arsenal on full debut back in 2010. What is \u201cthe Tottenham way\u201d? Ah, glory, glory; \u201cdoing things in style, with a flourish\u201d. And if we can marry that with some hard-nosed pragmatism and a title or two, then hallelujah! Over to you Jos\u00e9. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Dave Mackay \u2013 described by George Best as his hardest opponent. How are you feeling about VAR? Takes too long, keeps fans in the dark and decisions are still suspect. Whatever happened to \u201cclear and obvious\u201d? Funniest moment so far \u2026 Shortly after posting news of Poch\u2019s sacking, the club website crashed. \u201dAn unexpected error seems to have occurred,\u201d it said. Indeed. \u2022 Richard Barnes @barnesrichard Watford Best performance? Not a wide range to choose from, but the win at Norwich being, you know, a win and everything has to be the highlight to date. Not least because it hasn\u2019t (yet) been tarnished by anything that followed. Honourable mention for the draw at Spurs, which deserved rather more. And the worst? Being caned 8-0 at Manchester City. A perfect storm of unfavourable circumstance, from the early undefendable opener to the fragile confidence of the side, to the ghosts of the Cup final. A long way back from that. Happy with the manager? Flores was brought in to sort the defence and has certainly done that \u2013 if we\u2019re not quite miserly then we\u2019re certainly credible. Three goals shipped in five now, a dodgy one at Spurs and two to free-scoring Chelsea. What we need now is a goal threat. Troy returning will help, with Sarr and Welbeck to come. Why I love \u2026 Daryl Janmaat Has kept his chin up when others\u2019 have dropped. A rhinoceros of a right-back. What is \u201cthe Watford way\u201d? On the pitch there have been many different Watford ways, and more than one successful. Off the pitch it\u2019s defined by representing and being part of the community, and yes, we\u2019re doing that very well. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Some of Luther Blissett\u2019s bloody mindedness up front would be helpful. How are you feeling about VAR? Tired. \u201cGetting decisions right\u201d has always been secondary to not screwing up the game in the process for me, and the latter always felt likely. Funniest moment so far \u2026 The relative failures of the likes of United and Spurs \u2013 though I\u2019d almost rather they started stuffing people to separate out the morass of averageness in mid-table. We need some poor teams to chase. \u2022 Matt Rowson BHappy.wordpress.com @mattrowson West Ham Best performance? The comfortable 2-0 win over Manchester United. It looked like Anderson, Lanzini, Haller and Yarmolenko would trouble a lot of teams and we could have a shot at the top six. Sadly it\u2019s been downhill ever since. And the worst? The home defeat to Newcastle. Roberto was at fault for two goals, poor old Zabaleta got embarrassed for speed by Saint-Maximin and we let Voldemort/Shelvey score. Burnley away was almost as bad. Happy with the manager? He\u2019s been unlucky to lose Fabianski, but is increasingly under pressure. Is he worth his \u00a38m a year? He needs to deliver some rollickings, find a decent reserve goalkeeper, stabilise a dodgy defence, get Haller firing again, restore Anderson\u2019s confidence and find a role for Fornals. Why I love \u2026 Lucasz Fabianski With every game Roberto plays, Fabianski looks better and better. What is \u201cthe West Ham way\u201d? Playing attacking football, beating good teams, losing to bad teams, and being terrorised by Chris Wood. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? A rampaging Billy Bonds. He\u2019d gee up our side of fancy dan playmakers. How are you feeling about VAR? There\u2019s no common sense. Refs should go to the monitors themselves. If it\u2019s a case of being offside by a big toe or an unintentional handball that the naked eye can\u2019t see, don\u2019t give it. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Southampton\u2019s chant at 9-0 down: \u201cManchester City, we\u2019re coming for you.\u201d \u2022 Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves Best performance? Man City away, rounding off maybe the best week in my lifetime \u2013 beating Watford to get our first win, Besiktas away in Europe and then beating the champions. The game plan was spot on. And the worst? Chelsea at home. I\u2019ve never seen us look so bad at the back under Nuno. Happy with the manager? It\u2019s amazing that he\u2019s taken some flak from some Wolves fans after a couple of defeats. He\u2019s doing an incredible job. Why I love \u2026 Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez \u00a330m was an absolute bargain. And he hasn\u2019t even hit top form yet. What is \u201cthe Wolves way\u201d? Under Nuno we\u2019re a team who will compete, stay in the game, and then hit you in the second half once we\u2019ve worked our way into the game. Our second-half record speaks for itself. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? With Willy Boly out, Billy Wright could definitely slot right in. How are you feeling about VAR? I was in favour, but now have no faith in it being used properly. Plus we seem to be on the wrong side of it a lot so far\u2026 Funniest moment so far \u2026 The expression on the Kosovo manager\u2019s face in September when he realised his half-time tunnel rant during the England game had been caught on camera.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal Best performance? Comebacks against Spurs and with 10 men against Villa were decent. Otherwise, lacklustre. Maitland-Niles being forced off to remove a gold necklace in-play against Vit\u00f3ria sort of sums things up so far. And the worst? 2-0 up at Vicarage Road. Cue second-half capitulation. Happy with the manager? Inoffensive, but hapless. Mr Good Ebening\u2019s tinkering is in sharp contrast with how Rodgers and Lampard have moulded their respective teams in their image. The atmosphere is toxic, again. Why I love \u2026 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Feeds on scraps, but Auba invariably comes up trumps. What is \u201cthe Arsenal way\u201d? I was weaned on a Gunners side where \u201cresilience\u201d was the watchword. These days we\u2019re about spinelessness. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? The Invisible Wall, Gilberto, to stop our defence from being so exposed. How are you feeling about VAR? Totally infuriating, ruining the passion and flow. If it\u2019s staying, it must be limited to \u201cclear and obvious\u201d errors. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Spurs 2 Bayern Munich 7. Their humiliations have been the only solid crumbs of comfort. \u2022 Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 Aston Villa Best performance? The first half against Burnley: we took apart a proper Premier League team. That showed how good our football can be at its best. And the worst? The first half against Wolves. Leggy, off the pace and leaderless. Happy with the manager? He\u2019s popular, and learning quickly. Some say he\u2019s a bit gung-ho: I guess it\u2019s game management that needs to improve Why I love \u2026 Jack Grealish Took a few games to get up to speed, but inspirational since. We\u2019ve got the prayer mats out now, hoping his injury heals properly. We\u2019re toothless without him What is \u201cthe Aston Villa way\u201d? The appalling 2014-18 period stripped us of most of our identity. But this young manager and team are trying to re-establish the desire to win with a bit of flair. That said, I\u2019d sacrifice a snazzy playing style (and a limb) to stay up. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Dwight Yorke. He\u2019d provide the link-up play and the goals to keep us afloat. How are you feeling about VAR? Soul-destroying. It works in stop-start sports; the beauty of football is its flow and momentum, and the joy of a goal. VAR eradicates all that. Stop it. Now. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Karren Brady\u2019s attempts to be a football columnist are consistently hilarious. \u2022 Jonathan Pritchard Observer reader Bournemouth Best performance? The away win at Southampton. Accomplished, and our first win at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 long overdue! And the worst? Arsenal away: flatter than a can of Coke left out overnight. We took too long to get going \u2013 a familiar problem this season. Happy with the manager? Of course. If his team could defend better we might have lost him to a rival by now. Why I love \u2026 Jefferson Lerma Not the quickest or the cleanest of players, but he just desperately wants to win. He\u2019s the heartbeat of the side. What is \u201cthe Bournemouth way\u201d? Under Eddie, it\u2019s about playing out from the back and sucking teams in. He likes counterattacking, expressive players. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Nigel Spackman had a great career here in the early 80s (119 games) and went on to play for Chelsea, Liverpool and Rangers. We could do with his pinpoint passing. How are you feeling about VAR? Put it in the bin. Technology can\u2019t judge issues that just aren\u2019t black or white. A fiasco. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Southampton\u2019s comic defending for our third goal: Angus Gunn and Jan Bednarek running in to each other. Oh, and a certain 9-0 reverse to Leicester. \u2022 Peter Bell AFCBchimes.blogspot.co.uk @cherrychimes Brighton Best performance? Beating Spurs 3-0 days after they lost 7-2 to Bayern. We were fearless in a win as impressive as it was unexpected, with two goals for teenager Aaron Connolly on his full debut. The crowd sang \u201cwe want seven\u201d. And the worst? Losing at Old Trafford. In the past we\u2019ve been unlucky to come away from there with nothing \u2013 this time we never got going. Happy with the manager? The transformation has been instant: we\u2019re now creative and exciting. It\u2019s magical. Why I love \u2026 Leandro Trossard A brilliant signing. He missed a few games through injury but turned the match against Everton after coming on as sub, then scored the first and made the second against Norwich. The only worry is whether we can hold on to him. What is \u201cthe Brighton way\u201d? We\u2019ve added style to never giving up. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Peter Ward, to score 30 goals a season, and get us into the top six. How are you feeling about VAR? I loved it in the Everton game when it noticed Connolly had been trodden on in the area. But mostly it\u2019s frustrating. It doesn\u2019t stop mistakes. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Back in April BT\u2019s Jake Humphrey tweeted: \u201cHaving watched Brighton today, and I know I\u2019m not impartial, but you really should be pleased about the prospect of an expansive, exciting, ambitious Norwich team full of home-grown talents joining the Premier League.\u201d Which made beating a dull, disorganised Norwich side at the Amex that bit sweeter. \u2022 Steph Fincham Observer reader Burnley Best performance? The 1-1 draw at Wolves, particularly in the first half when we totally dominated against the team that finished seventh last season. Only the softest of stoppage-time penalties stopped us winning. And the worst? 0-3 at Sheffield United. We were second best from start to finish as the Blades did to us what we\u2019ve done to so many other teams. Happy with the manager? I\u2019m sure there are things he might wish he\u2019d done differently, but being in the top flight for a fourth straight season is some achievement. Why I love \u2026 Chris Wood Offside too much, but we\u2019re better with him than without him. He makes the pitch bigger, holds up play and runs the channels, and his goal return is excellent. What is \u201cthe Burnley way\u201d? As Sean Dyche puts it: maximum effort, minimum requirement. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Jimmy McIlroy. The most talented player to wear the claret and blue. How are you feeling about VAR? The worst change we\u2019ve ever had. Someone needs to pull the plug. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Pep Guardiola reacting to not getting it all his own way at Liverpool. \u2022 Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com @UTCdotcom Chelsea Trizia Fiorellino, who covered Chelsea for our Fans Verdict feature for over a decade, died in October after a short illness, aged 50. Trizia was a hugely respected figure at the club, chair of Chelsea Supporters Group, and always wrote with passion, humour and insight. In her last piece, in August, she discussed what lay ahead with VAR, writing: I want to howl at a referee error, scream at the injustice of it all, become apoplectic with rage at a missed red card tackle; I want to laugh my ass off when we score an offside goal against Spurs, grin like a lunatic when the wrong Manchester United player gets sent off, and guffaw when the ref overlooks a Liverpool stonewall penalty (as if\u2026). The point is, our game is passionate not despite the flaws, but because of the flaws. Below, her partner of 18 years, Paul Baker, continues Trizia\u2019s work. We send him, and Trizia\u2019s family and friends, our deepest sympathies. \u2022 Crisis, the national charity for homeless people, was a cause close to Trizia\u2019s heart. You can donate in her memory here. Best performance? Ajax away. We took it to them, and that late winner was just perfect. And the worst? A toss-up between the 20-minute spell that cost us at Old Trafford and 2-2 with Sheffield United. No home team should surrender a two-goal lead against a newly-promoted side. Or against anyone, for that matter. Happy with the manager? What a start. We\u2019re so exciting going forward \u2013 the crowd are absolutely buzzing. Clean sheets are the issue, but with zonal marking disappearing, and players coming back, that should improve. Why I love \u2026 Mason Mount His willingness to shoot at every opportunity must be something he\u2019s picked up working with Lampard. A proper star in the making. What is \u201cthe Chelsea way\u201d? Never giving up. Season after season we\u2019ve seen lost causes turn into triumphs. The current side is certainly living up to it in a transitional season. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Eden who? Didier Drogba would be the perfect mentor for Tammy Abraham. How are you feeling about VAR? It has killed the joy of celebrating a goal. There\u2019s too much at stake to call it a work in progress. It needs to be scrapped, now. Best moment so far \u2026 The outpouring of love and respect for Trizia. It has really given me comfort during this sad time. I miss her hugely and my heart is broken \u2013 but for me she\u2019ll always be looking down from her seat in the front row of the East Upper, watching her beautiful Chelsea. \u2022 Paul Baker Crystal Palace Best performance? With honourable mentions to our first ever win at the Olympic Stadium, where we came from behind to seal three points, and our first league win at Old Trafford in 30 years, I would point to our 1-0 home win over Villa. We absolutely dominated from start to finish, and were relentless. As convincing a victory as a 1-0 can be. And the worst? Spurs away: desperate stuff. To be 4-0 down at half-time was shocking. What made it worse was Newcastle and Brighton beating them so easily \u2026 Happy with the manager? He\u2019s done very well with relatively limited resources, and no replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, our player of the year. Gary Cahill and James McCarthy were good signings, but his refusal to use Max Meyer or Victor Camarasa to add creativity has caused some frustration. Why I love \u2026 Gary Cahill He could\u2019ve shown up and coasted in the early twilight of his career but has been terrific and led by example. An incredible bargain. What is \u201cthe Palace way\u201d? It used to be counterattacking at pace with skilful wingers, giving the big clubs a bloody nose. But it\u2019s all become a bit more pragmatic lately. Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now? Andy Johnson. Pace, and a clinical eye for goal. What a difference he\u2019d make. How are you feeling about VAR? It has massively benefited us. No surprise, really, as the so-called smaller clubs didn\u2019t used to get the big decisions. It has corrected some obvious wrongs, particularly the Zaha penalty at Arsenal. Funniest moment so far \u2026 Arsenal\u2019s wild celebrations after their late winner against us \u2013 especially Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s full-on frenzied knee slide for the cameras. Cue VAR \u2026 \u2022 Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk @Clapham_Grand Everton Best performance? West Ham at Goodison. Quick passing combined with good pressing. We should have won by a much greater margin. And the worst? The home defeat to Sheffield United. Not a single player put in an acceptable level of performance. Happy with the manager? Silva is an enigma. He\u2019s often dour and uncommunicative, but is highly rated as a coach and well liked by players. He\u2019s tactically stubborn with a default formation of two defensive midfielders, and still hasn\u2019t solved our weaknesses in dead ball situations \u2013 though dropping zonal marking may help. He\u2019s been unlucky with injuries, too. Why I love \u2026 Tom Davies A proper fan\u2019s favourite. The local lad is showing flashes of form again, and he\u2019s still only 21. He has the potential to become a proper Everton great. What is \u201cthe Everton way\u201d? As per the club motto, \u201conly the best is good enough\u201d. Sadly, as a team we haven\u2019t lived up to that for many a long year. But there\u2019s always hope \u2026 Which figure from the past would you most want to bring back now?

Even when they pressed us hard, we were in control. And the worst? Probably Napoli away when we lost by two late goals. But we still played better than we did when we lost to them at the same stage last season, and that didn\u2019t turn out too badly. Happy with the manager? We\u2019re unbeaten at Anfield since April 2017. Klopp\u2019s a tactical mastermind. Why I love \u2026 Roberto Firmino He\u2019s ace, the best centre-forward in the country.

Funniest moment so far \u2026 Firmino\u2019s sheepish sideways glance caught on camera in the Turf Moor tunnel at full time following the \u201cMan\u00e9 v Salah\u201d spat in October. \u2022 Steph Jones Observer reader \u2022 Part two: Manchester City to Wolves",
