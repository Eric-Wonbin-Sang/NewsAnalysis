      "body": "<p>It was last December during Andy Murray\u2019s annual training camp in Miami when Matt Little, his longtime strength and conditioning coach, believed it was all over. They had just finished a nightmare season in which Murray had done everything he possibly could to permanently return to the court \u2013 from attempting to correct his hip with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/08/andy-murray-hip-surgery-aims-to-return-wimbledon-tennis\" title=\"\">surgery in January</a> to copious cortisone injections throughout the year to numb the constant, searing pain \u2013 yet as he prepared for the new season his hip still screamed for mercy with every movement.</p> <p>In the middle of a disastrous training session with Fernando Verdasco, Murray wondered why on earth he was still putting himself through so much pain. Little asked his employer a simple question and the final answer later that day was devastating. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Look, if you could quit today, would you?\u2019\u201d Little says. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know what, I\u2019d feel a lot better.\u2019 He said to us in the locker room that day it\u2019s all over. That for us as a team was the first time he had actually said it. Properly said it. Meant it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/25/andy-murray-dunblane-parents-divorced-documentary\">Andy Murray: \u2018Dunblane was when I was nine \u2026 then our parents divorced\u2019 | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were in pieces, absolute bits. Myself, Jamie [Murray] and Shane [Annun], there were a lot of tears in that locker room. We didn\u2019t leave for a while. Then we brushed ourselves down, we said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to Australia anyway, let\u2019s give it a go.\u2019 Then the press conference happened. So that was the main time when we thought that is it, it\u2019s game over.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most striking aspects of Murray\u2019s new documentary is that Little\u2019s face appears nearly as much as Murray\u2019s own. He is always there. Much has been made of the solitary nature of the head\u2011to\u2011head battles on the tennis court, where the players are alone and coaching is verboten on the ATP tour, but it is in the shadows and during these desperate moments where loneliness can fester.

      "bodyText": "It was last December during Andy Murray\u2019s annual training camp in Miami when Matt Little, his longtime strength and conditioning coach, believed it was all over. They had just finished a nightmare season in which Murray had done everything he possibly could to permanently return to the court \u2013 from attempting to correct his hip with surgery in January to copious cortisone injections throughout the year to numb the constant, searing pain \u2013 yet as he prepared for the new season his hip still screamed for mercy with every movement. In the middle of a disastrous training session with Fernando Verdasco, Murray wondered why on earth he was still putting himself through so much pain. Little asked his employer a simple question and the final answer later that day was devastating. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Look, if you could quit today, would you?\u2019\u201d Little says. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know what, I\u2019d feel a lot better.\u2019 He said to us in the locker room that day it\u2019s all over. That for us as a team was the first time he had actually said it. Properly said it. Meant it. \u201cWe were in pieces, absolute bits. Myself, Jamie [Murray] and Shane [Annun], there were a lot of tears in that locker room. We didn\u2019t leave for a while. Then we brushed ourselves down, we said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to Australia anyway, let\u2019s give it a go.\u2019 Then the press conference happened. So that was the main time when we thought that is it, it\u2019s game over.\u201d One of the most striking aspects of Murray\u2019s new documentary is that Little\u2019s face appears nearly as much as Murray\u2019s own. He is always there. Much has been made of the solitary nature of the head\u2011to\u2011head battles on the tennis court, where the players are alone and coaching is verboten on the ATP tour, but it is in the shadows and during these desperate moments where loneliness can fester. Although players always refer to the people around them as their \u201cteam\u201d, they are employees and the mere presence of money can alter even the tightest relationships. One of the primary keys to success in tennis is associating with the right people. Over their 12 years, it seems like Little has been the right sort of person for Murray.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal had left them looking as comfortable as this team ever can, and there was even the good news story of a quiet reintegration for Granit Xhaka, who had performed tidily enough.

We lost control for 15 minutes and they scored two goals. The first half we controlled all the game. We created chances to score a second goal. The second half as well, for five or 10 minutes was positive. Then we lost control of the game, they pushed and scored two goals. We tried again to come back, but really we didn\u2019t push, we didn\u2019t create a big opportunity to score.

The Europa League group stages is reaching a climax and British clubs are well positioned. In the next hour Rangers and Wolves will be kicking off against their respective opponents knowing that victories could secure their place in the next round. A win or draw would definitely do the job for Wolves, who hope that Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s return to Portugal does not coincide with his last match as Wolves manager before Arsenal come calling. He would certainly be a good choice for Arsenal but would Arsenal be a good choice for him? He\u2019s got a good thing going at Wolves, a club on the up and up. My free advice would be to continue building there and then if there comes a time when he fancies a move, bigger and better run clubs than Arsenal will be happy to have him. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves - which is something Nuno always warns against - and the matter to hand is to beat Braga, who are a very decent side and already won at Molineux earlier in the group. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Rangers could advance if they win at Feyenoord (and Porto fail to beat Young Boys), who are a different outfit to the one they beat 1-0 at Ibrox earlier in the competition. Since then Jaap Stam has been given the boot and Feyenoord have hired none other than the former Rangers hero Dick Advocaat as their new manager. But Advocaat has lots of injury problems going into this game so Steven Gerrard will feel a win is within reach. Even a draw would be enough if Young Boys get the better of Porto. </p> <p>Later, Arsenal and Celtic will be in action, too. In all, 17 teams could clinch a place in the last 32 today. Here\u2019s a list - if you don\u2019t like where your team is mentioned, take it up with the alphabet: </p> <p>APOEL, AZ Alkmaar, Arsenal, Braga, CFR Cluj, Copenhagen, Dynamo Kyiv, Gent, \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, LASK, Ludogorets, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Rangers, Sporting CP, Wolfsburg, Wolves, Young Boys</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T17:38:19.558Z\">at 5.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right then, like Unai Emery any day now, I\u2019ll be off. Bye! Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 match report from the Emirates: For 54 minutes it was tempting to wonder whether this low-key encounter, watched by a sparse attendance and trundling along nicely enough in Arsenal\u2019s favour, might one day go down in history as the night a troubled head coach began clawing his way back from the brink. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal had left them looking as comfortable as this team ever can, and there was even the good news story of a quiet reintegration for Granit Xhaka, who had performed tidily enough. Then Daichi Kamada struck two bolts from the blue for Eintracht Frankfurt and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that, no matter what Unai Emery tries, his tenure is doomed to fail. Much more here: Unai Emery faces the cameras: Yes, we lost here and for the Europa League we continue. We have the last match to achieve our objective. Today I think we improve. In the first half we deserved to win. The second half, the first five, 10 minutes or so wasn\u2019t good for us. We lost control for 15 minutes and they scored two goals. The first half we controlled all the game. We created chances to score a second goal. The second half as well, for five or 10 minutes was positive. Then we lost control of the game, they pushed and scored two goals. We tried again to come back, but really we didn\u2019t push, we didn\u2019t create a big opportunity to score. We think we deserved more, but we lost control of the game for 15 minutes and they achieved their result in that moment. I am being positive but above all realistic. We lost a very good opportunity to reach the next round tonight. I\u2019m thinking about the next match. I rather missed the complete Rosenbergness of the Malmo match. Here\u2019s the scene before kick-off: He captains the team, and scores twice in an absolute humdinger of a game, including in the winner in the fourth minute of stoppage time: Followed by wild post-game celebrations, curtain-calls and tributes: Malmo v Dynamo Kyiv got the last-minute winner it deserved, incidentally. Markus Rosenberg scored it. It is his last home game for Malmo, ahead of his imminent retirement. Fairytale stuff. All the final scores of tonight\u2019s 8pm kick-offs: Group A Dudelange 0-2 Apoel Nicosia Sevilla 2-0 Qarabag Group B Lugano 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 4-3 Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg 1-2 LASK Sporting 4-0 PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic 3-1 Rennes Lazio 1-0 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes 1-1 Standard Liege \u201cWe just witnessed an absolute shambles of a performance in the second half,\u201d rages Martin Keown. Boos echo around a largely already-empty Emirates Stadium as the final whistle blows on another Arsenal defeat. Seven games without a win now, and is there any way back from this for Unai Emery? Another European win for Celtic, who are now guaranteed first place in Group E after a comfortable victory over Rennes. 90+2 mins: Guendouzi throws a frustrated elbow into the nearest opponent, and is booked. 90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time at Arsenal. Celtic, meanwhile, are playing the last of four advertised minutes. 90 mins: The corner is worked to Saka, whose shot from 20 yards is blocked. 89 mins: The Arsenal fans don\u2019t know whether to boo or leave. Their team is making a late effort, and Willock\u2019s cross is headed behind for a corner. 89 mins: A penalty shout! Saka goes down in the area, but the referee couldn\u2019t be less interested. A consolation for Rennees in Glasgow! It\u2019s a fine cross from the left and a fine run from Hunou, across the defender, and his header flashes in at the near post. 84 mins: Eintracht keep threatening, but they also keep trying to dribble round lots of Arsenal players in the penalty area. If they just hurried up and shot, they might score another yet. 83 mins: Abraham, the Frankfurt captain, goes down for a while in apparent pain. And then he gets up and walks away. His antics earn him some loud booing. 80 mins: Arsenal have basically stopped attacking. Or at least, they\u2019ve stopped shooting. The game is drifting away from them. They just won\u2019t stop scoring at Malmo. Dynamov Kyiv\u2019s Benjamin Verbic has made it 3-3 there now. 76 mins: Mustafi has indeed had to go off, and Torreira has come on to replace him, forcing Xhaka into defence. A team that started with three centre-backs on the pitch now has one. A fine one-two with Ntcham, a great first touch, and a precise low finish across goal from Michael Johnston puts Celtic in a three-goal lead, and they are totally bossing Group E! 69 mins: Nearly a third for Frankfurt! Gacinovic is played in down the left, but Sokratis manages to keep up with him, and get a boot in the way of the shot when it comes. 67 mins: Mustafi required a bit of treatment after that second goal, and it looks like he might have to go off here. That would be Arsenal\u2019s final substitution, and certainly not how Emery would like to use it. Ozil\u2019s arrival hasn\u2019t changed the course of the Gunners game! Mart\u00ednez makes an excellent save, but when the ensuing corner is headed to the edge of the area there are three black shirts there, in all sorts of space. Kamada collects the ball, composes himself, and under no pressure whatsoever sends it arrowing towards the bottom corner! The goals are flying in now across the continent. Erdal Rakip has made it Malmo 3-2 Dynamo Kyiv in what sounds like an absolute belter, Meanwhile Bryan Gil has scored for Sevilla against Qarabag, which is great news for Ciaran. 60 mins: Emery has acted, by taking off Martinelli and bringing on Ozil. 57 mins: The goal has been coming, even if Eintracht hadn\u2019t created many clear chances. They made two changes at half-time, bringing on Kohr and Gacinovic for Fernandes and Andre Silva, and they have dominated the game since the restart. An equaliser! Kamada collects the ball on the edge of the area, on the right-hand side, facing away from goal. He\u2019s allowed to spin, come infield and curl a lovely left-footer inside the far post! 47 mins: Chance for Arsenal! And another chance for Arsenal! Martinelli tees up Willock, whose shot should have gone in but instead went wide, off a defender\u2019s leg. And from the corner Xhaka ghosts past his man and pulls back to Chambers, who wellies his shot way high! The goals just keep coming in Malmo, where Markus Rosenberg, who is presumably on loan from the 2006 World Cup, has equalised for the home side against Dynamo Kyiv. Rosenberg is 37 now. Ciar\u00e1n is at the Ram\u00f3n Sanchez Pijuan for the Sevilla v Qarabag game! And he\u2019s sent in a half-time report. There the good news ends, though: Just in case you\u2019re wondering, there\u2019s absolutely nothing going on. Sevilla, somehow, started the game eight points above second place, and played with an obvious and understandable lack of energy. Chicharito, looking a lot heavier than I remembered him, hasn\u2019t even tested Asmir Begovic in what they\u2019re already calling the battle of former Premier League players. Play is back under way at Celtic. And probably some other places. Not, though, at Arsenal, thanks to all those first-half stoppages. On one hand, the Arsenal match has been very slow-paced and underwhelming. On the other hand, there\u2019s hardly anyone there so on a per-capita basis they\u2019ve surely had more excitement per head than normal. And a report from Feyenoord, where a point was single-handedly won for Rangers by Morelos, more or less: And some half-time reading, firstly a report on Wolves\u2019 ding-dong Braga-based draw: All your half-time scores: Group A Dudelange 0-2 Apoel Nicosia Sevilla 0-0 Qarabag Group B Lugano 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 1-2 Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg 1-1 LASK Sporting 3-0 PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic 2-0 Rennes Lazio 1-0 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes 1-1 Standard Liege 45+4 mins: They\u2019re playing five minutes of stoppage time at Arsenal, where Xhaka is back on the pitch and skewing a shot wide from the edge of the box. Ryan Christie has doubled Celtic\u2019s lead just before half-time! It\u2019s a decent shot, and it bounces nastily on its way inside the near post from 20 yards or so, but the keeper should absolutely have got a bit of himself in the way of that one. Martinelli slides the ball across the area from the right, and Aubameyang\u2019s shot hits the bottom of a defender\u2019s outstretched leg, and the top of the goalkeeper\u2019s outstretched leg, and then the bottom of the crossbar, and then bounces, and then goes in! A couple of away goals to tell you about: Maxime Lestienne has given Standard Liege a 1-0 lead at Guimaraes, in Arsenal\u2019s group. And Giorgos Merkis makes it Dudelange 0-1 Apoel Nicosia. 43 mins: Another injury at Arsenal, where Xhaka has had lengthy treatment to his right knee. 41 mins: Saka has a chance at the end of a bizarrely slow-paced Arsenal move, but it\u2019s straight at the keeper. It\u2019s all going off in Malmo, where Viktor Tsygankov has given Dynamo Kyiv a 2-1 lead. 34 mins: Martinelli gets a caution for fouling Kostic, who was himself booked a while ago. Consider yourselves up to date on Arsenal-based bookings. 32 mins: David Luiz has played on for a while, but is unable to run off the mysterious injury that mysteriously injured him earlier. He\u2019s off, and Guendouzi is on. 30 mins: Saka is played through, but R\u00f6nnow comes out well to get in the way of the shot. He seems to have hurt his ankle in the process, and the physios are now on. Lazio lead Cluj 1-0, thanks to a goal from Joaquin Correa. Not to be confused with Eddie Izzard, who\u2019s had a joking career. 28 mins: Another chance for Celtic! Ntcham shoots from just outside the area, and aims it expertly for the far post, but the keeper makes a good save. An excellent cut-back, a fine first-time finish and Celtic are in the lead! That was a fine move, filleting the French side down their left flank, and an all-round good goal. Dynamo Kyiv have equalised at Malmo! The young defender Vitaliy Mykolenko has done the scoring. Also, Thomas Goiginger has given LASK a 0-1 advantage at Rosenborg. More goals: Uros Matic has scored from the spot to give Apoel Nicosia a 0-1 lead at Dudelange. And Bruno Fernandes has doubled Sporting\u2019s lead over PSV. 16 mins: Amazing miss/save combo! And then a goalline clearance! Xhaka swings in a corner, and an absolutely bonkers defensive header sends the ball straight to Martinelli, unmarked and six yards out, who\u2019s got a tap-in! He taps straight into the keeper. Another corner, and this time Martinelli heads it at the near post, and it\u2019s headed off the line at the far! Sporting have taken the lead against PSV, through Luiz Phellype. Victory would take the Portuguese side through tonight. David Luiz is currently on the turf, apparently hurt. Watching replays of the incident it\u2019s hard to see how he\u2019s managed to get himself injured, but such is life. He is, interestingly, playing as a midfield anchor tonight. 11 mins: Arsenal nearly score! It\u2019s a lovely cross from the left, and either Willock or Aubameyang had to nod it in at the back stick! But instead of one of them having a free header they mark each other, put each other off, and Aubameyang heads wide. The only goal of the 8pm kick-offs so far has come at Malmo, who have taken a second-minute lead against Dynamo Kyiv through Rasmus Bengtsson. 5 mins: Action at Arsenal, where Unai Emery has been told to take off his black jacket, which combined with his black trousers might lead people to think he\u2019s playing for Eintracht Frankfurt, who are clad all in black. 1 min: Peeeeeep! We\u2019re off! Ruddy Buquet is perhaps my No1 top favourite referee\u2019s name. Not to be confused with this, which is of course a ruddy bouquet. The Emirates is at the very most half full tonight. It\u2019s come to something when fans can\u2019t even be relied on to turn up and boo. The 8pm kick-offs in full: Group A Dudelange v Apoel Nicosia Sevilla v Qarabag Group B Lugano v Copenhagen Malmo v Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg v LASK Sporting v PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic v Rennes Lazio v Cluj Group F Arsenal v Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes v Standard Liege Hello world! No time for shilly-shallying: the players are already coming out at the Emirates, where Granit Xhaka returns to the side for the first time since his post-substitutional strop precisely one month and one day ago. Unai Emery keeps five of the team that drew with Southampton at the weekend, and changes the rest. Arsenal: Martinez, Mustafi, Papastathopoulos, Luiz, Chambers, Willock, Xhaka, Tierney, Martinelli, Aubameyang, Saka. Subs: Leno, Lacazette, Ozil, Torreira, Pepe, Nelson, Guendouzi. Eintracht Frankfurt: Ronnow, Abraham, Hasebe, Hinteregger, Da Costa, Sow, Fernandes, Kostic, Kamada, Paciencia, Andre Silva. Subs: Ndicka, Joveljic, Gacinovic, Toure, Chandler, Kohr, Zimmermann. Referee: Ruddy Buquet (France) Still plenty more matches to come today, including those featuring Arsenal, Celtic and Dudelange. And here comes Simon Burnton to take you through them. So it\u2019s bye from me. Bye! Here are all today\u2019s results so far: Astana 2-1 Manchester United Braga 3-3 Wolves Feyenoord 2-2 Rangers AZ Alkmaar 2-2 Partizan Krasnodor 1-0 Basel Trabzonspor 0-1 Getafe Young Boys 1-2 Porto CSKA 1-1 Ludogorets Oleksandra 0-1 Wolfsburg Ferencvaros 2-2 Espanyol BAsaksehir 0-3 Roma Saint Etienne 0-0 Gent WAC 0-1 Monchengladbach Besiktas 2-1 Slovan Bratislava Young Boys 1-2 Porto Wolves are through to the last 32. But Nuno will be annoyed that they let slip a 3-1 lead here, with this result meaning they remain second in the group behind Braga. Two goals by Morelos means Rangers are top of their group going into the last game, in which they will need to avoid defeat at home to Young Boys. 90 min: Sa\u00efss swings his left foot at the ball from 25 yards. He makes a reasonable connection but it swirls over the bar. 88 min: Braga threaten to hurt Wovles on the counter-attack, but the decisive pass is just too long for Fransergio. Porto are now leading 2-1 against Young Boys, so all four teams could be still in contention going into the last group game. They\u2019ve come back from 3-1 down! And the equaliser is a dreadfully sloppy from a Wolves\u2019 viewpoint. Coady cleared a corner but then a cross came back in from the left and Fransergio was free to nod in from close range. GOAL! Besiktas 1-1 Slovan Bratislava (Roco 76). That means that both Braga and Wolves would go through to the next round, ceteris paribus. 75 min: Marvellous play by Moutinho. He wins the ball in midfield and then flips a sublime pass with the outside of his foot to Neto, who bombs down the right and sends over a delivery .... that comes to nothing. 73 min: Paulinho booked for nearly rugby tackling Traor\u00e9 to the ground, which, in fairness, is no mean feat. Super forward play by another Colombian. Sinisterra sent a bamboozled Helander spinning backwards onto his backside before dinking the ball over the advancing McGregor. Braga pounce on a slack pass by Sa\u00efss. Galeno feeds Paulinho, who finishes well. Another perfect finish from the Colombian. Barasic\u2019s cross from the left was ideal, and the striker leapt between two defenders to glance a header into the top corner from 10 yards. A brilliant goal that could clinch Rangers\u2019 place in the next round. 63 min: Morelos has an appeal for a penalty turned down after the centreback climbs over him. Here is the side that will host Rennes. Celtic: Forster; Bauer, Ajer, Julien, Taylor; McGregor, Brown; Forrest, Christie, Morgan; Ntcham 62 min: Rangers are nothing like the limp side of the first half. They\u2019re starting to really rattle their hosts now. Morelos comes close to scoring a second but is denied by the keeper, who paws his 20-yard shot out for a corner. As things stand, with Rangers drawing and Porto losing, Steven Gerrard\u2019s side would advance to the next round. Rangers are level! Davis sprayed the ball wide to Kent on the left. Kent sent a lovely cross to the far post, leaving Senesei not knowing how to deal with it. While the defender tried to make up his mind, Morelos kept his eye on the ball and, without out even having to jump, heads it past the keeper from six yards. That\u2019s his 23rd goal of the season, his 12th in this competition! 51 min: Wolves almost add to their lead. A delightful run and cross by Traor\u00e9 gave Jota a chance to outjump the defender and nod towards goals. But the keeper made a decent save. \u201cIn the action photos from Braga, the stands appear to be as empty as a pocket,\u201d notes poor Peter Oh. \u201cAre the Portuguese club serving some sort of closed stadium ban, or are Wolves not deemed exciting enough of a draw?\u201d It sure is a small crowd. Maybe the ticket prices were too high? Or folks have been put off by the awful weather? There are plenty of Wolves fans there, though. I can\u2019t see them but they\u2019re making plenty of noise. Nuno had a dream, apparently. Here is the side that the still employed Unai Emery hopes has picked. Xhaka is back!: Arsenal: Martinez; Mustafi, David Luiz, Sokratis, Chambers, Willock, Xhaka, Tierney; Martinelli, Aubameyang, Sako Lots of half-time scores: Braga 1-3 Wolves Feyenoord 1-0 Rangers Young Boys 1-0 Porto CSKA 0-0 Ludogorets Ferencvaros 1-1 Espanyol Olesandra 0-1 Wolfsburg Saint Etienne 0-0 Gent Basakeshir 0-3 Roma WAC 0-0 Monchengladbach Besiktas 0-1 Slovan Bratislava AZ Alkmaar 0-2 Partizan Half-time: Back in Portugal, against a team wearing something close to the Arsenal kit, Nuno is having a ball. Wolves have come from behind to lead 3-1 and they fully deserve it. Jimenez has been particularly brilliant in a splendid collective performance so far. As for Rangers at Feyenoord, not so much. They trail 1-0 after being dominated in the first half. 43 min: Tavernier curls in a dangerous freekick, but Feyenoord clear. Still, Rangers are at least ending the half at the right end of the pitch. 41 min: Rangers are being overwhelmed in Rotterdam and can be grateful to Feyenoord\u2019s shoddy finishing for the score being only 1-0. GOAL! Besiktas 0-1 Slovan Bratislava (Daniel 35) A win would keep the Slovaks in contention, making their final group game - at home to Braga - very interesting. Two goals in 82 seconds! And this, too, is a super finish, as Traor\u00e9 rockets a low shot under the keeper from 16 yards. Wolves are heading for the knockout phase! A lovely goal by the Irishman! Jimenez clipped in a cross and Doherty, having charged into the box, slams a header downwards past the keeper. Feyenoord\u2019s domination reaps its reward, albeit with unwitting assistance from Rangers. First,a header by Barasic was too weak to count as a clearance, then Toornstra\u2019s shot from 20 yards skimmed off Helander\u2019s knee and into the net! GOAL! Basakeshir 0-1 Roma (Veretout 30). The Italians take the lead through a penalty. If this were to be the final score, they would be right back in qualification contention. If the Turks can turn it around, they will go through. 28 min: Doherty does well down the right again for Wolves, but the keeper rushes out to claim his cross. But Wolves are doing even better down the left, where Jonny and Jota are making regular gains. Jota has just cracked a low shot wide of the far post after another sharp move. GOAL! AZ Alkmaar 0-2 Partizan (Soumah 27) The Dutch side could seal qualification today, but not by playing the way they are at the moment. 23 min: Sinisterra skies the ball over the bar from 10 yards after Feyenoord open up Rangers down the right. Meanwhile, William Hargreaves has a grievance with my Nuno/Arsenal comment in the preamble. \u201cThere can\u2019t be that many bigger and better run clubs than Arsenal, can there, over the last quarter century, for example? Okay, there\u2019s the big two in Spain, one each in France, Italy and Germany, and two or three in England, debatably, but to suggest this wouldn\u2019t be an exciting move up from Spurs seems a little dry? I\u2019ve heard commentators describe their squad as the third best in the PL, they\u2019re one of the most profitable (possibility of investment), and with that wealth of young talent coming on, I\u2019d have thought a chap of Nuno\u2019s capability and ambition would be chomping at the bit.\u201d Firstly, Arsenal do not have the third best squad in the Premier League. Secondly, it\u2019s the next 2-5 years - not the last 25 years - you need to be looking at. How well run are Arsenal now? Nuno could do better. GOAL! Alkmaar 0-1 Partizan (Asano 16). The Serbs have to win this to remain in contention for qualification. 17 min: McGregor makes a terrific save to deny Sinisterra. Moments later, Feyenoord threaten again, with a shot by Larsson deflected wide at the near post. Jimenez\u2019s goal reminds me that one of the best headed goals I\u2019ve ever seen was scored by a Mexcian. Remember this from Jared Borgetti at the 2002 World Cup? A lovely goal! Moutinho fed Jonny, who delivered a sumptuous cross to the back post. Jimenez arrived and angled an expert header in at the far post. 10 min: Doherty and Traor\u00e9 combine nicely down the right until the latter slightly overruns the ball, giving the left-back an opportunity to step in and dispossesses him. GOAL! Young Boys 1-0 Porto (Fassnacht 6). That will be enough to put the Swiss through in Rangers\u2019 group if the score stays the same. The hosts take the lead with first shot of the match! But it was all thanks to a diabolical deflection off Ruben Neves. The young of the Horta brothers tried his luck from nearly 25 yards and Rui Patricio would have claimed it easily if not for the nick off Neves\u2019 foot. 4 min: Rangers are having to play a containment game at the minute, as Feyenoord pop the ball around brightly in search of an opening. 3 min: Wolves have made a confident start in Braga, passing the ball around progressively. But Jota has just brought a promising move to an undignified end by donking a cross straight to the nearest defender. Over at Feyenoord, meanwhile, the stadium is packed and very noisy. You\u2019d suggest the atmosphere would be intimidating if you didn\u2019t know Rangers are somewhat experienced in dealing with intensely hostile away environments. The players of Braga and Wolves have entered the pitch, which almost looks like a paddyfield. Yep, it\u2019s raining in Portugal like it\u2019s never going to stop. Maybe that\u2019s why there\u2019s a very low turnout in the stands. The other results from the earlier kickoffs: Group C: Trabzonspor 0-1 Getafe. The Turks were already eliminated, the Spaniards\u2019 fate will be decided on the last group day. Krasnodor 1-0 Basel. Basel are already through. Krasnodor and Getafe will contest the group\u2019s other qualifying spot. United gave debuts to seven players as they fielded their youngest ever team for a European club game. They could offer that learning experience because they had already booked their passage to the next round. Scott Murray is covering Astana v Manchester United v Astana here, with the score 2-1 with 15 minutes to go. The only other goal in the early games so far has come in Turkey, where Trabzonspor are trailing 1-0 to Getafe. Feyenoord: Marsman; Geertruida, Botteghin, Senesi, Malaca; Toomstra, Fer, Kokcu; Berghuis, Sinisterra, Larsson Rangers: Mcgregor; Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic; Jack, Davis, Kamara; Ojo, Morelos, Kent Braga: Eduardo; Esgaio, Vianna, Wallace, Sequeira; A Horta, Fransergio, Palhinha, R Horta; Paulinho, Galeno Wolves: Rui Patricio; Dendoncker, Coady, Sa\u00efss; Doherty, Neves, Moutinho, Otto; Traor\u00e9, Jimenez, Jota Hello. The Europa League group stages is reaching a climax and British clubs are well positioned. In the next hour Rangers and Wolves will be kicking off against their respective opponents knowing that victories could secure their place in the next round. A win or draw would definitely do the job for Wolves, who hope that Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s return to Portugal does not coincide with his last match as Wolves manager before Arsenal come calling. He would certainly be a good choice for Arsenal but would Arsenal be a good choice for him? He\u2019s got a good thing going at Wolves, a club on the up and up. My free advice would be to continue building there and then if there comes a time when he fancies a move, bigger and better run clubs than Arsenal will be happy to have him. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves - which is something Nuno always warns against - and the matter to hand is to beat Braga, who are a very decent side and already won at Molineux earlier in the group. Meanwhile, Rangers could advance if they win at Feyenoord (and Porto fail to beat Young Boys), who are a different outfit to the one they beat 1-0 at Ibrox earlier in the competition. Since then Jaap Stam has been given the boot and Feyenoord have hired none other than the former Rangers hero Dick Advocaat as their new manager. But Advocaat has lots of injury problems going into this game so Steven Gerrard will feel a win is within reach. Even a draw would be enough if Young Boys get the better of Porto. Later, Arsenal and Celtic will be in action, too. In all, 17 teams could clinch a place in the last 32 today. Here\u2019s a list - if you don\u2019t like where your team is mentioned, take it up with the alphabet: APOEL, AZ Alkmaar, Arsenal, Braga, CFR Cluj, Copenhagen, Dynamo Kyiv, Gent, \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, LASK, Ludogorets, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Rangers, Sporting CP, Wolfsburg, Wolves, Young Boys",

I am here to work every single day and to be ready to go again every single day. \u201cAt the end of last season I was really fresh. You could see that because I was there to score goals, and I scored the goals! I cannot complain. I just have to say I was really fresh and enjoying it \u2013 I think all the players were fresh because we were successful. You just have to be as professional as you can.\u201d The Liverpool forward believes winning the Club World Cup for the first time in the club\u2019s history would more than compensate for a heavy schedule. \u201cI always say to win games and win trophies motivates players all the time. If we can win the Club World Cup then it will give us more momentum. Hopefully we are going to win it and give us another blast of high energy to go again for the rest of the season.\u201d Liverpool are yet to discover the extent of the ankle problem that forced Fabinho out of the Napoli game. The influential Brazilian will have a scan once the ankle has settled, although Klopp fears the injury could be significant.",

      "body": "<p>The doves weren\u2019t feeling it that night. Why should they have been? See it from their perspective. You and your mates have been trapped inside five pianos on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, waiting for your cue. And what was that cue? As soon as the flamboyant Englishman descends a staircase on to the stage, the piano lids will fly open, each bearing one of the letters of the name ELTON, hopefully in the right order. Your task will be to fly into the California night to a soundtrack of oohs and aahs before laughing boy bangs out Elderberry Wine.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t happen. As Elton John made his entrance into US society in 1973, in a white outfit making him look like the victim of a tarring and feathering, the piano lids flew up, but the birds didn\u2019t. \u201cThe doves had fallen asleep,\u201d he recalled. Like so many matters raised in Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One), questions remain. Were any doves harmed during the making of this concert? Had they nodded off during the sound check? I would have.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the real start of my flamboyant outfits,\u201d said Elton of the night that broke him stateside. Chubby, balding Reg Dwight from Pinner was, by his own charming admission, no Mick Jagger, David Bowie or Marc Bolan. Plus, stuck behind a piano, he couldn\u2019t strut his stuff. He needed a right old zhooshing. Hence the Mozart wig he wore in Australia, the Donald Duck outfit in New York, although possibly not the spotted romper suit he chose for this sit-down with Graham Norton.</p> <p>I have never really cared for Elton\u2019s music, although I did warm to him during this hour-long interview about his six-decade career. It wasn\u2019t just because he was out and proud in the homophobic 1970s, but also because his self-satire cut through the treacle of Norton\u2019s kneel-down-and-derriere-smooch interview technique. How rare to encounter a 72-year-old man laughing at himself rather than onanistically buffing his legacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48c84704b7eb30841f01ac1fa232eee33e2b8bb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c84704b7eb30841f01ac1fa232eee33e2b8bb2/0_27_2813_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That\u2019s more like it \u2026 the Mozart wig days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That\u2019s more like it \u2026 the Mozart wig days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why the toupee? \u201cI don\u2019t like being bald. I look like Shrek.\u201d (Note to non-balds: baldness doesn\u2019t necessarily make you green.) And he endearingly disagreed with critics of his disastrous 80s rug rethink. \u201cThey said it looked like a dead squirrel. More like a dead mole.\u201d</p> <p>He even told of playing a Vegas gig in 2017 only two weeks after a prostate cancer operation. When he took his parting bows, he was in excruciating pain from fluid under his colon (and wearing a nappy). \u201cIf only they knew,\u201d he said, \u201cat that moment I was pissing myself.\u201d</p> <p>So little of the original Elton remains. Hair, tonsils, prostate, appendix have all gone, but he has a pacemaker. \u201cI\u2019m like the bionic woman,\u201d he giggled. Not quite: Lindsay Wagner had superpowers and her own hair.</p> <p>Norton drove to the interview along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in an open-top Rolls-Royce. Were licence-fee payers bankrolling its rental? Or was it Elton\u2019s, like the private jet he loaned Meghan and Harry? It was the second time this month the BBC was interviewing British royalty. Norton is no Emily Maitlis, although they had two things in common. Both interviewed their subjects on home turf; she in Buckingham Palace, he in Elton and David\u2019s place in Nice. Both outdressed their interviewees \u2013 she in fabulous shoes and cod-military coat, he in a jaunty print jacket and matching shirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94628903fc56c7488fc9de075d468e397fed35e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94628903fc56c7488fc9de075d468e397fed35e8/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Emily Maitlis \u2026 Graham Norton heading to Elton John\u2019s Nice home in his Roller.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Emily Maitlis \u2026 Graham Norton heading to Elton John\u2019s Nice home in his Roller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grabs/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming after Prince Andrew\u2019s inquisition, it was impossible not to compare the interviewers\u2019 techniques. Maitlis was forensic, Norton oleaginous. \u201cHis showmanship and unique sense of style fast became legendary \u2013 and all before the age of 25,\u201d oiled Norton. True, Elton has not been accused of having sex with a trafficked 17-year-old victim of a dead sex offender, but, still, one does hope for a nod towards journalistic critical distance from the BBC. Norton didn\u2019t quite ask: \u201cRemind us Elton, why are you so great?\u201d, but the possibility was never remote. Worst, Norton thwarted Elton from describing his coming-out phone call to his mum, instead inviting him to compare his stage outfits to Liberace\u2019s \u2013 about which I couldn\u2019t care less.</p> <p>That said, I was delighted to learn how Elton Hercules John, as Reg became in 1967, chose his middle name. It was after rag-and-bone man Steptoe\u2019s longsuffering horse rather than the lavishly muscled ancient Greek hero \u2013 though the latter, I suspect, has the bigger following in the gay community.</p> <p>Will he ever retire into domestic felicity with his husband and adopted sons? Not soon. If Paul McCartney can announce he is headlining Glastonbury aged 78, it\u2019s unlikely his fellow septuagenarian is quite done. Elton is planning a musical of The Devil Wears Prada. His current so-called farewell world tour may never end. Lots of bits of Elton John have fallen off, but he is still standing.</p>",

Like so many matters raised in Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One), questions remain. Were any doves harmed during the making of this concert? Had they nodded off during the sound check? I would have. \u201cIt was the real start of my flamboyant outfits,\u201d said Elton of the night that broke him stateside. Chubby, balding Reg Dwight from Pinner was, by his own charming admission, no Mick Jagger, David Bowie or Marc Bolan. Plus, stuck behind a piano, he couldn\u2019t strut his stuff. He needed a right old zhooshing. Hence the Mozart wig he wore in Australia, the Donald Duck outfit in New York, although possibly not the spotted romper suit he chose for this sit-down with Graham Norton. I have never really cared for Elton\u2019s music, although I did warm to him during this hour-long interview about his six-decade career. It wasn\u2019t just because he was out and proud in the homophobic 1970s, but also because his self-satire cut through the treacle of Norton\u2019s kneel-down-and-derriere-smooch interview technique. How rare to encounter a 72-year-old man laughing at himself rather than onanistically buffing his legacy. Why the toupee? \u201cI don\u2019t like being bald. I look like Shrek.\u201d (Note to non-balds: baldness doesn\u2019t necessarily make you green.) And he endearingly disagreed with critics of his disastrous 80s rug rethink. \u201cThey said it looked like a dead squirrel. More like a dead mole.\u201d He even told of playing a Vegas gig in 2017 only two weeks after a prostate cancer operation. When he took his parting bows, he was in excruciating pain from fluid under his colon (and wearing a nappy). \u201cIf only they knew,\u201d he said, \u201cat that moment I was pissing myself.\u201d So little of the original Elton remains. Hair, tonsils, prostate, appendix have all gone, but he has a pacemaker. \u201cI\u2019m like the bionic woman,\u201d he giggled. Not quite: Lindsay Wagner had superpowers and her own hair. Norton drove to the interview along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in an open-top Rolls-Royce. Were licence-fee payers bankrolling its rental? Or was it Elton\u2019s, like the private jet he loaned Meghan and Harry? It was the second time this month the BBC was interviewing British royalty. Norton is no Emily Maitlis, although they had two things in common. Both interviewed their subjects on home turf; she in Buckingham Palace, he in Elton and David\u2019s place in Nice. Both outdressed their interviewees \u2013 she in fabulous shoes and cod-military coat, he in a jaunty print jacket and matching shirt. Coming after Prince Andrew\u2019s inquisition, it was impossible not to compare the interviewers\u2019 techniques. Maitlis was forensic, Norton oleaginous. \u201cHis showmanship and unique sense of style fast became legendary \u2013 and all before the age of 25,\u201d oiled Norton. True, Elton has not been accused of having sex with a trafficked 17-year-old victim of a dead sex offender, but, still, one does hope for a nod towards journalistic critical distance from the BBC. Norton didn\u2019t quite ask: \u201cRemind us Elton, why are you so great?\u201d, but the possibility was never remote. Worst, Norton thwarted Elton from describing his coming-out phone call to his mum, instead inviting him to compare his stage outfits to Liberace\u2019s \u2013 about which I couldn\u2019t care less. That said, I was delighted to learn how Elton Hercules John, as Reg became in 1967, chose his middle name. It was after rag-and-bone man Steptoe\u2019s longsuffering horse rather than the lavishly muscled ancient Greek hero \u2013 though the latter, I suspect, has the bigger following in the gay community. Will he ever retire into domestic felicity with his husband and adopted sons? Not soon. If Paul McCartney can announce he is headlining Glastonbury aged 78, it\u2019s unlikely his fellow septuagenarian is quite done. Elton is planning a musical of The Devil Wears Prada. His current so-called farewell world tour may never end. Lots of bits of Elton John have fallen off, but he is still standing.",

Overall pitch Berry: Only the Greens will put the climate and biodiversity crises at the very top of the government\u2019s priorities, and other parties are only taking these issues seriously now because the Greens have won the argument. Corbyn: Unlike the Tories, Labour has a climate plan and it will create huge numbers of jobs in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d encompassing offshore wind farms, housing upgrades, nationalised railways and energy, and a lot of new trees. Price: The Plaid Cymru leader made a strong pitch that Wales has been neglected by Westminster governments handing out infrastructure investment, which is vital to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon: Scotland is already a leader in onshore and offshore wind, and could go much further in renewable energy generation, as well as tree-planting and nature conservation. Swinson: The Liberal Democrats have traditionally been the strongest on green issues among the three main parties but have struggled to regain lost ground after taking part in the coalition, which failed to fulfil its promise to be \u201cthe greenest government ever\u201d. Swinson\u2019s commitments, for instance on achieving net zero only five years before the Tories, looked less impressive when compared with other parties. Best line Berry: The Greens have had the climate at the top of their agenda for years while the others are just catching up, Berry pointed out: \u201cDo you trust them to get this done without more Greens in parliament?\u201d Corbyn: \u201cThis election is the last chance to tackle our climate emergency.\u201d Corbyn did a good job of showing that he knows the issues, even if he didn\u2019t have answers for all of them.

Sturgeon: Scotland has a strong story on renewable energy. Just don\u2019t mention North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: Frequent flyer levy on anyone taking more than three international return flights a year. Worst moment Berry: Failed to explain why scrapping HS2 was a good idea, when calling for less flying. Corbyn: Defending nationalisation of the electricity grid, which Price suggested would divert investment from renewables, by claiming it would be easier to sell biogas back into the grid. Price: A rather feeble brag of claiming green credentials for changing his reusable nappies for his newborn son. Sturgeon: Refusing to directly address the question of North Sea oil and gas, preferring vague references to a \u201cjust transition\u201d to low-carbon jobs. Swinson: Floundering while trying to explain why the Lib Dems\u2019 target of net zero by 2045 was so much better than the Tories\u2019 2050 target. Unanswered questions Berry: Is it realistic to borrow \u00a31tn over the next decade? Corbyn: Does the party back Heathrow expansion, which half of Labour MPs voted for, and nuclear power? Price: Can Wales make the transition from a former coal-based economy to low-carbon industry? Sturgeon: North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: The Lib Dem record in the coalition. Verdict Berry: Berry showed a depth of familiarity with the issues that is her party\u2019s key selling point. Corbyn: Believable on these issues, and with a strong manifesto on the green industrial revolution. Price: Hammered home the point that Wales\u2019s potential has been overlooked and undermined by Westminster. Sturgeon: SNP are comfortable on renewables and the natural environment, less so on the North Sea. Swinson: Struggling to reclaim what used to be an easy win for the Lib Dems in being one of the greenest parties \u2013 now looking outflanked by Labour.

      "body": "<p>Opposition leaders attempted to outbid each other on Thursday night with their climate credentials in the first ever election debate focusing on the environmental emergency, in which the absent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/ice-sculpture-to-replace-boris-johnson-in-channel-4-climate-debate\">Boris Johnson was replaced by a melting ice sculpture</a>.</p> \n<p>In place of the prime minister, Channel 4 placed an ice sculpture, representing, they said, the emergency on planet Earth. A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1200112941170937859\">who also refused to take part</a>.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case.</p> \n<p>Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence.</p> \n<p>The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/eu-parliament-declares-climate-emergency\">urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</a>.</p> \n<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050.</p> \n<p>The expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed.</p> \n<p>Si\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry.</p> \n<p>Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets.</p> \n<p>Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part.

      "bodyText": "Opposition leaders attempted to outbid each other on Thursday night with their climate credentials in the first ever election debate focusing on the environmental emergency, in which the absent Boris Johnson was replaced by a melting ice sculpture. In place of the prime minister, Channel 4 placed an ice sculpture, representing, they said, the emergency on planet Earth. A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part. The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case. Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence. The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate. Johnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d. The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050. The expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed. Si\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted. \u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry. Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d \u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon. The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper. \u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said. More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets. Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d. He insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies. Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d He told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. \u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said. Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said. Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d",

And this was a leaders\u2019 debate. In a scene worthy of The Thick of It, Boris then had a temper tantrum at being excluded from a debate from which he had excluded himself and threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s public service broadcasting obligations. Satire had just eaten itself.</p> <p>The debate itself opened with a panoramic set of a world on fire and presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy explaining the Boris no-show and that he had been replaced with an ice sculpture of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The studio lights were turned on full and right on cue the ice sculpture started melting. There was an identical ice sculpture to represent the Brexit party, who also hadn\u2019t bothered to turn up, but no one was too interested in that one. Rather everyone was openly relieved that they didn\u2019t have to engage with Nigel Farage.</p> <p>After a short video featuring disappearing forests and glaciers, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and a dead koala, the five party leaders \u2013 the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price, the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson \u2013 were invited to indulge in some competitive virtue signalling with their opening statements. They all cared a lot a lot, though Swinson also cared about Brexit. Berry insisted she won first prize as she had cared much longer and the others were all arrivistes. She had a point.</p> <p>Corbyn couldn\u2019t believe his luck as he took the first question on climate change targets. Taking one look at the melting Boris, he indulged his obligatory free hit at the Tories. Something each of the leaders would also go on to do. Hell, why not? No one was going to contradict them. If there\u2019s one thing that everyone was agreed on \u2013 apart from the climate emergency being very serious \u2013 it was that the Tories were basically evil.</p> <p>The Conservatives target was 2050, Corbyn said. Which in reality was 2099. So Boris\u2019s secret plan was to kill the entire planet. He would get stuff done by 2030. Sturgeon and Swinson hurriedly tried to explain why their targets of 2045 really meant that they would be carbon neutral even sooner than Labour. Berry took the high ground and pronounced even 2030 to be defeatist and set her own target of 2029. This quickly developed into a free for all, before Sturgeon, the squabbler in chief, asked everyone to stop squabbling. Remembering they were all there to save the planet, all five leaders held hands and observed a minute\u2019s silence for the burnt koala.</p> <p>Thereafter all five leaders pretty much agreed with each other at every opportunity. People should start to eat a more plant-based diet and everyone should stop flying and take buses. Corbyn even promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. Or 200 a minute. There were going to be so many forests, no one would be able to see the wood for the trees.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a copy of our green manifesto,\u201d said the Labour leader.</p> <p>\u201cI could have read that online,\u201d Guru-Murthy replied.</p> <p>Corbyn chastised himself and promised to make that two billion and one trees. The debate ended with everyone \u2013 even Jeremy who insisted he was already too miserable to turn the heating up \u2013 promising to do a lot better. The one exception was Berry who said she was fed up with lists and that we were probably going to die anyway.</p> <p>But even she was up for a group hug come the closing credits. After all there were no winners in a climate emergency. There were losers though.

The debate itself opened with a panoramic set of a world on fire and presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy explaining the Boris no-show and that he had been replaced with an ice sculpture of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The studio lights were turned on full and right on cue the ice sculpture started melting. There was an identical ice sculpture to represent the Brexit party, who also hadn\u2019t bothered to turn up, but no one was too interested in that one. Rather everyone was openly relieved that they didn\u2019t have to engage with Nigel Farage. After a short video featuring disappearing forests and glaciers, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and a dead koala, the five party leaders \u2013 the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price, the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson \u2013 were invited to indulge in some competitive virtue signalling with their opening statements. They all cared a lot a lot, though Swinson also cared about Brexit. Berry insisted she won first prize as she had cared much longer and the others were all arrivistes. She had a point. Corbyn couldn\u2019t believe his luck as he took the first question on climate change targets. Taking one look at the melting Boris, he indulged his obligatory free hit at the Tories. Something each of the leaders would also go on to do. Hell, why not? No one was going to contradict them. If there\u2019s one thing that everyone was agreed on \u2013 apart from the climate emergency being very serious \u2013 it was that the Tories were basically evil. The Conservatives target was 2050, Corbyn said. Which in reality was 2099. So Boris\u2019s secret plan was to kill the entire planet. He would get stuff done by 2030. Sturgeon and Swinson hurriedly tried to explain why their targets of 2045 really meant that they would be carbon neutral even sooner than Labour. Berry took the high ground and pronounced even 2030 to be defeatist and set her own target of 2029. This quickly developed into a free for all, before Sturgeon, the squabbler in chief, asked everyone to stop squabbling. Remembering they were all there to save the planet, all five leaders held hands and observed a minute\u2019s silence for the burnt koala. Thereafter all five leaders pretty much agreed with each other at every opportunity. People should start to eat a more plant-based diet and everyone should stop flying and take buses. Corbyn even promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. Or 200 a minute. There were going to be so many forests, no one would be able to see the wood for the trees. \u201cI\u2019ve got a copy of our green manifesto,\u201d said the Labour leader. \u201cI could have read that online,\u201d Guru-Murthy replied. Corbyn chastised himself and promised to make that two billion and one trees. The debate ended with everyone \u2013 even Jeremy who insisted he was already too miserable to turn the heating up \u2013 promising to do a lot better. The one exception was Berry who said she was fed up with lists and that we were probably going to die anyway. But even she was up for a group hug come the closing credits. After all there were no winners in a climate emergency. There were losers though. The two ice sculptures that had melted into a puddle on the studio floor.

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has defended its decision to drop an investigation into claims of sex trafficking made against disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein by a woman who says she was forced to sleep with the Duke of York. It comes after Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked to the UK aged 17 to sleep with Prince Andrew, criticised the Metropolitan police for failing to subject her complaint to a full inquiry in 2015. But Scotland Yard, which says it has liaised with \u201cother law enforcement organisations\u201d, explained it concluded not to launch a criminal investigation as it \u201cwould be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK\u201d. Giuffre claims she slept with Andrew three times, including in London in 2001 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell. A photograph showing the prince with his arm around the then teenager\u2019s waist with Maxwell in the background has dogged him in recent weeks as controversy grows surrounding his involvement with Epstein following his disastrous BBC interview. On Monday, Giuffre accused Scotland Yard of corruption, writing on Twitter: \u201cAt first the Scotland Yard told me they were going to forensically examine GM\u2019s [Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s] house in London \u2013 next thing I hear, just like the FBI, they were not allowed to pursue the investigation. Corruption in the highelevels [sic] of gov.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, commander for specialist crime Alex Murray confirmed the Met received an \u201callegation of non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation\u201d against Epstein and a British woman relating to \u201cevents outside of the UK and an allegation of trafficking to central London in March 2001\u201d. He added: \u201cOfficers assessed the available evidence, interviewed the complainant and obtained early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. \u201cFollowing the legal advice, it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK. \u201cWe therefore concluded that the MPS [Metropolitan police service] was not the appropriate authority to conduct enquiries in these circumstances and, in November 2016, a decision was made that this matter would not proceed to a full criminal investigation.\u201d On Thursday night the BBC released a trailer of its interview with Giuffre before its broadcast on Monday. After Epstein committed suicide in a New York jail cell in August while awaiting trial for further offences, Murray said the Met reviewed its decision but the force stuck by its original assessment. \u201cThe MPS has liaised with other law enforcement organisations but has not received a formal request asking for assistance in connection with this allegation,\u201d he added. It comes as security concerns have been raised at Buckingham Palace after a masseuse claims she was invited to Prince Andrew\u2019s bedroom without being properly vetted. Monique Giannelloni has come forward to disclose that she was paid \u00a375 for an appointment with the prince after being introduced by socialite Maxwell. Giannelloni alleges that she was not searched, nor asked to sign in, before her appointment at the palace in 2000, which was booked by Prince Andrew\u2019s then assistant Charlotte Manley. Giannelloni, who has produced a signed cheque with Buckingham Palace branding in Manley\u2019s name to prove she was paid for the visit, said she was only asked for her car registration plate before being waved inside by aides. \u201cIt was so easy to get into the palace and it troubled me because I could have been anyone,\u201d she told MailOnline. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Andrew and never met anyone from the royal household. Nobody knew me. I wasn\u2019t spoken to by a royal protection officer or asked any questions at all. Nobody checked my bag when I arrived or when I left. I certainly expected more stringent security checks.\u201d Buckingham Palace declined to comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 November 2019 to correct the description of a photo of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre.",

If Brexit happens on 31 January, the two sides will immediately embark on an 11-month race to negotiate a free-trade agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready, we know what the most important principles are we want to defend and promote in the next phase,\u201d Michel told the Guardian and six other European newspapers. \u201cWe also know what are the top priorities: the integrity of the single market, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\">level playing field</a> [fair competition], the Good Friday agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The EU would have to \u201cwork again very hard\u201d to maintain unity, he said, especially as countries had different economic interests in the UK relationship. \u201cThere is a risk to be divided based on different economic situations in different countries. But if we use the same transparent way of working, it is the best guarantee to maintain unity.\u201d</p> <p>Michel declined to predict whether the two sides could agree a trade deal in just 11 months. In the annals of trade talks this would be an unprecedented feat and one senior EU diplomat said he could not see it happening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/get-brexit-done-reality-far-more-difficult-tortuous-european-union\">\u201cin my wildest dreams\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Michel said he wanted to avoid Brexit becoming a big issue for the summit, as he planned to focus on the eurozone, climate change and the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget.</p> <p>Unlike Tusk, an unabashed anglophile who recently declared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-gets-deal-backslapping-brussels-eu-summit-brexit\">in my heart I will always be a remainer\u201d</a>, the Belgian leader avoids flamboyant statements. \u201cThere are many things in my heart and certainly I also regret the choice, but I respect the choice of the British citizens.\u201d He added it would be important to \u201cshow serenity\u201d in upcoming talks.</p> <p>His priority is making Europe a more united player on the world stage, as he warned against the possibility of the union becoming \u201cthe collateral damage\u201d in a possible cold war between the US and China. \u201cThere is a risk that in the long term, there is a new cold war between the United States and China \u2026 I don\u2019t think the destiny of Europe is to become a junior partner.\u201d</p> <p>Michel said EU leaders needed \u201cmore strategic discussions\u201d, including in dealing with China, before two summits with the country next year.</p> <p>Unlike his predecessor, who once listed Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cworrying declarations\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38808504\">one of the threats facing Europe</a>, Michel struck an emollient note towards the US. He said the EU and US shared \u201cthe same goals\u201d and many common values, although he noted the two were at odds over climate change and the Iran nuclear deal.</p> <p>The softly spoken son of a former Belgian deputy prime minister, who has been involved in politics since his teenage years, Michel has broken many political records.

      "bodyText": "The EU is ready for the next phase of Brexit but risks greater internal divisions over trade talks with the UK, one of its incoming leaders has said. In one of his first interviews since being nominated president of the European council, Charles Michel said Brexit may have played an important role in bringing the EU together. The former Belgian prime minister will take the reins following a formal handover ceremony on Friday in his Europa HQ in Brussels, as Donald Tusk stands down after five years in post. Michel\u2019s first big moment will be chairing the EU summit on 12-13 December \u2013 election time in the UK. EU leaders will probably be finishing off their three-course dinner when exit polls drop on polling day, revealing whether Boris Johnson\u2019s election gamble is likely to have paid off. Michel said he hoped the election would bring clarity on whether the UK would ratify the withdrawal agreement. If Brexit happens on 31 January, the two sides will immediately embark on an 11-month race to negotiate a free-trade agreement. \u201cWe are ready, we know what the most important principles are we want to defend and promote in the next phase,\u201d Michel told the Guardian and six other European newspapers. \u201cWe also know what are the top priorities: the integrity of the single market, the level playing field [fair competition], the Good Friday agreement.\u201d The EU would have to \u201cwork again very hard\u201d to maintain unity, he said, especially as countries had different economic interests in the UK relationship. \u201cThere is a risk to be divided based on different economic situations in different countries. But if we use the same transparent way of working, it is the best guarantee to maintain unity.\u201d Michel declined to predict whether the two sides could agree a trade deal in just 11 months. In the annals of trade talks this would be an unprecedented feat and one senior EU diplomat said he could not see it happening \u201cin my wildest dreams\u201d. Michel said he wanted to avoid Brexit becoming a big issue for the summit, as he planned to focus on the eurozone, climate change and the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget. Unlike Tusk, an unabashed anglophile who recently declared \u201cin my heart I will always be a remainer\u201d, the Belgian leader avoids flamboyant statements. \u201cThere are many things in my heart and certainly I also regret the choice, but I respect the choice of the British citizens.\u201d He added it would be important to \u201cshow serenity\u201d in upcoming talks. His priority is making Europe a more united player on the world stage, as he warned against the possibility of the union becoming \u201cthe collateral damage\u201d in a possible cold war between the US and China. \u201cThere is a risk that in the long term, there is a new cold war between the United States and China \u2026 I don\u2019t think the destiny of Europe is to become a junior partner.\u201d Michel said EU leaders needed \u201cmore strategic discussions\u201d, including in dealing with China, before two summits with the country next year. Unlike his predecessor, who once listed Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cworrying declarations\u201d as one of the threats facing Europe, Michel struck an emollient note towards the US. He said the EU and US shared \u201cthe same goals\u201d and many common values, although he noted the two were at odds over climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. The softly spoken son of a former Belgian deputy prime minister, who has been involved in politics since his teenage years, Michel has broken many political records. He was Belgium\u2019s youngest-ever minister (aged 24) and youngest-ever prime minister (aged 38) when he formed an unwieldy four-party coalition dominated by Flemish nationalists in 2014. The coalition collapsed in 2018 when Michel insisted on signing a UN migration pact, against the wishes of the larger Flemish nationalist party. Describing himself as a bruggenbouwer (bridge builder), he said his experience in Belgian politics would help him forge compromises among 27 countries. \u201cMany people say Belgium is a mini-Europe,\u201d he said. Michel, a liberal ally of Emmanuel Macron, is seen as close to France, but sought to stress he was his own man. He said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was the first EU leader to suggest he consider the European job. He spoke warmly of ideas to reform the EU enlargement process that are closely associated with the French president, who caused uproar by blocking North Macedonia from opening membership talks. \u201cWe need to discuss whether it is possible to improve this process, for example with the possibility to decide the principle of reversibility,\u201d said Michel, referring to a key French idea that countries could be pushed to the back of the queue if sliding back on democratic reforms. While some countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, are sympathetic to the French plans, others in central and eastern European countries are wary. Michel will be only the third person to occupy the job, since the post was created in 2009. Some EU member states complain that being Europe\u2019s summiteer-in-chief is only a part-time job, a charge Michel batted away. He said the European council had grown in importance. \u201cI\u2019m not naive, I know what the obstacles are, but I am hopeful. I feel [there is] stronger political will among the leaders \u2013 stronger than is reflected in the media \u2013 to take decisions.\u201d",

The SNP said it had consulted Jewish community leaders about the handling of the case. It is unable to replace Hanvey as its official candidate as his name is now on the ballot paper. Nominations closed on 14 November. The Scottish Greens said their candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, Scott Rutherford, had been endorsed by the pro-independence campaign Yes Kirkcaldy as after Hanvey\u2019s suspension. The Scottish Greens have been the SNP\u2019s closest allies in the independence movement. Rutherford said this meant he was now the best candidate to challenge Labour in the seat, where his party has never before stood in a Westminster election.",

The decline of party politics in favour of group identity is often attributed \u2013 at least by Londoners \u2013 to issues of ethnicity and religion. Provincial Britain sees it differently. Its group identity is that of neighbourhood and town, assailed by outsiders of all sorts, with children seduced by bright lights, and replaced with migrants and interminable executive estates.</p> <p>As the political scientist <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2019/11/who-cares-about-immigration/\" title=\"\">Eric Kaufmann</a> points out, income and social background are having ever less bearing on voting behaviour: \u201cSmall-c conservative working-class voters have migrated to the Conservative party because of immigration and Brexit. On the other side, successful educated cosmopolitans opt for Labour or the Lib Dems.\u201d This is most vividly seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/30/facts-support-mps-claim-that-better-educated-voted-remain-pollster\" title=\"\">in the correlation</a> between remain voting and higher education. This is not a matter of economics, he says, but \u201ca measure of psychological openness and a liberal worldview\u201d. </p> <p>What may be deplorable must not become incomprehensible. I find leave voters resent what they see as their natural concern for the integrity of their community \u2013 or even the sovereignty of the British state \u2013 being dismissed as xenophobic or racist. When instructed to \u201cchange or die\u201d, they reply that we are all dead one day. Yes, a dynamic economy must be open to change \u2013 including economic migration \u2013 but only if the beneficiaries can persuade the sufferers that it is in their interest. Either way, it will depend on trust. Nothing so destroyed faith in David Cameron\u2019s government as its disregard of localism in planning and public services. People who do not trust those ordering them to change will seek revenge \u2013 even if it costs them money. </p> <p>Brexit was, of course, change \u2013 but to some voters it was an imagined reversion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/01/generation-nostalgia-britain-past-brexit-immigration\" title=\"\">a more familiar past</a>. It must be the most truly conservative vote in modern British history. It is why Boris Johnson was wise to stick with it, though unwise now to tear up treaty trading relations with the EU. It is also why Corbyn\u2019s reversion to the Labour party of the 1940s \u2013 to a land of nationalisation, council estates and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 may be shrewdly conservative rather than plain daft. It should reassure old Labour, like Tories preaching a return to empire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/28/labour-policies-benefit-millions-waspi-women-pensions\">Labour\u2019s policies will benefit millions, but now it needs to sell them better | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have always thought it dangerous for liberals to assume that conservatives know in their hearts that conservative values are selfish and shallow. Humans are by their nature conservative. The new populism gets this, that politics is no longer \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d. It is about things people find more important than money. Those who condemn Brexit fail to see it was never really to do with the EU, any more than it concerned the gross national product. It was about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live.</p> <p>Just now, the Conservative instinct understands this. So, in his Brexit hesitancy, does Corbyn.

Analysis by Matthew Goodwin and Roger Eatwell into who voted for Brexit in Britain and Donald Trump in the US found the tribes remarkably similar, with support in both cases more widely spread across ages and classes than initially supposed. Indeed, average leave and Trump voters had above-average incomes. What they shared was a concern about the continuity of their identity and way of life. They feared outsiders and newcomers. Brexit was cheered as much in struggling ex-industrial towns as in affluent Conservative counties. Most explanations have suffered from a failure to separate liberal contempt from dispassionate analysis. The decline of party politics in favour of group identity is often attributed \u2013 at least by Londoners \u2013 to issues of ethnicity and religion. Provincial Britain sees it differently. Its group identity is that of neighbourhood and town, assailed by outsiders of all sorts, with children seduced by bright lights, and replaced with migrants and interminable executive estates. As the political scientist Eric Kaufmann points out, income and social background are having ever less bearing on voting behaviour: \u201cSmall-c conservative working-class voters have migrated to the Conservative party because of immigration and Brexit. On the other side, successful educated cosmopolitans opt for Labour or the Lib Dems.\u201d This is most vividly seen in the correlation between remain voting and higher education. This is not a matter of economics, he says, but \u201ca measure of psychological openness and a liberal worldview\u201d. What may be deplorable must not become incomprehensible. I find leave voters resent what they see as their natural concern for the integrity of their community \u2013 or even the sovereignty of the British state \u2013 being dismissed as xenophobic or racist. When instructed to \u201cchange or die\u201d, they reply that we are all dead one day. Yes, a dynamic economy must be open to change \u2013 including economic migration \u2013 but only if the beneficiaries can persuade the sufferers that it is in their interest. Either way, it will depend on trust. Nothing so destroyed faith in David Cameron\u2019s government as its disregard of localism in planning and public services. People who do not trust those ordering them to change will seek revenge \u2013 even if it costs them money. Brexit was, of course, change \u2013 but to some voters it was an imagined reversion to a more familiar past. It must be the most truly conservative vote in modern British history. It is why Boris Johnson was wise to stick with it, though unwise now to tear up treaty trading relations with the EU. It is also why Corbyn\u2019s reversion to the Labour party of the 1940s \u2013 to a land of nationalisation, council estates and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 may be shrewdly conservative rather than plain daft. It should reassure old Labour, like Tories preaching a return to empire. I have always thought it dangerous for liberals to assume that conservatives know in their hearts that conservative values are selfish and shallow. Humans are by their nature conservative. The new populism gets this, that politics is no longer \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d. It is about things people find more important than money. Those who condemn Brexit fail to see it was never really to do with the EU, any more than it concerned the gross national product. It was about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live. Just now, the Conservative instinct understands this. So, in his Brexit hesitancy, does Corbyn. With Brexit over, it will be liberals who have a mountain to climb. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Virgin Money has nearly doubled the pay of its chief executive to \u00a33.4m after the bank was pushed to a second consecutive annual loss by a \u00a3385m charge for mis-sold payment protection insurance. David Duffy\u2019s pay jumped by 84% from \u00a31.8m in 2018, despite an investor revolt in January in which a third of shareholders opposed the bumper payout. The big increase was driven largely by a bonus of \u00a31.3m linked to the 2015 demerger of Virgin Money\u2019s predecessor bank, CYBG, from National Australia Bank, as well as incentives from 2016. Duffy\u2019s base salary was worth \u00a31m, according to the bank\u2019s annual report, published late on Thursday. Duffy also had a car allowance of \u00a330,000 and another \u00a319,784 in further benefits that included travel from his home to work. The Irish executive splits his time between properties in Cork, Glasgow and London, according to a 2016 Irish Times interview. Duffy\u2019s bonus payments were reduced by \u00a3175,000 to account for weak share price performance over the year. Investors had questioned whether the bank would have enough money to meet regulatory requirements for capital buffers in case of a financial shock, as it battled a weakening British economy and the costs of merging CYBG and Virgin Money and rebranding to the latter. However, investors shrugged off the PPI hit and piled back into shares on Thursday, as investors welcomed a capital preservation plan revealed separately earlier in the day which included suspending the dividend. Shares jumped by 19% to 170p, hitting levels not seen since the end of July, when the pre-merger CYBG reported pressure on its lending income. The bank officially changed its name from CYBG at the end of October, but Duffy said it had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the integration and rebrand. Virgin Money, created from the remnants of the failed Northern Rock, was the smaller bank before the merger, but executives it judged had a stronger, Richard Branson-backed brand than CYBG\u2019s Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. The bank made a statutory loss after tax of \u00a3194m for the year to 30 September, because of the costs of restructuring following the deal, as well as the extra money set aside to pay for compensation for \u00a3385m in mis-sold PPI. The bank\u2019s measure of underlying profit, stripping out those costs, came in at \u00a3539m, 7% lower compared with last year.xDuffy said the bank had experienced an \u201cunprecedented surge in PPI information requests in August\u201d after the City regulator set a final deadline of 29 August for the claims, which have so far cost banks more than \u00a352bn. The provision was within the bank\u2019s previous guidance to investors. Banks and other financial institutions pushed PPI policies between 1990 and 2010 alongside loans, credit cards and other deals, telling consumers it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment. However in many cases, exclusions in the small print meant customers could never make a claim. The late summer deadline prompted a rush of claims by customers that has surprised bank executives and investors, and has led to massive provisions across the sector. Lloyds, which runs the UK\u2019s biggest branch network, last month took a \u00a31.8bn hit, while Barclays set aside another \u00a31.4bn. Banking analysts said Virgin Money had answered concerns over whether it had enough capital to stay above regulatory requirements, even after taking into account the PPI hit. The suspension of the dividend had already been expected in order to preserve capital. The bank said its \u201cprogressive and sustainable dividend ambition remains\u201d, and it would consider reinstating the payouts during the next year. Investors were also heartened by growth of 16.1% year-on-year in personal lending. The company said this was driven by \u201chigh-quality\u201d growth in the Virgin Money credit card, and improvements to its salary finance and online loans. Duffy said the results represented \u201ca good operating performance in challenging conditions\u201d.

The 75-year-old stands trial alongside Mackrell, with both men pleading not guilty to the charges in pre-trial hearings.</p> <p>Opening the prosecution\u2019s case, Richard Matthews QC says: \u201cDuckenfield\u2019s criminal responsibility for the deaths ... flows from his gross failure to discharge his personal responsibility as match commander.\u201d Ben Myers QC, setting out Duckenfield\u2019s defence, said he was being \u201csingled out unfairly\u201d.</p> <p><strong>3 April</strong></p> <p>The jury fail to return a verdict on Duckenfield\u2019s charge, after deliberating for eight days. Mackrell is found guilty, by a majority of 10-2, of breaching his legal duty to take reasonable care at work for people\u2019s safety, in relation to the allocation of turnstiles for the match.</p> <p>Matthews tells the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, that the CPS will seek a retrial for Duckenfield on the same charge. Mackrell is later fined \u00a36,500 following his conviction.</p> <p><strong>25 June</strong></p> <p>Just over a month after the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Openshaw rules that Duckenfield will face a retrial, to begin at Preston crown court in October.</p> <p><strong>7 October</strong></p> <p>Duckenfield\u2019s retrial begins. Proceedings are relayed live to the Cunard building in Liverpool, to allow survivors and families of the victims to attend more easily.</p> <p><strong>28 November</strong></p> <p>Duckenfield is found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter, after the jury spend three days considering their verdict. Openshaw had earlier told the 10-person jury he would accept a majority verdict, on which at least nine of the 10 jurors agreed.</p>",

It adds that errors and omissions in the stadium\u2019s layout and design, and its lack of a valid safety certificate also contributed to the tragedy, as did Sheffield Wednesday FC\u2019s preparation for the match. On the question of whether the club\u2019s actions on the day of the game were a contributory factor, the jury could not say for sure but said they may have been. Errors and omissions by the South Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service were also said to contribute to the disaster. 2017 29 June Following Operation Resolve, the CPS charge Duckenfield, the police officer in command of the match, with manslaughter by gross negligence. The charge relates to 95 of the people who died at Hillsborough. No charge could be brought in relation to the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, in 1993. Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, is charged with two counts of breaching his duties under safety legislation. 2019 14 January Duckenfield\u2019s trial begins at Preston crown court. The 75-year-old stands trial alongside Mackrell, with both men pleading not guilty to the charges in pre-trial hearings. Opening the prosecution\u2019s case, Richard Matthews QC says: \u201cDuckenfield\u2019s criminal responsibility for the deaths ... flows from his gross failure to discharge his personal responsibility as match commander.\u201d Ben Myers QC, setting out Duckenfield\u2019s defence, said he was being \u201csingled out unfairly\u201d. 3 April The jury fail to return a verdict on Duckenfield\u2019s charge, after deliberating for eight days. Mackrell is found guilty, by a majority of 10-2, of breaching his legal duty to take reasonable care at work for people\u2019s safety, in relation to the allocation of turnstiles for the match. Matthews tells the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, that the CPS will seek a retrial for Duckenfield on the same charge. Mackrell is later fined \u00a36,500 following his conviction. 25 June Just over a month after the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Openshaw rules that Duckenfield will face a retrial, to begin at Preston crown court in October. 7 October Duckenfield\u2019s retrial begins. Proceedings are relayed live to the Cunard building in Liverpool, to allow survivors and families of the victims to attend more easily. 28 November Duckenfield is found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter, after the jury spend three days considering their verdict. Openshaw had earlier told the 10-person jury he would accept a majority verdict, on which at least nine of the 10 jurors agreed.",

Jonathan was oddly lacking in self-esteem and would ask us endlessly \u201cDo you think this is all right?\u201d, to which the answer was inevitably \u201cJonathan, it\u2019s wonderful\u201d. His question \u201cIt\u2019s rather good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d became the publisher\u2019s and my catchphrase for the project.

A week after Mrs Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979, he began his column with the words \u201cNow that the incoming Tory Government has made greed patriotic...\u201d Not much has changed in the past 40 years.<br><strong>John Marriott</strong><br><em>North Hykeham, Lincolnshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Clive James\u2019s TV reviews for the Observer were so funny. He once described the formidable dog and horse trainer Barbara Woodhouse, whose techniques included breathing up the horse\u2019s nostrils. \u201cAfter that, the beast will do her bidding, and so would you.\u201d<br><strong>Peter Lowthian</strong><br><em>Marlow, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Not only was Clive James a remarkable writer, he was also extraordinarily self-deprecating. When I helped run the Oxford University Literary Society when he was at the height of his fame he offered to speak for us and waived his fee, because, in his words, \u201cI am embarrassed by how abysmal I was last time I spoke at the university.\u201d<br><strong>Steven Pollard</strong><br><em>Pertenhall, Bedfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 So sad to hear that Clive James has died \u2013 he had cheated death for so long that it seemed he would last for ever. Too much to hope for, of course, but we have an amazing body of work to remember him by, including some of the most moving poetry I have ever read.<br><strong>Cherry Weston</strong><br><em>Wolverhampton</em></p> <p>\u2022 I will always be grateful to Jonathan Miller for one thing.

      "bodyText": "In a world increasingly populated by charlatans and idiots, we have just lost two outstanding intelligent, funny and talented individuals in one day \u2013 Jonathan Miller and Clive James (Obituaries, 28 November). Although quite different in many respects, both contributed in intellect and humour in ways we so desperately need right now. Both are irreplaceable, whereas our television screens and newspapers are now full of people whose disappearance would be no loss if they were to vanish tomorrow. Miller\u2019s description of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1980s Britain could be, word for word, an apt description of both Theresa May\u2019s and Boris Johnson\u2019s tenure in Downing Street. As we face a dreadful world of Brexit and Trump, more than ever, where are others like them? Garth Groombridge Southampton \u2022 The highlight of my design career was having the good fortune to work with Jonathan Miller, designing his book that accompanied the National Gallery exhibition On Reflection in 1998. Jonathan was oddly lacking in self-esteem and would ask us endlessly \u201cDo you think this is all right?\u201d, to which the answer was inevitably \u201cJonathan, it\u2019s wonderful\u201d. His question \u201cIt\u2019s rather good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d became the publisher\u2019s and my catchphrase for the project. He was rather good in so, so many ways. Chlo\u00eb Alexander Ludlow, Shropshire \u2022 The one quote from Clive James that I shall always remember dates from the time he was the Observer\u2019s TV critic. A week after Mrs Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979, he began his column with the words \u201cNow that the incoming Tory Government has made greed patriotic...\u201d Not much has changed in the past 40 years. John Marriott North Hykeham, Lincolnshire \u2022 Clive James\u2019s TV reviews for the Observer were so funny. He once described the formidable dog and horse trainer Barbara Woodhouse, whose techniques included breathing up the horse\u2019s nostrils. \u201cAfter that, the beast will do her bidding, and so would you.\u201d Peter Lowthian Marlow, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Not only was Clive James a remarkable writer, he was also extraordinarily self-deprecating. When I helped run the Oxford University Literary Society when he was at the height of his fame he offered to speak for us and waived his fee, because, in his words, \u201cI am embarrassed by how abysmal I was last time I spoke at the university.\u201d Steven Pollard Pertenhall, Bedfordshire \u2022 So sad to hear that Clive James has died \u2013 he had cheated death for so long that it seemed he would last for ever. Too much to hope for, of course, but we have an amazing body of work to remember him by, including some of the most moving poetry I have ever read. Cherry Weston Wolverhampton \u2022 I will always be grateful to Jonathan Miller for one thing. He once defended the piles of unread books in his home by explaining that he absorbed the contents \u201cby osmosis\u201d. That\u2019s the perfect excuse for me to buy more books, so thank you, Jonathan. Giles Oakley East Sheen, London \u2022 Jonathan Miller was a brilliant man who, when interviewed many years ago, memorably described himself: \u201cI\u2019m not really a Jew; just Jew-ish, not the whole hog.\u201d Peter Negri Alpington, Norfolk \u2022 Clive James wrote: \u201cHemingway was always killing something. He called it an appetite for life.\u201d Wonderful. Brendan O\u2019Brien Waterford, Ireland \u2022 Clive James and Jonathan Miller dead: just when we\u2019re most in need of an increase in the gross national IQ, we get a drastic reduction.

      "bodyText": "The Cabinet Office has defied a court order to release a secret government report on the UK\u2019s fracking industry. Officials were expected to hand over the report on Monday, days before Britain\u2019s first general election leaders\u2019 debate on the climate crisis, after the information tribunal ruled it was in the public interest to disclose its findings in full. The Cabinet Office is understood to have received the tribunal\u2019s order to release the documents on 28 October after a multi-year battle with Greenpeace, but by Thursday evening the government had yet to hand over the 2016 report or give an explanation for ignoring the court order. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cThe Tories\u2019 failure to publish this crucial report on fracking shows contempt for democracy and serves as a stark warning on what lies ahead if Boris Johnson is re-elected.\u201d Labour said the government\u2019s refusal to reveal the documents cast doubt over its commitment to end fracking in England, weeks after it declared a fracking moratorium in the run-up to the election. \u201cLabour will ban fracking, expand the Freedom of Information Act and introduce tough new transparency rules,\u201d Trickett added. Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the government was \u201cignoring the courts in order to avoid scrutiny of this dangerous and dirty industry\u201d. The campaign group uncovered some of the report\u2019s findings last year through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request but its investigations arm was barred by Cabinet Office officials from obtaining the full report. The FoI revealed that government ministers had known for years that fracking companies had exaggerated the economic benefits of the UK shale gas boom. It showed that only 4% of the UK\u2019s potential shale projects were likely to go ahead, contradicting public claims that a shale revolution could spur \u00a333bn of investment and create more than 64,000 jobs. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what further revelations are in the report they\u2019re still hiding, but the government are clearly very keen that the public don\u2019t find out, which makes it all the more important that we do,\u201d Parr said. As part of its ruling, the information tribunal said it had noted \u201can unfortunate tendency\u201d on the part of the Cabinet Office to be content to release positive information about the fracking industry but \u201canxious to withhold more negative information\u201d. \u201cIt is no secret that the government supported the development of the industry and the report was designed to address how the government could help it to develop; it was in our view in the public interest that the public should know how far officials were suggesting government might go in doing so,\u201d it said. It is understood the Cabinet Office will comply with the ruling in due course. It declined to comment on the reason behind the delay. Boris Johnson snubbed the leaders\u2019 debate on the climate, which was due to take place on Thursday evening.",

      "bodyText": "Twelve EU countries, including Ireland, have blocked a proposed new rule that would have forced multinational companies to reveal how much profit they make and how little tax they pay in each of the 28 member states. The proposed directive was designed to shine a light on how some of the world\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 such as Apple, Facebook and Google \u2013 avoid paying an estimated $500bn a year in taxes by shifting their profits from higher-tax countries such as the UK, France and Germany to zero-tax or low-tax jurisdictions including Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta. Ireland is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current rules. The country hosts corporate offices that collect revenue and profits generated by many multinational companies across the EU bloc. Ireland allows global technology companies to pay corporation tax at rate as low as 6.25%, compared with 19% in the UK. Ireland\u2019s decision to vote against the proposed directive \u2013 which would have forced companies to report their revenues and profits on a country-by-country basis \u2013 came as the Irish tax-and-spending watchdog warned that the country\u2019s economy could collapse if there was a global clampdown on tax avoidance. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) warned on Thursday that the country\u2019s economy has become so reliant on taxes paid by multinationals that half of all of corporate taxes paid in the nation come from just 10 global companies.

Sweden also voted against the proposed rule, but because its government feared that the directive might water down their higher standards on transparency. France, Spain and the Netherlands were among those voting for the proposals. Germany abstained. The UK, which had been one of the biggest supporters of tougher measures to tackle multinational tax avoidance, did not vote. The Treasury said this was because the UK is in purdah before the general election. The vote came more than three years after the European commission promised to expose multinational corporations\u2019 tax avoidance measures following the Panama Papers revelations. The proposal would have made country-by-country reporting mandatory for companies with an annual turnover of more than \u20ac750m. Elena Gaita, a senior policy officer at anti-corruption charity Transparency International, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an outrage that member states have once again put the interests of big business above those of citizens. \u201cEverywhere across the EU we see that the public is unhappy about multinationals, like Starbucks and Amazon, hiding the tax that they pay in countries they operate in.

It warned that between \u20ac2bn-\u20ac6bn (\u00a31.7bn-\u00a35bn) of the \u20ac10bn total corporate tax take is what it calls \u201cexcess\u201d. \u201cIn other words, beyond what would be expected based on the economy\u2019s underlying performance and historical and international norms.\u201d The budgetary watchdog said the Irish government had become increasingly reliant on corporate tax receipts, which rose to a record \u20ac10.4bn last year, more than double the amount collected in 2014. \u201cThe reliance on these volatile receipts leaves the government vulnerable to changes to the global tax environment, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) base erosion and profit shifting initiative,\u201d IFAC said. The OECD is trying to force big-tech companies, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, to pay more tax in countries where they actually sell their products and services. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate is 12.5% but it charges only 6.25% for profits linked to a company\u2019s patent or intellectual property. The IFAC, which plays a similar role to the UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility, said that corporation tax as a share of total Irish tax revenue in 2018 reached a record 18.7%. In the UK corporation tax makes up just 7% of the total tax take. The European commission has ruled that a sweetheart deal agreed by Apple and Ireland was illegal state aid and helped the US tech firm avoid \u20ac13bn in tax. The deal slashed Apple\u2019s tax rate to as little as 0.005%. The commission has ordered Apple to repay Ireland the entire sum but the two parties are appealing against the decision at Europe\u2019s general court.",

Astana didn\u2019t turn up in the first half, but they came out resurgent in the second, and experience proved too much for youth in the end. Mind you, had Tahith Chong not missed that open goal ... 90 min +2: The Astana Arena prepares to party. OK, this might not be peak Manchester United. But they are still Manchester United. And the minnows from Kazakhstan are about to beat the famous Manchester United. 90 min: Levitt has a whack from 35 yards. Full marks for ambition. Rangelo Janga replaces Roman Murtazayev. There will be three minutes of added time. 88 min: Lingard is booked for a late clatter on Rukavina. Then the seventh United debutant of the evening arrives, Ethan Galbraith replacing Angel Gomes. 87 min: Pertsukh robs Levitt in the midfield, and sets Maevski away down the right. Bernard does extremely well to stick to the Astana man and snuff out the attack. 85 min: Sergei Khizhnichenko makes way for Yuri Pertsukh. 84 min: Laird busies himself down the right, and his sheer persistence wins a free kick just outside the box. Before it can be taken, James Garner makes way for Largie Ramazani. 83 min: Shomko sees yellow for sliding in unnecessarily on Greenwood. 81 min: Beysebekov is booked for a cynical tug on Lingard. 80 min: United have stepped it up again. Laird, who has been extremely impressive on the attack, wins another corner down the right. The ball\u2019s hit long, and Gomes whips it back in from the left flank. Eric is worried about it sailing into the top right, but it goes wide, and he withdraws his hand just before making any contact. 78 min: Another sensational save by Eric! Gomes bursts infield from the left and rolls a pass across to Greenwood, who shapes like Zidane at Hampden in 2002 and batters a rising shot towards the top right. He\u2019s denied by the keeper\u2019s strong hand. The corner leads to nowt. 77 min: United come back at the hosts, Garner and Gomes combining well down the middle. The latter\u2019s bundled over, and it\u2019s a free kick just outside the D. Gomes takes, whipping the ball over the wall and down towards the top-left corner. It\u2019s going in, but Eric fingertips over the bar. A magnificent free kick, and a save to match. The corner comes to nothing. 75 min: Astana are looking for a third. Sigurjonsson has another attempt, coming in from the right, only to be denied by Bernard. Then Murtazayev tries to replicate Lingard\u2019s first-half goal, but his effort flies wide of the bottom-right corner. 73 min: Gomes glides in from the left and tees up Lingard, whose curler towards the top right is deflected out for a corner kick. Greenwood whips it in. Eric flaps, but does just enough to get it away from bother. Astana go straight up the other end and nearly score a picturebook goal: Rukavina deep on the right to Shomko on the left, Shomko inside to Rotario, who shuttles the ball on to Sigurjonsson by the right of the D. He whistles a low drive millimetres past the right-hand post. 72 min: Shaw turns on the jets and whizzes down the left. His cutback nearly finds Gomes in space in the area, but several yellow shirts swarm the single red one, and that is that. 70 min: There\u2019s no point having a shot from those sort of distances, unless you\u2019re Cristiano Ronaldo or Marcus Rashford. So United pass it around instead, and keep hold of possession. 69 min: Logvinenko is booked for an agricultural lunge on Lingard. A free kick to United, 35 yards out. 67 min: Sigurjonsson warms Grant\u2019s hands from distance. Then United go up the other end and win their first corner for a while, Greenwood\u2019s persistence a factor. A game of pinball ensues, only to end when the flag goes up for offside. \u201cChong had time enough to light up a cig if he wanted to,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cInstead he misses. Ah, the travails of youth.\u201d 65 min: D\u2019Mani Bughail-Mellor replaces Tahith Chong, who will wonder how he didn\u2019t get on the scoresheet tonight. He\u2019ll never get an easier chance in his whole career. Ah well, while it hurts now, the experience should stand him in good stead. 64 min: Khizhnichenko nearly breaks clear down the right, but is shepherded away from danger by Bernard, who has done very well to clear his head after that own goal. An awful slice of luck. Astana rip United apart with some pretty triangulation down the right. A ball\u2019s suddenly slipped down the inside-right channel for Rukavina, who is sprung clear into the box. Where\u2019s Shaw? Anyway, Rukavina pulls the ball back ... and it smacks off Bernard\u2019s head and into the top-right corner, past a wrong-footed Grant. What terrible luck for young Bernard. A freak goal, albeit at the end of a lovely passing move. 60 min: From the resulting free kick, sent in from the left by Sigurjonsson, Shaw does extremely well to flick a header out of harm\u2019s way with yellow shirts lurking everywhere. The corner that results is a waste of time. But United\u2019s very young team are under the cosh now. 59 min: Levitt is booked for a garden variety coming together with Beysebekov in the midfield. There really didn\u2019t seem much in that, it\u2019s a very strange decision. 57 min: A big 38 seconds, that. Astana have been a completely different team since the restart. The thin margins of success and failure. Shaw bursts down the left , draws the Astana keeper Eric, and rolls the ball across the face of goal. All Chong has to do is tap it in ... but he leans back and misses it, blazing it over the bar! How on earth? And then, 38 seconds later, a ball slipped down the inside-left channel finds Shomko just inside the United area, Shomko whips it across Grant and into the bottom right. 54 min: Something for the home fans to shout about! A free kick out on the left leads to a game of pinball in the United box. Eventually the ball falls to Maevski, who fires a shot inches wide of the left-hand post. 53 min: There\u2019s not a great deal to excite the crowd at the minute. Lingard overruns the ball when presented with a pocket of space just outside the Astana box. The busy Postnikov blooters it long for Khizhnichenko but the striker\u2019s miles offside. 51 min: United get their foot on the ball for the first time since the restart. They don\u2019t go anywhere but that\u2019s not the point. A modicum of control has been reestablished. 49 min: A free kick for Astana out on the right. Rotariu swings it in deep. Postnikov gets a head to the ball but his effort is soft and an easy one for Grant. 48 min: Astana are clearly moving around with more pace and purpose. Beysebekov powers down the left and fires a low ball across the face of goal. Bernard blocks, but in a very uncoordinated fashion, slicing the ball backwards over his own crossbar. Nothing comes of the corner. 46 min: Astana have presumably been given a good talking-to by their manager Roman Grygorchuk. Beysebekov and Murtazayev combine well down the left to win a corner. From the dead ball, Postnikov heads well over the bar. We\u2019re off again! No half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. United\u2019s young team have acquitted themselves very well. Though how much Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has learned from their performance is moot, given how bad Astana have been. They\u2019re giving United all the time in the world to play. But you can only beat what\u2019s in front of you, eh. 45 min: Murtazayev hoicks a shot miles into the air. Fortunately the roof\u2019s shut, or that ball would be halfway to Beijing. 44 min: Lingard sets Greenwood clear down the middle. The flag goes up for offside, correctly, and the whistle goes. Greenwood scoops the ball over Eric and into the net anyway, earning himself a comprehensive bollocking from the referee. But no yellow card. 43 min: Shomko makes off down the left. He\u2019s got men in the box. And slaps his cross into the first man. Astana have been dismal. 41 min: Shaw finds Greenwood out on the right with a glorious crossfield spray. Greenwood lays off to Chong, who runs down a cul-de-sac. 39 min: Sigurjonsson is booked for an unnecessarily hard lunge on Lingard. His studs crumped on the top of Lingard\u2019s boot, and you\u2019ve seen red cards given for that. As it is, he\u2019s still on the pitch, with a guilty but not particularly contrite smile spread across his cheeky face. 37 min: United continue to boss possession, though. They\u2019re not doing a great deal with it at present, but control isn\u2019t to be sniffed at. The home crowd are getting a little bit testy. 35 min: So having said that, Beysebekov, coming in from the left, meets a deep cross coming in from the other flank. He sends a meaty shot goalwards, forcing Grant into his first save of the evening. He makes it with ease. Safe hands. 34 min: Shomko launches long, in the 1980s style. Murtazayev is caught miles offside. Grant gathers the ball. He\u2019s had absolutely nothing to do. 32 min: Lingard has a whack from distance. His shot takes a huge deflection off Postnikov, looping up over the stranded keeper Eric and nearly dropping into the empty net. Nearly. The ball settles on the roof of the net, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. 30 min: The lull continues. Astana caused United a few problems at Old Trafford. Not many, but a few. They\u2019re causing their visitors no bother tonight. Some of these young lads will be thinking big boys\u2019 football is a doddle. 28 min: A lull. United\u2019s travelling support have just belted out 2019\u2019s first rendition of their festive 12 Cantonas song. Too early? Nah. It\u2019s snowy, and the John Lewis advert has been out for a good week or so. 26 min: Logvinenko has a dig from the best part of 30 yards. Nope! 24 min: Garner is eased off the ball by Maevski, illegally from behind. A free kick 30 yards out. Greenwood fancies it, and blooters it straight into the wall. 22 min: Astana should be level. Beysebekov glides in from the left, and plays a diagonal pass into the area that cuts out Shaw, who is totally oblivious to Rotariu lurking behind him. Rotariu\u2019s instant slapshot flies wide right from eight yards. He had to at least hit the target there. No idea what Shaw was thinking of there. Not much, is my wild guess. 20 min: United are in total control here. Chong drives towards the box with options either side, but fails to pick a penetrative pass. Then another run by Laird, who tears down the right flank, cuts back to see off Shomko with great ease, and tees up Lingard for a wild hoick. This Laird looks the business. 18 min: Another positive run by Laird, who reaches the byline and pulls a ball back into the Astana box. It\u2019s intercepted and cleared before it can find Greenwood. 16 min: Gomes makes good towards the Astana box down the middle. He slips the ball out right for Chong, who feeds Laird on the overlap. Laird lashes a shot-cum-cross straight into the arms of Eric. A decent move, with the right-back Laird showcasing his attack-minded philosophy. 14 min: The first job for Lee Grant to do. A free kick for Astana out on the left. Sigurjonsson swings it into the mixer, and it\u2019s easy pickings for the former Derby County, Sheffield Wednesday and Burnley keeper. 13 min: Replays show Lingard\u2019s shot taking a slight deflection off Sigurjonsson\u2019s boot. A fine effort nonetheless. 12 min: That goal had been coming. United have started very brightly, while the home side are struggling to string more than a couple of passes together at any one time. Lingard drops deep and powers towards the Astana area. He slips a pass wide right for Chong; his attempt at a curler into the top left is blocked. But United pick up possession again, Shaw cutting in from the left. He slips the ball to Lingard, who from the edge of the box takes a stride and larrups a low shot across Eric and into the bottom right. What a way to mark your first match as Manchester United captain! 8 min: Shaw sets Greenwood away down the left, but the young striker has gone far too early and the flag goes up for offside. United are well on the front foot here. 7 min: United look dangerous. Gomes strides down the left, cuts into the box and shoots. The Astana back line comes together and closes the door just in time. 6 min: Nothing much comes of that, Eric smothering the ball with Greenwood in reasonably close attendance. 5 min: United continue to knock it around. Suddenly they pick up the pace, Lingard sliding a pass down the inside-left channel for Greenwood, who shoots violently towards the goal from a not particularly promising angle. But he gets his effort on target, forcing Eric to parry. Corner coming up. 4 min: A bright end-to-end start as Chong tears off down the right. He doesn\u2019t have a whole load of support, though, and is forced to check back. But United keep hold of possession and ping it around confidently in a very pretty style. 2 min: A long pass down the Astana left. Murtazayev chases and wins a corner off Tuanzebe. United deal with the set piece with ease. Here we go, then! United\u2019s youthful team kick off. A feel of the ball for everyone at the back. Solskjaer shouts his encouragement from the bench. A few footballing journeys begin right here. The teams are out! It\u2019s a comparatively balmy eight degrees centigrade in the Astana Arena. The roof\u2019s closed, you see. It\u2019s minus 13 outside. A lovely scene in the tunnel beforehand, as Jesse Lingard made a concerted effort to say hello and talk to all of the mascots, making the young ones feel at ease. A lot of extremely wide smiles as they look up to the Manchester United captain with saucer eyes. Sweet. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Ole! \u201cIt\u2019s a great chance for the young players. A chance to show what they can do. It\u2019s the start of something special I\u2019m sure. One or two of these, we\u2019ll definitely see a lot more of them. It\u2019s exciting for us as coaches to see where we are at. Of course we want to win the game, but being away from home, and with such a long way to travel, this was the sensible decision. We\u2019ve got a game on Sunday again. And we give the youth a chance to play in front of 30,000 people, to play men\u2019s football, to get experience. Max Taylor has been an inspiration for all of us, we are so happy he is here. It\u2019s great for the other boys to see that setbacks are sometimes part of life and you can fight back from it.\u201d United\u2019s inner sanctum. Here\u2019s their kit laid out in the changing room ahead of the match. Confirmation that they\u2019ll be playing in their world-famous red shirts. Astana will be in their first-choice yellow. Hanging on the dressing-room door: the pennant captain Jesse Lingard will hand over to his opposite number, Nenad Eric. As expected, teenagers Ethan Laird, Di\u2019Shon Bernard and Dylan Levitt make their Manchester United debuts. The veteran goalkeeper Lee Grant also makes his first United start. Laird (18) is a right-back who likes to bomb forward in the modern style; Bernard (19) plays in the centre of defence; and Levitt (19) is a central midfielder who can pick a pass. The 19-year-old defender Max Taylor, thankfully fit and healthy now after his cancer treatment, is on the bench. Astana: Eric, Rukavina, Postnikov, Logvinenko, Shomko, Beysebekov, Maewski, Sigurjonsson, Rotariu, Sergei Khizhnichenko, Murtazaev. Subs: Muzhikov, Pertsukh, Zhakipbayev, Janga, Mokin, Zhalmukan, Prokopenko. Manchester United: Grant, Laird, Tuanzebe, Bernard, Shaw, Garner, Levitt, Chong, Lingard, Gomes, Greenwood. Subs: Puigmal, Bughail-Mellor, Kovar, Taylor, Galbraith, Ramazani, Mengi. Referee: Donatas Rumsas (Lithuania). Welcome to our coverage of Manchester United\u2019s experimental seminar in Kazakhstan. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are already through to the knockout stage of the Europa League, so this fixture against Astana presents a chance to field some debutants. Teenagers Ethan Laird, Di\u2019Shon Bernard and Dylan Levitt, and 36-year-old goalkeeper Lee Grant, are expected to make their debuts at some point. There\u2019s also a feelgood story in 19-year-old defender Max Taylor\u2019s inclusion, promoted to the senior squad for the first time since cancer treatment. So while on the one hand this match doesn\u2019t mean very much, on the other it means everything. The game kicks off at 3.50pm GMT, 9.50pm in the Astana Arena in Nur\u2013Sultan. The roof will be closed, which is just as well because temperatures outside are set to dip below -12 degrees centigrade. It\u2019s on ... and we hope your hats, scarves and coats are too.",

      "bodyText": "The government has failed to reach its recruitment targets for secondary school teacher trainees for a seventh year in a row, raising fears that schools in England face shortages in key subjects such as maths, physics and foreign languages. Figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) show that while there was a slight increase in overall numbers starting teacher training in 2019, the figure for secondary school teachers was just 85% of the total required by the government\u2019s teacher supply model. The figures show particularly high failure rates in recruiting specialist physics, modern foreign languages, maths, chemistry and computing teacher trainees, including just 43% of the estimated numbers for physics, which was even lower than last year\u2019s 47%. There were some successes, with above-forecast recruitment in biology, geography and history, including 66% more specialist biology trainees. The proportion of primary school trainees was close to the DfE\u2019s target at 96%. Union leaders said the shortages were becoming more acute as children from a recent mini baby boom progressed from primary to secondary school. Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cPupil numbers in state-funded secondary schools have already risen by almost 150,000 since 2014 and will rise by a further third of a million pupils over the next five years. \u201cEven where trainee targets have been met, recruitment to initial teacher training courses is just the very start. New teachers need dedicated support to help them develop into competent professionals. Once we have invested in their skills, we must not lose their passion and experience.\u201d Courtney said the government was still failing to account for past under-recruitment and not doing enough to prevent teachers from leaving the profession, with around a third of new recruits leaving within five years. The DfE\u2019s own forecasts suggest a nearly 15% rise in the secondary school population by 2027, adding around 400,000 pupils in state secondary schools in England. Successive governments have struggled to attract and retain teachers with computing, maths and physics degrees because of high demand in the wider workforce. In the case of modern foreign languages, the DfE said the shortfall was partly due to setting a higher recruitment target this year. The government had previously announced efforts to raise teacher starting salaries to \u00a330,000 as part of a recruitment and retention strategy designed to maintain the workforce in England. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the repeated missed targets showed the Conservatives could not be trusted to meet their own forecasts in government. \u201cThey have no plan to deal with the crisis they have created in teacher recruitment and retention, and their spending pledge amounts to a 13-year real-terms freeze, meaning four in five state schools in England will be financially worse off next year,\u201d Rayner said.",

Thanksgiving has increasingly drawn <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/thanksgiving-history.html\">criticism</a> for glossing over the disastrous impact of white settlement on Native Americans.</p> <p>Since 1970, the United American Indians of New England organisation has held a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving day, to remember \u201cthe genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture\u201d, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The National Day of Mourning takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, an early place of European settlement.</p> <p>Wounded Knee, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/11/27/soldiers-got-medals-honor-massacring-native-americans-this-bill-would-take-them-away/\">described by the Washington Post </a>as \u201cone of most shameful and bloody acts of violence against indigenous people in American history\u201d, occurred on 29 December 1890.</p> <p>Chief Big Foot, who led the Minneconjou Lakota, was guiding his people to refuge in South Dakota when US soldiers stopped them. The group surrendered and was taken to Wounded Knee Creek, \u201csurrounded by 470 soldiers and their formidable artillery\u201d, the Post wrote.</p> <p>While exact details of the massacre have proved difficult to determine, it is believed there was a dispute while soldiers were trying to disarm the chief\u2019s men. It is also thought a gunshot prompted American forces to attack. Between 150 and 400 Native Americans were killed. Historians agree most of the victims were women and children.</p> <p>Twenty members of the 7th cavalry involved in Wounded Knee received the Medal of Honor, which is <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/history.html\">described</a> by the Army as \u201cthe nation\u2019s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces\u201d.</p> <p>A large number of the medals were awarded for \u201cgallantry\u201d and \u201cbravery\u201d even though there are few details of purported acts of heroism, the Post noted.</p> <p>Maj Gen Nelson A Miles, an army commander, wrote of the incident: \u201cI have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee.\u201d</p> <p>According to a letter cited by the Post, Miles described the victims as \u201cwomen with little children on their backs, and small children powder-burned by the men who killed them being so near as to burn the flesh and clothing with the powder of their guns, and nursing babies with five bullet holes through them\u201d.</p> <p>While the Medal of Honor was granted more loosely in the 19th century, scholars have noted that the number of Wounded Knee recipients is high. Antietam, an 1862 civil war battle considered the \u201cbloodiest day in US history\u201d, also led to 20 awards.</p> <p>Native Americans have long pushed for the revocation of medals awarded to Wounded Knee soldiers. Since 1997, the National Congress of American Indians has greenlighted resolutions requesting the removal of medals.</p> <p>Congress formally apologized in 1990, stating \u201cdeep regret on behalf of the United States to the descendants of the victims and survivors and their respective tribal communities\u201d. But, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/50a20c85ffbac9a6e627b577abc8715a\">reported</a>, lawmakers did not offer any type of reparations.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley have announced legislation that would strip Medals of Honor from US soldiers who carried out the Wounded Knee massacre, killing hundreds of mostly unarmed Native Americans. A House bill on the subject was introduced in June by representatives including Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat who is one of the first female Native American US lawmakers. \u201cThe horrifying acts of violence against hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee should be condemned, not celebrated with Medals of Honor,\u201d said Warren, from Massachusetts, who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThe Remove the Stain Act acknowledges a profoundly shameful event in US history, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m joining my House colleagues in this effort to advance justice and take a step toward righting wrongs against Native peoples.\u201d In a statement, Haaland said the act was \u201cabout more than just rescinding Medals of Honor from soldiers who served in the US 7th Cavalry and massacred unarmed Lakota women and children [in 1890] \u2013 it\u2019s also about making people aware of this country\u2019s history of genocide of American Indians.\u201d Donald Trump has referenced Wounded Knee in mocking Warren\u2019s claim to Native American heritage. The senators\u2019 announcement came on Wednesday, a day before Thanksgiving, the federal holiday commemorating a 1621 harvest meal shared by Native Americans and Pilgrims. Thanksgiving has increasingly drawn criticism for glossing over the disastrous impact of white settlement on Native Americans. Since 1970, the United American Indians of New England organisation has held a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving day, to remember \u201cthe genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture\u201d, according to the Associated Press. The National Day of Mourning takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, an early place of European settlement. Wounded Knee, described by the Washington Post as \u201cone of most shameful and bloody acts of violence against indigenous people in American history\u201d, occurred on 29 December 1890. Chief Big Foot, who led the Minneconjou Lakota, was guiding his people to refuge in South Dakota when US soldiers stopped them. The group surrendered and was taken to Wounded Knee Creek, \u201csurrounded by 470 soldiers and their formidable artillery\u201d, the Post wrote. While exact details of the massacre have proved difficult to determine, it is believed there was a dispute while soldiers were trying to disarm the chief\u2019s men. It is also thought a gunshot prompted American forces to attack. Between 150 and 400 Native Americans were killed. Historians agree most of the victims were women and children. Twenty members of the 7th cavalry involved in Wounded Knee received the Medal of Honor, which is described by the Army as \u201cthe nation\u2019s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces\u201d. A large number of the medals were awarded for \u201cgallantry\u201d and \u201cbravery\u201d even though there are few details of purported acts of heroism, the Post noted. Maj Gen Nelson A Miles, an army commander, wrote of the incident: \u201cI have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee.\u201d According to a letter cited by the Post, Miles described the victims as \u201cwomen with little children on their backs, and small children powder-burned by the men who killed them being so near as to burn the flesh and clothing with the powder of their guns, and nursing babies with five bullet holes through them\u201d. While the Medal of Honor was granted more loosely in the 19th century, scholars have noted that the number of Wounded Knee recipients is high. Antietam, an 1862 civil war battle considered the \u201cbloodiest day in US history\u201d, also led to 20 awards. Native Americans have long pushed for the revocation of medals awarded to Wounded Knee soldiers. Since 1997, the National Congress of American Indians has greenlighted resolutions requesting the removal of medals. Congress formally apologized in 1990, stating \u201cdeep regret on behalf of the United States to the descendants of the victims and survivors and their respective tribal communities\u201d. But, the Associated Press reported, lawmakers did not offer any type of reparations.",

      "bodyText": "Banks and building societies are reporting a last-minute surge in applications for a government savings scheme offering people up to \u00a33,000 of \u201cfree\u201d money. The help-to-buy Isa, which helps people save towards a deposit on their first home, closes to new savers at midnight on Saturday 30 November. The account was launched at the end of 2015 and is judged by many commentators to have been a success: the latest Treasury data shows that more than 256,000 homes worth a total of \u00a344bn have so far been bought using the Isa. The accounts are available from banks and building societies, many of which have reported an 11th hour surge in interest. Nationwide said it had seen \u201ca sharp uplift in applications\u201d in recent weeks, adding: \u201cWith each day we get closer to the deadline, volumes increase even further.\u201d Santander said it had seen a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in applications. If someone saving up to buy their first home puts money into the Isa, the government will boost their savings by 25%. So for every \u00a3200 saved, first-time buyers can receive a bonus of \u00a350. The maximum government bonus is \u00a33,000, although to receive that an account-holdermust have saved \u00a312,000. When both members of a couple sign up, the maximum total bonus is \u00a36,000. Those who sign up before the deadline can continue paying into their account for another 10 years, prompting some experts to say that this scheme is not just for those already planning to buy a property \u2013 it could also benefit many people in their mid to late teens who may want to buy at some point in the future. Individuals can open an account with as little as \u00a31, and while they can save up to \u00a3200 a month, there is no requirement to pay money in every month. The Isa cash has to be used to buy a home up to the value of \u00a3250,000 outside London, or up to \u00a3450,000 in the capital. To qualify, an individual must be 16 or over and be a first-time buyer \u2013 defined as someone who doesn\u2019t own, and has never owned, a home anywhere in the UK or the world. Martin Lewis at the MoneySavingExpert.com website said all 16-year-olds who dreamed of owning a home should \u201copen one now, even with \u00a31, or you could be throwing \u00a31,000s away\u201d. Private Finance, a mortgage broking firm, said: \u201cWith up to \u00a33,000 of essentially free money up for grabs, would-be buyers should act quickly to secure their chance of receiving this bonus.\u201d After 30 November, the accounts will not be available to new savers \u2013 but those who opened one before then can keep saving into it until November 2029, when accounts will close to additional contributions. The government bonus cash must be claimed by December 2030. To date, the government has paid out \u00a3320m in bonuses, with the average amount handed out put at \u00a3943, according to new Treasury data covering the period from the Isa\u2019s December 2015 launch to 30 June 2019. The median age of a first-time buyer who used the scheme was 28, though 40 people aged 65-plus have received bonuses, as did eight homebuyers aged under 18. The government bonus contributes towards someone\u2019s overall deposit \u2013 sometimes referred to as the mortgage deposit. But they do not get the bonus money at the exchange stage \u2013 they only get it on completion.

That could fall by as much as \u00a3200,000 under plans reportedly being shared with shareholders before a new remuneration policy due in February.</p> <p>Staley\u2019s pension payments were equivalent to 17% of his total fixed salary in 2018, and under the proposals would fall to about the same level as the 10% paid to other Barclays staff. A Barclays source said pension contributions across the business would rise from 10% to 12.5% of salary.</p> <p>The changes, first reported by the Financial Times, would bring Barclays in line with the other major British banks, which have also faced pressure to stop outsized pension perks in the wake of an updated corporate governance code that said bosses\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/nov/27/pensions-executive-pay-revolution\">pension contributions should be in line</a> with the rest of the workforce.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, who campaigns on executive pay at the High Pay Centre, said the proposed changes were \u201cobviously a positive example of engaged shareholder stewardship\u201d as well as pressure from unions.</p> <p>\u201cBringing executive pensions more in line with the wider workforce will be good for employee engagement and will help to rebuild the reputation of the banking industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, the banks still spend vast sums of money on a small number of top earners, with wider consequences for shareholders, the pay of lower earning staff and divisions between those at the top and everybody else across society as a whole.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/25/barclays-profits-plunge-as-bank-issues-global-economy-warning\">Barclays profits plunge as bank warns of challenging year ahead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lloyds Bank is planning similar changes to the pension payments to its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio.

That included fixed pay of \u00a32.35m in cash and shares, and he was also awarded a bonus of \u00a31.06m, just under half the maximum possible.</p> <p>On top of that he was given taxable benefits worth \u00a355,000 \u2013 alone nearly double the UK\u2019s median salary of about \u00a329,600. Barclays\u2019 annual report listed those benefits as private medical cover, life and ill health income protection, tax advice, money for relocation and money for a car allowance.</p> <p>Staley can also avail himself of a chauffeur-driven company car for business trips, as well as other unnamed benefits that \u201care considered minor in nature\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/11/barclays-jes-staley-fined-whistleblower-fca\">Staley was required to hand over more than \u00a31.1m</a> out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower.

Staley received an annual cash payment of \u00a3396,000 last year in place of a pension in order to avoid taxes on pensions for higher earners. That could fall by as much as \u00a3200,000 under plans reportedly being shared with shareholders before a new remuneration policy due in February. Staley\u2019s pension payments were equivalent to 17% of his total fixed salary in 2018, and under the proposals would fall to about the same level as the 10% paid to other Barclays staff. A Barclays source said pension contributions across the business would rise from 10% to 12.5% of salary. The changes, first reported by the Financial Times, would bring Barclays in line with the other major British banks, which have also faced pressure to stop outsized pension perks in the wake of an updated corporate governance code that said bosses\u2019 pension contributions should be in line with the rest of the workforce. Luke Hildyard, who campaigns on executive pay at the High Pay Centre, said the proposed changes were \u201cobviously a positive example of engaged shareholder stewardship\u201d as well as pressure from unions. \u201cBringing executive pensions more in line with the wider workforce will be good for employee engagement and will help to rebuild the reputation of the banking industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, the banks still spend vast sums of money on a small number of top earners, with wider consequences for shareholders, the pay of lower earning staff and divisions between those at the top and everybody else across society as a whole.\u201d Lloyds Bank is planning similar changes to the pension payments to its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters \u2013 who labelled an investor rebellion against his pay \u201cimmature and unhelpful\u201d \u2013 will also receive half the previous \u00a3474,000 allowance. In 2018 Barclays paid Staley \u00a33.36m in total, 96 times more than the median Barclays employee. That included fixed pay of \u00a32.35m in cash and shares, and he was also awarded a bonus of \u00a31.06m, just under half the maximum possible. On top of that he was given taxable benefits worth \u00a355,000 \u2013 alone nearly double the UK\u2019s median salary of about \u00a329,600. Barclays\u2019 annual report listed those benefits as private medical cover, life and ill health income protection, tax advice, money for relocation and money for a car allowance. Staley can also avail himself of a chauffeur-driven company car for business trips, as well as other unnamed benefits that \u201care considered minor in nature\u201d. In 2018 Staley was required to hand over more than \u00a31.1m out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower. He was fined a total of \u00a3642,430 by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Barclays clawed back \u00a3500,000 of his bonus over the matter.",

Background Planting billions of trees across the world is one of the most effective and cheapest ways of taking carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere. Through the process of photosynthesis, they absorb and store the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global heating, making them natural carbon sinks. Reality The government has officially committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The official adviser the Committee on Climate Change says the UK must plant 1.5 billion new trees by 2050 to meet that target, or 50 million a year. Planting 2 billion trees in the next 20 years would be the equivalent of sowing 100 million a year, so Corbyn\u2019s promise to plant more than that 10 years ahead of the target effectively doubles the requirement. That is the equivalent of three trees planted every second, day and night. While this sounds incredible, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility. One man in Northumberland who has launched a private woodland has planted more than 2 million trees in 12 years. Experts at the Woodland Trust say overshooting the planting target will be necessary given annual losses and threats to existing woodland and hedgerows \u2013 including everything from Network Rail clearing trees from sidelines, or the removal of around 5,500 trees from Sheffield by the council. But, they say, planting trees is not the only requirement. \u201cOn one side, you need expansion, but you also need to protect the natural regeneration of trees and woodlands, to stop inappropriate development and to understand more about pests and diseases,\u201d such as the devastating ash dieback which is a danger to 120m trees, said a spokesman for the trust. It is currently fighting around 1,000 cases of threats to ancient woodland, 108 of these from HS2. So, it says, expansion must happen not just to increase the number of trees, but also to mitigate losses. Verdict The Labour plan is ambitious but not out of sync with expert thinking.",

      "bodyText": "A row between two Queensland Nationals led to the Capricornia MP Michelle Landry making an \u201cinformal\u201d complaint about bullying, in a sign of ongoing tensions within the Coalition junior party. The party says the issue has since been \u201cdealt with internally\u201d. Following a heated partyroom meeting in Canberra in the last sitting week of October, Landry and the Wide Bay MP Llew O\u2019Brien clashed in a fiery exchange in the corridors of Parliament House after they left the chamber of the House of Representatives. The row erupted after Landry, the assistant minister for children and families, took aim at O\u2019Brien about partyroom leaks. In the partyroom meeting, O\u2019Brien had accused McKenzie of allowing One Nation to take credit for the government bringing forward the dairy code of conduct, and said it had been his intention to call a spill against her. Following the corridor argument, Landry is understood to have made an informal complaint to the party\u2019s executive and other party members, but did not escalate the complaint formally, which would have triggered an investigation. The Nationals president, Larry Anthony, told Guardian Australia that the matter had been dealt with internally, and was now \u201cin the past\u201d. \u201cI was aware a few weeks ago that there was a robust discussion between a lot of members, and a lot of that was over the dairy code and issues there,\u201d Anthony told Guardian Australia. \u201cI am also aware that this issue [of Landry and O\u2019Brien] was dealt with internally by the LNP, as they are both LNP members. These issues are dealt with internally by the party, and it is now done, it is in the past. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI don\u2019t mind robust discussions amongst our members but we all have to get on with each other, and I always want there to be harmony, and that issue is behind us now.\u201d The LNP president, David Hutchinson, said the party \u201cbecame aware of a disagreement between two MPs\u201d. \u201cWe have spoken with both of them, and consider the matter closed.\u201d O\u2019Brien told Guardian Australia that \u201ca short, robust discussion was had about the state of the partyroom\u201d. \u201cI have always had a good relationship with Michelle and the parliament is the place for robust discussions.\u201d Landry declined to comment. The row comes amid simmering tensions within the Nationals about the leadership of Michael McCormack, and the government\u2019s handling of the threat of One Nation in the bush. Anger erupted within the party after Pauline Hanson claimed to radio host Alan Jones that she had secured the mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry, with Jones saying she had done a \u201ctitanic\u201d job. There has also been some angst about the government\u2019s drought response, with Nationals MPs anxious that the party is not doing enough in regional areas to address the record dry spell. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce told the ABC last month that the Nationals were \u201cdriving the agenda\u201d, but not always getting credit for their work. \u201cWhat the Nationals get upset with is, we drive an agenda, we do so much work in a space, then obviously if Pauline Hanson comes out and announces it, it\u2019s not that she developed the policy, it\u2019s not that she drove the agenda \u2013 we did.

      "bodyText": "Conservationists say an official government report to the UN\u2019s world heritage committee to be released next week must show Australia has fresh plans to attack the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s two key threats \u2013 climate change and water quality. At a forum earlier this month environment ministers signed-off on the \u201cstate of conservation\u201d report for the reef,which was then sent to Unesco\u2019s world heritage committee. A report to be published on Friday by the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society details what they say Australia needs to do to avoid the committee placing the reef on its \u201cin danger\u201d list when it meets in China next year. The report says Australia must revise its central Great Barrier Reef policy, the Reef 2050 plan, to fill a \u201cgaping hole\u201d left by the absence of efforts to keep global heating to 1.5C. Australia needs an \u201cenergy transition plan\u201d, the report argues, that is compatible with the Paris climate agreement\u2019s ambitious target. Richard Leck, WWF-Australia\u2019s head of oceans, told Guardian Australia the government was now clearly acknowledging climate change as the reef\u2019s greatest threat, and that temperatures needed to be kept to 1.5C. He said: \u201cWith all of that in front of us, the committee may be very concerned that Australia is acknowledging the need to limit global warming to 1.5C but, at this stage, is not walking the walk.\u201d Mass coral bleaching along the reef in 2016 and again in 2017 killed half the shallow water corals, with northern sections hit hard. The following year, the number of new corals crashed by 89%. In July 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority published a revised climate change position statement, when it stressed the need to stick to a 1.5C global warming target, adding: \u201cIf we are to secure a future for the Great Barrier Reef and coral reef ecosystems globally, there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d In August, the authority\u2019s five-yearly outlook report downgraded the long-term prospects for the reef from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cvery poor\u201d. Also that month, an official review of water quality along inshore reefs found conditions had failed to improve. State of the reef In 2017 the world heritage committee asked for Australia to submit a detailed report on the state of the reef before 1 December, which should include progress on water-quality targets. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Earlier this month, environment ministers sent that report, which Unesco is expected to make public in the coming days. At the time, the Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said her government\u2019s newly-enacted farm pollution laws \u201calong with other efforts including tree clearing laws and action on climate change\u201d would \u201cprevent it from being listed by the world heritage committee as in-danger next year.\u201d The committee will review the reef again at its annual meeting, to be held in China in June next year. Reef in danger? The world heritage committee resisted pressure to put the reef on its \u201cin danger\u201d list in 2015 after the Queensland and federal government had tabled its Reef 2050 plan, which set targets to improve water quality along the 2,300-kilometre reef. The last time the Great Barrier Reef was reviewed by Unesco, the world heritage committee said it \u201cstrongly encourages\u201d Australia to \u201caccelerate efforts\u201d to meet the Reef 2050 plan\u2019s targets \u201cin particular regarding water quality\u201d. The report from WWF-Australia and AMCS also says extra funding should be given to enforcing water quality laws. A reforestation program should be introduced along riverbanks and other landscapes to reduce run-off into waterways that flow into the reef. Leck said the Reef 2050 plan was an \u201cexcellent\u201d response, but added: \u201cIt had one major flaw. It did not include climate change. \u201cGiven what\u2019s happened to the reef in the subsequent years, that is now a gaping hole. The next 2050 plan has to incorporate what the federal and Queensland government has recognised. A reef-safe strategy has to be 1.5C compatible. \u201cThe Australian government clearly acknowledges the reef\u2019s greatest threat is climate change. It\u2019s a no-brainer that we need a climate policy consistent with the reef\u2019s survival.\u201d Imogen Zethoven, AMCS director of strategy, said that to avoid a possible \u201cin danger\u201d listing, the Australian government needed to rapidly reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy and accelerate efforts to address local threats. In a 2017 review of the government\u2019s climate change policies, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority wrote: \u201cTo ensure a future for the Great Barrier Reef (ie as a functioning reef ecosystem), the latest science indicates the stronger position in the Paris agreement to restrict the increase to 1.5C (or ideally less) above pre-industrial is essential.\u201d The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that even at 1.5C of warming, coral reefs around the world would decline by 70 to 90%. At 2C, coral reefs would all but disappear. The world heritage committee has been slow to produce a new policy that would outline how it plans to incorporate climate change impacts into its decision making. In July, the Australian government told a world heritage meeting that climate change threats on individual sites should not be used to justify \u201cin danger\u201d listings. Stephen Oxley, from the environment and energy department, told the committee Australia was disappointed the policy had not been finalised. But the department told Guardian Australia its intervention was unrelated to the reef\u2019s assessment at the 2020 meeting.",

      "bodyText": "Brutal attacks on Labour\u2019s tax and spending plans are part of the furniture of any election. No surprise at the incoming fire over Labour\u2019s promise to compensate women born in the 1950s for the state pension entitlements stolen from them. The equalisation of men and women\u2019s pension age was accelerated by the Tories, cheating them of firm entitlements. The Waspi (Women against state pension inequality) group has campaigned for years, dressed as suffragettes with demos all over the country, but they complain that their case has hardly been heard. Now Labour has come up with the goods: there has been plenty of reporting of the cost \u2013 but none of the jubilation these women feel. Labour long ago promised to compensate them, but has only now spelled it out in a stonking great commitment of nearly \u00a312bn a year for five years. So here\u2019s the crude question: how many of these more than three million older women will be swung towards Labour? In Pendle, Lancashire, Sally Lambert was one of the Waspi organisers who met shadow chancellor John McDonnell on Wednesday. \u201cAll the women in our group were so pleased to have someone listening at last,\u201d she said. They support equalisation, but they needed longer to save \u2013 and this government theft is the only equality they have experienced. Her story is a good example of how working women born in the 1950s have been impoverished. She didn\u2019t know until two years before she was 60 that, once she\u2019d reached that age, she would have to work another six years. By then, she had cut back work after cancer treatment left her frail. She was grieving the loss of a son and was caring for her mother. Like most, she was not a high earner. She left school at 15 and worked as a machinist making slippers: \u201cThere was no equal pay back then, we had a lot less than the men.\u201d Later, she made Christmas decorations for shops before doing community work for a disability group. This is what happened when women like her found they had no pension and couldn\u2019t work more. She had some savings, so didn\u2019t qualify for any benefits. After she\u2019d exhausted those savings, she spent a very small inheritance when her mother died. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky I have a husband who has a \u00a310,000 a year pension, so we got by,\u201d she says. But others in her group with no partner had to sell their homes to survive. Women who were divorced never had lost years of pension counted in the settlement. Does she think these 1950s women, the ones Labour calls the \u201cMade in Dagenham\u201d women, will swing to Labour? \u201cMy friend just joined the Labour party this week!\u201d She feels it will persuade many, as will the party\u2019s policies on the \u201cNHS and free social care\u201d. Those born between 1950 and 1955 will get \u00a3100 a week for each week they lost, not as a lump sum: younger ones get less, on a taper.

But well-off women will be paying higher tax rates \u2013 and as Lambert says: \u201cIt\u2019s an entitlement we paid for that was stolen, not a benefit.\u201d Labour could have means tested this, but cutting out relatively few high earners is unlikely to save much. As for fiscal rashness, the Resolution Foundation says that both Labour and the Conservatives are set to break their budgetary rules, so the mud may not stick. Take the other assault on Labour\u2019s tax plans: Jeremy Corbyn made a poor fist of defending the abolition of the absurd marriage allowance. It\u2019s a tax relief that was widely ridiculed at the time, brought in to please the Daily Mail\u2019s clamour for incentivising marriage: Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s Centre for Social Justice claimed lack of a marriage licence was a prime cause of poverty. David Cameron brought it in just before the 2015 election. It came as a \u00a31,060 transferable tax allowance, so it only goes to couples where one partner doesn\u2019t work (or is earning below the tax threshold).

According to a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/increasing-oversight-api-manufacturing-through-international-collaboration\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018 report</a> on the international inspection programme, 1,333 of these inspections were carried out at 458 manufacturing sites in 18 different countries over a six-year period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"73ac0a02ab7365740d79ffc1deb4bf9bf7dba304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ac0a02ab7365740d79ffc1deb4bf9bf7dba304/0_25_547_547/500.png\" alt=\"Illustration of tablets\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Other contract manufacturing organisations import APIs and complete the manufacturing process by combining them with excipients (chemically inactive substances such as lactose or mineral oil that help to deliver the medication to your system). The medicine is then packaged \u2013 possibly at yet another manufacturing site \u2013 and labelled in accordance with local regulations. The finished product is then delivered to the patient.</p> <p><strong>Distribution and wholesale<br></strong>Wholesalers buy medical products directly from manufacturers, and then resell them at a markup to hospitals, clinics, stores and pharmacies \u2013 anywhere that gets them directly to the patient. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have somebody doing that aggregation and order consolidation and delivery consolidation, you would cripple virtually every healthcare system in the world \u2013 even the most sophisticated ones \u2013 because the pharmacist would be doing nothing but taking orders and opening boxes all day long,\u201d says Christopher Goetz, executive vice-president and general manager for the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (IFPW).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"22db3f77d7b1e40d434fca349f4e9cf3f93626cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22db3f77d7b1e40d434fca349f4e9cf3f93626cb/0_26_547_547/500.png\" alt=\"Illustration of medicine packets\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wholesalers must comply with the product manufacturer\u2019s stipulations on the humidity, temperature control and other environmental conditions that must be adhered to during the storage and movement of the product. And while national regulations are virtually non-existent in some low-income countries, in the US, \u201cyou basically have to keep track of every single pill \u2013 almost every single ingredient \u2013 from the time that it leaves the manufacturing plant until it reaches the end user\u201d, says George Bray, vice-president of member engagement, IFPW.</p> <p>Many medical products, such as vaccines, are also part of the \u201ccold chain\u201d, and must be stored and transported at temperatures between 2-8C \u2013 a particularly challenging task in extremely hot regions or war-torn or poverty-stricken countries, though new heat-resistant vaccine formulations and solar refrigeration technologies are helping to address the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6d07e5b4bf75b2bb9bdeb43f0b3a16df98ee0551\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d07e5b4bf75b2bb9bdeb43f0b3a16df98ee0551/0_13_547_547/500.png\" alt=\"Illustration of truck and ship\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The wholesale stage of a product\u2019s journey from manufacturer to patient is also, unfortunately, one of the points at which falsified medicines are likely to enter the supply chain. These falsified medicines range from those with no active ingredients to those with dangerous adulterations that can lead to resistance to treatment, illness and even death. A 2017 <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\" rel=\"nofollow\">WHO study</a> found that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are substandard or falsified.</p> <p>Although more than a third of the nations in the world have had their legitimate supply chain compromised, the problem is worse in countries where oversight and enforcement is weak or legitimate drugs are in short supply. However, seals, labels and other forms of anti-tampering technology, including emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI, are increasingly being used to tackle the problem. And campaign groups, such as <a href=\"http://fightthefakes.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fight the Fakes</a>, are helping to raise awareness of the issue by giving voice to people who\u2019ve been personally impacted by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fd1d84920d2b6e1af8b46e538fbd08e0383d33c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1d84920d2b6e1af8b46e538fbd08e0383d33c1/0_16_547_547/500.png\" alt=\"Illustration of open boxes\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Post-approval changes<br></strong>Pharma companies often make changes to a medicine or vaccine throughout its lifecycle. These changes are made for a number of reasons: to make the production process more efficient, for example, or to incorporate new scientific advances. But any changes need to be reviewed and approved by each national regulatory authority (NRA).</p> <p>NRA requirements differ from country to country, and resource constraints can limit their ability to carry out reviews in a timely manner. As such, <a href=\"https://www.ifpma.org/subtopics/supply-chain-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the estimated timeline for drug licensure and one post-approval change is 1.5 years; the longest a whopping 5.5 years</a>.</p> <p>The International Federation of Pharmaceuticals &amp; Manufacturers Association (IFPMA) has therefore recommended that consistent and harmonised regulatory approaches for the management of post-approval changes should be implemented worldwide, which would help to ensure that everyone has access to the latest version of a medicine or vaccine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6150cb5470b54f48a313f0446a47933ea7455fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6150cb5470b54f48a313f0446a47933ea7455fcb/0_25_547_547/500.png\" alt=\"Illustration of hospital\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Demand forecasting<br></strong>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2013 such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease \u2013 are some of the leading causes of death and disability globally, and disproportionately affect those living in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to strengthening the regulatory framework, the entire health system \u2013 in particular supply chain and procurement \u2013 needs to evolve rapidly to face this epidemiological transition.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.path.org/resources/coalition-for-access-to-ncd-medicines-and-products/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coalition for Access to NCD Medicines and Products</a> has brought together governments, the private sector, philanthropic and academic institutions, and NGOs to tackle the barriers countries face in procuring, supplying, and distributing essential medicines and technologies for NCDs.

And, of course, I think it\u2019s relatively clear if your forecast is off, it can lead to increased stock-outs or waste, ultimately affecting availability of medicines for people living with NCDs.\u201d</p> <p>When stock-outs occur in a public health facility, people with chronic long-term conditions may have to travel farther to get the medicine they need, and potentially buy it from private pharmacies at a higher price. \u201cThere\u2019s a concentration of medicines and products in the urban areas and at higher levels of care,\u201d McGuire explains. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with conditions such as non-communicable diseases, we need to make sure that these medicines are as close to the person\u2019s home as possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-health-progress/2019/nov/28/why-it-makes-financial-sense-to-achieve-global-universal-healthcare-by-2030\">Why it makes financial sense to achieve global universal healthcare by 2030</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, the procurement process for something like insulin isn\u2019t always the same as the procurement process for syringes.

The medicine is then packaged \u2013 possibly at yet another manufacturing site \u2013 and labelled in accordance with local regulations. The finished product is then delivered to the patient. Distribution and wholesale Wholesalers buy medical products directly from manufacturers, and then resell them at a markup to hospitals, clinics, stores and pharmacies \u2013 anywhere that gets them directly to the patient. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have somebody doing that aggregation and order consolidation and delivery consolidation, you would cripple virtually every healthcare system in the world \u2013 even the most sophisticated ones \u2013 because the pharmacist would be doing nothing but taking orders and opening boxes all day long,\u201d says Christopher Goetz, executive vice-president and general manager for the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (IFPW). Wholesalers must comply with the product manufacturer\u2019s stipulations on the humidity, temperature control and other environmental conditions that must be adhered to during the storage and movement of the product. And while national regulations are virtually non-existent in some low-income countries, in the US, \u201cyou basically have to keep track of every single pill \u2013 almost every single ingredient \u2013 from the time that it leaves the manufacturing plant until it reaches the end user\u201d, says George Bray, vice-president of member engagement, IFPW. Many medical products, such as vaccines, are also part of the \u201ccold chain\u201d, and must be stored and transported at temperatures between 2-8C \u2013 a particularly challenging task in extremely hot regions or war-torn or poverty-stricken countries, though new heat-resistant vaccine formulations and solar refrigeration technologies are helping to address the problem. The wholesale stage of a product\u2019s journey from manufacturer to patient is also, unfortunately, one of the points at which falsified medicines are likely to enter the supply chain. These falsified medicines range from those with no active ingredients to those with dangerous adulterations that can lead to resistance to treatment, illness and even death. A 2017 WHO study found that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are substandard or falsified. Although more than a third of the nations in the world have had their legitimate supply chain compromised, the problem is worse in countries where oversight and enforcement is weak or legitimate drugs are in short supply. However, seals, labels and other forms of anti-tampering technology, including emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI, are increasingly being used to tackle the problem. And campaign groups, such as Fight the Fakes, are helping to raise awareness of the issue by giving voice to people who\u2019ve been personally impacted by it. Post-approval changes Pharma companies often make changes to a medicine or vaccine throughout its lifecycle. These changes are made for a number of reasons: to make the production process more efficient, for example, or to incorporate new scientific advances. But any changes need to be reviewed and approved by each national regulatory authority (NRA). NRA requirements differ from country to country, and resource constraints can limit their ability to carry out reviews in a timely manner. As such, the estimated timeline for drug licensure and one post-approval change is 1.5 years; the longest a whopping 5.5 years. The International Federation of Pharmaceuticals &amp; Manufacturers Association (IFPMA) has therefore recommended that consistent and harmonised regulatory approaches for the management of post-approval changes should be implemented worldwide, which would help to ensure that everyone has access to the latest version of a medicine or vaccine. Demand forecasting Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2013 such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease \u2013 are some of the leading causes of death and disability globally, and disproportionately affect those living in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to strengthening the regulatory framework, the entire health system \u2013 in particular supply chain and procurement \u2013 needs to evolve rapidly to face this epidemiological transition. The Coalition for Access to NCD Medicines and Products has brought together governments, the private sector, philanthropic and academic institutions, and NGOs to tackle the barriers countries face in procuring, supplying, and distributing essential medicines and technologies for NCDs. Path, an international non-profit organisation aimed at achieving health equity for all, leads the coalition; it has carried out studies in Kenya and Senegal on supply chain barriers and affordability and availability issues for essential medicines. One area identified as a major challenge is demand forecasting. \u201cIn the NCD space, we do not have the robust data sets that are available for other areas of health,\u201d says Helen McGuire, global programme leader for non-communicable diseases at Path. \u201cIt is very challenging for governments at the national and sub-national level to forecast for budgeting and procurement. And, of course, I think it\u2019s relatively clear if your forecast is off, it can lead to increased stock-outs or waste, ultimately affecting availability of medicines for people living with NCDs.\u201d When stock-outs occur in a public health facility, people with chronic long-term conditions may have to travel farther to get the medicine they need, and potentially buy it from private pharmacies at a higher price. \u201cThere\u2019s a concentration of medicines and products in the urban areas and at higher levels of care,\u201d McGuire explains. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with conditions such as non-communicable diseases, we need to make sure that these medicines are as close to the person\u2019s home as possible.\u201d What\u2019s more, the procurement process for something like insulin isn\u2019t always the same as the procurement process for syringes. Sometimes both products are not available at the same location; there may also be subsidies for insulin but not for syringes. One way to tackle the issue is to take a people-centric approach to supply chain and procurement processes, says McGuire, taking into account exactly what an individual needs to manage their condition on a long-term basis \u2013 something that\u2019s likely to become even more important as global populations grow and age, and the demand for medicines in emerging markets increases.",

It means, at least in the first instance, making those public goods profitable. Students are in more and more debt, workers are paid less and less, while private companies and developers are given access to a potentially lucrative market.</p> <p>What does this mean for workers in higher education? They face a proliferation of perverse incentives: instead of research and teaching, lecturers are expected to take part in a perpetual recruitment drive. Instead of supporting students emotionally and academically, staff in student services, often facing cuts and \u201crestructures\u201d, are expected to act as the vanguard of \u201cemployability\u201d.</p> <p>With more students, permanent staff are expected to take on more and more work. Temporary staff are expected to paper over structural gaps, providing a \u201cflexible\u201d workforce who are hired and fired in response to fluctuations in student numbers. Research shows that part-time staff and those on hourly rates are only paid for <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10336/Counting-the-costs-of-casualisation-in-higher-education-Jun-19/pdf/ucu_casualisation_in_HE_survey_report_Jun19.pdf\" title=\"\">55% of their work</a>. Staff in general work, on average, the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10091/Higher-Education-Sector-Conference\" title=\"\">two days unpaid per week</a>. Given these low wages, many temporary staff are effectively paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>The expectations placed on staff cannot be met. It is not possible to produce the kind of work expected in the amount of time we are paid to do it. New methods of evaluation and student metrics create even more work, and overlook the key fact that asking students if they enjoyed a course reveals very little about whether that course was well-taught. Student services are stretched to breaking point, and instead of releasing the tension by, for example, increasing funding, services are instead outsourced, with trained counsellors replaced by generic \u201cadvisers\u201d and, even, apps.</p> <p>When we say that the expectations on staff cannot be met, we mean that it is not possible to live under these conditions. There is nothing else left to squeeze. The doctrines of flexibility and precarity are in no way specific to higher education. They are paradigmatic of contemporary working practices. This means the struggle against precarity is not just a struggle for better conditions for academic workers \u2013 it is the insistence that a better life is possible for all of us. The disruption to teaching that comes from workers\u2019 poor health, unnecessary pressure and precarity is much, much greater than the disruption caused by the cancellation of classes.</p> <p>Despite the deprivations of the picket line \u2013 early mornings, hours standing in the cold, lost pay \u2013 I have rarely seen colleagues so happy. The lifting of the neoliberal impulse to be constantly working, every interaction a chance for self-development, every minute a chance to get something done, has profound effects. Reclawing time from management\u2019s extractive demands gives us a glimpse of how the university could be.</p> <p>The University and College Union dispute, which runs until next Wednesday, is about pay and pensions for some 43,000 members of the union, all working in academia. Even if we won on both counts, our futures, and the future of higher education, will not be secure without a fundamental rethink of the way in which universities are funded in the UK.</p> <p>We cannot afford to merely attempt to reform a marketised sector, based around fees. Almost 10 years on from the seismic higher education reforms of 2010, we face another general election. The only party now offering a rethink of fees and funding, rather than the shuffling of proverbial deckchairs, is Labour.</p> <p>We must not let students\u2019 interests be pitted against workers. They are one and the same. So far during the strike, universities have bribed students to cross the picket line with gimmicks like free breakfast and free parking. They have attempted to ban solidarity action by students with a sustained campaign of misinformation, including the suggestion that joining picket lines is illegal and that students must cross them because they are members of NUS and not UCU. We are warned that students might feel anxious about the strike and that by picketing our workplaces we are letting them down.</p> <p>In these moments, management attempts to call upon a sense of duty we might feel towards our students. But as workers in higher education, we should not be content to merely provide a better version of the kind of education-as-commodity that management insists on.</p> <p>With our strike and the election, we have a chance to start fundamentally re-imagining the university. It\u2019s the only thing that might save it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Amelia Horgan is a writer, researcher, activist and graduate teaching assistant at the University of Essex</p>",

Instead of supporting students emotionally and academically, staff in student services, often facing cuts and \u201crestructures\u201d, are expected to act as the vanguard of \u201cemployability\u201d. With more students, permanent staff are expected to take on more and more work. Temporary staff are expected to paper over structural gaps, providing a \u201cflexible\u201d workforce who are hired and fired in response to fluctuations in student numbers. Research shows that part-time staff and those on hourly rates are only paid for 55% of their work. Staff in general work, on average, the equivalent of two days unpaid per week. Given these low wages, many temporary staff are effectively paid less than the minimum wage. The expectations placed on staff cannot be met. It is not possible to produce the kind of work expected in the amount of time we are paid to do it. New methods of evaluation and student metrics create even more work, and overlook the key fact that asking students if they enjoyed a course reveals very little about whether that course was well-taught. Student services are stretched to breaking point, and instead of releasing the tension by, for example, increasing funding, services are instead outsourced, with trained counsellors replaced by generic \u201cadvisers\u201d and, even, apps. When we say that the expectations on staff cannot be met, we mean that it is not possible to live under these conditions. There is nothing else left to squeeze. The doctrines of flexibility and precarity are in no way specific to higher education. They are paradigmatic of contemporary working practices. This means the struggle against precarity is not just a struggle for better conditions for academic workers \u2013 it is the insistence that a better life is possible for all of us. The disruption to teaching that comes from workers\u2019 poor health, unnecessary pressure and precarity is much, much greater than the disruption caused by the cancellation of classes. Despite the deprivations of the picket line \u2013 early mornings, hours standing in the cold, lost pay \u2013 I have rarely seen colleagues so happy. The lifting of the neoliberal impulse to be constantly working, every interaction a chance for self-development, every minute a chance to get something done, has profound effects. Reclawing time from management\u2019s extractive demands gives us a glimpse of how the university could be. The University and College Union dispute, which runs until next Wednesday, is about pay and pensions for some 43,000 members of the union, all working in academia. Even if we won on both counts, our futures, and the future of higher education, will not be secure without a fundamental rethink of the way in which universities are funded in the UK. We cannot afford to merely attempt to reform a marketised sector, based around fees. Almost 10 years on from the seismic higher education reforms of 2010, we face another general election. The only party now offering a rethink of fees and funding, rather than the shuffling of proverbial deckchairs, is Labour. We must not let students\u2019 interests be pitted against workers. They are one and the same. So far during the strike, universities have bribed students to cross the picket line with gimmicks like free breakfast and free parking. They have attempted to ban solidarity action by students with a sustained campaign of misinformation, including the suggestion that joining picket lines is illegal and that students must cross them because they are members of NUS and not UCU. We are warned that students might feel anxious about the strike and that by picketing our workplaces we are letting them down. In these moments, management attempts to call upon a sense of duty we might feel towards our students. But as workers in higher education, we should not be content to merely provide a better version of the kind of education-as-commodity that management insists on. With our strike and the election, we have a chance to start fundamentally re-imagining the university. It\u2019s the only thing that might save it. \u2022 Amelia Horgan is a writer, researcher, activist and graduate teaching assistant at the University of Essex",

Last June, reporters from the Italian newspaper la Repubblica discovered Malatto in a tourist resort enjoying holidays in the province of Messina, even though he was on trial in Rome. \u2018\u2019We asked the Italian judiciary to monitor Malatto\u2019s movements,\u201d said Jorge Ithurburu, a lawyer for 24 Marzo, a Rome-based NGO. \u201cWe fear that he may escape justice.\u201d Eva Lerouc, 45, whose parents were kidnapped in 1976 by the regime, also testified before prosecutors on Thursday. Her father, Armando Lerouc, was killed and her mother, Elida Saroff, disappeared after the kidnapping. \u201cThis is unfair,\u201d she said of the trial. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight because Malatto has to be extradited. We seek justice.\u201d In 1985, two years after Argentina returned to democracy, the coup\u2019s leader Videla was convicted of human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. Since then, more than 1,000 other former officers have been sentenced for the torture and extrajudicial murder of activists and political opponents and their families. Many former officers continue to live in hiding in Europe, especially in Italy where many Argentinians have family ties. Malatto\u2019s family originally hailed from Abruzzo and he holds an Italian passport. Last July an Italian court sentenced 24 people to life in prison for their involvement in Operation Condor, in which the dictatorships of six South American countries conspired to kidnap and assassinate political opponents in each other\u2019s territories.",

The French president defended his comments in Paris alongside the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who had previously warned Macron not to expect that a European defence formation could replace the Nato transatlantic structure. An unrepentant Macron said: \u201cThe questions I have asked are open questions, that we haven\u2019t solved yet.\u201d He said: \u201cPeace in Europe, the post-INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty] situation, the relationship with Russia, the Turkey issue \u2013 who\u2019s the enemy?

Although at recent summits Donald Trump has railed against what he regards as Europe\u2019s freeloading, in the run-up to next week\u2019s 70th anniversary summit there have been fundamental divisions about the organisation\u2019s purpose. Poland and the Baltic states are particularly infuriated at what they regard as Macron\u2019s pro-Russia, anti-US stance. Macron was also critical of Turkey, saying it could not expect solidarity from Nato allies while launching an offensive in Syria. Turkey has blocked a Nato defence plan for the Baltics and Poland after some members refused to formally recognise Kurdish fighters in Syria as a security threat. A meeting between France, Germany, UK and Turkey on the state of the Turkish incursion into northern Syria is likely to happen on the sidelines of the summit. On Wednesday, Reuters and Turkish media reported that Nato had agreed this year to a collective security guarantee for Turkey in the event of an attack from its southern border with Syria, where since October Ankara has been locked in a battle with Kurdish-led forces previously supported by the US in the fight against Islamic State. The plan included recognising the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), the main component of the umbrella Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as a terrorist threat to Turkey. Ankara says the YPG are the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), an outlawed group that has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades, and it has long been infuriated by western support for the Syrian groups. However, worried about a potential legal obligation to fight against a force it supported in Syria, Washington later withdrew its support, leading other countries to oppose it too, Turkish diplomats have alleged. They did not specify when the plan was submitted or when the US withdrew support. In retaliation, Turkey now says that at next week\u2019s summit it will block formal approval of a military plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the event of a Russian attack. Both plans need the backing of all 29 member states. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, confirmed the reports that it had blocked the Baltic plan, telling reporters: \u201cWe are not against Nato\u2019s retaliation plans for the Baltic nations but [Nato] should also want for Turkey what it wants for the Baltics.\u201d In London, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said Europe had opposed the Turkish incursion into Syria, but said it would be a strategic blunder if criticism of Turkey drove the country into the arms of Vladimir Putin. Turkey has defied the Nato alliance and angered the US by purchasing a Russian defence system, a decision that the US says makes it impossible for the US to provide Turkey with military aircraft. Macron also said France would begin a review of its Barkhane intervention in the Sahel following the death of 13 soldiers in Mali this week, with \u201call options on the table\u201d. \u201cIn this context, and in light of the decisions that France will take, a bigger engagement by its allies is obviously something that would be quite positive,\u201d he said. Although Britain has provided helicopters and security personnel to help France\u2019s 4,500-member Barkhane force in west Africa, and the US provides intelligence support, France has so far failed to persuade other allies to make a significant contribution. \u201cIn the Sahel, France is involved and acting on behalf of everyone,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIf some people want to see an example of what they term cost-sharing, they can come Monday to the ceremony France is organising\u201d for the dead 13 soldiers. \u201cThere they will see the cost.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On a sticky Sunday in August, more than 5,000 people are standing through sporadic torrents of rain to attend a free outdoor concert in New York\u2019s Central Park. The event, Selena for Sanctuary, has been organised in response to the Trump administration\u2019s severe policies on undocumented individuals, and the crowd has gathered to support immigrant-rights organisations such as <a href=\"https://maketheroadny.org/\" title=\"\">Make the Road New York</a> \u2013 all in the name of the pop star Selena Quintanilla.</p> <p>Selena has been dead for nearly 25 years. The superstar was shot and killed in 1995, at the age of 23, by her fanclub manager, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. Yet at the concert, she seems more present than ever: fans wear T-shirts emblazoned with her wide, red-lipped smile. Others wear one-piece jumpsuits and jackets with gleaming rhinestones, nods to the sparkling stage outfits Selena would often make herself. From the stage, a parade of up-and-coming bilingual artists belts out covers of her classic cumbia hits: Mexican-American indie star Cuco offers his take on Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, dream-pop newcomer Ambar Lucid sings Techno Cumbia, and Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis performs Como la Flor. Their songs are a celebration during a turbulent time, reflecting how Selena still serves as a symbol of hope in the fight for immigrants\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Tributes to Selena have abounded in recent years. She is still a beloved celebrity in the US, referred to as the Queen of Tejano \u2013 a blend of folk and popular music that originated on the border of Texas and Mexico. In 2016, the beauty brand Mac launched a Selena-inspired makeup collection. When, in 2017, she was honoured posthumously with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a record <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8023165/selena-quintanilla-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-ceremony\" title=\"\">crowd of 4,500 people</a> gathered for the ceremony.

The film follows Selena from her childhood in the Texan cities of Lake Jackson and later Corpus Christi, where she launched her career. Her father, the musician Abraham Quintanilla Jr, organised Selena and her two siblings, AB and Suzette, into a band that he managed. They performed frequently in his short-lived restaurant before finding fame at local carnivals, weddings and community events. By the time she was 18, Selena had recorded her first solo album \u2013 1989\u2019s Selena \u2013 and won the Tejano Music award for female vocalist of the year.</p> <p>She had endeared herself to audiences with a disarming girl-next-door persona and a candid approach to straddling Mexican and American identities. Her vocals were almost entirely in Spanish, but Selena was honest about her struggles learning the language as an American from Texas. She did not shy away from the intricacies of biculturalism; instead, she discussed the challenges with tender sincerity: \u201cI feel very proud to be Mexican. I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to learn Spanish when I was a girl, but \u2026 it\u2019s never too late to get in touch with your roots,\u201d she said in an interview in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1994.</p> <p>Selena\u2019s jostling between transnational spaces is important to younger generations, particularly because, over the last decade, the Latino demographic has shifted from foreign-born immigrants to children born in the US and navigating dual worlds as Selena did. Her fashion aesthetic was also a source of inspiration: \u201cThere was no artist who dressed like her, especially somebody that looked like us and represented us,\u201d says Doris Mu\u00f1oz, the 25-year-old music manager and concert promoter behind Selena for Sanctuary. \u201cA lot of us clung to that, because we saw ourselves in her.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKGbjJarMeA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RKGbjJarMeA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Selena singing Bidi Bidi Bom Bom</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Onstage, Selena dazzled, embracing and challenging what people expected her to be as an artist performing in Spanish. At her unforgettable final concert in the Houston Astrodome, she arrived in a purple jumpsuit and launched into a seven-minute disco medley in English. She twirled along to cumbia melodies before breaking into lively choreography reminiscent of US stars such as Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson.</p> <p>Through the Latin arm of EMI, which signed her in 1989, Selena released four studio albums and the concert LP Selena Live!, the latter winning her a Grammy for best Mexican-American album in 1994. The award helped to cement Spanish-language music in the US, and Selena\u2019s place as the single leading woman in Tejano music. When she died in 1995, tens of thousands of people filed past her casket in Corpus Christi. The American Spanish language network Univision even stopped its programming to run footage of bereaved fans at the service. Four months later, her fifth studio album, Dreaming of You, came out and debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 \u2013 a first for a Latina artist that proved her reach across broad audiences.</p> <p>Deborah Paredez, a professor at Columbia University and the author of the 2009 book Selenidad: Selena, Latinos and the Performance of Memory, notes that Selena\u2019s catalogue drew on a range of Latin styles \u2013 something that helps explain why fans from such diverse Latin American backgrounds have united behind her. \u201cThere was an incorporation of Colombian and Caribbean rhythms \u2026 she really resonated across different points of identification or national affiliations.\u201d AB, who was Selena\u2019s producer, was aware of the blend the band was creating, saying in 1995: \u201cThey call us Tejano, and yes, we are from Texas. But a lot of the music we\u2019re playing is from Mexico and South America [and is] a mixture of tropical, reggae, cumbia, all these things. It\u2019s got pop influences to it, too.\u201d</p> <p>As Spanish-language pop finds renewed popularity today, Selena is still seen as a genre-crossing trailblazer: Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny has listed Selena as the icon with whom he wishes he could have collaborated, and artists from Gloria Estefan to Becky G to Leslie Grace have performed her music. AB\u2019s son, Svani Quintanilla, is now a DJ, Principe Q, and has continued his relatives\u2019 tradition of pushing cumbia music forward by mixing it with hip-hop beats. \u201cThey were making songs that were unheard of,\u201d he says, pointing to the example of the cumbia-meets-electronic hit Techno Cumbia from 1994. \u201cThat was decades ahead of its time.\u201d</p> <p>Mu\u00f1oz was thinking about Selena\u2019s enduring legacy when she started Selena for Sanctuary in 2017 to raise money for her own parents\u2019 citizenship proceedings. She has since expanded the benefit into a broader series that champions not-for-profit organisations fighting for immigrants\u2019 rights. For her, it made sense to centre on Selena. A Mexican-American, Mu\u00f1oz has been a fan of the singer since she was a child \u2013 her family told her that she burst into tears at the age of two when Selena\u2019s death hit the news \u2013 and as a concert promoter, she had noticed that people \u201cflocked\u201d to the singer\u2019s catalogue of upbeat, danceable hits, regardless of their age or which part of Latin America they or their families were born in. \u201cThere was that unifying factor \u2013 everyone loves her music and sees her as an inspiration.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIrwmSS_RGw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hIrwmSS_RGw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Selena winning a Grammy.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Paredez points out that Selena\u2019s music was \u201cdefinitely not overtly political\u201d, but fans have still connected her death to their own grief in times of struggle. As she notes, shortly after Selena\u2019s death, laws were passed to expand the grounds for deportation and reduce eligibility for welfare benefits, with severe implications for people in low-income, Spanish-speaking communities. This mid-90s legislation coincided with attacks on bilingual education and debates over Proposition 187, a ballot initiative that prohibited undocumented immigrants from using non-emergency healthcare in California (it was later ruled unconstitutional).</p> <p>\u201cHaving [Selena] killed during that time holds her in this space of potential unrealised,\u201d says Paredez. \u201cImmigrants who are making their way and trying to provide better lives for their children \u2013 that\u2019s nothing if not about a potential that then gets unrealised when they are deported or threatened.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88a62aa039a9fb415425aab0c0f1ca158ec8cdd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a62aa039a9fb415425aab0c0f1ca158ec8cdd5/0_0_1913_2510/762.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lopez playing Selena in the 1997 film.\" width=\"762\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lopez playing Selena in the 1997 film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia De La Rosa/Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More recently, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has left many immigrants feeling more fearful than ever. A \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy initiated at the border resulted in more than 3,000 children being separated from their parents; their tearful voices went viral in audio footage recorded by journalists in 2017. Trump has used the words \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d to discuss migrants from Latin America, terms that sounded even more horrifying after a man opened fire at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/walmart-mass-shooting-el-paso-texas-mexicans\" title=\"\">Walmart in El Paso, </a>Texas, killing 22 people and later confessing to authorities that he was targeting Mexicans.</p> <p>In such an atmosphere of violence, some Latinos have used cultural totems as an escape, and Selena is among the most powerful: a pillar of hope for Latinos, eternally youthful and ready to brighten darker times, even for just a moment.</p> <p>\u201cHer music just brings joy to everyone in the community,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cA Selena song comes on at the club and everyone\u2019s immediately singing all the lyrics, and grabbing their friends, smiling in each other\u2019s faces. With everything that\u2019s happening in our country, we deserve these moments of joy.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to Selena for Sanctuary, other efforts have tied her legacy to activism: Topfoxx, a New York City-based sunglasses startup, gave proceeds from a set of Selena-themed glasses to benefit children held in detention centres; a news conference decrying family separations was held in front of her memorial statue in Corpus Christi.</p> <p>Younger artists invoke Selena\u2019s name when they talk about using their platform to uplift others. Jackie Cruz, who plays Flaca in Orange Is the New Black and is also a singer, released her debut album, Hija de Chavez, in October. She won attention as a vocalist after she covered Selena\u2019s Como la Flor in 2017, and she says Selena has been a role model. Cruz has spent time protesting outside detention centres across Texas. \u201cI want to be a leader in the community like she was,\u201d she says. \u201cShe taught us how to lead and how to give back and how to represent, and I want to build on that.\u201d</p> <p>Svani remains a frequent fixture at Selena-themed charity events and parties, and he joined Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s efforts at Selena for Sanctuary to stay involved with the community. From the stage, he watched the crowd swell with joy as they danced to his late aunt\u2019s music. \u201cIf she was here, she would be doing all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like she would be at all of these events. She would be using her voice for good.\u201d</p>",

The event, Selena for Sanctuary, has been organised in response to the Trump administration\u2019s severe policies on undocumented individuals, and the crowd has gathered to support immigrant-rights organisations such as Make the Road New York \u2013 all in the name of the pop star Selena Quintanilla. Selena has been dead for nearly 25 years. The superstar was shot and killed in 1995, at the age of 23, by her fanclub manager, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. Yet at the concert, she seems more present than ever: fans wear T-shirts emblazoned with her wide, red-lipped smile. Others wear one-piece jumpsuits and jackets with gleaming rhinestones, nods to the sparkling stage outfits Selena would often make herself. From the stage, a parade of up-and-coming bilingual artists belts out covers of her classic cumbia hits: Mexican-American indie star Cuco offers his take on Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, dream-pop newcomer Ambar Lucid sings Techno Cumbia, and Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis performs Como la Flor. Their songs are a celebration during a turbulent time, reflecting how Selena still serves as a symbol of hope in the fight for immigrants\u2019 rights. Tributes to Selena have abounded in recent years. She is still a beloved celebrity in the US, referred to as the Queen of Tejano \u2013 a blend of folk and popular music that originated on the border of Texas and Mexico. In 2016, the beauty brand Mac launched a Selena-inspired makeup collection. When, in 2017, she was honoured posthumously with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a record crowd of 4,500 people gathered for the ceremony. Now Netflix has announced that in 2020 it will air \u201ca coming-of-age story chronicling the singer\u2019s rise\u201d, starring Walking Dead actor Christian Serratos. The contours of Selena\u2019s story were set out in the 1997 biopic directed by Gregory Nava, which rocketed a little-known Jennifer Lopez to fame. The film follows Selena from her childhood in the Texan cities of Lake Jackson and later Corpus Christi, where she launched her career. Her father, the musician Abraham Quintanilla Jr, organised Selena and her two siblings, AB and Suzette, into a band that he managed. They performed frequently in his short-lived restaurant before finding fame at local carnivals, weddings and community events. By the time she was 18, Selena had recorded her first solo album \u2013 1989\u2019s Selena \u2013 and won the Tejano Music award for female vocalist of the year. She had endeared herself to audiences with a disarming girl-next-door persona and a candid approach to straddling Mexican and American identities. Her vocals were almost entirely in Spanish, but Selena was honest about her struggles learning the language as an American from Texas. She did not shy away from the intricacies of biculturalism; instead, she discussed the challenges with tender sincerity: \u201cI feel very proud to be Mexican. I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to learn Spanish when I was a girl, but \u2026 it\u2019s never too late to get in touch with your roots,\u201d she said in an interview in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1994. Selena\u2019s jostling between transnational spaces is important to younger generations, particularly because, over the last decade, the Latino demographic has shifted from foreign-born immigrants to children born in the US and navigating dual worlds as Selena did. Her fashion aesthetic was also a source of inspiration: \u201cThere was no artist who dressed like her, especially somebody that looked like us and represented us,\u201d says Doris Mu\u00f1oz, the 25-year-old music manager and concert promoter behind Selena for Sanctuary. \u201cA lot of us clung to that, because we saw ourselves in her.\u201d Onstage, Selena dazzled, embracing and challenging what people expected her to be as an artist performing in Spanish. At her unforgettable final concert in the Houston Astrodome, she arrived in a purple jumpsuit and launched into a seven-minute disco medley in English. She twirled along to cumbia melodies before breaking into lively choreography reminiscent of US stars such as Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson. Through the Latin arm of EMI, which signed her in 1989, Selena released four studio albums and the concert LP Selena Live!, the latter winning her a Grammy for best Mexican-American album in 1994. The award helped to cement Spanish-language music in the US, and Selena\u2019s place as the single leading woman in Tejano music. When she died in 1995, tens of thousands of people filed past her casket in Corpus Christi. The American Spanish language network Univision even stopped its programming to run footage of bereaved fans at the service. Four months later, her fifth studio album, Dreaming of You, came out and debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 \u2013 a first for a Latina artist that proved her reach across broad audiences. Deborah Paredez, a professor at Columbia University and the author of the 2009 book Selenidad: Selena, Latinos and the Performance of Memory, notes that Selena\u2019s catalogue drew on a range of Latin styles \u2013 something that helps explain why fans from such diverse Latin American backgrounds have united behind her. \u201cThere was an incorporation of Colombian and Caribbean rhythms \u2026 she really resonated across different points of identification or national affiliations.\u201d AB, who was Selena\u2019s producer, was aware of the blend the band was creating, saying in 1995: \u201cThey call us Tejano, and yes, we are from Texas. But a lot of the music we\u2019re playing is from Mexico and South America [and is] a mixture of tropical, reggae, cumbia, all these things. It\u2019s got pop influences to it, too.\u201d As Spanish-language pop finds renewed popularity today, Selena is still seen as a genre-crossing trailblazer: Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny has listed Selena as the icon with whom he wishes he could have collaborated, and artists from Gloria Estefan to Becky G to Leslie Grace have performed her music. AB\u2019s son, Svani Quintanilla, is now a DJ, Principe Q, and has continued his relatives\u2019 tradition of pushing cumbia music forward by mixing it with hip-hop beats. \u201cThey were making songs that were unheard of,\u201d he says, pointing to the example of the cumbia-meets-electronic hit Techno Cumbia from 1994. \u201cThat was decades ahead of its time.\u201d Mu\u00f1oz was thinking about Selena\u2019s enduring legacy when she started Selena for Sanctuary in 2017 to raise money for her own parents\u2019 citizenship proceedings. She has since expanded the benefit into a broader series that champions not-for-profit organisations fighting for immigrants\u2019 rights. For her, it made sense to centre on Selena. A Mexican-American, Mu\u00f1oz has been a fan of the singer since she was a child \u2013 her family told her that she burst into tears at the age of two when Selena\u2019s death hit the news \u2013 and as a concert promoter, she had noticed that people \u201cflocked\u201d to the singer\u2019s catalogue of upbeat, danceable hits, regardless of their age or which part of Latin America they or their families were born in. \u201cThere was that unifying factor \u2013 everyone loves her music and sees her as an inspiration.\u201d Paredez points out that Selena\u2019s music was \u201cdefinitely not overtly political\u201d, but fans have still connected her death to their own grief in times of struggle. As she notes, shortly after Selena\u2019s death, laws were passed to expand the grounds for deportation and reduce eligibility for welfare benefits, with severe implications for people in low-income, Spanish-speaking communities. This mid-90s legislation coincided with attacks on bilingual education and debates over Proposition 187, a ballot initiative that prohibited undocumented immigrants from using non-emergency healthcare in California (it was later ruled unconstitutional). \u201cHaving [Selena] killed during that time holds her in this space of potential unrealised,\u201d says Paredez. \u201cImmigrants who are making their way and trying to provide better lives for their children \u2013 that\u2019s nothing if not about a potential that then gets unrealised when they are deported or threatened.\u201d More recently, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has left many immigrants feeling more fearful than ever. A \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy initiated at the border resulted in more than 3,000 children being separated from their parents; their tearful voices went viral in audio footage recorded by journalists in 2017. Trump has used the words \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d to discuss migrants from Latin America, terms that sounded even more horrifying after a man opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people and later confessing to authorities that he was targeting Mexicans. In such an atmosphere of violence, some Latinos have used cultural totems as an escape, and Selena is among the most powerful: a pillar of hope for Latinos, eternally youthful and ready to brighten darker times, even for just a moment. \u201cHer music just brings joy to everyone in the community,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cA Selena song comes on at the club and everyone\u2019s immediately singing all the lyrics, and grabbing their friends, smiling in each other\u2019s faces. With everything that\u2019s happening in our country, we deserve these moments of joy.\u201d In addition to Selena for Sanctuary, other efforts have tied her legacy to activism: Topfoxx, a New York City-based sunglasses startup, gave proceeds from a set of Selena-themed glasses to benefit children held in detention centres; a news conference decrying family separations was held in front of her memorial statue in Corpus Christi. Younger artists invoke Selena\u2019s name when they talk about using their platform to uplift others. Jackie Cruz, who plays Flaca in Orange Is the New Black and is also a singer, released her debut album, Hija de Chavez, in October. She won attention as a vocalist after she covered Selena\u2019s Como la Flor in 2017, and she says Selena has been a role model. Cruz has spent time protesting outside detention centres across Texas. \u201cI want to be a leader in the community like she was,\u201d she says. \u201cShe taught us how to lead and how to give back and how to represent, and I want to build on that.\u201d Svani remains a frequent fixture at Selena-themed charity events and parties, and he joined Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s efforts at Selena for Sanctuary to stay involved with the community. From the stage, he watched the crowd swell with joy as they danced to his late aunt\u2019s music. \u201cIf she was here, she would be doing all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like she would be at all of these events. She would be using her voice for good.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m sitting on a beanbag in a dark room, staring at a split-screen scored with apple-green blips and streaks of light that \u2013 much like a heart monitor \u2013 record signs of life. The date: 8 September 1994. The setting: Dzanga-Sangha national park, a marshy patch in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/central-african-republic\">Central African Republic</a>. The opening notes come courtesy of a chorus of insects, whose murmurs are soon joined by the territorial shrieks of a southern tree hyrax and the grunts of a western lowland gorilla. The cacophony builds to a climax, and \u2013 the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2013 a solo rumble of African forest elephants, sloshing through water (it\u2019s the wet season). Next, the ribbits of frogs and the chirps of a red-chested cuckoo, then the alarm calls of the greater spot-nosed monkey. The performance continues in much the same vein, animal species sounding both uncomfortably close and disappointingly far away, until \u2013 at last \u2013 it fades and the apple-green blips and streaks vanish from the screen.</p> <p>The Great Animal Orchestra is the highlight of Other Spaces, three audiovisual installations by multidisciplinary collective <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV2nwn9kT0\">United Visual Artists</a>. Its conductor is ecologist Bernie Krause, who since the 1970s has been making sound recordings of various ecosystems and their residents. As well as works of art, these soundscapes are a vital means of observing shifts in the world\u2019s remaining wild habitats. Krause archives them, we\u2019re told, in case any of the animal ensembles fall silent \u2013 which, because of human activities, has so far happened in 50% of those in his collection.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV2nwn9kT0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iZV2nwn9kT0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV2nwn9kT0\">United Visual Artists\u2019 work</a> at Other Spaces</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first installation, Our Time, explores the way we interact with space \u2013 and, by extension, the world around us \u2013 up close. A row of lightbulbs suspended from the ceiling swing side to side, front to back, in sync and not. A shoddy hypnotist\u2019s pendulum, perhaps, but stand in the centre of the room and you\u2019ll soon find yourself swaying in time to both the kinetic sculptures and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/15/meet-mira-calix-who-puts-wasps-on-stage-and-her-audience-in-a-maze\">Mira Calix</a>\u2019s electronic soundtrack.</p> <p>Vanishing Point, the third installation, takes this exploration a step further \u2013 forcing us to reckon with a space manipulated by an invisible other. Inspired by the mathematical drawings of Renaissance artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, the laser installation uses perspective as a restructuring mechanism. A small, dark room is sliced and diced by beams of bright-white light projected from an unknown vanishing point. The thread-like rays may look delicate, but there\u2019s something menacing about the way they course across your body.</p> <p>Running in conjunction with Other Spaces is a group show of new work by artists curated by Jefferson Hack. Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder<em> </em>invites us to dip down beneath 180 The Strand into the basement, to visit a series of created environments by newly commissioned and debut artists.</p> <p>Doug Aitken\u2019s video installation New Era explores the invention of the mobile phone and the way it has loosened our grip on reality. Inside a hexagonal chamber of mirrors, screens and speakers, we\u2019re introduced to US engineer Martin Cooper \u2013 the now 90-year-old who led the team that built the first mobile phone \u2013 who declares, repeatedly: \u201cI made a phone call.\u201d A kaleidoscope of sweeping landscapes, manmade highways and myriad communication systems reflects our immersive relationship with handheld devices and the hyperconnected age in which we live.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad6381cdf937bb66357e3c7b8914f6b773a6faaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad6381cdf937bb66357e3c7b8914f6b773a6faaa/0_51_1515_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrence Lek\u2019s installation Temple Ost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Night out \u2026 Lawrence Lek\u2019s installation Temple Ost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar temporal and spatial dislocation occurs in Lawrence Lek\u2019s Temple Ost, which uses CGI and 3D animation to connect the building with nearby Temple tube station. Virtual partygoers parade from the underground station to the cavernous space beneath the creative hub for a night out. Elsewhere, Korakrit Arunanondchai gives us a glimpse of Thai folklore and culture with a trio of videos that weave shots of his grandparents, nature, Thai and American protesters, and computer hard drives. And Jenn Nkiru\u2019s Rebirth is Necessary \u2013 a rhythmic film with roots in Afro-surrealism \u2013 splices new and archival footage and recordings to create a dialogue between past and present expressions of black identity.</p> <p>The final work is a collaboration between artists Sophia Al-Maria and Victoria Sin. The first of two encounters sees a female figure wearing a yellow bikini, coat and sandals telling us \u2013 rather forcefully \u2013 to breathe. Sounds simple, but the effect is strangely soothing. Speaking of which, you could spend hours in these free, otherworldly exhibitions, soaking up the sounds, sights and scents. Just remember to wrap up \u2013 it\u2019s cold, especially in the basement.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://180thestrand.com/\">Other Spaces and Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder are at 180 The Strand, London</a>, until 8 December.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting on a beanbag in a dark room, staring at a split-screen scored with apple-green blips and streaks of light that \u2013 much like a heart monitor \u2013 record signs of life. The date: 8 September 1994. The setting: Dzanga-Sangha national park, a marshy patch in the Central African Republic. The opening notes come courtesy of a chorus of insects, whose murmurs are soon joined by the territorial shrieks of a southern tree hyrax and the grunts of a western lowland gorilla. The cacophony builds to a climax, and \u2013 the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2013 a solo rumble of African forest elephants, sloshing through water (it\u2019s the wet season). Next, the ribbits of frogs and the chirps of a red-chested cuckoo, then the alarm calls of the greater spot-nosed monkey. The performance continues in much the same vein, animal species sounding both uncomfortably close and disappointingly far away, until \u2013 at last \u2013 it fades and the apple-green blips and streaks vanish from the screen. The Great Animal Orchestra is the highlight of Other Spaces, three audiovisual installations by multidisciplinary collective United Visual Artists. Its conductor is ecologist Bernie Krause, who since the 1970s has been making sound recordings of various ecosystems and their residents. As well as works of art, these soundscapes are a vital means of observing shifts in the world\u2019s remaining wild habitats. Krause archives them, we\u2019re told, in case any of the animal ensembles fall silent \u2013 which, because of human activities, has so far happened in 50% of those in his collection. The first installation, Our Time, explores the way we interact with space \u2013 and, by extension, the world around us \u2013 up close. A row of lightbulbs suspended from the ceiling swing side to side, front to back, in sync and not. A shoddy hypnotist\u2019s pendulum, perhaps, but stand in the centre of the room and you\u2019ll soon find yourself swaying in time to both the kinetic sculptures and Mira Calix\u2019s electronic soundtrack. Vanishing Point, the third installation, takes this exploration a step further \u2013 forcing us to reckon with a space manipulated by an invisible other. Inspired by the mathematical drawings of Renaissance artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, the laser installation uses perspective as a restructuring mechanism. A small, dark room is sliced and diced by beams of bright-white light projected from an unknown vanishing point. The thread-like rays may look delicate, but there\u2019s something menacing about the way they course across your body. Running in conjunction with Other Spaces is a group show of new work by artists curated by Jefferson Hack. Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder invites us to dip down beneath 180 The Strand into the basement, to visit a series of created environments by newly commissioned and debut artists. Doug Aitken\u2019s video installation New Era explores the invention of the mobile phone and the way it has loosened our grip on reality. Inside a hexagonal chamber of mirrors, screens and speakers, we\u2019re introduced to US engineer Martin Cooper \u2013 the now 90-year-old who led the team that built the first mobile phone \u2013 who declares, repeatedly: \u201cI made a phone call.\u201d A kaleidoscope of sweeping landscapes, manmade highways and myriad communication systems reflects our immersive relationship with handheld devices and the hyperconnected age in which we live. A similar temporal and spatial dislocation occurs in Lawrence Lek\u2019s Temple Ost, which uses CGI and 3D animation to connect the building with nearby Temple tube station. Virtual partygoers parade from the underground station to the cavernous space beneath the creative hub for a night out. Elsewhere, Korakrit Arunanondchai gives us a glimpse of Thai folklore and culture with a trio of videos that weave shots of his grandparents, nature, Thai and American protesters, and computer hard drives. And Jenn Nkiru\u2019s Rebirth is Necessary \u2013 a rhythmic film with roots in Afro-surrealism \u2013 splices new and archival footage and recordings to create a dialogue between past and present expressions of black identity. The final work is a collaboration between artists Sophia Al-Maria and Victoria Sin. The first of two encounters sees a female figure wearing a yellow bikini, coat and sandals telling us \u2013 rather forcefully \u2013 to breathe. Sounds simple, but the effect is strangely soothing. Speaking of which, you could spend hours in these free, otherworldly exhibitions, soaking up the sounds, sights and scents. Just remember to wrap up \u2013 it\u2019s cold, especially in the basement. \u2022 Other Spaces and Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder are at 180 The Strand, London, until 8 December.",

      "body": "<p>For the Hillsborough families whose 96 loved ones were killed so horrifically at a football match on a sunny spring day in 1989, a 30-year battle for the truth and accountability has culminated in another outcome they find impossible to accept. They fought for 21 years against the first inquest verdict of accidental death in 1991, finally seeing it quashed in 2012. Then in April 2016, the jury at the new inquests determined that the 96 people were unlawfully killed by the gross negligence manslaughter of the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, to a criminal standard of proof.</p> <p>Yet now, following a grim, painful trial and retrial at Preston crown court, in which the families accused the judge of not being impartial, the jury at his prosecution has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/28/hillsborough-david-duckenfield-verdict\">found him not guilty</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/28/hillsborough-david-duckenfield-verdict\"> of, in effect, the same offence: gross negligence manslaughter</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35fb185dcdb8dc12840bdd52efadaa07ec2caae7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35fb185dcdb8dc12840bdd52efadaa07ec2caae7/0_31_2698_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Duckenfield arriving at Preston crown court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Duckenfield arriving at Preston crown court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Duckenfield, prosecution inevitably followed the inquests, where he admitted in March 2015 that his multiple \u201cprofessional failings\u201d at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 \u201cled to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children\u201d.</p> <p>The inquest jury based its unlawful killing verdict on the clear direction of the coroner, the senior former Court of Appeal judge Sir John Goldring, that they could reach it only if they were satisfied \u201cthat David Duckenfield, the match commander, was responsible for the manslaughter by gross negligence of those 96 people\u201d.</p> <p>It also demolished the toxic case made by the South Yorkshire police after the disaster: to blame the victims, those 24,000 people who had gone to Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough ground to support Liverpool and been plunged into horror at the squalid Leppings Lane end. That campaign of blame was infamously initiated by Duckenfield himself, who falsely blamed Liverpool supporters even as people were dying from the crush in \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace.</p> <p>Asked what had happened by the Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Graham Kelly, Duckenfield did not tell the truth: that he had ordered exit gates to be opened to allow a large number of people in quickly and alleviate a crush at the turnstiles. Instead, Duckenfield told Kelly that Liverpool supporters had forced a gate open.</p> <p>At the new inquests, Duckenfield admitted that after exit gate C was opened and more than 2,000 people came in, his own failure to have them directed away from a tunnel, which led to the crowded central pens, caused the lethal crush. He also admitted that he had indeed lied at 3:15pm on the day, then again at a meeting of club directors at about 3:45pm, and that it had been a \u201cterrible lie\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/hillsborough_stadium-zip/giv-125157sR5Ama78eW5/\" data-alt=\"Hillsborough stadium\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/hillsborough_stadium-zip/giv-125157sR5Ama78eW5/\">Hillsborough stadium</a> </figure>  <p>Quickly relayed to the BBC at the match and broadcast to the nation at 3:40pm, his lie laid the foundation for years of victim-blaming by police that followed: allegations that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late, drunk, loutish and without tickets, and tried to force their way in.</p> <p>The new inquests jury heard all the evidence over more than two exhaustive years, the longest case ever heard in British legal history. They concluded in their verdicts that the behaviour of those paying spectators looking forward to supporting Kenny Dalglish\u2019s brilliant team did not contribute at all to the disaster.</p> <p>Yet despite those hard-won legal findings, in Preston the effort began again on behalf of Duckenfield to reverse the inquests\u2019 determinations. Over the many weeks in the gloom of downstairs court number one, Duckenfield\u2019s barrister, Benjamin Myers QC, indignantly denied any failings at all, and even denied that hDuckenfield\u2019s admission of failures on oath four years earlier were really admissions at all, arguing they had been taken \u201cout of context\u201d.</p> <p>Myers based a defence mostly on arguing it was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/14/hillsborough-officer-david-duckenfield-manslaughter-charge-unfair-court-hears\">bitterly and deeply unfair</a>\u201d to be prosecuting Duckenfield when other factors were to blame \u2013 including the safety flaws of the Leppings Lane terrace and its vile \u201cpens\u201d, the \u201cdefective\u201d police plan Duckenfield inherited and radios not working properly \u2013 and resurrecting the old allegations against the victims. Myers also criticised other police officers who had worked to Duckenfield\u2019s command, including one, Insp Harry White, whom Duckenfield had explicitly said in his evidence at the inquests he did not blame or criticise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2016/apr/06/hillsborough-victims-the-96-people-whose-lives-were-cut-short\">Hillsborough victims: the 96 people whose lives were cut short</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hole in the heart of these proceedings, the question about the British legal system looming over every miserable day for the families, was why it allows and requires this: established truths, determined by a jury on comprehensive evidence given on oath in front of a senior judge, erased and up for grabs again.</p> <p>The Preston trials were marshalled by Sir Peter Openshaw, a veteran judge of the criminal court circuit in Lancashire. Although the new jury was effectively deciding the same questions about the same disaster, Openshaw gave them the required legal direction that previous findings \u2013 about which they were not informed anyway \u2013 were \u201cquite irrelevant\u201d because \u201cthe rules and procedures were very different to a criminal trial\u201d.</p> <p>So a blank page was presented to a new jury, as if no truths had been accepted over 30 years, through the families\u2019 fight, fury and an infinity of tears. Repeatedly, Myers was on his feet alleging that Liverpool supporters had indeed arrived late; that many were without tickets and many had had a drink; that they pushed, misbehaved, refused to accede to police instructions and tried to cheat their way into the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"385f88a417d236a0a74a20b9f8e9410cf12aa51f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385f88a417d236a0a74a20b9f8e9410cf12aa51f/0_195_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans try to get to safety at Hillsborough during the 1989 semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans try to get to safety at Hillsborough during the 1989 semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hillsborough Inquests/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the adversarial system, a defendant can present any case to a court within the rules as applied by the judge, and it is up to the opponent, here the Crown Prosecution Service, to challenge them. The only evidence that counts is what the two opponents have presented in that courtroom, often in hasty responses.</p> <p>The most glaring example of the departure from established truths this can create came in the first trial, which culminated in a hung jury. The CPS lead barrister, Richard Matthews QC, had decided not to make much of Duckenfield\u2019s lie on the day, except, almost in passing, the bare fact that he said it. This was a legal assessment that bewildered and exasperated the families. In Openshaw\u2019s summing up, the judge suggested to the jury that Duckenfield had not, in fact, lied after all. He said that Duckenfield appeared to have genuinely formed the impression that supporters had forced a gate, and that given the circumstances, it was \u201cnot at all surprising\u201d. The jury was never told that Duckenfield had actually admitted in previous proceedings four years earlier that he had told a terrible lie.</p> <p>On the question of Duckenfield\u2019s experience, there was consideration of large events whose police operations he had commanded, including a Billy Graham rally and a Bruce Springsteen concert at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane ground. Duckenfield had acknowledged those at the inquests, but explained: \u201cThey were different to the football matches of the time.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to that, Openshaw told the jury: \u201cAs [Duckenfield] said, the atmosphere of those events \u2013 and the kind of people attending them \u2013 were very different from those attending a semi-final.\u201d</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose 18-year-old son, James, was one of the 96 people killed, said family members hearing that were devastated, and considered the summing up \u201cone-sided\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI found it disgusting. Like the judge was saying my lovely innocent son and all our 96 were a different kind of people, hooligans, and their families. Even in death, after 30 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"592ee646d6d45049277252fbfd94abf1d2f884ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/592ee646d6d45049277252fbfd94abf1d2f884ee/0_25_1603_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casualties are carried away after the crush at Hillsborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casualties being carried away after the crush at Hillsborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Operation Resolve/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In heated meetings over the summer, many family members called on the CPS to improve their performance, and to apply for the judge to be replaced. The CPS did strengthen their case somewhat, including by emphatically presenting Duckenfield\u2019s lie in evidence this time.

      "bodyText": "For the Hillsborough families whose 96 loved ones were killed so horrifically at a football match on a sunny spring day in 1989, a 30-year battle for the truth and accountability has culminated in another outcome they find impossible to accept. They fought for 21 years against the first inquest verdict of accidental death in 1991, finally seeing it quashed in 2012. Then in April 2016, the jury at the new inquests determined that the 96 people were unlawfully killed by the gross negligence manslaughter of the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, to a criminal standard of proof. Yet now, following a grim, painful trial and retrial at Preston crown court, in which the families accused the judge of not being impartial, the jury at his prosecution has found him not guilty of, in effect, the same offence: gross negligence manslaughter. For Duckenfield, prosecution inevitably followed the inquests, where he admitted in March 2015 that his multiple \u201cprofessional failings\u201d at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 \u201cled to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children\u201d. The inquest jury based its unlawful killing verdict on the clear direction of the coroner, the senior former Court of Appeal judge Sir John Goldring, that they could reach it only if they were satisfied \u201cthat David Duckenfield, the match commander, was responsible for the manslaughter by gross negligence of those 96 people\u201d. It also demolished the toxic case made by the South Yorkshire police after the disaster: to blame the victims, those 24,000 people who had gone to Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough ground to support Liverpool and been plunged into horror at the squalid Leppings Lane end. That campaign of blame was infamously initiated by Duckenfield himself, who falsely blamed Liverpool supporters even as people were dying from the crush in \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace. Asked what had happened by the Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Graham Kelly, Duckenfield did not tell the truth: that he had ordered exit gates to be opened to allow a large number of people in quickly and alleviate a crush at the turnstiles. Instead, Duckenfield told Kelly that Liverpool supporters had forced a gate open. At the new inquests, Duckenfield admitted that after exit gate C was opened and more than 2,000 people came in, his own failure to have them directed away from a tunnel, which led to the crowded central pens, caused the lethal crush. He also admitted that he had indeed lied at 3:15pm on the day, then again at a meeting of club directors at about 3:45pm, and that it had been a \u201cterrible lie\u201d. Quickly relayed to the BBC at the match and broadcast to the nation at 3:40pm, his lie laid the foundation for years of victim-blaming by police that followed: allegations that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late, drunk, loutish and without tickets, and tried to force their way in. The new inquests jury heard all the evidence over more than two exhaustive years, the longest case ever heard in British legal history. They concluded in their verdicts that the behaviour of those paying spectators looking forward to supporting Kenny Dalglish\u2019s brilliant team did not contribute at all to the disaster. Yet despite those hard-won legal findings, in Preston the effort began again on behalf of Duckenfield to reverse the inquests\u2019 determinations. Over the many weeks in the gloom of downstairs court number one, Duckenfield\u2019s barrister, Benjamin Myers QC, indignantly denied any failings at all, and even denied that hDuckenfield\u2019s admission of failures on oath four years earlier were really admissions at all, arguing they had been taken \u201cout of context\u201d. Myers based a defence mostly on arguing it was \u201cbitterly and deeply unfair\u201d to be prosecuting Duckenfield when other factors were to blame \u2013 including the safety flaws of the Leppings Lane terrace and its vile \u201cpens\u201d, the \u201cdefective\u201d police plan Duckenfield inherited and radios not working properly \u2013 and resurrecting the old allegations against the victims. Myers also criticised other police officers who had worked to Duckenfield\u2019s command, including one, Insp Harry White, whom Duckenfield had explicitly said in his evidence at the inquests he did not blame or criticise. The hole in the heart of these proceedings, the question about the British legal system looming over every miserable day for the families, was why it allows and requires this: established truths, determined by a jury on comprehensive evidence given on oath in front of a senior judge, erased and up for grabs again. The Preston trials were marshalled by Sir Peter Openshaw, a veteran judge of the criminal court circuit in Lancashire. Although the new jury was effectively deciding the same questions about the same disaster, Openshaw gave them the required legal direction that previous findings \u2013 about which they were not informed anyway \u2013 were \u201cquite irrelevant\u201d because \u201cthe rules and procedures were very different to a criminal trial\u201d. So a blank page was presented to a new jury, as if no truths had been accepted over 30 years, through the families\u2019 fight, fury and an infinity of tears. Repeatedly, Myers was on his feet alleging that Liverpool supporters had indeed arrived late; that many were without tickets and many had had a drink; that they pushed, misbehaved, refused to accede to police instructions and tried to cheat their way into the ground. In the adversarial system, a defendant can present any case to a court within the rules as applied by the judge, and it is up to the opponent, here the Crown Prosecution Service, to challenge them. The only evidence that counts is what the two opponents have presented in that courtroom, often in hasty responses. The most glaring example of the departure from established truths this can create came in the first trial, which culminated in a hung jury. The CPS lead barrister, Richard Matthews QC, had decided not to make much of Duckenfield\u2019s lie on the day, except, almost in passing, the bare fact that he said it. This was a legal assessment that bewildered and exasperated the families. In Openshaw\u2019s summing up, the judge suggested to the jury that Duckenfield had not, in fact, lied after all. He said that Duckenfield appeared to have genuinely formed the impression that supporters had forced a gate, and that given the circumstances, it was \u201cnot at all surprising\u201d. The jury was never told that Duckenfield had actually admitted in previous proceedings four years earlier that he had told a terrible lie. On the question of Duckenfield\u2019s experience, there was consideration of large events whose police operations he had commanded, including a Billy Graham rally and a Bruce Springsteen concert at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane ground. Duckenfield had acknowledged those at the inquests, but explained: \u201cThey were different to the football matches of the time.\u201d Referring to that, Openshaw told the jury: \u201cAs [Duckenfield] said, the atmosphere of those events \u2013 and the kind of people attending them \u2013 were very different from those attending a semi-final.\u201d Margaret Aspinall, the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose 18-year-old son, James, was one of the 96 people killed, said family members hearing that were devastated, and considered the summing up \u201cone-sided\u201d. She said: \u201cI found it disgusting. Like the judge was saying my lovely innocent son and all our 96 were a different kind of people, hooligans, and their families. Even in death, after 30 years.\u201d In heated meetings over the summer, many family members called on the CPS to improve their performance, and to apply for the judge to be replaced. The CPS did strengthen their case somewhat, including by emphatically presenting Duckenfield\u2019s lie in evidence this time. But Matthews still left out large areas that had been considered by the inquests jury, crucially including whether other police officers\u2019 1989 evidence was reliable. He declined to challenge Openshaw continuing as the trial judge. When the retrial began on 7 October, Openshaw was in his position again, on the raised, wood-panelled stage. Duckenfield was in the courtroom, not in the dock allocated for criminal defendants; the judge allowed this throughout, explaining in a ruling that it was part of making allowances for Duckenfield\u2019s post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. On October 24, the judge told the jury in some detail that Duckenfield had reported poorly with a chest infection, including that he had driven himself to hospital although he had been told to call an ambulance as a precaution. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, poor chap,\u201d Openshaw said. That was followed by a direction to the jury that if they thought Duckenfield was not showing any emotion as they heard about the horrific crush, and as bereaved parents gave evidence about the loss of their children, it could be explained due to him suffering from PTSD. The families, who have suffered endless grief and trauma for 30 years, reacted with dismay to these interventions, and asked if an accused in a criminal trial would normally be referred to as \u201cpoor chap\u201d. In his summing up of the evidence, Openshaw made a similar reference to the Bruce Springsteen concert and Billy Graham rally, telling the jury that Duckenfield had said of them at the inquests: \u201cThe nature and tone of the events \u2013 and indeed the people who attended \u2013 was completely different from a semi-final.\u201d He did take the jury through Duckenfield\u2019s admissions at the inquests, but added that Duckenfield had \u201cprefaced\u201d many of them by saying he was conceding to failures only with the benefit of hindsight. He did not explain to the jury that the inquests barristers had sought to break that down, asking Duckenfield if he accepted that he failed according to how competent he should have been at the time. Openshaw cited Myers\u2019 argument that the admissions had been \u201cwrung out\u201d of Duckenfield over six days of questioning. But the judge did not explain that many of Duckenfield\u2019s acknowledgements of failure were in fact made on the first two days, to Christina Lambert QC, counsel to the inquests. Nor that Duckenfield\u2019s acceptance that his own \u201cprofessional failings led to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children\u201d was made to his own barrister, John Beggs QC. Throughout, the jury was told to remove emotion from their consideration, and very little was heard of the 96 people themselves, whose terrible deaths Duckenfield was accused of causing.

      "bodyText": "SURROUND SOUND If you stand looking north-east or south-west anywhere in the English midlands, so one ear points north-west while the other faces south-east, you can probably hear, in perfect stereo, a click, a puff, cascading liquid, and finally two extremely satisfying thuds. Those are the sounds, in the wake of Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s advancement to the knockout stages of Big Cup, of Pep Guardiola and Humility Man\u2122 lighting up a cigar, pouring themselves a large brandy and throwing their boots up on the desk. Job\u2019s done! Wahey! All finished! Now to enjoy Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year with nary a care in the world. Poor old J\u00fcrgen Klopp doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Not even the smallest sip of gl\u00fchwein for Po\u2019 J\u00fcrgs. This miserable state of affairs is a result of Liverpool\u2019s December schedule, in which the Premier League leaders and European champions have to kick off a brand new match every 80 minutes as part of a collaborative effort between Fifa, Uefa and the Premier League to rupture the space-time continuum. Wednesday night\u2019s working over by Napoli doesn\u2019t help matters, as they\u2019ll now have to put in a shift at Salzburg if they want to make it to the last 16, though Klopp is more worried about the ankle-knack picked up by Fabinho. \u201cThat\u2019s massive, I don\u2019t want to say what I expect, but it\u2019s pretty painful,\u201d Klopp sighed, as party poppers went off in the background, Marco Silva adding to the sound collage before next Wednesday\u2019s Merseyside derby. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard can\u2019t relax either. No cigar or brandy for Po\u2019 Frankie yet. Not allowed. That\u2019s because his FLC side are also still fretting on qualification, drawing 2-2 with Valencia in a game where the absurdly profligate Spanish side\u2019s expected goals tally must have been six or seven at the very least. (We haven\u2019t checked but it must have been, or those stats are less than worthless, we saw all those gilt-edged chances with our own eyes.) Chelsea now have to beat Lille in their last game to make sure of advancement, though some good news could be taken away when a worrying-looking knack for Tammy Abraham turned out to be mere bruising. Ah well, FLCMFL and J\u00fcrgen labour on. No complaints, it\u2019s their job after all, though it is hard to concentrate with all this lip smacking, ice cracking and contented laughter rumbling away in the background. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray now for hot MBM coverage of Astana 1-3 Manchester United, while Paul Doyle and Simon Burnton will have the Big Vase clockwatch from 5.55pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHe\u2019s turned his back on the city and what made him who he is\u201d \u2013 Kaveh Hosseinpour, vice-president of the Malm\u00f6 supporters\u2019 club, after Zlatan Ibrahimovic bought a 25% share of rival Swedish top-flight club Hammarby. A 9ft statue of the striker has been further vandalised by people attempting to set it alight. RECOMMENDED VOTING Vote! Vote! Vote! RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly Extra will be in this general vicinity. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIf Matt Dony, or indeed any Fiver readers of a certain age, are missing the 90s (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), I can heartily recommend the Britpop Revival Show, which plays two hours of classics from the era every Wednesday night. I can also (albeit slightly less heartily) recommend Love in the Time of Britpop, which not only has lots of Britpop references but also plenty of 90s football, including a namecheck for Tommy Tynan of Plymouth Argyle fame. There\u2019s also a rude joke about Menswear for good measure\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods. \u201cJacklin O\u2019Riordan tried to claim \u00a31,452 from The Fiver for a failed so-called \u2018business agreement\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s letters). I think Jacklin should wait in line, as the majority of long-time Fiver sufferers like myself deserve compensation for having your tea-timely nonsense forced into our inboxes for so long. Mind you, even the suggestion that you would even have any money that Weird Uncle Fiver hadn\u2019t already pinched from you to support his habits laughable\u201d \u2013 Nick Jeffery. \u201cAs a famously positive person who only ever sees the good in people, I can only imagine that Jacklin genuinely values a copy of An A to Z of Football Collectibles to be worth \u00a31,452. Now, I appear to have recently come into possession of said artefact, and Jacklin\u2019s in luck! I\u2019m willing to part with it for the low, low price of \u00a31,089: a massive saving of 25%! Better move fast, these kinds of offers can\u2019t last. I await the call\u201d \u2013 Matt Dony. \u201cAs a flamin\u2019 Strayan Soccer supporter, we are desperate for a coach to make it on the world stage. Imagine my dismay to hear Ante Covic was shown the door marked Do One at Hertha (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs). This was soon overcome with a little research showing that our Ante is actually still the custodian at Rockdale City Suns FC. By the way, Kevin Muscat is available.

Several thousand employees greeted his return with thunderous applause. One sign read: \u201cHow do you spell relief? Ruckelshaus.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting on his long career in 2001, Ruckelshaus said: \u201cAt EPA, you worked for a cause that is beyond self-interest and larger than the goals people normally pursue. You\u2019re not there for the money, you\u2019re there for something beyond yourself.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, he joined other former EPA directors in championing the agency against cuts or efforts to curtail its authority.</p> <p>In late 2015, before receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/epa-william-ruckelshaus-republicans-climate-change\">he told the Guardian</a>: \u201cThe [Obama] administration is trying to lead on climate change but they aren\u2019t getting much support from the Republicans who have turned it into a partisan issue, which is too bad.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are successful, that will set us back a fair bit.

He said some states don\u2019t have the resources to police big polluters, and others lack the will.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that the ultimate authority to enforce the law was put into federal hands was because the states weren\u2019t any good at it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to delegate it to the states \u2026 is completely fraudulent.\u201d</p> <p>Ruckelshaus was born in 1932 in Indianapolis to a family of leading Republicans.

Reagan asked him back to the EPA in 1983 to help restore public trust after the prior administrator \u2013 Anne M Gorsuch, mother of current supreme court Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2013 was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents about her agency\u2019s allegedly lax efforts to clean up toxic waste. Ruckelshaus said he accepted the job because he thought he could help staff re-establish the EPA\u2019s credibility. Several thousand employees greeted his return with thunderous applause. One sign read: \u201cHow do you spell relief? Ruckelshaus.\u201d Reflecting on his long career in 2001, Ruckelshaus said: \u201cAt EPA, you worked for a cause that is beyond self-interest and larger than the goals people normally pursue. You\u2019re not there for the money, you\u2019re there for something beyond yourself.\u201d In recent years, he joined other former EPA directors in championing the agency against cuts or efforts to curtail its authority. In late 2015, before receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama, he told the Guardian: \u201cThe [Obama] administration is trying to lead on climate change but they aren\u2019t getting much support from the Republicans who have turned it into a partisan issue, which is too bad. \u201cIf they are successful, that will set us back a fair bit. It won\u2019t look good to the world and it won\u2019t be good for the US.\u201d That was before Trump \u2013 about whom he said \u201cI don\u2019t know what Trump actually knows about climate change, I don\u2019t think Trump thinks much about many of the issues\u201d \u2013 won office. In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Ruckelshaus\u2019s criticism of moves to roll back environmental protections and give more regulatory power to states was withering. He said some states don\u2019t have the resources to police big polluters, and others lack the will. \u201cThe reason that the ultimate authority to enforce the law was put into federal hands was because the states weren\u2019t any good at it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to delegate it to the states \u2026 is completely fraudulent.\u201d Ruckelshaus was born in 1932 in Indianapolis to a family of leading Republicans. He told the Los Angeles Times in 1971 his interest in nature and conservation was rooted when his father took him fishing in northern Michigan. Between stints at the EPA, he moved his family to the Seattle area where he had spent two years out of high school as an army drill sergeant at the Fort Lewis. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. He led federal efforts to recover Chinook salmon and steered an ambitious state initiative to clean up and restore Puget Sound, where salmon and orcas are in danger. His focus on a collaborative science-based process helped set the course for the Puget Sound Partnership, charged with cleaning up the inland waters by 2020. His daughter, Mary Ruckelshaus, was the agency\u2019s chief scientist as her father led the leadership council that oversaw it. Denis Hayes, who coordinated the first Earth Day in 1970, once called Ruckelshaus \u201ca Republican environmental hero\u201d and Washington governor Chris Gregoire described him as \u201cbig as the great outdoors\u201d. Ruckelshaus was on the boards of directors of several major corporations. He was senior vice-president for law and corporate affairs at the Weyerhaeuser before returning to the EPA. Some environmentalists criticized his close ties to some of the industries that the EPA regulated. He was chief executive of Browning-Ferris Industries from 1988 to 1995 and chairman from 1995 to 1999. He was also a strategic director of Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, an early backer of companies such as Amazon.",

      "body": "<p>The Maltese prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, who resigned this week, has been arrested and questioned by police over allegations that he is a co-conspirator in the murder of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Keith Schembri, a businessman who has run the office of the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, since the Malta Labour party came to power in 2013, was arrested on Tuesday, police sources confirmed.</p> <p>It is understood he was taken into custody after allegations by the businessman Yorgen Fenech, who was arrested last week after trying to leave Malta on his yacht.</p> <p>Fenech, who is himself under suspicion for involvement in the killing, is understood to have implicated Schembri in the hope of receiving a presidential pardon. Caruana Galizia, Malta\u2019s foremost investigative journalist, was killed in October 2017 when a bomb fixed to her car was detonated near her home in the village of Bidnija. She had exposed corruption at the highest levels in government and business circles.</p> <p>The killing of a prominent journalist in a European Union member state drew international attention and raised concerns about the rule of law in Malta.</p> <p>Caruana Galizia\u2019s family said they were seeking an urgent meeting with the attorney general, Peter Grech, in an effort to prevent Fenech from being granted a pardon. \u201cWe urgently want to clarify the situation,\u201d the family said.</p> <p>An official in the attorney general\u2019s office said he would meet the family to discuss their concerns.</p> <p>Lawyers for Schembri and Fenech did not respond to requests for comment. Maltese police have made no statement.</p> <p>In a further development, a doctor has been arrested, accused of passing messages between Schembri and Fenech. According to local reports, citing police sources, Dr Adrian Vella is suspected of passing messages to Fenech while the businessman was on police bail and in hospital under supervision by officers. At that point, Schembri had not yet resigned. The doctor was close to Schembri, reports said, having accompanied him on trips for medical treatment in recent years.</p> <p>Vella\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The revelation will add to the pressure on the prime minister to step down. Muscat yesterday lost a key ally when the influential newspaper Malta Today withdrew its support. The paper\u2019s co-owner was known to be close to Muscat.</p> <p>\u201cJoseph Muscat\u2019s moral authority has been compromised to the point of no return,\u201d the paper\u2019s executive editor wrote in a scathing editorial. \u201cThe stage is set for Muscat\u2019s exit.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister is reportedly planning to address a Labour party rally on Sunday. But, in a Facebook post yesterday, his education minister, Evarist Bartolo, undermined the show of support, warning against raising the political temperature and saying it was not the time for \u201chot heads and spreading hatred and violence\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cProtests are essential in a democracy, but they have to be civil and democratic because it is easy to spark the crowd, but then how to put out the fire?\u201d The opposition Nationalist party has cancelled an event on Sunday after criticism that it could also inflame the situation.</p> <p>Caruana Galizia\u2019s family have urged supporters to attend demonstrations organised by campaign groups and avoid party political events. \u201cDO NOT go to any rallies organised by party leaders,\u201d her son Matthew Caruana Galizia wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is not a time for tribal politics. Joseph Muscat wants us to go to war against each other. Our war is against corruption.\u201d</p> <p>Schembri was arrested after tendering his resignation on Monday night, following a long meeting at Muscat\u2019s home. For nearly four years, he has been at the centre of a political scandal triggered by Caruana Galizia\u2019s investigations.</p> <p>Using a leak of offshore information known as the Panama Papers, she reported that Schembri and a fellow minister, Konrad Mizzi, had become the beneficiaries of secretive offshore companies soon after entering office. Subsequent investigations uncovered that those companies were due to receive payments from another shell company, belonging to Fenech.</p> <p>The businessman was granted a valuable concession by the government to run a power station, while Mizzi was energy minister. Mizzi resigned on Tuesday, saying he was guilty of poor judgment but innocent of any criminal conduct.</p> <p>Schembri has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing.</p> <p>A suspected middleman, Melvin Theuma, was granted a presidential pardon in exchange for information on Monday, and is scheduled to testify before a magistrate tomorrow.</p> <p>Three accused hitmen - Alfred Degiorgio, his brother George, and Vincent Muscat - are also in detention following their arrest in December 2017, but have not yet been brought to trial. They have been charged with planting the explosive device that killed Caruana Galizia.</p> <p>The campaign group Reporters Without Borders called for all those implicated in the murder to be brought to trial.</p> <p>\u201cAfter two long years of impunity, we welcome the significant developments that now appear to be taking place in the investigation into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia. However, these are not sufficient steps towards justice. We call for all hitmen, all middlemen, and all masterminds to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d its UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent, said.</p> <p>Yesterday there were clashes in Malta\u2019s parliament, with opposition MPs staging a walkout from the House of Representatives in protest at what they said was the prime minister\u2019s refusal to shoulder political responsibility.</p> <p>Before leaving the chamber, the Nationalist party leader, Adrian Delia, called on Muscat to resign and announced the Nationalists would no longer speak to a \u201cgovernment that has lots its legitimacy, since the prime minister does not recognise his political responsibility\u201d.</p>",

It is understood he was taken into custody after allegations by the businessman Yorgen Fenech, who was arrested last week after trying to leave Malta on his yacht. Fenech, who is himself under suspicion for involvement in the killing, is understood to have implicated Schembri in the hope of receiving a presidential pardon. Caruana Galizia, Malta\u2019s foremost investigative journalist, was killed in October 2017 when a bomb fixed to her car was detonated near her home in the village of Bidnija. She had exposed corruption at the highest levels in government and business circles. The killing of a prominent journalist in a European Union member state drew international attention and raised concerns about the rule of law in Malta. Caruana Galizia\u2019s family said they were seeking an urgent meeting with the attorney general, Peter Grech, in an effort to prevent Fenech from being granted a pardon. \u201cWe urgently want to clarify the situation,\u201d the family said. An official in the attorney general\u2019s office said he would meet the family to discuss their concerns. Lawyers for Schembri and Fenech did not respond to requests for comment. Maltese police have made no statement. In a further development, a doctor has been arrested, accused of passing messages between Schembri and Fenech. According to local reports, citing police sources, Dr Adrian Vella is suspected of passing messages to Fenech while the businessman was on police bail and in hospital under supervision by officers. At that point, Schembri had not yet resigned. The doctor was close to Schembri, reports said, having accompanied him on trips for medical treatment in recent years. Vella\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. The revelation will add to the pressure on the prime minister to step down. Muscat yesterday lost a key ally when the influential newspaper Malta Today withdrew its support. The paper\u2019s co-owner was known to be close to Muscat. \u201cJoseph Muscat\u2019s moral authority has been compromised to the point of no return,\u201d the paper\u2019s executive editor wrote in a scathing editorial. \u201cThe stage is set for Muscat\u2019s exit.\u201d The prime minister is reportedly planning to address a Labour party rally on Sunday. But, in a Facebook post yesterday, his education minister, Evarist Bartolo, undermined the show of support, warning against raising the political temperature and saying it was not the time for \u201chot heads and spreading hatred and violence\u201d. He added: \u201cProtests are essential in a democracy, but they have to be civil and democratic because it is easy to spark the crowd, but then how to put out the fire?\u201d The opposition Nationalist party has cancelled an event on Sunday after criticism that it could also inflame the situation. Caruana Galizia\u2019s family have urged supporters to attend demonstrations organised by campaign groups and avoid party political events. \u201cDO NOT go to any rallies organised by party leaders,\u201d her son Matthew Caruana Galizia wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is not a time for tribal politics. Joseph Muscat wants us to go to war against each other. Our war is against corruption.\u201d Schembri was arrested after tendering his resignation on Monday night, following a long meeting at Muscat\u2019s home. For nearly four years, he has been at the centre of a political scandal triggered by Caruana Galizia\u2019s investigations. Using a leak of offshore information known as the Panama Papers, she reported that Schembri and a fellow minister, Konrad Mizzi, had become the beneficiaries of secretive offshore companies soon after entering office. Subsequent investigations uncovered that those companies were due to receive payments from another shell company, belonging to Fenech. The businessman was granted a valuable concession by the government to run a power station, while Mizzi was energy minister. Mizzi resigned on Tuesday, saying he was guilty of poor judgment but innocent of any criminal conduct. Schembri has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing. A suspected middleman, Melvin Theuma, was granted a presidential pardon in exchange for information on Monday, and is scheduled to testify before a magistrate tomorrow. Three accused hitmen - Alfred Degiorgio, his brother George, and Vincent Muscat - are also in detention following their arrest in December 2017, but have not yet been brought to trial. They have been charged with planting the explosive device that killed Caruana Galizia. The campaign group Reporters Without Borders called for all those implicated in the murder to be brought to trial. \u201cAfter two long years of impunity, we welcome the significant developments that now appear to be taking place in the investigation into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia. However, these are not sufficient steps towards justice. We call for all hitmen, all middlemen, and all masterminds to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d its UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent, said. Yesterday there were clashes in Malta\u2019s parliament, with opposition MPs staging a walkout from the House of Representatives in protest at what they said was the prime minister\u2019s refusal to shoulder political responsibility. Before leaving the chamber, the Nationalist party leader, Adrian Delia, called on Muscat to resign and announced the Nationalists would no longer speak to a \u201cgovernment that has lots its legitimacy, since the prime minister does not recognise his political responsibility\u201d.",

The Peacocks chain, which is part of Day\u2019s Edinburgh Woollen Mill group, has been named by administrators at FRP advisory as preferred bidder for Bonmarch\u00e9, which continues to trade from 285 stores. The deal would hand back ownership to Day, whose Spectre investment vehicle took control of Bonmarch\u00e9 shortly before it fell into administration in October. FRP, which has been seeking a buyer for the fashion chain, said it had considered \u201cnumerous offers from a range of interested parties for all or parts of the business\u201d but believed the Peacocks bid was the best on the table. The administrators hope to complete a deal before Christmas that would reunite Bonmarch\u00e9 with its former sister chain Peacocks. The companies have operated separately since they jointly went into administration in 2012. Tony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, said: \u201cWe have now begun advanced negotiations with Peacocks on a going concern basis and aim to complete a transaction that will maximise returns for creditors, but also provide the best opportunity to keep the retailer open and protect the greatest number of jobs. He said Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s future was still dependent on negotiations between Peacocks and landlords on rents and there remained a risk that the business could cease to trade. More than one landlord told the Guardian that they had been approached about rent-free deals in recent months. Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s collapse came after it was taken private by Day\u2019s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s acting deputy secretary of homeland security was called \u201cthe son of immigrant grandparents who cages children for a fascist president\u201d on Wednesday night, by a man who forced him to leave a Capitol Hill bar on Thanksgiving eve. That man was Martin O\u2019Malley, former Baltimore mayor, governor of Maryland and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. It was the latest in a string of incidents in which angry opponents of Trump have confronted members of his administration in public. In June 2018, then White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was famously asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia. Senior adviser Stephen Miller, the force behind Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies, has been confronted numerous times. Such incidents have led to debate about the need for civility in US public life \u2013 particularly after Trump himself was booed at a World Series game in Washington in October. The first lady, Melania Trump, was booed in Baltimore on Tuesday, when she delivered remarks at a conference on the opioid epidemic. In messages sent to the Washington Post after the Wednesday night incident at the Dubliner bar, O\u2019Malley was unrepentant. A Twitter user who met O\u2019Malley at the pub first reported the incident, writing: \u201cMartin O\u2019Malley just drove Ken Cuccinelli out of the Dubliner in DC [with] a passion-laced and shame-invoking tirade on behalf of immigrant refugee children!!!\u201d Siobhan Houton Arnold later told the Post: \u201cO\u2019Malley was shouting. I don\u2019t think Cuccinelli was responding. I think he\u2019s like, \u2018Time to go. Just got here and I\u2019m leaving.\u2019 He pretty much retreated.\u201d O\u2019Malley told the Post he had not shouted, but had raised his voice to be heard in a busy bar as he gathered with fellow members of his class at Gonzaga, a Catholic high school in Washington from which Cuccinelli also graduated. He wanted to talk about Trump immigration policy which has led to family separations at the southern border and controversy over the conditions in which migrants of all ages are held. \u201cWe all let him know how we felt about him putting refugee immigrant kids in cages \u2013 certainly not what we were taught by the Jesuits at Gonzaga,\u201d O\u2019Malley told the Post, adding his line about Cuccinelli serving a \u201cfascist president\u201d. Cuccinelli did not immediately comment. He is a former attorney general of Virginia who narrowly lost to Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in the 2013 gubernatorial election, a race in which he was accused of comparing immigrants to rats. An immigration hardliner \u2013 in contrast to O\u2019Malley\u2019s record on the issue \u2013 he joined the Trump administration as acting director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Service in June and became acting deputy homeland security secretary this month. In June, Cuccinelli caused controversy when he responded to widely circulated images of a man from El Salvador who drowned with his young daughter while crossing the Rio Grande by saying the father was to blame because he \u201cdidn\u2019t wait to go through the asylum process in the legal fashion\u201d. In August, he said Emma Lazarus\u2019s poem at the Statue of Liberty in New York, which famously says \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\u201d, should be amended to reflect that America should welcome only the \u201cpoor who can stand on own two feet and who will not become a public charge\u201d. He also implied that the famous verse only applied to people from Europe. Cuccinelli also courted controversy in 2010, as attorney general of Virginia, when he distributed lapel pins to his staff which featured a Confederate version of the state\u2019s great seal. Writing for the Guardian in August as the Statue of Liberty furore played out, former Clinton aide and Lincoln biographer Sidney Blumenthal said: \u201cCuccinelli\u2019s imposition of a Confederate great seal and his chipping at the Statue of Liberty were of a piece. \u201c\u2026Emma Lazarus brought her vision to Liberty in its original spirit.

      "bodyText": "UK Athletics has announced a major review into whether mistakes were made in its handling of the Alberto Salazar scandal \u2013 and especially its decision to clear Mo Farah to continue training at the Nike Oregon Project after concerns were raised about the now-disgraced coach in 2015. The independent review, which will be led by the respected sports barrister John Mehrzad, comes after Salazar was banned for four years in October by Usada for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d. Salazar has since said he will appeal against the ban and no NOP athlete, including Farah, has ever been found to have taken a banned substance. The review will pay particular attention to a 2015 audit, led by UKA\u2019s performance oversight committee, which found there was \u201cno reason\u201d to be concerned about any British athlete or coaches involved with the Oregon Project in the wake of an explosive Panorama investigation into Salazar. At the time many in athletics expressed their concerns about the audit\u2019s lack of scope, given it was not asked to examine the doping claims against Salazar but rather Farah\u2019s training programme with the Nike Oregon Project and the endurance programme within the Oregon Project itself. There were also fears about whether the committee could be seen as a whitewashing exercise, given it was led by former athletes Jason Gardener, Dr Sarah Rowell and Anne Wafula Strike \u2013 all with close ties to UKA \u2013 rather than experienced sports lawyers or investigators. As the Guardian pointed out in 2015, while Usada\u2019s inquiry into Salazar was run by the top American lawyer Bill Bock and the former New York City police detective Victor Burgos, UKA had asked three athletes to jump in at the deep end. Steve Magness, whose allegations against Salazar were a key part of Panorama\u2019s documentary, said that he had a 30-40 minute interview which he described as \u201cjust a sham\u201d. The review, which has the potential to heap further embarrassment on crisis-hit UKA, which has lost its chief executive, performance director and chair \u2013 and failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships \u2013 in the space of 10 months, is expected to be completed in the spring of 2020. It was revealed this month that UKA\u2019s decision to stage last year\u2019s World Cup in London on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup had cost it close to \u00a32m. On Tuesday UK Sport also warned UKA that it risked a cut in its \u00a327m lottery funding. Announcing the review, the UK Athletics chair, Chris Clark, said: \u201cThe UKA Board recognises the seriousness of the Usada decision released at the start of October. It has unanimously agreed that an independent review should now be carried out with the aim that findings and recommendations are published in or around spring 2020. \u201cWe need to ensure we have a clear way forward that gives us confidence in the integrity of our coaching efforts. If there are lessons to be learnt, we plan to implement any recommendations into a future focused, transparent and accountable way of working.\u201d Meanwhile Dr Rowell, the chair of the performance oversight committee in 2015, said she welcomed the announcement. \u201cThere has been much written about what the Oregon Project review looked into, found or concluded in 2015, and I therefore welcome this review as an opportunity to establish the full facts and for those facts to be published for all to see.\u201d The review will also examine UKA\u2019s response to the Fancy Bears leaking of a draft Usada report into Salazar in 2017 and make recommendations about its future governance. It will also investigate whether UKA sought advice from UK Sport, UK Anti-Doping and Usada in 2015 and 2017 respectively \u2013 and, if so, did any of those bodies provide any formal response or guidance. In a statement UKA said Mehrzad had \u201csignificant experience of conducting independent reviews in sport\u201d having been the only legal member of the independent review panel that looked into the climate and culture of the world-class programme in British Cycling. Mehrzad also chaired an independent review concerning governance issues within the British Equestrian Federation.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. The pound has hit its highest level against the euro since May. Traders pushed sterling higher after a YouGov poll suggested Boris Johnson would win a solid majority in next month\u2019s election. Stocks have dipped, though, as investors worry about whether the US and China are really closing in on a trade deal. Relations could be hit by Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a bill supporting the pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong. UK house prices have risen at their fastest rate in seven months. But at just 0.8% year-on-year, housing inflation is still lower than a year ago. Property experts have cautioned that Brexit uncertainty is still weighing on the market. UK car production has suffered another decline, as the auto industry continues to struggle. German inflation has picked up, but remains low in historical terms. Consumer prices rose by 1.2% year-on-year this month, on a harmonised basis, new figures show. That\u2019s up from 0.9% in October. On a non-harmonised basis, inflation was even lower: UK bank TSB has just announced which 82 branches will close, as part of a cost-cutting plan. They\u2019re located across the country, with two branches going in Edinburgh, two in Birmingham, and a dozen in London - plus other towns and cities. Here\u2019s the list. European stock markets have lost ground today, as a new bout of trade war jitters hit stocks. It\u2019s not a major move -- the EU-wide Stoxx 600 has only lost 0.2%, after hitting a four-year high earlier this week. The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, having hit a two-month high last night. But still, there is anxiety about the US-China negotiations after Donald Trump signed a law that backs the Hong Kong democracy movement. Especially with Beijing threatening to ban the individuals who drafted the bill (see earlier). This has cast the planned Phase One trade deal into \u201ca new spasm of doubt\u201d, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. He writes: Markets continue to work on the expectation of a trade deal its close, so close - but this might be a case of labouring under a misapprehension. The message from China is there is no news on trade talks \u2013 just the tiny matter of Hong Kong\u2026 Donald Trump has signed a law backing the Hong Kong protestors. At such a delicate moment for trade talks this could tip the balance against agreement. To rob a phrase, Trump seems apt to bring discord where there was harmony. China has promised countermeasures. Despite its recent recovery, the pound is still around 10% below its value in June 2016, before the EU referendum. Ian Strafford-Taylor, CEO of international money specialist, Equals, says this has a significant impact at the foreign exchange desk: \u201cDespite the TV debates and mud slinging between parties, the pound is actually in a much stronger position against the euro than it was at the start of the year \u2013 currently 7% higher with a rate of 1.174. It\u2019s not quite at the height of the one-year peak we saw in May this year (1.175) but it\u2019s not far off and is standing at a six-month high.\u201d \u201cA lot can happen in the two weeks we still have until the election so we shouldn\u2019t expect to see the pound stay at these rates. The build-up to past elections have seen the pound go on a rollercoaster journey and a new Prime Minister typically brings about a significant change in the strength of the pound, so we should brace ourselves for more turbulence.\u201d \u201cAs it stands, the pound is still 10% lower against the euro since the day of the Brexit referendum in June 2016. This means Brits heading to Eurozone countries will now get \u20ac127 less for every \u00a31,000 exchanged than they would have just over three years ago. With December looming, many investors big and small will be wondering where to put their money in 2020. A lot depends on the general election, of course. But Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, reckons UK stocks might be underwhelming whatever happens on 12 December. \u201cDespite a relatively good year for equity returns in 2019, 2020 looks set to be a flat year for UK earnings. \u201cInvestors who\u2019ve pinned their hopes on the 12 December poll offering a clear direction of travel will likely be disappointed. In the event of a Conservative majority, Brexit may be \u2018completed\u2019, however gains will be capped as the next phase of negotiations ensues. Should the election result in a hung parliament, we expect a further extension to Article 50.\u201d City economists have been busy digesting YouGov\u2019s poll, which predicts a 68-seat majority for Boris Johnson. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada reports the chances of a Conservative majority government have now hit 70% on Betfair - its joint-highest level of the campaign. The probability of a Conservative government of any kind is also close to the high (78%), while the probability of a Labour majority remains negligible (3%), he adds. But, Cole also recommends caution - it would be a mistake to over-interpret YouGov\u2019s findings. On YouGov\u2019s model, the predicted Conservative majority disappears if the Conservative lead over Labour falls to around 7% points from the 11% they have in their results (similar to other polls). This is very similar to the threshold on a simple uniform national swing. So, with Labour\u2019s vote share trending higher, a hung parliament is still a possibility. For that reason, the pound may be under pressure before election day..... Cole explains: For the markets\u2019 confidence in the election outcome to be maintained, the red dotted line in the second chart needs to start diverging from the path it followed in 2017. Otherwise, GBP\u2019s latest gains look fragile. Hope of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war have just taken a small knock. China is considering banning the individuals who drafted America\u2019s new legislation supporting the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. That\u2019s according to the editor of China\u2019s Global Times, Hu Xijin, who is thought to have a good steer on Beijing\u2019s thinking. China is certainly unhappy that president Trump signed off the legislation, which threatens sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong. Officials have said the law is an interference in China\u2019s internal affairs, and \u201cfull of prejudice and arrogance\u201d. Trump claimed earlier this week that talks about a Phase One trade deal with China are in the \u201cfinal throes\u201d -- any sanctions on US citizens could destabilise the negotiations. House prices may be holding up in the face of economic uncertainty, but the same isn\u2019t true of car production. The number of new vehicles built in the UK fell by over 5,600 last month compared to October 2018, at 134,750. That\u2019s a 4% decline. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which calculates the data, says it is \u201cextremely worrying\u201d. Car production has now fallen for 16 in the last 17 months - August was a blip, because the usual summer shutdowns were moved to April. Here\u2019s our news story on the pick-up in UK house prices: 2019 has been a bruising year for the eurozone, but there are signs that 2020 could be a little better. Eurozone economic sentiment has strengthened this month, and by more than expected, according to the latest data from the European Commission. Optimism rose in services sector - up to 9.3 from 9.0 on the EC\u2019s scale. The mood is also less gloomy at factories. The EC\u2019s industrial sentiment gauge rose to -9.2 from -9.5 in October. The public are less pessimistic too - with consumer sentiment rising to -7.2 from -7.6. Fears of a eurozone recession do seem to have eased recently, with Germany returning to growth in the last quarter. Speaking of the election.... analysts at the Institute of Fiscal Studies have just warned that neither the Conservatives or Labour have a \u2018credible plan\u2019 for the public finances. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Paul Johnson, the director of the respected thinktank, noted that the Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto in 2017 pledged more austerity and spending cuts, but in reality public service spending has gone up, and is due to be around \u00a327bn higher next year than implied by the manifesto. In fact, he said, it is closer to the 2017 Labour pledge than the Tories\u2019 own manifesto. This time, the Conservatives are not promising any more spending cuts but are not predicting any spending increases beyond those set out in September either. Their plans would leave public service spending excluding health still 14% lower in 2023-24 than it was in 2010-11. \u201cNo more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in,\u201d Johnson said. The Conservatives have pencilled in few tax changes beyond a small cut in national insurance contributions. \u201cIf you think things are pretty much OK as they are, then you will like the Conservatives proposals for tax and spend. If you want big increases in taxation and spending then Labour and the Liberal Democrats have plenty to offer,\u201d Johnson said. Sterling is strengthening after a much-anticipated opinion poll showed that Boris Johnson is on track to win a comfortable majority next month. The MRP poll, carried out by YouGov, predicted that the Conservatives would win 359 seats, up 42, while Labour would fall to 211 seats and the Liberal Democrats would only gain one seat, giving 13 MPs. This would give Johnson a majority of 68 - likely enough to push his Brexit deal through the Commons. Although the City isn\u2019t keen on a hard Brexit, it also feared another hung parliament and the risk of a disorderly departure from the EU. So the pound has hit \u20ac1.176 for the first time since May. It\u2019s also trading at a one-week high against the US dollar, at $1.2950. Howard Archer of EY Item Club predicts that house prices will keep rising by around 1% in the near term. There are factors pushing prices up, he points out. Consumers have more purchasing power, thanks to wage growth, and interest rates are near record lows. There\u2019s also a shortage of houses on the market, thanks to Britain\u2019s failure to build enough new homes. But, the labour market has recently faltered, Archer adds, with wage growth slowing and employment dropping by 58,000 in the last quarter. As it\u2019s general election time, Nationwide have crunched their data to show how the housing market has fared whenever Britons went to the polls. As you can see, mortgage approvals jumped after David Cameron was surprisingly returned to Number 10 in 2015.... but slid after the ex-PM lost his Brexit referendum the following year. Nationwide\u2019s Robert Gardner explains: \u201cWhile activity slowed in the period immediately following the EU referendum, this was a continuation of a trend that was driven by the introduction of additional stamp duty on second homes earlier in that year. Tony Blair\u2019s election win in 1997 was also followed by a sharp fall in mortgage approvals, as the newly independent Bank of England raised interest rates several times (hitting 7.25% in 2018). Gardner adds: \u201cIt appears that housing market trends have not traditionally been impacted around the time of general elections. Rightly or wrongly, for most home buyers, elections are not foremost in their minds while buying or selling their home. Iain McKenzie, CEO, The Guild of Property Professionals, reckons the housing market will remain subdued until there\u2019s more clarity on Brexit. Once we know what to expect, the market can settle into a new normal and activity will start to improve as buyers and sellers get on with it. At the moment there is a lack of stock coming onto the market as sellers hold back and remain on the side-lines. I think this will change once we put Brexit behind us, and we can move forward as a country. For now, the positives are that money continues to be cheap to borrow and property prices are more realistic.\u201d Moving forwards as a country could take some time, though. Even if Britain does leave the EU at the end of January, a new cliff-edge would loom in December 2020 to get a free trade deal agreed. 2019 has been an \u201cannus horribilis\u201d* for the housing market, says Guy Harrington, CEO of property lender Glenhawk, adding: October\u2019s marginally higher growth may reflect the market\u2019s quietly increasing confidence that the general election result may not be the disaster it feared, but overall it\u2019s a case of \u2018bring on the new decade\u2019. Worryingly for UK vendors, with neither the Tory or Labour manifesto offering much cause for optimism, it may take more than a general election and Brexit resolution to rouse the market from its deep slumber.\u201d * -this Latin phrase was popularised in 1992 by the Queen, who might be tempted to use it again this year.... London\u2019s housing market has been in a real rut since the Brexit vote, with price falling for months. But is the worst over? Patrick Alvarado, director of central London estate agent Nicolas Van Patrick, reports the market is now \u201cpicking up\u201d. Alvarado says: Over the past three months, we have sold most of our properties, many of which had been sitting on our books for more than a year, so there is reason to be quietly optimistic. Agents tend to be bellwethers for future movements in the market and there is no doubt that we are seeing more buyers get on with it and step into the market, which bodes well for the future.\u2019 Despite this month\u2019s rise in prices, UK house price inflation is still sharply lower than before the EU referendum. Back in 2016, house prices were rising at around 5% per year, not the sub-1% growth seen in 2019. Basic pay growth hit 4% this year, meaning the price/earnings ratio has dipped. But it\u2019s still sharply over its long-term average (making it much harder for young adults to get onto the housing ladder, compared with earlier generations) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After months of being dampened down by economic and political uncertainty, Britain\u2019s housing market may be flickering back to life. House prices rose by 0.5% in November, according to the latest survey from Nationwide. That\u2019s the strongest monthly growth since July 2018, up from just 0.2% in October. On an annual basis (a better measure), prices are up 0.8% compared with November 2018, as buyers shrug off the uncertainty over who will be in Downing Street after 12 December. That\u2019s the strongest year-on-year increase since April, but still weaker than in 2018 when prices were rising by over 2%. It means the average property is now worth \u00a3215,734. House prices have now been rising by less than 1% for a whole year, below the rate of inflation and wage growth. That should make property slightly more affordable (or slightly less unaffordable?) for first-time buyers and those looking to trade up. Prices are currently below the record high of \u00a3217,663 set in July: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says the confusion over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU has weighed on the housing market. \u201cAnnual house price growth remained below 1% for the 12th month in a row in November, at 0.8%, though this was the strongest outturn since April. Indicators of UK economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. To date, the slowdown has largely centred on business investment, while household spending has been more resilient. More details to follow..... Also coming up today It could be a quiet day in the markets, with American traders away celebrating Thanksgiving. Investors may be more nervous about the USC-China trade talks, after Donald Trump signed two US bills supporting Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters. That\u2019s a rebuff to China, which had urged the president to block the legislation. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone business climate survey 1pm GMT: German inflation for November",

Rydon, among other firms originally involved in the works at the Chalcots estate in Camden, north London, faces court claims totalling \u00a3130m to cover the costs of stripping combustible cladding, employing fire marshals and fixing inadequate internal fire stopping measures and fire doors. More than 1,000 people had to be evacuated from the blocks immediately after the June 2017 disaster for fear of a repeat catastrophe. Central government has provided \u00a380m to cover the costs of works after more than 1,000 residents of the council estate had to be evacuated in the days after the Grenfell fire, which claimed 72 lives. But that is not enough to make the buildings safe, according to the London borough of Camden. If successful the action, being taken in the technology and construction court division in the high court in London, could pave the way for dozens of other councils and social landlords to sue builders and developers. Of the 160 high-rise council blocks wrapped in similar aluminium composite cladding to that which spread the fire at Grenfell, 34 have been fixed and works are under way on a further 82. Works are yet to start on the remaining 44. The government announced \u00a3400m to help fund the removal of dangerous cladding, but Camden\u2019s move suggests that may not be enough. The claim has been submitted against a private finance initiative consortium Partners for Improvement in Camden \u2013 currently in liquidation \u2013 as well as Rydon Construction, Rydon Maintenance, Faithful+Gould and United Living South. \u201cThe PFI agreement for refurbishment and maintenance of the Chalcots estate was entered into in good faith and fundamental to this was our expectation that the Chalcots towers would be safe for our residents,\u201d a council spokesman said. \u201cWe should not have been put in a position where we were left with no option but to evacuate residents from their homes on a Friday night.\u201d They continued: \u201cThe costs of the supporting residents during the evacuation and level of work required at the Chalcots made a major impact on our reserves. Clearly, it would not be right for residents and, by extension, the public purse, to foot the bill for what has been a private contractor failure.\u201d Rydon, Faithful+Gould and United Living South have been contacted for comment.",

And why wouldn\u2019t they? Past nominees have included Stephen King, Salman Rushdie and Philip Roth, while winners range from Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer to Morrissey and Melvyn Bragg.</p> <p>I was nominated for the Bad sex award last year, for a scene in my novel Connect that was about three-and-a-half pages long. The extract that most media ran was about 20% of that. The part most people shared was even smaller: \u201cHe sucks on the hard nipple. He has never done this before, and yet; no, wait, of course, it is totally familiar.

Jezebel went with the headline: \u201cBan Men \u2026 From Writing About Sex.\u201d And so on, and on, from time zone to time zone, around the world. From the Daily Mail to Entertainment Weekly, Mexico\u2019s El Universal to Slovenia\u2019s Mladina, the world\u2019s press gleefully dumped on us. On social media, meanwhile, people shared a veritable waterfall of vomiting gifs, and tweets along the lines of: \u201cI\u2019m never having sex with a straight man again, these are AWFUL. Also I feel like Julian Gough and Haruki Murakami should be on some sort of register?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Pornhub age, there is no demand for sex in novels. My editors often urge me to leave it out entirely</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, basically, the Bad sex award is the anti-Booker: you lose rather than gain sales; there isn\u2019t even a real prize; and you now have a colossal new global audience, who had never previously heard of you and now think you are a terrible writer and a worse human being.</p> <p>The traditional advice given to writers who have been misrepresented by the media is: never complain, never explain. That made some sense when a bad review existed for a single day in a geographically isolated newspaper, and, within 24 hours, was being shat on by a cheerful budgie. But I don\u2019t think that works any more, in a world where hundreds of news outlets can, in a single night, overwhelm every thoughtful piece by anyone who has actually read one of your books over the previous two decades.</p> <p>It is possible that the Bad sex award had a point when it was established back in 1993. After the collapse of Britain\u2019s obscenity laws, and before the internet, authors were occasionally encouraged to add some gratuitous sex in order to sell books, giving us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/bonkbuster-books-history-sex-suburbs\">the bonkbuster</a>. But that era is long gone. In the Pornhub age, when every toddler poking at Dad\u2019s smartphone is just three seconds away from accidentally watching a donkey mount the pope, there is no demand for sex in novels. My editors often urge me to leave it out entirely. And there are valid reasons for their caution. When we read good immersive fiction, anything that happens to the point-of-view character feels like it\u2019s happening to us. Usually, that\u2019s fine: a reader who dislikes olives will not throw a book across the room because the main character puts an olive in his mouth. But replace that olive with a nipple, clitoris or penis, and the writer risks triggering the reader\u2019s sexual-disgust reflex; a hardwired neurological response that can very easily send a book flying.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The places we can talk honestly about sex and sexuality \u2013 are shrinking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So why do we write sex when we know it is risky? Because leaving sex out of fiction falsifies our picture of humanity. If fiction can\u2019t address life\u2019s most difficult, complex and interesting areas, then why write or read it?</p> <p>This is why I find the Bad sex award, at this point in its history, in bad faith. Its basic premise \u2013 that authors are adding unnecessary and lazy sex to increase sales \u2013 is not just wrong, it\u2019s the reverse of the truth. The award very deliberately avoids shortlisting actual pornography or erotica and instead targets authors who are trying to be honest about desire and sex, however distasteful the results may be. It deliberately and successfully encourages the worst, and dumbest, misreading of fiction; the conflating of authors with their characters in order to publicly shame them. This is regressive cyber-Victorianism in progressive drag.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying all the books picked are great literature. I\u2019m saying that, with no context and reframed like this, judgment of them is impossible. Even I wouldn\u2019t like to stumble on that part of my novel out of context. But then no one would, or should, because sex scenes in books aren\u2019t just \u201csex scenes\u201d, any more than a meal in a Jane Austen novel is an \u201ceating scene\u201d. By the time we get to that part of Connect, we\u2019ve had 500 pages to get to know Colt, a socially awkward teenage boy who doesn\u2019t like to touch or be touched, and Sasha, the young woman he is sharing his first sexual experience with. That a reader wouldn\u2019t think his thoughts in that moment is completely irrelevant to the truth of the scene. I wouldn\u2019t, either. But <em>he</em> would.</p> <p>In many ways, of course, the Bad sex award is a flashy but unimportant cultural sideshow. It may damage the sales of a few peculiar books, but it doesn\u2019t end careers. Some may say that straight white males with publishing deals are the most privileged of the privileged, and deserve their shaming. But you can turn that on its head: if even straight white males, often with major publishers behind them, are going to be humiliated for writing about sex, then is anyone going to be able to at all?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7941c4b27f7a0c69310746c60d32413464f20abc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7941c4b27f7a0c69310746c60d32413464f20abc/81_0_1348_809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Gough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Gough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because right now, the internet\u2019s sexual commons \u2013 the places we can talk honestly about sex and sexuality \u2013 are shrinking.

Facebook has banned talking about sex, with the intent to ban soliciting and pornography; the effect is to ban individuality. All this year, coordinated campaigns \u2013 both religious and secular \u2013 have been using social media\u2019s new reporting tools to force the removal of accounts run by women who work in adult entertainment, or those who fight for the rights of such women. Under such pressure, Instagram recently deleted the accounts of more than 1,300 adult performers, despite their images showing no nudity or sex. Offline, in China, a woman writing under the pseudonym <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/world/asia/tianyi-china-erotic-novels-prison.html\">Lady Tianyi</a> is one year into a 10-year sentence, for writing about the wrong kind of sex \u2013 gay \u2013 in her self-published books.</p> <p>But the problem has spread far beyond sex.

A woman mocked for the stupidity of a single comment turns out to be dirt poor, uneducated, lost, alone; her friends dying, month by month, of opioid overdoses.

      "bodyText": "New cases of polio linked to the oral vaccine have been reported in four African countries and more children are now being paralysed by vaccine-derived viruses than those infected by viruses in the wild, according to global health numbers. The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners identified nine new cases caused by the vaccine in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola last week. Along with seven other African countries with outbreaks, cases have also been reported in Asia. In Afghanistan and Pakistan polio remains endemic, and in Pakistan officials have been accused of covering up vaccine-related cases. Polio, a highly infectious disease that spreads through contaminated water or food, usually affects children under five, with around one in 200 infections resulting in paralysis. Of those paralysed 5\u201310% die due to crippled breathing muscles. The WHO reports that as long as a single child remains infected, all children are at risk of contracting the disease. More than 95% of the population needs to be immunised for polio to fully be eradicated. In developing countries the oral vaccine is used due to its low cost and accessibility, needing only two drops per dose. In western countries, a more expensive, injectable version of the vaccine \u2013 which contains an inactivated virus incapable of causing the disease \u2013 is used as a preventative. The onset has been caused by a type 2 virus contained in the vaccine. Type 2 is a wild virus that was eliminated years ago, but in rare cases the live virus in oral polio vaccines can mutate into a form capable of igniting new outbreaks of the disease. Just last week donors pledged $2.6 bn (\u00a32bn) to combat polio as part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), which formed in 1988 with the goal of eradicating the disease by 2000. According to the WHO, wild poliovirus cases have fallen by more than 99% since 1988, from 350,000 in more than 125 endemic countries to 33 reported cases in 2018.

The rise in vaccine-derived polio cases is caused by a mutated form of the disease found in faecal matter that targets children who have not been vaccinated, he said. \u201cWhat we must do is extend the coverage of immunisation so that polio can no longer continue to survive,\u201d said Mkanda. Dr Edward Parker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said efforts to develop more stable polio vaccines by scientists were progressing. \u201cIf they prove to be safe and effective in regions still affected by polio, these vaccines could be a key breakthrough in finally consigning this disease to the history books.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><br>Who gets to decide what kind of sport hockey is? All it took was two high-profile dismissals in two weeks (with a third possible), and we now have an open question.</p> <p>The most recent high-profile departure was Mike Babcock, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/the-maple-leafs-fired-mike-babcock-here-s-why-1.5367284\">ousted</a> as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs less than a week ago. His young squad, brimming with talent, had hit a losing streak in which they looked even more disorganized and dejected than they had over the first few weeks of the season. In as Babcock\u2019s replacement came Sheldon Keefe, the 39-year old favourite of Leafs\u2019 35-year old general manager, Kyle Dubas. Two wins immediately followed. \u201cNight and day,\u201d defenceman Tyson Barrie <a href=\"https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/reinvigorated-leafs-eager-to-keep-pushing-forward-with-keefe-at-helm\">told</a> the Toronto Sun on Monday.</p> <p>A few lines down in the same Sun story, a detail of the darkness came to light: during the 2016-17 season, Babcock asked then-rookie Mitch Marner to rank the Leafs players based on work ethic. Marner obliged, and was surprised when Babcock read the list to the rest of the team. Some mild psychological games, maybe. An abuse of power for sure. After the story came out, Babcock <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/maple-leafs-mitch-marner-encourages-nhlers-speak-truth/\">told Sportsnet</a> that he had later apologized, but the anecdote sparked something nevertheless.</p> <p>\u201cNot very surprising the things we\u2019re hearing about Babcock,\u201d former player Akim Aliu tweeted on Monday evening. \u201cApple doesn\u2019t fall far from the Tree, same sort of deal with his protege in YYC. Dropped the N bomb several times towards me in the dressing room in my rookie year because he didn\u2019t like my choice of music.\u201d Aliu was talking about current Calgary Flames coach Bill Peters. He talked some more to TSN on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/13/its-good-don-cherry-is-gone-itll-be-better-if-his-successor-represents-todays-canada\">It's good Don Cherry is gone. It'll be better if his successor represents today's Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe walked in before a morning pre-game skate and said \u2018Hey Akim, I\u2019m sick of you playing that nigger shit,\u2019\u201d Aliu <a href=\"https://www.tsn.ca/akim-aliu-speaks-publicly-on-allegations-against-calgary-flames-head-coach-bill-peters-1.1403974\">told TSN</a> about the incident that allegedly occurred when Peters was coaching the AHL\u2019s Rockford Ice Dogs. The story had an immediate impact. \u201cThe behavior that has been alleged is repugnant and unacceptable,\u201d the NHL said in a statement. But there was more. Michal Jord\u00e1n, former defenceman for the Carolina Hurricanes, (Peters\u2019 former NHL team), alleged via Twitter that Peters kicked him and punched another unnamed player in the head on the bench during a game. On Wednesday, current Hurricanes coach, Rod Brind\u2019Amour confirmed the account. \u201cIt for sure happened, the two issues that are in question,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the players brought it to management\u2019s attention and it was \u201cdefinitely dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t escaped many that the Babcock and Peters revelations come less than two weeks after Don Cherry, the loudmouth octogenarian mainstay at the CBC\u2019s Hockey Night in Canada, opted to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/don-cherry-podcast-launch-1.5364771\">step down</a> from his job rather than apologize for a racist on-air comment. As the years of his Coach\u2019s Corner segment wore on, Cherry\u2019s macho blustering, his rambling monologues, his lionizing of \u201crock \u2018em sock \u2018em\u201d hockey became ever more off-kilter with modern reality \u2013 a fact obvious to seemingly everyone but Canada\u2019s hockey broadcasters.

And if you don\u2019t think it is, just take a look at what\u2019s happening at the National Hockey League level and the OHL level with minors,\u201d former NHL forward Dan Carcillo, a longtime vocal critical of how players are treated, said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarBombBoom13/status/1199394627763212294?s=20\">a video</a> posted to Twitter Tuesday. \u201cThese leagues need to change. These people need to be held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>For the hockey world, it\u2019s Carcillo\u2019s reminder about minors that should prompt a serious pause. In his rookie season, Mitch Marner was 19 when he made his debut for the Leafs. He was not a child, but the uncomfortable question is that, even if he were, would the story have been any different? No. Aliu\u2019s comments about Peters were so shocking, almost everyone missed another detail he revealed: that, whilst with the OHL\u2019s Windsor Spitfires, he refused to participate in a hazing ritual \u201cthat would have forced him and other rookies to stand naked in a bus washroom.\u201d</p> <p>By Wednesday evening, Peters still hadn\u2019t been officially fired, but it seems likely he will be, even though <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/28179891/flames-coach-bill-peters-apologizes-hurtful-comments-letter-gm\">he released a letter of apology for his actions</a>. But will his exit change anything for anyone beyond the Flames organization? \u201cClearly, the old school way of coaches manipulating players by way of power games and intimidation is on the wane,\u201d Sportsnet\u2019s Eric Francis <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/flames-continue-bill-peters-investigation-firing-seems-outcome/\">wrote</a> Wednesday, before adding that the network had received \u201cseveral stories from players who did not appreciate Peters and his ways.\u201d But, he cautioned: \u201cnow is not the time to pile on.\u201d Will everyone else agree?</p> <p>Professional sports leagues like to position themselves at arm\u2019s length from reality: no matter what happens in the world, you can count on hockey, or football, or basketball to stay the same. That separation is handy \u2013 not just for creating stories of athletic gods, ageless dynasties, and fulfilled destinies. It\u2019s also good for business. Everyone, they tell us, is welcome to play and to dream in the world of sports.</p> <p>But this is a lie. There is no separation at all. The world of sports is our world. Every once in a while, and more frequently of late, we\u2019re reminded that the cultural framework that governs the world outside the rink, or off the court, or beyond the field is the exact same one that is at work within them. The same power structures exist. The same kind of men make the rules. Until they don\u2019t.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who gets to decide what kind of sport hockey is? All it took was two high-profile dismissals in two weeks (with a third possible), and we now have an open question. The most recent high-profile departure was Mike Babcock, ousted as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs less than a week ago. His young squad, brimming with talent, had hit a losing streak in which they looked even more disorganized and dejected than they had over the first few weeks of the season. In as Babcock\u2019s replacement came Sheldon Keefe, the 39-year old favourite of Leafs\u2019 35-year old general manager, Kyle Dubas. Two wins immediately followed. \u201cNight and day,\u201d defenceman Tyson Barrie told the Toronto Sun on Monday. A few lines down in the same Sun story, a detail of the darkness came to light: during the 2016-17 season, Babcock asked then-rookie Mitch Marner to rank the Leafs players based on work ethic. Marner obliged, and was surprised when Babcock read the list to the rest of the team. Some mild psychological games, maybe. An abuse of power for sure. After the story came out, Babcock told Sportsnet that he had later apologized, but the anecdote sparked something nevertheless. \u201cNot very surprising the things we\u2019re hearing about Babcock,\u201d former player Akim Aliu tweeted on Monday evening. \u201cApple doesn\u2019t fall far from the Tree, same sort of deal with his protege in YYC. Dropped the N bomb several times towards me in the dressing room in my rookie year because he didn\u2019t like my choice of music.\u201d Aliu was talking about current Calgary Flames coach Bill Peters. He talked some more to TSN on Tuesday. \u201cHe walked in before a morning pre-game skate and said \u2018Hey Akim, I\u2019m sick of you playing that nigger shit,\u2019\u201d Aliu told TSN about the incident that allegedly occurred when Peters was coaching the AHL\u2019s Rockford Ice Dogs. The story had an immediate impact. \u201cThe behavior that has been alleged is repugnant and unacceptable,\u201d the NHL said in a statement. But there was more. Michal Jord\u00e1n, former defenceman for the Carolina Hurricanes, (Peters\u2019 former NHL team), alleged via Twitter that Peters kicked him and punched another unnamed player in the head on the bench during a game. On Wednesday, current Hurricanes coach, Rod Brind\u2019Amour confirmed the account. \u201cIt for sure happened, the two issues that are in question,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the players brought it to management\u2019s attention and it was \u201cdefinitely dealt with.\u201d It hasn\u2019t escaped many that the Babcock and Peters revelations come less than two weeks after Don Cherry, the loudmouth octogenarian mainstay at the CBC\u2019s Hockey Night in Canada, opted to step down from his job rather than apologize for a racist on-air comment. As the years of his Coach\u2019s Corner segment wore on, Cherry\u2019s macho blustering, his rambling monologues, his lionizing of \u201crock \u2018em sock \u2018em\u201d hockey became ever more off-kilter with modern reality \u2013 a fact obvious to seemingly everyone but Canada\u2019s hockey broadcasters. Cherry hung on and so did his bosses. Until, one day, they just didn\u2019t. \u201cAbuse is ripe throughout every single level of hockey. And if you don\u2019t think it is, just take a look at what\u2019s happening at the National Hockey League level and the OHL level with minors,\u201d former NHL forward Dan Carcillo, a longtime vocal critical of how players are treated, said in a video posted to Twitter Tuesday. \u201cThese leagues need to change. These people need to be held accountable.\u201d For the hockey world, it\u2019s Carcillo\u2019s reminder about minors that should prompt a serious pause. In his rookie season, Mitch Marner was 19 when he made his debut for the Leafs. He was not a child, but the uncomfortable question is that, even if he were, would the story have been any different? No. Aliu\u2019s comments about Peters were so shocking, almost everyone missed another detail he revealed: that, whilst with the OHL\u2019s Windsor Spitfires, he refused to participate in a hazing ritual \u201cthat would have forced him and other rookies to stand naked in a bus washroom.\u201d By Wednesday evening, Peters still hadn\u2019t been officially fired, but it seems likely he will be, even though he released a letter of apology for his actions. But will his exit change anything for anyone beyond the Flames organization? \u201cClearly, the old school way of coaches manipulating players by way of power games and intimidation is on the wane,\u201d Sportsnet\u2019s Eric Francis wrote Wednesday, before adding that the network had received \u201cseveral stories from players who did not appreciate Peters and his ways.\u201d But, he cautioned: \u201cnow is not the time to pile on.\u201d Will everyone else agree? Professional sports leagues like to position themselves at arm\u2019s length from reality: no matter what happens in the world, you can count on hockey, or football, or basketball to stay the same. That separation is handy \u2013 not just for creating stories of athletic gods, ageless dynasties, and fulfilled destinies. It\u2019s also good for business. Everyone, they tell us, is welcome to play and to dream in the world of sports. But this is a lie. There is no separation at all. The world of sports is our world. Every once in a while, and more frequently of late, we\u2019re reminded that the cultural framework that governs the world outside the rink, or off the court, or beyond the field is the exact same one that is at work within them. The same power structures exist. The same kind of men make the rules. Until they don\u2019t.",

      "bodyText": "TSB has unveiled the locations of 82 branches across the UK that will close next year, with the loss of around 370 jobs. The bank is also shutting four branches this year and will be left with a high street network of 454 branches. The move is designed to cut \u00a3100m in costs by 2022 under TSB\u2019s new chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, who is seeking to draw a line under last year\u2019s IT meltdown. TSB said it would seek to keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum, and that it had consulted with the Unite and Accord unions. The bank will continue to have a national branch network across Britain, with 65% of the population living within four miles of a TSB branch. Robin Bulloch, customer banking director at TSB, said: \u201cWe have made the difficult decision to close 82 branches, today announcing the locations. We will fully support customers through this transition. \u201cWe realise this is difficult news for our branch partners and will do everything to support those affected to offer voluntary redundancies and redeploy as many people as we can to other roles.\u201d The bank argues that when it was spun out from Lloyds Banking Group in 2013, it ended up holding twice as many branches per 10,000 customers as competitors. In the last two years, TSB has seen branch transactions drop by 17% as customers increasingly choose to bank online or by phone. Here is a list of the planned branch closures in 2020.

Take the first season of Big Brother: launched at the optimistic dawn of the new millennium, it featured benevolent tasks for its housemates that included learning how to throw a clay pot or mastering semaphore. Millions of us tuned in to see how these supposedly ordinary folk went about their days, from brushing their teeth to getting drunk, and it was addictive.</p> <p>As the century has progressed, the world seems to have lost some of its reality and gained that of television\u2019s. Take Donald Trump, transitioning from head of a fictional boardroom in The Apprentice to head of one of the most powerful nations on Earth. Or the sun-soaked \u201cglamour\u201d of the Love Island aesthetic seeping into everyday life \u2013 or at least everyday Instagram. It\u2019s as if we no longer need reality TV to give us new insights into the ways we live now \u2013 we can just scroll through our Insta feed for that, or get our shocking viewing from the news.

Take the first season of Big Brother: launched at the optimistic dawn of the new millennium, it featured benevolent tasks for its housemates that included learning how to throw a clay pot or mastering semaphore. Millions of us tuned in to see how these supposedly ordinary folk went about their days, from brushing their teeth to getting drunk, and it was addictive. As the century has progressed, the world seems to have lost some of its reality and gained that of television\u2019s. Take Donald Trump, transitioning from head of a fictional boardroom in The Apprentice to head of one of the most powerful nations on Earth. Or the sun-soaked \u201cglamour\u201d of the Love Island aesthetic seeping into everyday life \u2013 or at least everyday Instagram. It\u2019s as if we no longer need reality TV to give us new insights into the ways we live now \u2013 we can just scroll through our Insta feed for that, or get our shocking viewing from the news. But there is one show that, somehow, still surpasses real life to give us the reality fix we crave: I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here.

Once inflation is taken into account, the Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that day-to-day departmental spending fell by \u00a332bn between 2010-11 and 2017-18, from \u00a3334bn to \u00a3302bn.

But as a leading figure in the Conservative party he made several interventions on national issues, including austerity. Writing in the Telegraph in 2010, he said the government should \u201cbear down on wasteful public spending\u201d to manage the deficit. While urging caution to avoid a double-dip recession, he added: \u201csome pain is inevitable\u201d. However, he publicly clashed with Cameron on spending cuts \u2013 viewed in context as Johnson seeking a second mayoral term and to position himself as a rival to Cameron. He warned against cuts to transport infrastructure in London and attacked policing cuts during the 2011 London riots. He warned benefit cuts could cause \u201cKosovo-style social cleansing of London\u201d, though Johnson\u2019s office distanced him from this comment after it drew criticism. \u201cMy consistent position has been that the government is absolutely right to reform the housing benefit system which has become completely unsustainable,\u201d it said. Since returning as an MP in 2015, Johnson has consistently voted in support of austerity policies, according to the They Work for You website. He almost always voted for a reduction in spending on welfare benefits, including a vote in 2016 in favour of reductions to the work allowance element of universal credit and reductions to employment and support allowance. He consistently voted for reducing central government funding for local authorities, including most recently to vote to set the main central government grant for 2018-19 at a level 56% lower than it was set for 2017-18. Looking ahead to Johnson\u2019s position on austerity now he is prime minister, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the 2019 Conservative manifesto would leave public service spending outside of health still 14% lower in 2023-24 than it was in 2010-11, adding: \u201cNo more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in.\u201d Verdict Johnson did speak out against austerity while London mayor at the inception of austerity, though this could be viewed as him vying for more personal power.

That\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ve seen such a big drop in EU migration since 2016, despite the fact that policy has not yet changed at all.\u201d</p> <p>Overall net migration, combining both figures for EU and non-EU, was about 212,000 in the period, the data shows.</p> <p>The figures are classed as experimental estimates after the ONS admitted earlier this year it had been underestimating some EU net<strong> </strong>migration data since 2016.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Net migration from the EU into the UK is at its lowest level since before the bloc was enlarged to take in countries including Poland and Lithuania, figures suggest. The difference between EU nationals arriving and leaving in the year ending June 2019 was 48,000, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show, the lowest level since 2003, when it was 15,000 and before the so-called EU8 countries joining the union: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. EU net migration climbed to a peak of 219,000 in the year to March 2015 and has been falling ever since against the backdrop of the referendum and the Brexit negotiations. The fall is driven by a decline in EU immigration, down from a 305,000 peak in March 2015 to 199,000 in the year to June, while EU emigration is up to 151,000 from a trough of 75,000 in the year to March 2013. The lower value of the pound making the UK less attractive, improving economic prospects in EU countries of origin, and the political uncertainty of the prolonged Brexit process are all factors that have influenced the decline in net EU migration. However, an estimated 229,000 more non-EU citizens moved to the UK than left in the year ending June 2019 \u2013 this has gradually increased since 2013 largely because of a rise in non-EU immigration, while emigration has remained broadly stable. The distinction is important because the government\u2019s immigration policy is focused on ending freedom of movement with the EU with a broader argument that the country has no control of this side of migration. But the element over which it does have control \u2013 immigration outside the EU \u2013 continues to rise. EU net migration has declined without restricting freedom of movement. Experts have said the relatively low levels of EU net migration mean that restricting free movement at this point in time would be expected to have a much smaller impact on overall migration levels than it would have done in the past. However, this will not always be the case as EU migration has fluctuated up and down over time. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cWhat will happen to migration in the coming years is highly uncertain, regardless of which party is power. It\u2019s easy to imagine that migration policies are the only things that affect migration, but in reality, policies act more like a filter than a tap. \u201cThe state of the economy, demand for workers by UK employers, conditions in countries of origin can have a big impact on migration, in some cases even more than changes in policy. That\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ve seen such a big drop in EU migration since 2016, despite the fact that policy has not yet changed at all.\u201d Overall net migration, combining both figures for EU and non-EU, was about 212,000 in the period, the data shows. The figures are classed as experimental estimates after the ONS admitted earlier this year it had been underestimating some EU net migration data since 2016.",

Then again, it feels, well, very Who. No member of the rock aristocracy has ever seemed as troubled by the very notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/05/the-whos-pete-townshend-announces-debut-novel-the-age-of-anxiety\">being a rock star</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/02/pete-townshend-the-who-interview-symphonised-quadrophenia\">Pete Townshend</a>. The Who weren\u2019t even supposed to be a band, he said in 2006. As far as Townshend was concerned, they were a kind of art school project, complete with a thesis he\u2019d written under the influence of Gustav Metzger\u2019s concept of auto-destructive art, announcing that, as soon as they got famous, they were going to split up. Or worse: at one point, he suggested the band douse themselves in petrol and set fire to themselves on stage.</p> <p>In truth, Townshend ruined his own plan by being such an innovative songwriter and performer that giving up no longer seemed like an option. Instead, he settled for metaphorically thrashing about, seemingly in the throes of a perpetual existential crisis, writing songs that were, as writer Jon Savage put it, \u201cat war\u201d: with the older generation, with the class system, with accepted notions of gender, with the commodification of pop and, frequently, with the Who and their audience. Townshend was big on sending out peevish signals that music was not what it could be. Amid the innovations of 1966, he protested that pop\u2019s innocence had been tragically lost. In 1972, he worked on an unreleased projected called Rock Is Dead. By the time punk arrived, he was declaring himself old and irrelevant: \u201cAm I doing it all again? \u2026 We\u2019re chewing a bone.\u201d He was 32.</p> <p>Forty years on, with half of the Who deceased and the relationship of its two surviving members in a precarious state \u2013 Who was recorded without Townshend or Daltrey actually meeting \u2013 Townshend seems more troubled than ever. Who certainly does some of the things that artists of their vintage are supposed to do, including make knowing references to their most beloved work.

      "bodyText": "The first words you hear on the Who\u2019s 12th studio album are Roger Daltrey, telling the band\u2019s audience to get stuffed. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d the band\u2019s 75-year-old frontman sings, \u201cI know you\u2019re going to hate this song.\u201d There follows four and half minutes of agonising over whether there\u2019s any point in making a new Who album at all \u2013 \u201cthis sound that we share has already been played\u201d \u2013 before songwriter Townshend signs off on All This Music Must Fade with a muttered \u201cwho gives a fuck?\u201d This is obviously not the way heritage rock artists essaying their first album in 13 years are meant to carry on. Then again, it feels, well, very Who. No member of the rock aristocracy has ever seemed as troubled by the very notion of being a rock star as Pete Townshend. The Who weren\u2019t even supposed to be a band, he said in 2006. As far as Townshend was concerned, they were a kind of art school project, complete with a thesis he\u2019d written under the influence of Gustav Metzger\u2019s concept of auto-destructive art, announcing that, as soon as they got famous, they were going to split up. Or worse: at one point, he suggested the band douse themselves in petrol and set fire to themselves on stage. In truth, Townshend ruined his own plan by being such an innovative songwriter and performer that giving up no longer seemed like an option. Instead, he settled for metaphorically thrashing about, seemingly in the throes of a perpetual existential crisis, writing songs that were, as writer Jon Savage put it, \u201cat war\u201d: with the older generation, with the class system, with accepted notions of gender, with the commodification of pop and, frequently, with the Who and their audience. Townshend was big on sending out peevish signals that music was not what it could be. Amid the innovations of 1966, he protested that pop\u2019s innocence had been tragically lost. In 1972, he worked on an unreleased projected called Rock Is Dead. By the time punk arrived, he was declaring himself old and irrelevant: \u201cAm I doing it all again? \u2026 We\u2019re chewing a bone.\u201d He was 32. Forty years on, with half of the Who deceased and the relationship of its two surviving members in a precarious state \u2013 Who was recorded without Townshend or Daltrey actually meeting \u2013 Townshend seems more troubled than ever. Who certainly does some of the things that artists of their vintage are supposed to do, including make knowing references to their most beloved work. The fantastic Detour has a definite air of Magic Bus, as well as a titular nod to the name that the nascent Who plied their trade under in the early 60s. A Baba O\u2019Riley-ish synth flutters around Street Song; an echo of Substitute\u2019s intro haunts the acoustic guitar of I Don\u2019t Wanna Get Wise. But the most Who-esque thing about it might be the way its songs repeatedly pick at questions of the Who\u2019s own relevance. I Don\u2019t Wanna Get Wise views a rock career as one of inevitable decline \u2013 from \u201csnotty young kids\u201d to \u201cover-full, always sated, puffed-up and elated\u201d \u2013 while Hero Ground Zero and Rockin\u2019 in Rage both pitch fears of superannuation against the continued desire to create: \u201cI\u2019m too old to fight \u2026 I don\u2019t have a right to join the parade,\u201d suggests the latter, before adding: \u201cyou know you must write, you know you must rage.\u201d If not everything here works \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with the political sentiment of Ball and Chain, it just feels a little lumbering and clumsy \u2013 there\u2019s something exciting about hearing Townshend vacillating between declaring himself spent and readying himself for another charge.

In one section headed \u201cThe Liberal Democrats don\u2019t share people\u2019s values,\u201d the briefing note claims: \u201cThe Lib Dems have put forward \u2018pro-pimp\u2019 policies on prostitution \u2013 and have suggested prostitution should be suggested as a career to schoolchildren.\u201d To reach this claim, the dossier took comments made three years ago by a former chairman of the Lib Dems\u2019 Cheltenham branch and suggested they were indicative of party policy. In fact, Dennis Parsons was forced to resign in 2016 after making the remarks, which he said were a rhetorical question and not his views. Parsons also apologised unreservedly. The Lib Dem manifesto does not mention prostitution, although the party has a longstanding conference motion promoting decriminalisation to safeguard sex workers. Tory candidates targeting Lib Dems have also been given lists of examples to support claims the party is soft on crime, and wants to \u201chike taxes on working people\u201d. Turning a press report from when Nick Clegg was leader in 2013 into a doorstep attack line for use in the December election, the party instructs activists to tell voters that the Lib Dems would \u201creplace our nuclear deterrent with unarmed missiles\u201d. Clegg had boasted about blocking the Tories on Trident while deputy prime minister in the coalition government, but the party reinstated a policy of supporting the use of a nuclear deterrent two years ago under Tim Farron. Swinson said in a flagship election interview that she was prepared to use nuclear warheads, while her party\u2019s manifesto pledges to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent while international deals on disarmament are sought. On leaving the EU, under the heading \u201cThe Liberal Democrats cannot understand why anyone in the country voted for Brexit,\u201d the authors back up the claim with comments made by the party\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Wera Hobhouse. \u201cWera Hobhouse called the \u2018angry\u2019 public \u2018spoiled and selfish\u2019, claiming they just don\u2019t want to \u2018share in the wealth of the country\u2019,\u201d the briefing note claims. Hobhouse made those comments on her blog in 2014 \u2013 two years before the referendum was held. The Guardian contacted the Conservative party for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed how Conservative candidates had been told not to sign up to specific pledges on protecting the NHS from privatisation and trade deals or tackling climate change. The 11-page briefing note explained the party\u2019s position on nine key areas and \u201cstrongly advises\u201d prospective Tory MPs \u201cagainst signing up to any pledges\u201d unless they have been agreed from the centre. However, it said supporting shooting was allowed \u201cas an important part of rural life\u201d.",

Earlier this year we saw a Canadian folk duo <a href=\"http://www.pharisandjason.com/\" title=\"\">Pharis and Romero</a> who blew our socks off with their beautiful harmonies and banjo playing. We have also seen Wreckless Eric there and a singer-songwriter called Sarah Jarosz from Texas whose Americana and contemporary folk also blew us away. The added bonus is that Greystones is the flagship pub for a local brewery, <a href=\"https://thornbridgebrewery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thornbridge</a>, and so there is a wide range of delicious craft beers and ales to sup while enjoying the tunes.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.mygreystones.co.uk/\" title=\"\">mygreystones.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Penny</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Hare and Hounds, </strong><strong>Birmingham</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"402dea88deae1ffb95f1423ff02961c7fb6ca6b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/402dea88deae1ffb95f1423ff02961c7fb6ca6b3/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hare and Hounds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>We were off to see the Bootleg Beatles.

Downstairs a traditional, Victorian bar and a modern, minimalist bar serve craft beers and good choice of Purity IPAs. The atmosphere was friendly with an eclectic mix of punters, some there for the gig, others just to drink and chat. The music was in an upstairs room with another bar. The atmosphere was buzzing and the band superb.

This venue has live bands throughout the year (outdoors in summer, on the barge now), with families, couples and hipsters young and old enjoying the music. The free gigs include covers bands and local bands such as Austin Gold blasting out their own infectious rhythms and tunes. The food is pretty decent too, with classic Thai and Indonesian dishes. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.charters-bar.com/\" title=\"\">charters-bar.com</a></em><br><strong>Annie Carter</strong></p> \n<h2>The Junction, south London</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab36659965dfc4e0d786f6c2220e11adad18bd69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab36659965dfc4e0d786f6c2220e11adad18bd69/0_40_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Junction, south London\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>In a relatively unknown part of London, between Brixton and Camberwell, the Junction offers a wonderful array of live jazz, acoustic, latin and blues music every night of the week. During the jazz jams the musicians, always excellent, will usually be sitting in the pub among the crowd, only getting up for their turn, making it feel very spontaneous and friendly. The owners\u2019 brilliantly eclectic jazz band plays on a Friday or you can pop down on other days to see musicians from across London. There is a lovely atmosphere, great tapas, board games on offer and it is dog-friendly. The pub is two minutes\u2019 walk from Loughborough Junction station and there is no entry free. <br><em><a href=\"http://thejunction.london/\" title=\"\">thejunction.london</a></em><br><strong>Emily</strong></p> \n<h2>Chums, Bristol</h2> \n<p>Chums is a tiny, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it neighbourhood boozer bursting at the seams with character. The windows steam up, the locals stream in, and you can expect to have a thoroughly lovely evening. Couple this with Chums\u2019 regular live folk, gypsy and bluegrass musicians and you\u2019re onto a winner. Best of all is <a href=\"https://www.ponchartrain.band/\" title=\"\">Ponchartrain</a> \u2013 a gorgeously ramshackle seven-piece band playing Americana meets Hillbilly meets honky tonk meets blues.

You might start with a fiddle, an accordion and acoustic guitar \u2013 but by the end of the night a multitude of musicians will have assembled and be in full flow. It feels profoundly Scottish to be sipping a pint of Tennent\u2019s lager at such a beautiful little local pub and listening to traditional music. The dark wood interior, many nooks and crannies and stained glass windows help create a traditional atmosphere but attract a really mixed crowd. As a bonus, each urinal is dedicated to one of the perpetrators of the Highland Clearances so the men, at least, can pee with pride.<br>\u2022 <em>On <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LismoreBar\" title=\"\">Facebook</a><br></em><strong>Thomas</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2019 to correct a misspelling of Clachaig Inn.</p> \n<p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Greystones, Sheffield The Backroom venue in the Greystones pub is such a small and intimate venue that the audience can converse with the musicians. Earlier this year we saw a Canadian folk duo Pharis and Romero who blew our socks off with their beautiful harmonies and banjo playing. We have also seen Wreckless Eric there and a singer-songwriter called Sarah Jarosz from Texas whose Americana and contemporary folk also blew us away. The added bonus is that Greystones is the flagship pub for a local brewery, Thornbridge, and so there is a wide range of delicious craft beers and ales to sup while enjoying the tunes. \u2022 mygreystones.co.uk Penny Hare and Hounds, Birmingham We were off to see the Bootleg Beatles. A number 50 bus from the city centre took us to the Hare and Hounds in trendy Kings Heath. On the wall is a plaque proclaiming that this was where UB40 played their first gig (9 February 1979). Downstairs a traditional, Victorian bar and a modern, minimalist bar serve craft beers and good choice of Purity IPAs. The atmosphere was friendly with an eclectic mix of punters, some there for the gig, others just to drink and chat. The music was in an upstairs room with another bar. The atmosphere was buzzing and the band superb. Gig tickets from about \u00a37 \u2013 a small price to keep music live. \u2022 On Facebook Carole The Grayston Unity, Halifax This tiny venue with a superb atmosphere is where excellent local indie band the Orielles launched their debut album, Silver Dollar Moment, in 2018. My personal highlight was seeing post-punk Manchester band the Blue Orchids with the brilliant Martin Bramah (ex-the Fall). Most gigs are free and you can listen to the likes of blues rocker Tom Hingley, indie covers band Zenit and others a matter of inches away, while supping on a pint of Chinook or a gentleman jack cocktail. \u2022 thegraystonunity.co.uk Steve Clachaig Inn, Glencoe, Highlands This wonderful pub is my favourite for live music. There\u2019s a large selection of real ales and over 400 whiskies. The bands usually play Scottish folk music and the audience joins in with the best-known songs. Surrounded by mountains \u2013 the west face of Aonach Dubh looms over the pub \u2013 the place is unsurprisingly popular with walkers and climbers. There is hotel and self-catering accommodation, a campsite and youth hostel nearby. It\u2019s my favourite pub in Scotland \u2013 once discovered, never forgotten. \u2022 clachaig.com Seona Stevenson Duke of Cumberland, Whitstable, Kent When I moved to Whitstable I was so pleased to come across \u201cDukes\u201d, which showcases original music in lovely surroundings. The Grade II-listed venue\u2019s walls are covered in art by artist Chris How. The Sugar Hill Gang, Lee Scratch Perry, Roy Ayres and Sticky Fingers are just some of acts to have played here. Sunday afternoon gigs are always free, but the quality of the musicians never seems to drop. There is a lovely garden and restaurant, and the venue attracts some famous faces from the music world \u2013 I once bumped into Pink Floyd\u2019s Nick Mason here. \u2022 dukeinwhitstable.co.uk Craig Avery Blue Peter Inn, Polperro, Cornwall Last summer we stayed in Polperro for a month, kept there partly by the energising atmosphere of the music nights at the 16th-century Blue Peter Inn. Local singers belting out Cornish sea shanties and folk music, with the participation of the customers \u2013 often involving some friendly coercing \u2013 created an irresistible, feelgood vibe. Gigs \u2013 some planned, some impromptu, sparked the cosy pub into life, even spilling outside in front of the quay. \u2022 thebluepeterinn.com Nick Charters, Peterborough Just beyond the spires of Peterborough Cathedral, there\u2019s an idyllic spot by the river alongside a bar on a moored Dutch barge named Charters. This venue has live bands throughout the year (outdoors in summer, on the barge now), with families, couples and hipsters young and old enjoying the music. The free gigs include covers bands and local bands such as Austin Gold blasting out their own infectious rhythms and tunes. The food is pretty decent too, with classic Thai and Indonesian dishes. \u2022 charters-bar.com Annie Carter The Junction, south London In a relatively unknown part of London, between Brixton and Camberwell, the Junction offers a wonderful array of live jazz, acoustic, latin and blues music every night of the week. During the jazz jams the musicians, always excellent, will usually be sitting in the pub among the crowd, only getting up for their turn, making it feel very spontaneous and friendly. The owners\u2019 brilliantly eclectic jazz band plays on a Friday or you can pop down on other days to see musicians from across London. There is a lovely atmosphere, great tapas, board games on offer and it is dog-friendly. The pub is two minutes\u2019 walk from Loughborough Junction station and there is no entry free. thejunction.london Emily Chums, Bristol Chums is a tiny, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it neighbourhood boozer bursting at the seams with character. The windows steam up, the locals stream in, and you can expect to have a thoroughly lovely evening. Couple this with Chums\u2019 regular live folk, gypsy and bluegrass musicians and you\u2019re onto a winner. Best of all is Ponchartrain \u2013 a gorgeously ramshackle seven-piece band playing Americana meets Hillbilly meets honky tonk meets blues. Chums, don\u2019t ever change. \u2022 On Facebook Alice Howells The Lismore, Glasgow Every Monday at the Lismore, a folk band slowly assembles itself through the evening. You might start with a fiddle, an accordion and acoustic guitar \u2013 but by the end of the night a multitude of musicians will have assembled and be in full flow. It feels profoundly Scottish to be sipping a pint of Tennent\u2019s lager at such a beautiful little local pub and listening to traditional music. The dark wood interior, many nooks and crannies and stained glass windows help create a traditional atmosphere but attract a really mixed crowd. As a bonus, each urinal is dedicated to one of the perpetrators of the Highland Clearances so the men, at least, can pee with pride. \u2022 On Facebook Thomas \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2019 to correct a misspelling of Clachaig Inn.

Almost all of the world\u2019s roughly 10,000 ashy storm petrels live off the California coast; of those, half live on the Farallones. <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2878\">Research by Warzybok </a>and his colleagues published this month in the academic journal Ecosphere indicates that, even with 15 or fewer owls visiting the islands, the petrel population can be significantly affected. Each owl eats one or two petrels a night, he says, meaning that just a few owls can affect the total petrel population substantially in a single season.</p> <h2>\u2018We have to get every last one\u2019</h2> <p>It may seem shocking, but dropping poison on an island to fix its rodent problems isn\u2019t a new idea, and it has many supporters.</p> <p>To date, brodifacoum has eradicated rodent populations on at least 60 islands in Mexico, the South Pacific, the Galapagos, and Alaska. It was used successfully on South Georgia, a remote island near Antarctica that had been home to 33 bird species before rats eliminated 90% of them. Brodifacoum also killed the rats that previously choked Palmyra Atoll near Hawaii, where, since its application in 2011, native trees have rebounded more than 5,000%. \u201cIn the field, the use of rodenticide is state of the art right now,\u201d said Doug Cordell, an FWS spokesman.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s like dropping a bomb in the Grand Canyon. Is this appropriate?</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Charter, Farallones adviser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is in part because of how difficult it is to wipe out a rodent population. \u201cWe have to get every last one,\u201d Warzybok said. If even one male and female were left alive, the population would bounce back quickly.</p> <p>FWS, which manages the Farallones, formally explored various options for removing the mice for more than a decade, considering about 50 approaches before settling on brodifacoum. \u201cWe took them all seriously, including the snakes and cats,\u201d Cordell said. He argues that brodifacoum is the only candidate that is strong enough, widely available enough, and in possession of a consistent enough track record for the job.</p> <p>And although a plan to drop tons of poisoned grain from helicopters may sound extreme, the FWS maintains that it is safe, since brodifacoum is not water-soluble and the proposal included plans to trap burrowing owls and other at-risk animals on the island, to keep them out of harm\u2019s way during the poison\u2019s application.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749ed92a267b147b745730429c2087f98b41aa60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749ed92a267b147b745730429c2087f98b41aa60/0_0_2300_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US Fish and Wildlife service has a plan to drop tons of poison pellets on the Farallon Islands to solve the mouse infestation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US Fish and Wildlife service has a plan to drop tons of poison pellets on the Farallon Islands to solve the mouse infestation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Mondon/Contra Costa Times/Tribune News Service via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, mentioning poison in the same breath as natural wonders often evokes public horror. In 2001, when the National Park Service undertook a brodifacoum-fueled effort to eradicate the black rats on Anacapa Island in southern California, furor reached such a peak that park rangers undertaking the effort had to wear bulletproof vests. In San Francisco, the opposition has been led in part by activist Maggie Sergio, who started her organization IslandWatch largely to focus on island rodenticide campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cBrodifacoum is one of the most persistent and toxic poisons on the market today, and the impacts of this poison continue up the food chain for some time,\u201d Sergio said by email. She, like many critics of the poison drop approach, points to the instances when the technique has gone wrong. FWS acknowledges in a recent Farallones report that the failure rate in similar mouse eradication attempts has hovered around 30%. On the Alaskan islet known formerly as Rat Island, excess grain bait dropped impulsively on its shores killed hundreds of birds, including 46 bald eagles.</p> <h2>\u2018Significant doubt\u2019</h2> <p>Rat Island\u2019s legacy is one reason that the Greater Farallones Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council, which advises the sanctuary\u2019s superintendent, has expressed trepidation about brodifacoum in the past, according to Charter. In 2013, the council released a statement on the proposal expressing \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about the project.</p> <p>Brodifacoum has been found in significant quantities in the organs of predators such as bobcats and mountain lions. And Lisa Owens-Viani, the director of a conservation organization that has sued California over its rodenticide regulations, points to a 2018 study that found significant levels of the poison in freshwater fish. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough known about how these poisons are spreading through the ecosystem,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f31bb58ba403b31e631ac93885dff6c1129bbd73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31bb58ba403b31e631ac93885dff6c1129bbd73/0_0_3372_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea lions sleep on docks at Pier 39 in the San Francisco harbor.

The area attracts crowds of tourists and seagulls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Clark/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fate of the seagulls that routinely fly between the Farallones and San Francisco was also of great concern to opponents of the FWS plan, who feared the birds could ingest brodifacoum at the islands before returning to the city, where they often flock to tourist attractions in search of a snack. The San Francisco environmental department considered the morbid possibility of vast quantities of dead seagulls ending up at the most popular spots. And in a letter seen by the Guardian, the FWS employee Michael Fry wrote: \u201c95% of all the gulls at the SF Zoo, Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Alcatraz Is. are from the Farallones. Brodifacoum takes 4-7 days to kill a bird. All of the birds will be flying back and forth until they get sick and die. Probably half will die in San Francisco. Minimum number will be 3,000 dead gulls in SF.\u201d</p> <p>Charter and other advocates are working to identify non-rodenticide alternative solutions, such as gene editing or contraception, that can slow a population\u2019s growth without using hormones or poisons.</p> <p>But Cordell argues that while these new techniques are promising, they have never been used on mouse populations, and \u201cthey\u2019re not at a state now where they\u2019re used to eradicate rodents on island ecosystems\u201d. In the end, brodifacoum presents the only \u201cproven\u201d method, he said.</p> <p>Cordell says the FWS will put its plans on hold for several months as the agency prepares to submit an amended proposal to the California Coastal Commission later this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, October and November are peak burrowing owl season on the islands. Researchers like Warzybok will continue to step around mice as they go about their work, watching the sky for new arrivals.</p>",

FWS, which manages the Farallones, formally explored various options for removing the mice for more than a decade, considering about 50 approaches before settling on brodifacoum. \u201cWe took them all seriously, including the snakes and cats,\u201d Cordell said. He argues that brodifacoum is the only candidate that is strong enough, widely available enough, and in possession of a consistent enough track record for the job. And although a plan to drop tons of poisoned grain from helicopters may sound extreme, the FWS maintains that it is safe, since brodifacoum is not water-soluble and the proposal included plans to trap burrowing owls and other at-risk animals on the island, to keep them out of harm\u2019s way during the poison\u2019s application. Even so, mentioning poison in the same breath as natural wonders often evokes public horror. In 2001, when the National Park Service undertook a brodifacoum-fueled effort to eradicate the black rats on Anacapa Island in southern California, furor reached such a peak that park rangers undertaking the effort had to wear bulletproof vests. In San Francisco, the opposition has been led in part by activist Maggie Sergio, who started her organization IslandWatch largely to focus on island rodenticide campaigns. \u201cBrodifacoum is one of the most persistent and toxic poisons on the market today, and the impacts of this poison continue up the food chain for some time,\u201d Sergio said by email. She, like many critics of the poison drop approach, points to the instances when the technique has gone wrong. FWS acknowledges in a recent Farallones report that the failure rate in similar mouse eradication attempts has hovered around 30%. On the Alaskan islet known formerly as Rat Island, excess grain bait dropped impulsively on its shores killed hundreds of birds, including 46 bald eagles. \u2018Significant doubt\u2019 Rat Island\u2019s legacy is one reason that the Greater Farallones Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council, which advises the sanctuary\u2019s superintendent, has expressed trepidation about brodifacoum in the past, according to Charter. In 2013, the council released a statement on the proposal expressing \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about the project. Brodifacoum has been found in significant quantities in the organs of predators such as bobcats and mountain lions. And Lisa Owens-Viani, the director of a conservation organization that has sued California over its rodenticide regulations, points to a 2018 study that found significant levels of the poison in freshwater fish. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough known about how these poisons are spreading through the ecosystem,\u201d she said. The fate of the seagulls that routinely fly between the Farallones and San Francisco was also of great concern to opponents of the FWS plan, who feared the birds could ingest brodifacoum at the islands before returning to the city, where they often flock to tourist attractions in search of a snack. The San Francisco environmental department considered the morbid possibility of vast quantities of dead seagulls ending up at the most popular spots. And in a letter seen by the Guardian, the FWS employee Michael Fry wrote: \u201c95% of all the gulls at the SF Zoo, Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, Alcatraz Is. are from the Farallones. Brodifacoum takes 4-7 days to kill a bird. All of the birds will be flying back and forth until they get sick and die. Probably half will die in San Francisco. Minimum number will be 3,000 dead gulls in SF.\u201d Charter and other advocates are working to identify non-rodenticide alternative solutions, such as gene editing or contraception, that can slow a population\u2019s growth without using hormones or poisons. But Cordell argues that while these new techniques are promising, they have never been used on mouse populations, and \u201cthey\u2019re not at a state now where they\u2019re used to eradicate rodents on island ecosystems\u201d. In the end, brodifacoum presents the only \u201cproven\u201d method, he said. Cordell says the FWS will put its plans on hold for several months as the agency prepares to submit an amended proposal to the California Coastal Commission later this year. Meanwhile, October and November are peak burrowing owl season on the islands. Researchers like Warzybok will continue to step around mice as they go about their work, watching the sky for new arrivals.",

The Riders are committed to keeping costs down, but acknowledge that composting, like healthy eating, is unaffordable for many.</p> \n<p>Recent recruit Zoe Apisdorf, 29, is on a collection route in Shaker Heights, an ethnically mixed wealthy suburb scattered with grandiose mansions, not far from the county\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe food waste issue is a food inequalities issue which is really painful to me.

      "bodyText": "Autumn foliage signals the end of the growing season across the rust belt states as farmers wind down for the winter chill. Yet in Cleveland\u2019s bleak \u201cforgotten triangle\u201d, bountiful crops of rainbow chard, collard greens and plump purple aubergines are blooming at one of the city\u2019s urban farms. In a heavily segregated city where race and inequality can define one\u2019s life outcome, not to mention the obstacles of food deserts and urban decay, now there is an arable green oasis. The farm, created by the not-for-profit Rid-All partnership, is striving to change eating habits in a city where health inequalities disproportionately affect African American communities. Its African American creators have transformed a desolate illegal dumping ground into a lush, eight-acre agricultural innovation site with greenhouses, fish ponds and a composting facility. Rid-All is among 25 inspirational people and organizations changing lives and communities that the Guardian is this week highlighting as part of the Cleveland\u2019s City Champions project. Each case exemplifies how grassroots activists and socially minded entrepreneurs are tackling big, interconnected global challenges such as the climate crisis, obesity and infant mortality at the local level, often in the absence of state-sponsored structural solutions. \u201cPeople of colour are constantly under attack, and not just by guns and the police, by all sorts of structural violence like corruption, food deserts, educational and health inequalities,\u201d said Amanda King, founder of Shooting without Bullets, an arts and social justice organization in Cleveland. Rid-All\u2019s ethos is community building through education and experience: over the past decade, hundreds of Clevelanders \u2013 mostly African American men \u2013 have completed its urban farming training programmes, including most recently a group of veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Aided by an army of volunteer sustainability converts, the farm has become a community hub, hosting vegetarian food festivals, weddings, cooking classes, school visits and guided tours. \u201cThe idea was to show people how to turn vacant urban plots into green spaces that generate community pride and economic opportunities,\u201d said co-founder Randy McShepard. \u201cDiabetes, heart disease and obesity are killing us, yet these diseases can all be mitigated by healthy diets, which is what we\u2019re trying to teach our communities.\u201d The scale of the challenge in Cleveland can be daunting. The city is the capital of Cuyahoga county, located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, a former powerhouse which has suffered decades of economic decline and widespread racial inequalities: African Americans make up 30% of the county\u2019s population, but are 79% more likely to die from diabetes than their white counterparts. Almost 54% of children in Cleveland live in poverty \u2013 the second-highest rate in the country after Detroit, but African Americans and Latinos are three times more affected than whites. Countywide, one in three, or 400,000 people, live in a food desert \u2013 a neighbourhood with high rates of poverty and no supermarket within half a mile. This dire situation is even worse in predominantly black neighbourhoods like East Cleveland, Hough and Glenville, where more than half the people rely on gas stations, minimarts and fast-food outlets to eat. Not a single Cuyahoga County supermarket (a food store bigger than 10,000ft) is owned by an African American. School friends It is within this context of deep-seated economic and racial injustice that Rid-All was founded in 2009 by three school friends who grew up on the same street, in a suburb African Americans were only able to move to after racist home ownership zoning policies, known as redlining, were relaxed in the 1960s. Rid-All began as the global financial crisis was taking hold of the city, fuelling a rise in unemployment and foreclosures. They acquired 1.3 acres of abandoned land, obtained council permits, cleaned it up and opened the first greenhouse in early 2010. \u201cFood is the longest relationship you will ever have, and we\u2019re trying to help people make it a good one,\u201d said Keymah Durden III, another co-founder (the third founder, Damien Forshe, died suddenly last year). But this is about more than healthy eating: the core team, all African American men in their 50s, are socially-minded entrepreneurs with their fingers in many green pies, striving to inspire and teach community members to grow small businesses. They were all members of Alpha Phi Alpha \u2013 the first African American college fraternity, which emphasises community service, leadership and tackling injustice. One recent urban farming graduate has launched an organic skincare line using herbs grown at the farm, another a hot sauce company. Rid-All is expanding and has spawned numerous not-for-profit and business spinoffs, including a commercial fish farm, vegan catering, puppet and theatre shows, comics and beekeeping, with a vegetarian restaurant and juice business in the works. Invest small, inspire big On a chilly grey October morning, Valerie Harrison, a retired teacher and community organizer, is out mowing the grass and inspecting the season\u2019s final harvest at the Bedford Heights community garden. This was an unused grassy plot in 2010, which Harrison, 60, persuaded the mayor of Bedford Heights, a predominantly black mixed-income suburb, to sanction as a community garden. Now, there are 20 raised plots where cub scouts, widows and adults with learning difficulties grow a variety of crops including strawberries, tomatoes, kale and okra; 10% of the produce is donated to the community centre and local residents. Harrison recently completed Rid-All\u2019s five-month farming course on a scholarship, after promising to impart the knowledge to other gardeners. She recently secured funds to double the number of plots for next season, a joint venture with a local public middle school. This is exactly the multiplier effect that Rid-All want to generate: invest small, inspire big. Rust Belt Riders Despite the shocking number of Americans facing hunger, as much as half of all food is wasted. The majority ends up in landfills, making it one of the largest contributors to the greenhouse gas emissions driving the global climate crisis. In Cleveland, like much of the US, there is no municipal composting service. Working closely with Rid-All is a local food waste collection company, Rust Belt Riders, which started out in 2014 as two guys on their bikes collecting and composting food waste from a handful of restaurants to avoid it ending up in landfills. Rust Belt Riders, another of the City Champions, is a small but growing business, collecting 50,000lb of food waste every week from 150 businesses (schools, restaurants, grocery stores, museums), and recently started a residential service which costs $10 for weekly collection, or $5 to drop off your food waste. The Riders are committed to keeping costs down, but acknowledge that composting, like healthy eating, is unaffordable for many. Recent recruit Zoe Apisdorf, 29, is on a collection route in Shaker Heights, an ethnically mixed wealthy suburb scattered with grandiose mansions, not far from the county\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods. \u201cThe food waste issue is a food inequalities issue which is really painful to me. Part of the paradigm shift is getting people to see that throwing out food \u2013 and plastic \u2013 with trash isn\u2019t normal,\u201d said Apisdorf. Apisdorf drops off the waste to Rid-All, which will be turned into compost, and sold to commercial farmers cultivating corn, hemp, and soya, as well as community gardens, local residents, and marijuana growers \u2013 a burgeoning industry in Ohio. \u201cWe waste so much in the United States, we have to change our way of life and the climate and global food crisis means our regenerative agriculture model is the way of the future,\u201d said Marc White, 55, Rid-All\u2019s sharply dressed chief farmer, compost guru and holistic health columnist. \u201cOur soil is the secret sauce for nutrition \u2026 it is black gold.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion using #citychampions, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "bodyText": "Good morning and happy Thanksgiving. I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Beijing slams \u2018prejudice and arrogance\u2019 of US bill Donald Trump has raised the hackles of the Chinese government by signing into law a congressional bill backing Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement. The legislation, approved unanimously by the US senate and by all but one member of the House, threatens sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese government officials accused of human rights abuses amid the semi-autonomous city\u2019s continuing political unrest. Beijing said the bill was \u201ca pure interference in China\u2019s internal affairs \u2026 full of prejudice and arrogance.\u201d Police break siege. Police have peacefully entered Hong Kong Polytechnic University after a 10-day siege, despite pleas from activists who said up to 20 protesters were still holed up inside the campus. World may \u2018have crossed climate tipping points\u2019 already A group of scientists writing in the journal Nature have warned the world may already have passed one or more climate \u201ctipping points\u201d, putting humanity in a \u201cstate of planetary emergency\u201d that poses \u201can existential threat to civilisation\u201d. Such points are reached when a major impact of global heating becomes unstoppable, for example the loss of rainforests or polar ice sheets. One of those impacts alone, the researchers warned, could lead to a cascade of others. South Korea pollution. South Korea has announced plans to shut down up to a quarter of its coal-fired power plants over the winter to combat dangerously high levels of dust pollution. Massive Attack. Trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack have been touring the globe for decades. Now they have commissioned a report to assess the carbon emissions impact of the live music touring industry, in hopes of eliminating its effects. Sondland accused of sexual misconduct by three women Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women who say he retaliated against them after they rejected his advances. Sondland, whose neck-deep involvement in the Ukraine scandal has made him a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, has categorically denied the claims, saying he believes they were \u201cconcocted and \u2026 coordinated for political purposes\u201d. \u2018Unwanted kissing\u2019. One of the accusers, a potential business partner, told ProPublica that Sondland had tried to kiss her during a tour of one of the hotels he owns, and then withdrew his offer of investment in her business after she rebuffed him. Lawyers: indict Bolsonaro for \u2018encouraging genocide\u2019 Lawyers and leading human rights activists in Brazil are calling for the indictment of the country\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro by the International Criminal Court, claiming he has encouraged genocide against Brazil\u2019s indigenous tribes. Since taking power, Bolsonaro has compared indigenous people to zoo animals and \u201cprehistoric men\u201d, made efforts to dismantle the agency responsible for protecting the country\u2019s more than 300 tribes and pushed to open up their tribal lands to mining companies. \u2018Informative note.\u2019 The campaigners on Wednesday delivered a request to an ICC prosecutor in the Hague for a \u201cpreliminary investigation of incitement to genocide and widespread systematic attacks against indigenous peoples\u201d by Bolsonaro. Cheat sheet Five people have been killed in a fire at a public housing high-rise in Minneapolis\u2019s Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, which is known as Little Mogadishu for the many Somali immigrants who have settled there. Experts have questioned Trump\u2019s decision to label Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations, suggesting the new designation would be mostly cosmetic \u2013 unless the president requires a pretext for US military incursions. Ahead of the UK\u2019s general election, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party has obtained documents which, it says, prove Boris Johnson and the Conservatives plan to put the National Health Service \u201con the table\u201d in a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. The Chicago home of Jeff Tweedy, the frontman for the Grammy-winning rock band Wilco, was shot at at least seven times early on Tuesday morning. Tweedy\u2019s son Spencer said he did not believe his family were deliberately targeted. Must-reads Limpy the limping turkey becomes a Thanksgiving star A Massachusetts turkey, recognisable by his distinctive rolling gait, has charmed (some) residents of the town of Reading by disrupting traffic, chasing mail trucks and inadvertently raising hundreds of dollars for charity. Adam Gabbatt learns from Limpy\u2019s inspiring refusal to let his disability define him. Talking climate change with your family: a beginner\u2019s guide With the climate crisis more present than ever before, it\u2019s a subject likely to come up at the dinner table over Thanksgiving. Emily Holden offers advice on how to navigate the contentious topic with sceptical relatives on both sides of the political divide. How Michigan\u2019s \u2018political novices\u2019 beat GOP gerrymandering In 2016, a Michigan woman with no political experience asked her Facebook friends whether they wanted to help make elections fairer in one of America\u2019s most gerrymandered states. Three years on, her group Voters not Politicians has succeeded in stripping redistricting power from lawmakers, as Sam Levine reports. California islands tackle a plague of mice The Farallon Islands off northern California are home to 300,000 breeding seabirds, five species of seals and sea lions, and a unique variety of cricket. They also contain more than a thousand mice per acre, a growing threat to the islands\u2019 rich biodiversity. But efforts to cull the rodents might make matters worse, writes Alissa Greenberg. Opinion At 41 and in the final phase of her fertility, Lynda-Marie Taurasi is in a happy relationship with a man who does not want children. So she is planning to have children alone \u2013 while staying with him. I wasn\u2019t going to depend on a relationship to become a mother. Many women have come to single motherhood through various means, and I am grateful for the women who have paved the way, often times unwittingly, for this to become an intended option. Sport The Liverpool coach, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, has said his team will relish the pressure of a Champions League group decider in Salzburg next month, after the title holders failed to book their place in the next round with a 1-1 draw against Napoli on Wednesday. Chelsea face a similar test after a 2-2 draw with Valencia, while Lionel Messi hit a career milestone as he led Barcelona to the knockout stages with a 3-1 win over Dortmund. When the mixed martial artist Justin Wren was sent a video of a 12-year-old boy being violently bullied at school, he saw a version of his vulnerable younger self. Wren decided to step in, bringing out the MMA community and other sportspeople in support of his #StandWithRayden campaign. Loretta Hunt reports.

Here are some of your questions and her answers.</p> <h2>Education</h2> <p><strong>One of the most popular ideas in the Labour manifesto is free education for all. Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan for</strong><strong>? </strong><em>Carina Nicu, 27</em><em>, research technician at the University of Manchester</em></p> <p>Hi Carina, you\u2019re right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament.</p> <p>Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it\u2019s costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). It would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits \u2013 though of course it wouldn\u2019t just be these students who would benefit.</p> <p>Labour hasn\u2019t earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure, but its biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested. Labour says it\u2019s just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won\u2019t be high by international standards. Critics say it will deter foreign investment and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders.</p> <p><strong>I have teenage grandchildren, one hoping to start higher education next year. Please can you clarify the Labour position on student grants \u2013 both for maintenance and tuition fees. Will there be means testing? If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> </strong><strong>forms a government after the election when would any new arrangements for student finances be introduced?</strong> <em>Muriel, Preston</em></p> <p>Hello Muriel, Labour has said it will abolish tuition fees for all students \u2013 beginning immediately, so for those starting university in autumn 2020 \u2013 and bring back maintenance grants for the children of families on lower incomes.</p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p><strong>Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? </strong><em>Sabrina</em></p> <p>Hi Sabrina, yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party\u2019s longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here.</p> <p>And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d, under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement for continuing to live and work here.

Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? </strong><em>Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa</em></p> <p>I\u2019m afraid, not, Daniel. Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will \u201ctake urgent steps to refresh our democracy\u201d, and it commits to a series of specific changes including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16, but there is no mention of voting reform.</p> <p>It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens\u2019 assembly. It appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK, but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That\u2019s as close as the manifesto comes on the issue.</p> <h2>Broadband</h2> <p><strong>What does the nationalisation of <a href=\"https://www.openreach.com/\">Openreach</a> mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach\u2019s competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for \u201cfree\u201d broadband. </strong><em>Sam, West Midlands</em></p> <p>Good question Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you\u2019re right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach \u2013 renamed British Broadband \u2013 would expand its operations significantly, presumably).</p> <h2>How radical?</h2> <p><strong>Just how radical is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party manifesto \u2013 when compared to both traditional British politics, and to other European countries?</strong> <em>Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk</em></p> <p>Hi Tom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor this week that his plans wouldn\u2019t put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government in just five years. As the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, put it, \u201cthis would be the biggest set of spending increases and the biggest set of tax increases and the biggest set of borrowing increases we\u2019ve seen in peacetime history.\u201d</p> <h2>Abortion</h2> <p><strong>I\u2019m aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion \u2013 which I am wholly supportive of. However, I\u2019m not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate? Many Tory supporters I know are posting pro-life website claims that abortion will be made legal at any point during pregnancy even when the baby is fully developed. I do not believe this to be true but I\u2019m struggling to find the details on the changes Labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. </strong><em>Nicole, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>Hi Nicole, I\u2019m really interested (and concerned) to hear that that\u2019s out there, because it\u2019s not true.

Thanks for asking that one.</p> <h2>Equality</h2> <p><strong>Has Labour made any indication that </strong><strong>it would have a gender-balanced cabinet?</strong> <em>Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London</em></p> <p>I haven\u2019t seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet and contrasted that with the Conservatives\u2019 more male-dominated top team. So while he hasn\u2019t committed to keeping everyone in the same jobs if he got into Downing Street, I think it\u2019s highly likely he would maintain a balance.</p> <h2>Health</h2> <p><strong>Have Labour published any deeper details on what the \u00a31bn public health investment might break down into? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> inequalities presumably need to be a focus. </strong><em>Joel, 30, working in the charity sector, Essex</em></p> <p>Hi Joel, yes, the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy.</p> <p>The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and Labour says it would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses \u2013 and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity.</p> <p>To try to make the target stick, the party also says it would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act \u2013 a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality \u2013 and a new obligation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> agencies to cooperate with directors of public health.</p> <h2>Share your questions</h2> <p>Next up will be the Guardian\u2019s in-house election psephologist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh\">Dan Sabbagh</a>, who is also the defence and security editor.

      "bodyText": "As part of a new series, you can ask our politics team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. On Wednesday the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, answered your questions about Labour\u2019s manifesto, campaign and policies. Here are some of your questions and her answers. Education One of the most popular ideas in the Labour manifesto is free education for all. Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan for? Carina Nicu, 27, research technician at the University of Manchester Hi Carina, you\u2019re right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it\u2019s costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). It would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits \u2013 though of course it wouldn\u2019t just be these students who would benefit. Labour hasn\u2019t earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure, but its biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested. Labour says it\u2019s just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won\u2019t be high by international standards. Critics say it will deter foreign investment and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders. I have teenage grandchildren, one hoping to start higher education next year. Please can you clarify the Labour position on student grants \u2013 both for maintenance and tuition fees. Will there be means testing? If Labour forms a government after the election when would any new arrangements for student finances be introduced? Muriel, Preston Hello Muriel, Labour has said it will abolish tuition fees for all students \u2013 beginning immediately, so for those starting university in autumn 2020 \u2013 and bring back maintenance grants for the children of families on lower incomes. Brexit Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina Hi Sabrina, yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party\u2019s longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here. And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d, under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement for continuing to live and work here. (The manifesto doesn\u2019t say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here.) Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK. As for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit. Electoral reform Labour has often hinted at electoral reform. Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa I\u2019m afraid, not, Daniel. Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will \u201ctake urgent steps to refresh our democracy\u201d, and it commits to a series of specific changes including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16, but there is no mention of voting reform. It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens\u2019 assembly. It appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK, but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That\u2019s as close as the manifesto comes on the issue. Broadband What does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach\u2019s competitors?

The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and Labour says it would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses \u2013 and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity.

More than a quarter (28%) of new hydropower plants are to be constructed in nature reserves, with many planned in the Balkans, home to some of Europe\u2019s last free-flowing rivers. Rivers in western and central Europe are already strewn with tens of thousands of manmade barriers such as dams, which have fuelled the steep decline in freshwater fish, such as salmon, trout and eels. The study, which claims to be Europe\u2019s first inventory of hydropower, found that 8,507 new plants are planned for the coming years, adding to the 21,387 on the continent. A further 278 plants are already under construction, according to the research, which was commissioned by four NGOs. \u201cWe are facing nothing less than the end of free flowing rivers in Europe, if we don\u2019t stop this dam craze,\u201d said Ulrich Eichelmann, the chief executive of RiverWatch, one of four environmental NGOs that commissioned the study. \u201cUnder the label of \u201cgreen energy\u201d, the hydro lobby and political decision makers are about to destroy Europe\u2019s last remaining rivers and streams, and with it an enormous amount of plant and animal species,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any additional new hydro dams in Europe.\u201d Eichelmann said the quality and diversity of rivers in the Balkans was \u201cunparalleled\u201d, while in central and western Europe hydropower dams have already had a huge impact \u201cto the extent that many of us don\u2019t know what a living river looks like\u201d. He described the Vjosa river, which runs from Greece to the Adriatic Sea as \u201cthe last big wild river in Europe\u201d and said it was \u201chighly threatened\u201d as a result of hydropower projects planned in Albania. Academic research has found that up to 30 freshwater fish species in the Balkans face extinction if all planned hydropower projects in the region go ahead. At risk are the Greek brook lamprey, the marble trout and a variety of zingels, a fish that thrives in fast-flowing waters. \u201cWe must understand that the already high demand for water resources, especially in southern Europe will be exacerbated by such large-scale hydropower exploitation, resulting in a deadly combination for freshwater diversity,\u201d said Steven Weiss, an associate professor at the Karl-Franzens university of Graz. Weiss, who has carried out separate research into the threat to wildlife posed by dams, provided a comment to the NGO team. The report was published as new European Union leaders prepare plans for a \u201cEuropean green deal\u201d that will lead to an expansion of renewable energy, with the aim of reducing greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2050. The NGOs argue that Europe is already \u201csaturated\u201d with dams and insist hydropower should not be considered as a form of green energy. Even small dams can have a dramatic impact on wildlife, by preventing fish from migrating to spawning grounds. Hydropower dams have been linked to a decline in salmon, trout, eel and sturgeon by the European Environment Agency. According to the agency, dams and reservoirs also trap sand in certain places, fuelling coastal erosion or flooding elsewhere. WWF, another of the NGOs that commissioned the report, said hydropower was one of the biggest obstacles to meeting EU targets on healthy rivers. Under EU water legislation, all rivers, lakes, coastal and groundwater must achieve \u201cgood\u201d ecological status by 2027 at the latest, an extension on the original 2015 target. Currently only 40% of surface waters are deemed to have good status, according to the latest report by the EU executive, which highlighted problems of pollution and human activity that disrupts the flow of rivers. The NGO study highlights that many planned plants will produce relatively little electricity. \u201cSmall hydropower plants come with a large ecological impact because they are numerous and disrupt river continuity, whilst contributing minimally to electricity production.\u201d Hydropower is growing more slowly in western Europe, including in Scotland and Norway. In Switzerland, which makes intensive use of the technology, operators want to harness melting glaciers to create a new model of \u201cperiglacial hydropower plant\u201d. But the most rapid expansion is forecast for south-eastern Europe and Turkey.",

      "bodyText": "TikTok has apologised for blocking a US teenager from the Chinese-owned video sharing platform after she posted a video highlighting Beijing\u2019s treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang. A spokesman for the platform on Thursday blamed a \u201chuman moderation error\u201d for the removal of a video by 17-year-old Feroza Aziz disguised as a makeup tutorial to avoid being censored. In the short clip, Aziz curls her eyelashes while calling on viewers to \u201cspread awareness\u201d of what is happening in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has been accused of sending at least 1 million Uighurs and other minorities to internment camps. The video was viewed more than 1.5 million times but Aziz was blocked from posting any more videos. In a statement acknowledging the \u201csignificant interest and confusion\u201d in Aziz\u2019s case, Eric Han, head of safety at TikTok US, said: \u201cDue to a human moderation error, the viral video \u2026 was removed. It\u2019s important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed.\u201d Han said the company had previously banned an account by Aziz after she posted a satirical video about the prospect of marrying Osama bin Laden. As part of \u201cscheduled platform-wide enforcement\u201d, her second account was suspended a few days after she posted her makeup tutorial. \u201cOur moderation approach of banning devices associated with a banned account is designed to protect against the spread of coordinated malicious behaviour \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that this was not the intent here,\u201d Han said, adding that the company had contacted Aziz to tell her that her account had been reinstated. Han said the company was reviewing the \u201cprocedural breakdown\u201d in this incident and would be releasing a \u201ctransparency report\u201d as well as a fuller version of its community moderation guidelines. Aziz posted on Twitter that her account had been unblocked but cast doubt on the company\u2019s explanations. She wrote: \u201cDo I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a 3-part video about the Uighurs? No.\u201d Aziz\u2019s video and accusations of censorship come at a time when the Chinese leadership is facing international condemnation for its policies in Xinjiang, which China defends as counter-terrorism measures. Several recent high-profile leaks detailing the use of involuntary internment camps for \u201cideological education\u201d have undermined Beijing\u2019s claims that it only hosts \u201cvocational training centres\u201d that people attend willingly. Owned by the Beijing-based technology company ByteDance, TikTok is one of few Chinese apps that have gained popularity outside of China. TikTok has said that it does not apply Chinese censorship rules on the international version of its app. Uighurs within China and those overseas have previously used Douyin, the app\u2019s domestic version, to communicate or raise awareness of the situation but those accounts appear to have been scrubbed from the platform. Leaked moderation guidelines seen by the Guardian barred content related to certain world leaders, Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence and Falun Gong. It did not mention Xinjiang specifically, but barred \u201chighly controversial topics, such as separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups, for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Chefs are more like us than they often care to admit. At work, they may weave local, seasonal magic with the finest foraged ingredients, but off the clock they are prey to the same quick and dirty fast-food urges as Joe Public. And why not?</p> <p>\u201cBefore I was a chef I was working-class. Do you know what I mean?\u201d asks Sat Bains, chef-owner at the two Michelin star Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham. \u201cYou can\u2019t forget where you come from and I\u2019ve got no problem with someone seeing me going into McDonald\u2019s. If that makes me happy, I\u2019m going to eat it.\u201d</p> <p>From calorie-packed high-street classics to healthier new-wave options, we asked some of the UK\u2019s best chefs how they satisfy their fast-food cravings.</p> <h2><strong>Heston Blumenthal </strong><br><strong>The Fat Duck, Bray</strong><em>, </em><strong>Berkshire</strong><br><strong>Generic petrol-station tuna mayo sandwiches</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93b0a6970f9f661e92f022e7bb58347febf1d63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b0a6970f9f661e92f022e7bb58347febf1d63a/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heston Blumenthal\u2019s favourite: Tuna sandwich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heston Blumenthal\u2019s favourite: tuna sandwich</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DebbiSmirnoff/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love Melton Mowbray pork pies, prawn cocktail anything and squidgy, white bread tuna sandwiches from petrol station fridges. The soggier the bread the better, but it must have some crunchy bits inside \u2013 it needs plenty of mayo <em>and</em> onion. This dates back to when I was training in the gym 20 hours a week and ate tin after tin of tuna. It\u2019s not the healthiest but we should stop feeling guilty and forgive ourselves sometimes \u2026 just not every day.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Paul Ainsworth</strong><br><strong>No 6 and Rojano\u2019s, Padstow, Cornwall</strong><br><strong>Nando\u2019s fino pitta</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNando\u2019s grilled chicken is super-tasty, consistent and, as I have to watch my weight, healthier than burgers or pizza. Our regular order used to be whole roast chicken with coleslaw, corn and sweet potatoes. Then I discovered this game-changer. I was in Stratford-Upon-Avon filming Great British Menu, went to Nando\u2019s and somehow the fino pitta had never caught my eye before. It\u2019s a next-level, roasted chicken-thigh flatbread with caramelised red onion chutney, grilled halloumi and salad. Now, that\u2019s my treat.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sat Bains</strong><br><strong>Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham</strong><br><strong>McDonald\u2019s Filet-o-Fish</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1a2d9e001d9a499530421bf49be8e8a648f9e11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a2d9e001d9a499530421bf49be8e8a648f9e11/0_14_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McDonalds Filet-o-Fish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McDonald\u2019s Filet-o-Fish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Biggs/PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn my first year at college, I worked in McDonald\u2019s. I hated it, but it introduced me to Filet-o-Fish. It was a revelation. That contrast between soft, steamed bap, crunchy fried fish, tartare sauce \u2013 and don\u2019t forget it\u2019s got a layer of cheese too \u2013 it was like, shiiiit, man. I don\u2019t have one often but I love \u2019em. My expectations are realistic: I\u2019m not going for a gourmet feast. But nothing else does it for me. When we close at Christmas we buy sausage McMuffins for the staff as a treat. Last year, I had a \u00a3550 white truffle left over and we shaved it over the breakfasts. They loved it. It\u2019s called the McTruffle Shuffle.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Simon Rimmer</strong><br><strong>Greens, Manchester</strong><br><strong>Greggs sausage roll</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it often but the Gregg\u2019s sausage roll is a joy. It\u2019s greasy, over-seasoned and you know it\u2019s not doing you a scrap of good. Yet there\u2019s something heavenly in that white pepper and heavily minced pork. I haven\u2019t tried the vegan one. Why would you? Don\u2019t get me started on pretend meat in vegan food. As a veggie restaurant owner for 30 years, it drives me insane.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Meriel Armitage</strong><br><strong>Club Mexicana, London</strong><br><strong>Greggs vegan sausage roll</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c3a5dd28211aa51b531b31a212f95376f0080c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c3a5dd28211aa51b531b31a212f95376f0080c1/0_118_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greggs vegan sausage roll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greggs vegan sausage roll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Fortune/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPredictable, I know, but it has changed vegans\u2019 lives. I\u2019ve been vegan for 10 years and cut convenience food out of my life. It didn\u2019t exist. Now I see a Greggs sign like a beacon on the high street. A close second is Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s veg samosa. That\u2019s a motorway service station staple. On the way to and from festivals I\u2019ll eat four!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Jacob Kenedy</strong><br><strong>Bocca di Lupo, London</strong><br><strong>Pret A Manger\u2019s egg mayo sandwich</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of the independents. I am one. But I spend a lot of time going to meetings, hurrying around and, in a rush, you go for the safe, consistent bet and Pret is definitely that. Fresh bread, decent fillings, a bit like sandwiches used to be when made by your schoolfriends\u2019 parents, possibly. Having said that, I\u2019ll go to Pret in a hurry, then spend quite a long time trying to figure out which is the best-looking egg sandwich. I always get it wrong.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Yotam Ottolenghi, </strong><br><strong>Ottolenghi</strong><br><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/snapsoon/\" title=\"\">Round Falafel</a>\u2019s wraps</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI often go to this Lebanese falafel stand on Parkway in Camden for a falafel salad tray or a wrap with pickles, tahini and chilli sauce. Otherwise, it\u2019s Pizza Express\u2019s rich, unctuous Sloppy Giuseppe. If you\u2019re getting takeout pizza, you might as well get the most decadent.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nina Matsunaga</strong><br><strong>The Black Bull, Sedbergh, Cumbria</strong><br><strong>Caff\u00e9 Nero\u2019s white chocolate mocha</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2022c43197760fd0232d1eb16c2b18b6da9632c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2022c43197760fd0232d1eb16c2b18b6da9632c8/0_230_2136_2669/800.jpg\" alt=\"Caffe Nero for Nina Matsunaga\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caffe Nero</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m really bad for high-carb, fatty, deep-fried food. If we\u2019re on the motorway or in an airport \u2013 those moments when you\u2019re not really part of the real world \u2013 I go for fries and iced coffees full of sugar and cream, like McDonald\u2019s caramel iced frapp\u00e9. In winter, it\u2019s Nero\u2019s horribly sugary white chocolate mocha. I\u2019m not sure you can call espresso with white chocolate sauce, milk, whipped cream and chocolate powder a speciality coffee. It sounds great in your head, then you start drinking it and by the end you feel, \u2018Why did I do that?\u2019 \u201d</p> <h2><strong>Stuart Ralston</strong><br><strong>Aizle and Noto, Edinburgh</strong><br><strong>Five Guys\u2019 cheeseburger</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI used to work at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s The London and since leaving New York, I\u2019ve found most cheeseburgers are terrible. Restaurants make them too \u2018gourmet\u2019 with thick brioche buns and hockey puck-sized patties that you can\u2019t pick up without it falling apart. A proper burger uses thin patties, a soft bun so squishy you can eat it like a sandwich, and American cheese rather than fancy cheddar. A Five Guys\u2019 double cheeseburger with grilled onions, mayo, mustard and ketchup is the closest I\u2019ve come to the real deal.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Chris Leach</strong><br><strong>Manteca, London</strong><br><strong>KFC\u2019s Zinger Tower burger</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2858373099ad250c74b24f406d2a8b8e886456f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2858373099ad250c74b24f406d2a8b8e886456f3/0_111_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"KFC Zinger Tower Burger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">KFC Zinger Tower Burger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI rarely get drunk any more but, when I did, my go-to fast food was a KFC Zinger Tower burger: a chicken burger with spicy coating, hash brown, cheese and fiery salsa.

      "bodyText": "Chefs are more like us than they often care to admit. At work, they may weave local, seasonal magic with the finest foraged ingredients, but off the clock they are prey to the same quick and dirty fast-food urges as Joe Public. And why not? \u201cBefore I was a chef I was working-class. Do you know what I mean?\u201d asks Sat Bains, chef-owner at the two Michelin star Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham. \u201cYou can\u2019t forget where you come from and I\u2019ve got no problem with someone seeing me going into McDonald\u2019s. If that makes me happy, I\u2019m going to eat it.\u201d From calorie-packed high-street classics to healthier new-wave options, we asked some of the UK\u2019s best chefs how they satisfy their fast-food cravings. Heston Blumenthal The Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire Generic petrol-station tuna mayo sandwiches \u201cI love Melton Mowbray pork pies, prawn cocktail anything and squidgy, white bread tuna sandwiches from petrol station fridges. The soggier the bread the better, but it must have some crunchy bits inside \u2013 it needs plenty of mayo and onion. This dates back to when I was training in the gym 20 hours a week and ate tin after tin of tuna. It\u2019s not the healthiest but we should stop feeling guilty and forgive ourselves sometimes \u2026 just not every day.\u201d Paul Ainsworth No 6 and Rojano\u2019s, Padstow, Cornwall Nando\u2019s fino pitta \u201cNando\u2019s grilled chicken is super-tasty, consistent and, as I have to watch my weight, healthier than burgers or pizza. Our regular order used to be whole roast chicken with coleslaw, corn and sweet potatoes. Then I discovered this game-changer. I was in Stratford-Upon-Avon filming Great British Menu, went to Nando\u2019s and somehow the fino pitta had never caught my eye before. It\u2019s a next-level, roasted chicken-thigh flatbread with caramelised red onion chutney, grilled halloumi and salad. Now, that\u2019s my treat.\u201d Sat Bains Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham McDonald\u2019s Filet-o-Fish \u201cIn my first year at college, I worked in McDonald\u2019s. I hated it, but it introduced me to Filet-o-Fish. It was a revelation. That contrast between soft, steamed bap, crunchy fried fish, tartare sauce \u2013 and don\u2019t forget it\u2019s got a layer of cheese too \u2013 it was like, shiiiit, man. I don\u2019t have one often but I love \u2019em. My expectations are realistic: I\u2019m not going for a gourmet feast. But nothing else does it for me. When we close at Christmas we buy sausage McMuffins for the staff as a treat. Last year, I had a \u00a3550 white truffle left over and we shaved it over the breakfasts. They loved it. It\u2019s called the McTruffle Shuffle.\u201d Simon Rimmer Greens, Manchester Greggs sausage roll \u201cI don\u2019t have it often but the Gregg\u2019s sausage roll is a joy. It\u2019s greasy, over-seasoned and you know it\u2019s not doing you a scrap of good. Yet there\u2019s something heavenly in that white pepper and heavily minced pork. I haven\u2019t tried the vegan one. Why would you? Don\u2019t get me started on pretend meat in vegan food. As a veggie restaurant owner for 30 years, it drives me insane.\u201d Meriel Armitage Club Mexicana, London Greggs vegan sausage roll \u201cPredictable, I know, but it has changed vegans\u2019 lives. I\u2019ve been vegan for 10 years and cut convenience food out of my life. It didn\u2019t exist. Now I see a Greggs sign like a beacon on the high street. A close second is Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s veg samosa. That\u2019s a motorway service station staple. On the way to and from festivals I\u2019ll eat four!\u201d Jacob Kenedy Bocca di Lupo, London Pret A Manger\u2019s egg mayo sandwich \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of the independents. I am one. But I spend a lot of time going to meetings, hurrying around and, in a rush, you go for the safe, consistent bet and Pret is definitely that. Fresh bread, decent fillings, a bit like sandwiches used to be when made by your schoolfriends\u2019 parents, possibly. Having said that, I\u2019ll go to Pret in a hurry, then spend quite a long time trying to figure out which is the best-looking egg sandwich. I always get it wrong.\u201d Yotam Ottolenghi, Ottolenghi Round Falafel\u2019s wraps \u201cI often go to this Lebanese falafel stand on Parkway in Camden for a falafel salad tray or a wrap with pickles, tahini and chilli sauce. Otherwise, it\u2019s Pizza Express\u2019s rich, unctuous Sloppy Giuseppe. If you\u2019re getting takeout pizza, you might as well get the most decadent.\u201d Nina Matsunaga The Black Bull, Sedbergh, Cumbria Caff\u00e9 Nero\u2019s white chocolate mocha \u201cI\u2019m really bad for high-carb, fatty, deep-fried food. If we\u2019re on the motorway or in an airport \u2013 those moments when you\u2019re not really part of the real world \u2013 I go for fries and iced coffees full of sugar and cream, like McDonald\u2019s caramel iced frapp\u00e9. In winter, it\u2019s Nero\u2019s horribly sugary white chocolate mocha. I\u2019m not sure you can call espresso with white chocolate sauce, milk, whipped cream and chocolate powder a speciality coffee. It sounds great in your head, then you start drinking it and by the end you feel, \u2018Why did I do that?\u2019 \u201d Stuart Ralston Aizle and Noto, Edinburgh Five Guys\u2019 cheeseburger \u201cI used to work at Gordon Ramsay\u2019s The London and since leaving New York, I\u2019ve found most cheeseburgers are terrible. Restaurants make them too \u2018gourmet\u2019 with thick brioche buns and hockey puck-sized patties that you can\u2019t pick up without it falling apart.

A Five Guys\u2019 double cheeseburger with grilled onions, mayo, mustard and ketchup is the closest I\u2019ve come to the real deal.\u201d Chris Leach Manteca, London KFC\u2019s Zinger Tower burger \u201cI rarely get drunk any more but, when I did, my go-to fast food was a KFC Zinger Tower burger: a chicken burger with spicy coating, hash brown, cheese and fiery salsa.

      "body": "<p>Tiger Roll, the winner of the last two Grand Nationals, is 10 days away from resuming light exercise as he builds towards a possible return to Aintree in April. Whether he will make the trip to Liverpool, however, even if he is fit and primed to perfection, is a question for another day.</p> \n<p>Or, more probably, days, weeks and months. Gordon Elliott, who will equal the record for Grand National victories if one of his runners wins on 4 April, said here that \u201cin my mind, it is the race we have been training him for ever since he won it last year\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/cyrname-altior-ascot-end-unbeaten-record-jump-racing\">Cyrname upsets the odds with landmark victory over Altior at Ascot</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And yet it is only a fortnight since Michael O\u2019Leary, owner of the nine-year-old Tiger Roll, suggested the chances of his chaser returning to Aintree for an attempt to join Red Rum as the only three-time National winner were \u201cslim and none\u201d.</p> \n<p>This quote tennis between owner and trainer seems likely to continue into the new year and on towards 11 February, when the weights for this year\u2019s race will be published in Liverpool. Five days later, the Boyne Hurdle at Navan could mark Tiger Roll\u2019s return to action after having a bone chip removed from a joint this month.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe procedure he had went well, and he\u2019s on box-rest until Friday week,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThen the bandage comes off and he\u2019ll start back walking. He\u2019ll do three weeks walking and then all being well, we\u2019ll be back cantering.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was at full fitness and almost ready to run when it happened. It\u2019s not ideal, but if it had happened in January or February, it would be a lot worse. The Boyne Hurdle is where we\u2019d love to go, but if he doesn\u2019t get there there\u2019s a fair chance he could go straight to Cheltenham [in March] for the cross-country race.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe carried 11st 5lb last year. We know he\u2019s going to have top weight, we\u2019re not stupid. Would he have won with 5lb more last year? He probably would, so if he gets 5lb more this year, we\u2019ll be happy.</p> \n<p>\u201cI never second-guess what Michael O\u2019Leary does. Of course you read it [the owner\u2019s comments], it\u2019s your job, but the dream is to get this horse back for the Grand National and to run in it would be awesome and if he could head out to the last circuit with a live chance it would be some atmosphere.\u201dElliott, who saddled 11 runners in last year\u2019s race, said on Wednesday that if the Grand National entries were to be made tomorrow, he would probably have 15 names on the list. \u201cThey\u2019ll all be in the handicap and they will all be entitled to run,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The potential back-ups to Tiger Roll include Borice, this year\u2019s Galway Plate winner, who will make his first start since in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury on Saturday. Jury Duty, the American Grand National winner, and the Cheltenham Festival winners Storyteller and Shattered Love are also under consideration for next year\u2019s race.</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook</h2> \n<p>A couple of last-time-out winners appeal as they try their luck at Taunton. <strong>Manofthemountain (2.15)</strong>, who had experience in an Irish point early last year, is now unbeaten in two tries over fences and seems to have started in that sphere on a very fair mark, judging by wins at Newton Abbot and Southwell.</p> \n<p>A 13-runner field asks more questions but he has Nico de Boinville aboard to help out and there was nothing among the opposition that grabbed me by the throat. He got his rating from two placed efforts over hurdles last winter and has since switched yards, had a wind op and stepped up in distance, so the possible reasons for improvement are legion. He has a half-brother with three wins from higher ratings than the one he has.</p> \n<p><strong>Highway To Success (2.50)</strong> was the nap last week when scoring at 5-1 at Wincanton. Judging by the extraordinary run he put in, he has started in handicaps off a very nice mark and connections are obliged to have another go just seven days later because he can run without a penalty and will be 9lb higher in future.

      "bodyText": "Tiger Roll, the winner of the last two Grand Nationals, is 10 days away from resuming light exercise as he builds towards a possible return to Aintree in April. Whether he will make the trip to Liverpool, however, even if he is fit and primed to perfection, is a question for another day. Or, more probably, days, weeks and months. Gordon Elliott, who will equal the record for Grand National victories if one of his runners wins on 4 April, said here that \u201cin my mind, it is the race we have been training him for ever since he won it last year\u201d. And yet it is only a fortnight since Michael O\u2019Leary, owner of the nine-year-old Tiger Roll, suggested the chances of his chaser returning to Aintree for an attempt to join Red Rum as the only three-time National winner were \u201cslim and none\u201d. This quote tennis between owner and trainer seems likely to continue into the new year and on towards 11 February, when the weights for this year\u2019s race will be published in Liverpool. Five days later, the Boyne Hurdle at Navan could mark Tiger Roll\u2019s return to action after having a bone chip removed from a joint this month. \u201cThe procedure he had went well, and he\u2019s on box-rest until Friday week,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThen the bandage comes off and he\u2019ll start back walking. He\u2019ll do three weeks walking and then all being well, we\u2019ll be back cantering. \u201cHe was at full fitness and almost ready to run when it happened. It\u2019s not ideal, but if it had happened in January or February, it would be a lot worse. The Boyne Hurdle is where we\u2019d love to go, but if he doesn\u2019t get there there\u2019s a fair chance he could go straight to Cheltenham [in March] for the cross-country race. \u201cHe carried 11st 5lb last year. We know he\u2019s going to have top weight, we\u2019re not stupid. Would he have won with 5lb more last year? He probably would, so if he gets 5lb more this year, we\u2019ll be happy. \u201cI never second-guess what Michael O\u2019Leary does. Of course you read it [the owner\u2019s comments], it\u2019s your job, but the dream is to get this horse back for the Grand National and to run in it would be awesome and if he could head out to the last circuit with a live chance it would be some atmosphere.\u201dElliott, who saddled 11 runners in last year\u2019s race, said on Wednesday that if the Grand National entries were to be made tomorrow, he would probably have 15 names on the list. \u201cThey\u2019ll all be in the handicap and they will all be entitled to run,\u201d he said. The potential back-ups to Tiger Roll include Borice, this year\u2019s Galway Plate winner, who will make his first start since in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury on Saturday. Jury Duty, the American Grand National winner, and the Cheltenham Festival winners Storyteller and Shattered Love are also under consideration for next year\u2019s race. Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook A couple of last-time-out winners appeal as they try their luck at Taunton. Manofthemountain (2.15), who had experience in an Irish point early last year, is now unbeaten in two tries over fences and seems to have started in that sphere on a very fair mark, judging by wins at Newton Abbot and Southwell. A 13-runner field asks more questions but he has Nico de Boinville aboard to help out and there was nothing among the opposition that grabbed me by the throat. He got his rating from two placed efforts over hurdles last winter and has since switched yards, had a wind op and stepped up in distance, so the possible reasons for improvement are legion. He has a half-brother with three wins from higher ratings than the one he has. Highway To Success (2.50) was the nap last week when scoring at 5-1 at Wincanton. Judging by the extraordinary run he put in, he has started in handicaps off a very nice mark and connections are obliged to have another go just seven days later because he can run without a penalty and will be 9lb higher in future. These things often run into trouble and he\u2019ll have a big field to weave through but 5-2 is fair enough about Suzi Best\u2019s youngster. Rebecca Curtis could have a good day at Ffos Las, including with Dalaman (2.05), who had some excuses for a fruitless last season with another yard. He\u2019s back down to his last winning mark and the 11-2 appeals against a handful of rivals with no secrets from anyone. At Chelmsford, Muntadab (5.30) is worth a look, having dropped to his lowest rating since scoring at Newmarket 14 months ago. He finished weakly in a couple of soft-ground races last month but this belated return to an all-weather surface could well help and he\u2019s widely available at 9-1, even 12-1 in places.",

      "body": "<p>Last year, the three most streamed artists across the globe on Spotify were all North American rappers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/04/drake-post-malone-and-xxxtentacion-are-most-streamed-artists-of-2018-on-spotify\">Drake, Post Malone and XXX</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/04/drake-post-malone-and-xxxtentacion-are-most-streamed-artists-of-2018-on-spotify\">Tentacion</a> \u2013 the culmination of a decade in which rap became the world\u2019s dominant pop music. It\u2019s a genre now so wide and plural that sweeping statements about it become nonsensical, and so many figures in the last decade have helped move it to its current place in the firmament: the DIY spirit and uncontained impulses of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/05/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-lil-b-curse\"> Lil B</a>; the monolithic repetitive one-bar melodies of Chief Keef; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj\">Nicki Minaj</a>\u2019s weaponising of drama and persona. The scene\u2019s biggest star, Drake, is interestingly both highly influential and heavily influenced.</p> <p>But one rap collective is a case study in how the genre flourished, expanded and culturally dominated this decade, and also functions as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/04/63-up-review-documentary-marvel-makes-all-other-reality-tv-look-trivial\">Seven Up</a>-type social experiment in seeing people grow in real time. Odd Future \u2013 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all\">Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All</a> to give their full name \u2013 emerged as teenagers from Los Angeles in 2008, in a hail of encrusted tube socks and profanity. After a flurry of group mixtapes, its members grew up and amicably became independent of one another, just as groups of teenagers are wont to do. Various artists from their number would go on to release some of the best rap, funk and R&amp;B music of the period \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/05/tyler-the-creator-back-after-uk-ban-funk-reinvention-homophobia-accusations\">Tyler the Creator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/07/earl-sweatshirt-some-rap-songs-review\">Earl Sweatshirt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/30/syd-off-future-backlash-gay-community-hurt-my-feeling\">Syd</a> \u2013 and others, such as Domo Genesis and MellowHype, put out future cult classics. Normalised to the always-on broadcasting of social media and the droll surrealism of meme culture, they carved out new space for rap, becoming the bards of the confessional impulse that gripped our culture from Twitter to reality TV.</p> <p>The first time I saw them live was the first time anyone in the UK had seen them: their first London gig in 2010, in the basement of the Stoke Newington pub where I worked. I let myself downstairs and all I remember is a hail of limbs; everyone on stage seemed to be like one of those flappy inflatable humans you see outside car showrooms. Here and on record, they were being powered by the same batteries that juiced up Jackass, or punk, or anything else that has historically annoyed parents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d680d4d54867e322089adde235d45b43a2da8a3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d680d4d54867e322089adde235d45b43a2da8a3f/0_0_1996_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The bards of the confessional impulse ...

Tyler, the Creator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This energy fed the genius of Tyler, the Creator, the group\u2019s central MC. His early work sounds like it\u2019s coming from a mouth with just the faintest hint of a sly grin curling up at the sides \u2013 he dares you to think he\u2019s being serious. It\u2019s the deadpan cruelty of a kid too advanced for the rest of his class, and even the teacher. As well as playing up, he shows off \u2013 there is a brilliant musicality to his Ren and Stimpy vision of sex on French!, for instance: \u201cI guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber / And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers / Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba / This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp\u201d. Unfortunately for him, Theresa May\u2019s Home Office banned him from the country, a decision that led to feverish excitement on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/us-rapper-tyler-the-creator-back-in-the-uk-after-ban-expires\">his eventual return</a>, and an edge of outlaw danger.</p> <p>The lurid gross-out vibe had previously worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem\">Eminem</a>, who similarly spiked his tracks with comic ultraviolence, and whose whiteness made him that much more relatable (or, depressingly, palatable) to the large white audiences in the US and UK \u2013 no travel ban for him, of course. Odd Future were black, but sat closer to the traditionally white-majority space of skate culture than mainstream rap \u2013 and they were \u201cmoving from middle to upper class\u201d, as Syd would soon rap. The \u201csuper rich kids\u201d Earl Sweatshirt complains of on the Frank Ocean song of the same name are a class above him, but he\u2019s still in their bratty orbit. The glamorous underclass violence and sheer otherness of gangsta rap had been alluring to ogling white audiences, but here was something even more enticing: authentic for being black, accessible for existing in middle-class white spaces, and saying crude, funny, clever things. This blend attracted a cult following, which was swiftly monetised through the kind of hypebeast-streetwear merch (branded Golf Wang, a play on Wolf Gang) that tends to be bought by those with a considerable disposable income. Sure enough, when I next saw Tyler perform, this time in London\u2019s Roundhouse, sat behind me were five white pubescent boys all wearing Supreme caps in different designs. It\u2019s a tension that Odd Future noticed: the cerebral <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/16/earl-sweatshirt-hollywood-parties-deconstructing-herman-hesse-therapy\">Earl Sweatshirt</a> complained of being \u201ctoo black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks\u201d on his track, Chum, while the hornier Tyler fretted on Bastard: \u201cI\u2019m tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck / Drunk white girls the only way I\u2019ll get my dick sucked.\u201d</p> <p>These jaded half-boasts also point to another key part of Odd Future\u2019s appeal: vulnerability. You could probably plot their rugged, slapdash production and fiendishly clever, free-ranging flow in a line with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/wutangclan\">Wu-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/wutangclan\">Tang Clan</a> or MF Doom, but you\u2019d rarely hear those artists be as confessional as Odd Future\u2019s members. There was plenty of hip-hop\u2019s boastfulness, but various other rap cliches were nowhere to be seen, be they luxury brands and cars at one end, or guns on the other. Some filed them alongside the schlocky violence of horrorcore rap, but Tyler rejected this.</p> <p>For years America had focused on its feelings, from expensive therapy to TV shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/26/my-so-called-life-claire-danes-show-that-changed-tv\">My So-Called Life</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/25/dawsons-creek-helped-teen-tv-get-emotional\">Dawson\u2019s Creek</a>, whose plots were driven entirely by remarkably articulate expressions of emotion (and seemed as exotic to Brits as US gangsta rap). Blogging and social media allowed this impulse to flow naturally, and Odd Future came of age during this time when it became normal, even expected, for you to spill your inner life into a public realm. Tyler even used the framing device of a therapy session \u2013 another middle-class trope \u2013 to give structure to his diatribes against his absent father and his new urges.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCbWLSZrZfw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FCbWLSZrZfw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Indeed, daddy issues were a notable theme. Tyler was unrepentant: \u201cFuck a deal, I just want my father\u2019s email / So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\u201d, but Earl was more even-handed: \u201cI just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest / When honestly I miss this nigga\u201d. A later Earl track, Playing Possum, extended an olive branch by poetically weaving speeches by his parents over each other \u2013 tragically, his father died before he could hear it. Earl\u2019s radical emotional transparency is essayed in the very way he raps, his words endlessly rolling over line breaks, the sound of that constant spill. One line sums it up: \u201cSay goodbye to my openness, total eclipse / Of my shine that I\u2019ve grown to miss when holding shit in\u201d \u2013 a paradoxical admission, being candid about staying silent, knowing that his candour is both soothing and the source of his creative \u201cshine\u201d. The rhyme scheme, as ever, has a casual perfection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/syd-the-internet-odd-future-interview-hive-mind\">The Internet\u2019s Syd: \u2018I\u2019m the only person like me that I know\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This frankness, and willingness to explore one\u2019s interior life, extended to sexuality. Rap has often been homophobic, with plenty of use of the other F-word \u2013 one of the buttons that Tyler himself pushed, reasoning that \u201cit hits\u201d \u2013 and as recently as 2017 you had mainstream stars such as Offset claiming he was unaware of the homophobia in his line \u201cI cannot vibe with queers\u201d. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/syd-the-internet-odd-future-interview-hive-mind\">Syd</a>, once Odd Future\u2019s DJ and then a solo artist and member of cosmic funk band the Internet, was out and proud \u2013 it was refreshing to have her bedroom-R&amp;B solo record be so open about lesbian sex. At one point she coos admiringly, with that aforementioned yuppie aspiration, at a woman who \u201cdrive a Beemer and she got it on her own\u201d.</p> <p>Tyler has gone from being accused of homophobia to sort-of coming out with a jokey tweet, dropping in lines such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/25/tyler-the-creator-flower-boy-gay-man-or-queer-baiting-provocateur\">\u201cI\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004\u201d</a> and eventually writing an entire album, Igor, about a love affair with a man. His unwillingness to put a neat bow on his sexuality chimes with a world where, in the UK, 54% of 18 to 24-year-olds say they are not 100% heterosexual, and his playful lack of clarity is testament to the messiness of that journey for many people. It is all uncharted territory for him, indeed for hip-hop; it is impossible to quantify, but it feels as if he is influencing this sexual culture as much as it is influencing him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbbd43833a9014e2dc89ff29095a55b94f65bf60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbbd43833a9014e2dc89ff29095a55b94f65bf60/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking the R&B rules ...

      "bodyText": "Last year, the three most streamed artists across the globe on Spotify were all North American rappers \u2013 Drake, Post Malone and XXXTentacion \u2013 the culmination of a decade in which rap became the world\u2019s dominant pop music. It\u2019s a genre now so wide and plural that sweeping statements about it become nonsensical, and so many figures in the last decade have helped move it to its current place in the firmament: the DIY spirit and uncontained impulses of Lil B; the monolithic repetitive one-bar melodies of Chief Keef; Nicki Minaj\u2019s weaponising of drama and persona. The scene\u2019s biggest star, Drake, is interestingly both highly influential and heavily influenced. But one rap collective is a case study in how the genre flourished, expanded and culturally dominated this decade, and also functions as a Seven Up-type social experiment in seeing people grow in real time. Odd Future \u2013 or Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All to give their full name \u2013 emerged as teenagers from Los Angeles in 2008, in a hail of encrusted tube socks and profanity. After a flurry of group mixtapes, its members grew up and amicably became independent of one another, just as groups of teenagers are wont to do. Various artists from their number would go on to release some of the best rap, funk and R&amp;B music of the period \u2013 Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd \u2013 and others, such as Domo Genesis and MellowHype, put out future cult classics. Normalised to the always-on broadcasting of social media and the droll surrealism of meme culture, they carved out new space for rap, becoming the bards of the confessional impulse that gripped our culture from Twitter to reality TV. The first time I saw them live was the first time anyone in the UK had seen them: their first London gig in 2010, in the basement of the Stoke Newington pub where I worked. I let myself downstairs and all I remember is a hail of limbs; everyone on stage seemed to be like one of those flappy inflatable humans you see outside car showrooms. Here and on record, they were being powered by the same batteries that juiced up Jackass, or punk, or anything else that has historically annoyed parents. This energy fed the genius of Tyler, the Creator, the group\u2019s central MC. His early work sounds like it\u2019s coming from a mouth with just the faintest hint of a sly grin curling up at the sides \u2013 he dares you to think he\u2019s being serious. It\u2019s the deadpan cruelty of a kid too advanced for the rest of his class, and even the teacher. As well as playing up, he shows off \u2013 there is a brilliant musicality to his Ren and Stimpy vision of sex on French!, for instance: \u201cI guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber / And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers / Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba / This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp\u201d. Unfortunately for him, Theresa May\u2019s Home Office banned him from the country, a decision that led to feverish excitement on his eventual return, and an edge of outlaw danger. The lurid gross-out vibe had previously worked for Eminem, who similarly spiked his tracks with comic ultraviolence, and whose whiteness made him that much more relatable (or, depressingly, palatable) to the large white audiences in the US and UK \u2013 no travel ban for him, of course. Odd Future were black, but sat closer to the traditionally white-majority space of skate culture than mainstream rap \u2013 and they were \u201cmoving from middle to upper class\u201d, as Syd would soon rap. The \u201csuper rich kids\u201d Earl Sweatshirt complains of on the Frank Ocean song of the same name are a class above him, but he\u2019s still in their bratty orbit. The glamorous underclass violence and sheer otherness of gangsta rap had been alluring to ogling white audiences, but here was something even more enticing: authentic for being black, accessible for existing in middle-class white spaces, and saying crude, funny, clever things. This blend attracted a cult following, which was swiftly monetised through the kind of hypebeast-streetwear merch (branded Golf Wang, a play on Wolf Gang) that tends to be bought by those with a considerable disposable income. Sure enough, when I next saw Tyler perform, this time in London\u2019s Roundhouse, sat behind me were five white pubescent boys all wearing Supreme caps in different designs. It\u2019s a tension that Odd Future noticed: the cerebral Earl Sweatshirt complained of being \u201ctoo black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks\u201d on his track, Chum, while the hornier Tyler fretted on Bastard: \u201cI\u2019m tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck / Drunk white girls the only way I\u2019ll get my dick sucked.\u201d These jaded half-boasts also point to another key part of Odd Future\u2019s appeal: vulnerability. You could probably plot their rugged, slapdash production and fiendishly clever, free-ranging flow in a line with Wu-Tang Clan or MF Doom, but you\u2019d rarely hear those artists be as confessional as Odd Future\u2019s members. There was plenty of hip-hop\u2019s boastfulness, but various other rap cliches were nowhere to be seen, be they luxury brands and cars at one end, or guns on the other. Some filed them alongside the schlocky violence of horrorcore rap, but Tyler rejected this. For years America had focused on its feelings, from expensive therapy to TV shows such as My So-Called Life and Dawson\u2019s Creek, whose plots were driven entirely by remarkably articulate expressions of emotion (and seemed as exotic to Brits as US gangsta rap). Blogging and social media allowed this impulse to flow naturally, and Odd Future came of age during this time when it became normal, even expected, for you to spill your inner life into a public realm. Tyler even used the framing device of a therapy session \u2013 another middle-class trope \u2013 to give structure to his diatribes against his absent father and his new urges. Indeed, daddy issues were a notable theme. Tyler was unrepentant: \u201cFuck a deal, I just want my father\u2019s email / So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\u201d, but Earl was more even-handed: \u201cI just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest / When honestly I miss this nigga\u201d. A later Earl track, Playing Possum, extended an olive branch by poetically weaving speeches by his parents over each other \u2013 tragically, his father died before he could hear it. Earl\u2019s radical emotional transparency is essayed in the very way he raps, his words endlessly rolling over line breaks, the sound of that constant spill. One line sums it up: \u201cSay goodbye to my openness, total eclipse / Of my shine that I\u2019ve grown to miss when holding shit in\u201d \u2013 a paradoxical admission, being candid about staying silent, knowing that his candour is both soothing and the source of his creative \u201cshine\u201d. The rhyme scheme, as ever, has a casual perfection. This frankness, and willingness to explore one\u2019s interior life, extended to sexuality. Rap has often been homophobic, with plenty of use of the other F-word \u2013 one of the buttons that Tyler himself pushed, reasoning that \u201cit hits\u201d \u2013 and as recently as 2017 you had mainstream stars such as Offset claiming he was unaware of the homophobia in his line \u201cI cannot vibe with queers\u201d. But Syd, once Odd Future\u2019s DJ and then a solo artist and member of cosmic funk band the Internet, was out and proud \u2013 it was refreshing to have her bedroom-R&amp;B solo record be so open about lesbian sex. At one point she coos admiringly, with that aforementioned yuppie aspiration, at a woman who \u201cdrive a Beemer and she got it on her own\u201d. Tyler has gone from being accused of homophobia to sort-of coming out with a jokey tweet, dropping in lines such as \u201cI\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004\u201d and eventually writing an entire album, Igor, about a love affair with a man. His unwillingness to put a neat bow on his sexuality chimes with a world where, in the UK, 54% of 18 to 24-year-olds say they are not 100% heterosexual, and his playful lack of clarity is testament to the messiness of that journey for many people. It is all uncharted territory for him, indeed for hip-hop; it is impossible to quantify, but it feels as if he is influencing this sexual culture as much as it is influencing him. You could say the same for Frank Ocean. Mainstream male R&amp;B can be even more heteronormative than rap, with the likes of Luther Vandross closeted by music that acts as a lubricant for sex in a majority-straight culture; as Ocean himself said in 2012: \u201cIn black music, we\u2019ve got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance\u201d. But Ocean broke the rules, not just for what a male R&amp;B musician could be, but also of the genre itself. Like Tyler, he is part of a generation less inclined to label themselves, never describing himself as gay or bisexual \u2013 \u201clife is dynamic\u201d, he once said \u2013 but singing candidly of love and sex with men. Is this resistance, even subconsciously, borne out of fear of rejection by their audiences? That\u2019s perhaps a reach; more interesting is how that resistance to being boxed in also shapes their music. Ocean is the great poet of modern R&amp;B and Odd Future\u2019s most revered member of all, with his album, Blonde, rightly being canonised as the finest of the decade. Its impressionistic daubs sit outside genre concerns altogether; it is \u201crhythm and blues\u201d in those words\u2019 most pure, literal sense. The album as a whole has a rhythm, is a rhythm; there are blues in the sense of different sadnesses, different shades, from inky midnights to duck-egg mornings, and of course he plays the blues, too.

      "bodyText": "Numerous gunshots have been fired at the Chicago home of Jeff Tweedy, frontman of the Grammy-winning indie rock band Wilco. His wife, Susan Miller Tweedy, detailed the incident in a Facebook post. She reported hearing: \u201cSeven to 10 shots fired at what sounded like right at our house \u2026 A bullet went through the storm door to our balcony and lodged in the wooden door.\u201d She added that Jeff found seven bullet casings outside their home. There were no reported injuries from the incident, which took place early on Tuesday morning and was reported to Chicago police by numerous people in the Irving Park neighbourhood. Tweedy\u2019s son Spencer told local radio that he did not believe his family were deliberately targeted. Gun crime is a serious problem in Chicago. On one weekend in early August, seven people were shot dead and 46 wounded, leading mayor Lori Lightfoot to say: \u201cAs a city, we have to stand up and do a hell of a lot more than we\u2019ve done in a very long time.\u201d A month later, seven people were killed and 34 wounded over the Labor Day weekend; in October, three were killed and 21 wounded in another single weekend. Earlier this month, Chicago police reported that murders were down 11% and shootings 10% during the first 10 months of 2019, compared with the same period in 2018.",

The Labour party leader insisted he would take the same anti-austerity message to all parts of the country at his \u201cplan for nature\u201d launch in Southampton.

Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country.\u201d But the Guardian understands that after beginning the campaign with a resolutely offensive strategy, the party recognises that it now has much more to do to hold constituencies in Brexit-voting areas. It plans to hammer home the benefits of a pared-down set of its manifesto commitments that will put money directly in the pockets of voters in these constituencies. Labour strategists also say they will focus relentlessly on the risk of returning Boris Johnson to No 10 for five years, and seek to make the election a binary choice between Labour and the Tories in the hope of squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote further. Even before Wednesday evening\u2019s YouGov projection, which gave Boris Johnson a 68-seat majority and predicted Labour would lose 44 seats, party strategists were concerned about the imperative of appealing to leave supporters. They point out that even in the 2017 general election, the six seats Labour lost were all in leave areas; and, even in those they held, the increase in Labour\u2019s vote share was significantly lower than elsewhere. The YouGov projection, which showed the Lib Dems failing to make inroads in many of the seats Labour is targeting, has strengthened the hand of those who have been making that argument internally. These include the \u201cfour Ms\u201d \u2013 Seumas Milne, Andrew Murray, Len McCluskey and Karie Murphy, Labour sources suggested. It was McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who warned against expanding freedom of movement, as some Labour activists had hoped to. In traditional Labour heartlands the reaction among candidates to a new focus on their constituencies was mixed. Great Grimsby candidate Melanie Onn said she had not had a single visit arranged centrally to help her defend her 2,565-majority in her heavily leave-voting seat, so was surprised to hear about a shift in focus to the north of England and Midlands. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to wait and see what this refocus is, I\u2019m not really sure what it means,\u201d she said. The shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, appears to be acting as a bridge between Corbyn, his shadow cabinet and those candidates in northern and Midland constituencies with a leave majority. As well as helping Onn launch her campaign he has also visited Stoke, which voted 72% leave, for a joint event in support of Labour candidates there. Sonya Ward, who is trying to take back the traditional Labour heartland seat of Mansfield from Tory Ben Bradley, said she had been frequently visited by the shadow cabinet \u2013 including Corbyn. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty well supported to be honest.\u201d One Labour source in a heartland seat said: \u201cI think they have seen the polls, after ignoring the polls for a long time.

To be honest I think they\u2019ve realised a little bit too late that they\u2019ve been more interested in trying to save Emily Thornberry\u2019s seat in Islington than Labour heartlands.\u201d Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman, defending Huddersfield, which voted 51% leave in the referendum, said he would welcome more support for his colleagues in Yorkshire. While he has a healthy 12,000-majority, some female politicians elsewhere in the region risk losing their seats. The Tories are predicted to pick up three seats in South Yorkshire, including Don Valley, Penistone and Stocksbridge and Rother Valley, and four in West Yorkshire including Dewsbury, Keighley and Wakefield.

Headline emphasis is often placed on issues such as single-use plastics or band travel by air. Important as those things are, <a href=\"http://www.powerful-thinking.org.uk/resources/the-show-must-go-on-report/\" title=\"\">evidence shows</a> that factors such as audience transportation and venue power account for as much as 93% of all the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions generated by major music events.</p> <p>As a band that has toured globally for several years, we\u2019ve had cause to reflect on this. Concerns over our own carbon impact and those of our wider industry aren\u2019t new to us, but the urgency is. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" title=\"\">UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> called for \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d and said carbon emissions were harmful, regardless of the fun had in their generation. In other words, what goes on tour doesn\u2019t stay on tour.</p> <p>We\u2019ve taken unilateral steps for nearly two decades \u2013 like many bands, we\u2019ve paid to have trees planted, prohibited the use of single-use plastics and travelled by train wherever feasible. We have explored advanced carbon offset models, but in researching these programmes serious issues arose.</p> <p>First, the concept of offsetting creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others \u2013 generally those in the poorer nations in the southern hemisphere. Evidence suggests that offset programmes can wreak serious havoc for the often voiceless indigenous and rural communities who have done the least to create the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a31d4695d8b49b5e84ce9d5248ad840810dc89b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a31d4695d8b49b5e84ce9d5248ad840810dc89b9/0_168_5007_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glastonbury festival 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glastonbury festival 2019: \u2018Audience transportation and venue power account for as much as 93% of all the CO2 emissions generated by major music events.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, carbon offsetting transfers emissions from one place to another rather than reducing them. The <a href=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2018/11/15/end-the-cdm/\" title=\"\">European commission has warned</a> that 85% of projects were unlikely to deliver \u201creal\u201d or \u201cmeasurable\u201d reductions, while the <a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/carbon-offsets-are-not-our-get-out-jail-free-card\" title=\"\">UN environment programme</a> recently stated that offsetting cannot be used by polluters \u201cas a free pass for inaction\u201d. </p> <p>We\u2019ve also discussed ending touring altogether \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50490700\" title=\"\">important option</a> that deserves consideration. In reality, however, an entire international roster of acts would need to stop touring to achieve the required impact.

      "bodyText": "The imprinting of climate emergency into the public consciousness, achieved by the school strikes and mass activist arrests, seems to have generated more introspection than positive action. The debate around personal sacrifice, hypocrisy and lifestyle change is playing at high volume and, as recently highlighted by the climate expert Michael Mann, this presents a danger that popular demand for catastrophe-avoiding systemic change could get lost in the mix. This debate is just as alive (and equally confused) within the music industry. Headline emphasis is often placed on issues such as single-use plastics or band travel by air. Important as those things are, evidence shows that factors such as audience transportation and venue power account for as much as 93% of all the CO2 emissions generated by major music events. As a band that has toured globally for several years, we\u2019ve had cause to reflect on this. Concerns over our own carbon impact and those of our wider industry aren\u2019t new to us, but the urgency is. Last year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d and said carbon emissions were harmful, regardless of the fun had in their generation. In other words, what goes on tour doesn\u2019t stay on tour. We\u2019ve taken unilateral steps for nearly two decades \u2013 like many bands, we\u2019ve paid to have trees planted, prohibited the use of single-use plastics and travelled by train wherever feasible. We have explored advanced carbon offset models, but in researching these programmes serious issues arose. First, the concept of offsetting creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others \u2013 generally those in the poorer nations in the southern hemisphere. Evidence suggests that offset programmes can wreak serious havoc for the often voiceless indigenous and rural communities who have done the least to create the problem. Ultimately, carbon offsetting transfers emissions from one place to another rather than reducing them. The European commission has warned that 85% of projects were unlikely to deliver \u201creal\u201d or \u201cmeasurable\u201d reductions, while the UN environment programme recently stated that offsetting cannot be used by polluters \u201cas a free pass for inaction\u201d. We\u2019ve also discussed ending touring altogether \u2013 an important option that deserves consideration. In reality, however, an entire international roster of acts would need to stop touring to achieve the required impact. In a major employment industry with hundreds of acts, this isn\u2019t about to happen. Any unilateral actions we take now would prove futile unless our industry moves together, and to create systemic change there is no real alternative to collective action. So today we\u2019re announcing the commissioning of the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to map the full carbon footprint of typical tour cycles, and to look specifically at the three key areas where CO2 emissions in our sector are generated: band travel and production, audience transport and venue. The resulting roadmap to decarbonisation will be shared with other touring acts, promoters and festival/venue owners to assist swift and significant emissions reductions. The stark reality is that failure to do so could mean matters are taken out of our hands. In recent months, (thanks in no small part to those strikes and those arrests) 245 local authorities across the UK have declared a climate emergency, with 149 setting targets of zero emissions by 2030 or earlier. In the festival sector alone, this number includes the licensing authorities for each of the five best-attended UK outdoor events: Glastonbury, Download, Reading/Leeds, V Festivals and Creamfields. Their event plans will now inevitably include mandatory rules on carbon emissions, and so the likelihood of licences being granted without emissions being dramatically and continually reduced is slim. Given the current polarised social atmosphere, uplifting and unifying cultural events are arguably more important now than ever, and no one would want to see them postponed or even cancelled. The challenge therefore is to avoid more pledges, promises and greenwashing headlines and instead embrace seismic change. The report produced by the Tyndall Centre will not provide a panacea, and we know implementation of its findings will require significant change for us and our colleagues across the industry who are as keen as we are to create change.

      "body": "<p>Rayden Overbay winced and arched his back as the boy unloaded punches on him. He stumbled backward against the bathroom stalls looking for some escape, but there were attackers on every side. And behind them onlookers, half a dozen at least, some of them holding up cell phones fixed on an autistic, partially deaf 12-year-old getting the beating of his life. Rayden went home that day with a black eye, a busted lip, a bloody nose and a concussion.</p> <p>Less than 24 hours later, professional mixed martial artist Justin Wren sat at his kitchen table watching the video, which had been posted to social media by one of the kids who shot it. It was like finding a long-lost home movie in the attic.</p> <p>\u201cI know how that feels,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThat was me.\u201d</p> <p>At Rayden\u2019s age, Wren had been attacked in the locker room by a bully who had terrorized him for years. He\u2019d been blindsided with the violent crack of a football helmet to the back of his head. It left an egg the size of a baseball and planted a seedling of doubt that his life might not be worth living anymore.</p> <p>\u201cI remember people laughing at me,\u201d Wren told the Guardian. \u201cNo one spoke up or stepped in. I remember the bully walking away. Nothing happened to him. Just like Rayden.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/27/rams-revival-and-the-ongoing-struggle-against-mmas-far-right-fight-clubs\">RAM\u2019s revival and the ongoing struggle against MMA's far-right fight clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a reason an acquaintance sent the video to Wren \u2013 and not because they wanted the former UFC fighter to show Rayden some moves to defend himself. Wren is actually in the business of fighting <em>for</em> people. He started the Fight for the Forgotten foundation in 2011 at the age of 24 to combat the plight of the Mbuti Pygmies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who were enslaved and even cannibalized by rival tribes. Today, Fight for the Forgotten has raised over a million dollars, funding 62 clean water wells and the purchase of 3,015 acres of land for dozens of displaced Pygmy tribes in multiple countries.</p> <p>In 2014, Wren began fighting for Bellator MMA, using his platform for the Pygmies and donating his purses to the cause. But his humanitarian work has put a strain on his health. He\u2019s survived black water fever, dengue fever and malaria three times, but has had physical complications ever since. Three years ago, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He still has nightmares of sickly infants dying in his arms.</p> <p>Still, Wren\u2019s sense of justice remains. As he watched Rayden\u2019s video in astonishment, he realized he could be that person he wished he\u2019d had as a kid for Rayden.</p> <p>Two days after Rayden\u2019s attack, he and his family were eating dinner with Wren at his office 20 minutes away from the boy\u2019s Oklahoma school. They had Chick-fil-A, a treat for the family, who live in a trailer park. Rayden\u2019s father, Danny, works as a manager at a fast food restaurant, and money has been so tight that the boys have lived with their grandparents in another trailer down the row for the last year.</p> <p>Rayden has been bullied by his classmates since the age of nine, but the last year had been especially trying for the seventh grader when he gained 110lbs from his diabetes medication and began wearing a hearing aid. When school officials found Rayden after the bathroom incident, he\u2019d scribbled \u201cI WANT TO KILL MYSELF\u201d down the length of his forearm with a marker. Wren had contemplated suicide in his teens before he transferred schools, took up wrestling and became a national champion.</p> <p>\u201cRayden, it\u2019s OK to not be OK, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay this way,\u201d Wren told Rayden as they ate together that first time. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me, I want to be your friend.\u201d</p> <p>The hashtag #StandWithRayden quickly gained traction on social media and Wren encouraged followers to send Rayden video messages so he knew he was not alone. The MMA community came out in force, as did pro wrestlers such as WWE legend Mick Foley. Other celebrities, including Terry Crews and Sarah Silverman, would follow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5I_eQSBwO1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We wanted to document the adventure for Rayden and his family to always remember him first being surrounded with support and his heart invaded by love. When I met Rayden he was traumatized, and I had to tell him, \u201churt people - hurt people.\u201d But people who have been thru it, who have overcome, who have seen love win. We are loved people who love people. It\u2019s okay to not be okay, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. I\u2019m so grateful for the army that had shown up to help us in our vision to #DefeatHateWithLOVE and our mission to #knockoutbullying worldwide. Let\u2019s keep the hope train full steam ahead! Stay tuned to the rest of our adventure. Also, be sending love to the school and even or especially the people who acted out in bullying. I don\u2019t believe that is their identity, it doesn\u2019t define them, and just like Rayden having a turn around and transformation story that is our hope for them! We are here to help them too. Rayden\u2019s parents forgive the CHILDREN that acted out. Let\u2019s not get lost in this and focus on that... They need love and support too. Let\u2019s send our love, prayers, and keep them in our thoughts too, please. That is Rayden\u2019s wish, his parents hope, and my mission too. Let\u2019s put love and compassion in ACTION for everyone involved. One good thing I know, and I won\u2019t speak details of minors (and I only know a little) is that the family asked instead of hefty fines (they are being held accountable) let\u2019s lower the fines a bit and increase community service so that they know what its like to help in the community, serve, and find out that no act of kindness ever goes wasted. This is going to be a redemption story... Not only for Rayden, but hopefully those involved and the school in general. This is making waves and having ripple effects all over the world. I\u2019m so grateful for that! Let\u2019s minimize the negative and focus and fan the flames of the positive.

      "bodyText": "Rayden Overbay winced and arched his back as the boy unloaded punches on him. He stumbled backward against the bathroom stalls looking for some escape, but there were attackers on every side. And behind them onlookers, half a dozen at least, some of them holding up cell phones fixed on an autistic, partially deaf 12-year-old getting the beating of his life. Rayden went home that day with a black eye, a busted lip, a bloody nose and a concussion. Less than 24 hours later, professional mixed martial artist Justin Wren sat at his kitchen table watching the video, which had been posted to social media by one of the kids who shot it. It was like finding a long-lost home movie in the attic. \u201cI know how that feels,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThat was me.\u201d At Rayden\u2019s age, Wren had been attacked in the locker room by a bully who had terrorized him for years. He\u2019d been blindsided with the violent crack of a football helmet to the back of his head. It left an egg the size of a baseball and planted a seedling of doubt that his life might not be worth living anymore. \u201cI remember people laughing at me,\u201d Wren told the Guardian. \u201cNo one spoke up or stepped in. I remember the bully walking away. Nothing happened to him. Just like Rayden.\u201d There was a reason an acquaintance sent the video to Wren \u2013 and not because they wanted the former UFC fighter to show Rayden some moves to defend himself. Wren is actually in the business of fighting for people. He started the Fight for the Forgotten foundation in 2011 at the age of 24 to combat the plight of the Mbuti Pygmies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who were enslaved and even cannibalized by rival tribes. Today, Fight for the Forgotten has raised over a million dollars, funding 62 clean water wells and the purchase of 3,015 acres of land for dozens of displaced Pygmy tribes in multiple countries. In 2014, Wren began fighting for Bellator MMA, using his platform for the Pygmies and donating his purses to the cause. But his humanitarian work has put a strain on his health. He\u2019s survived black water fever, dengue fever and malaria three times, but has had physical complications ever since. Three years ago, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He still has nightmares of sickly infants dying in his arms. Still, Wren\u2019s sense of justice remains. As he watched Rayden\u2019s video in astonishment, he realized he could be that person he wished he\u2019d had as a kid for Rayden. Two days after Rayden\u2019s attack, he and his family were eating dinner with Wren at his office 20 minutes away from the boy\u2019s Oklahoma school. They had Chick-fil-A, a treat for the family, who live in a trailer park. Rayden\u2019s father, Danny, works as a manager at a fast food restaurant, and money has been so tight that the boys have lived with their grandparents in another trailer down the row for the last year. Rayden has been bullied by his classmates since the age of nine, but the last year had been especially trying for the seventh grader when he gained 110lbs from his diabetes medication and began wearing a hearing aid. When school officials found Rayden after the bathroom incident, he\u2019d scribbled \u201cI WANT TO KILL MYSELF\u201d down the length of his forearm with a marker. Wren had contemplated suicide in his teens before he transferred schools, took up wrestling and became a national champion. \u201cRayden, it\u2019s OK to not be OK, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay this way,\u201d Wren told Rayden as they ate together that first time. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me, I want to be your friend.\u201d The hashtag #StandWithRayden quickly gained traction on social media and Wren encouraged followers to send Rayden video messages so he knew he was not alone. The MMA community came out in force, as did pro wrestlers such as WWE legend Mick Foley. Other celebrities, including Terry Crews and Sarah Silverman, would follow. The next week, Rayden watched from the sidelines as the University of Oklahoma football team inched out Iowa State 42-41. Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts gave Rayden a stern message as he signed the game ball for him afterward. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone bothering you, talking to you, just let me know,\u201d Hurts said, glancing up into Rayden\u2019s eyes. Hurts waved his arm across the locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole squad behind you now.\u201d That Monday, the bullying video had over 10m views. #StandWithRayden had rippled outside the sports community into Hollywood.

He actually said \u201cno government \u2013 and certainly no Labour government\u201d would have the courage to make such a cut. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "One Nation has shocked the government by voting with Labor, the Greens and Jacqui Lambie to reject the Coalition\u2019s bill to broaden the grounds to deregister unions and disqualify their officials. Despite voting with the Coalition on One Nation, Centre Alliance and government amendments, Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts then crossed the floor to vote the so-called Ensuring Integrity bill down. Due to a tied 34 to 34 vote, the bill was negatived. The vote was a major win for unions, which had been furiously lobbying the Senate crossbench not to pass the bill, warning that industrial action, including campaigns for nurse-to-patient ratios, could trigger deregistration under the draconian new laws. Attorney general Christian Porter said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the result and suggested the government may reintroduce bill \u2013 but the Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O\u2019Neil confidently predicted it would be \u201chumiliated\u201d if it did. In a statement Hanson said despite amendments \u201cthere was a quantity of non-amendable changes that prevented our full support\u201d, including powers for court-appointed administrators to take over the functions of a union. At a press conference, Hanson and Roberts cited inaction on corporate crime including the differential penalties for the 23m alleged breaches of anti-money laundering provisions by Westpac as another reason. ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said that the message from the vote was \u201cdon\u2019t mess with working people\u201d and that people \u201cdon\u2019t like double standards\u201d on legal breaches by unions, companies or politicians. Both O\u2019Neil and Hanson ruled out any quid pro quos in return for One Nation support, with Hanson insisting she would \u201cnever base [her] vote on that\u201d. Despite recounting stories of workers calling her office in tears to thank her for blocking the bill, Hanson warned the Senate debate was a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d of unions, reserving the right to vote it through in future if unions did not stop behaviour she characterised as \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d. If the government reintroduces the bill, Hanson said she will \u201cassess it at the time\u201d and her vote is \u201cnot guaranteed the next time\u201d. Earlier in the week, Hanson had twice warned One Nation would not be rushed on the bill, and twice said the government could not take its votes for granted. But despite never publicly committing to vote one way or the other, One Nation\u2019s contributions in Senate debate and backroom negotiations had led the government to believe passage of the bill was an inevitability. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The attorney general Christian Porter agreed to joint amendments with Centre Alliance and a separate set from One Nation, which created a demerit point system and required an actual penalty to have been imposed by a court, rather than just a finding of wrongdoing. On Wednesday senator Malcolm Roberts told the Senate that One Nation would not stand for \u201cunion-bashing\u201d or a bill that allowed deregistration for misdemeanours like late paperwork \u2013 which was still allowed by the bill, if unions breached rules three times. Roberts went on to lash \u201crogue\u201d union officials who he said \u201cmust \u2026 be held to account\u201d and noted that One Nation\u2019s \u201cpositive improvements\u201d to the bill had been accepted. Earlier on Thursday, Anthony Albanese refused to comment on the hypothetical of what Labor would do if the bill passed. Lambie \u2013 who had said that if militant construction unionist John Setka did not stand aside the bill would pass \u2013 nevertheless sought to amend it and then ultimately opposed the bill. Her amendments would have required a review after 12 months and excluded \u201ca failure or refusal by the person to attend for work\u201d from the list of breaches that could trigger deregistration. These amendments were voted down, although both One Nation and Centre Alliance amendments were accepted before the ultimate defeat.

Patrick told the Senate the amended bill was not a \u201cunion-busting\u201d law, accusing unions of \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cfear-mongering\u201d claims. Patrick claimed that only \u201csystematic conduct\u201d was targeted, so three \u201cmistakes\u201d by a union breaching separate and unrelated provisions would not trigger deregistration.",

It is clear, though, that most want him to stay. \u201cThe really remarkable thing is how he has brought our community together,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Halloran Gesmundo, who works as a nail stylist in Reading. \u201cIt is just so amazing when you are out taking pictures and other people come along and you strike up a friendly conversation and help each other with pictures.\u201d O\u2019Halloran Gesmundo, who described Limpy as a \u201cquirky turkey\u201d, recently held a Nail Bar Party, donating 25% of sales to a charity called Understanding Disabilities. She said Limpy has provided her with uplifting moments during a difficult time. \u201cMy mom passed away earlier this year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was reflecting that when I\u2019m really missing her I tend to take a break and go find Limpy, because he always makes me laugh at his antics, and always puts me in a good mood. \u201cHe lifts your spirits. He is a beautiful bird.\u201d",

Thugs like <strong>John Setka</strong> should not be allowed to hold office in their union. He has to go. I\u2019ve always said he has to go. I said I\u2019d vote for a bill that would get rid of John Setka and put the CFMEU on notice. The government didn\u2019t want to work with me to get the bill to that final form.</p> <p>If the government really wanted to get rid of Setka they wouldn\u2019t have drafted the bill like this. They would have backed amendments that would have lined him up and taken him down. They would have supported my amendments. They had the chance to. But they didn\u2019t because they were too cocky that they\u2019d get their win without me. Well, guess what. Look where that gets you. </p> <p>Let me be crystal clear \u2013 the decision to not get rid of John Setka wasn\u2019t mine. It was the government who decided to let him off with a warning. </p> <p>The government amendments would have left him there with a clean slate and a blemish-free record. They would have given him a 10-year window to just play nice and go with grace. </p> <p>That\u2019s not something I am going to abide by.</p> <p>And without my amendments, I had to decide whether to support a bill that both <em>wouldn\u2019t </em>remove Setka and <em>would </em>throw every other well-behaved union under the bus. </p> <p>I had to make a call whether to support a bill that makes out like teachers, nurses and fireys are as bad as the CFMEU. It puts the bloody Musicians\u2019 Union of Australia in the same camp as the ETU for goodness sake! There\u2019s no need to put everyone in the firing line.</p> <p>My amendments would have applied serious penalties to serious conduct. The bad guys would have been taken out. But the good guys would be spared.</p> <p>I gave the government the chance to support amendments that protect good unionists and line up bad ones. They said no, we\u2019ll go it alone, and they lost. Now there\u2019s nothing. And thanks to the Coalition\u2019s bloody-minded arrogance, they have nothing to show for their work.</p> <p>Criminal officials bring their union into disrepute. These people don\u2019t deserve to have a leadership role in a union. By being there, they undermine the union movement and they actually hurt union members. </p> <p>I\u2019m the only person in this place who had proposed realistic solutions to address these problems. </p> <p>I gave the government a chance.

Here is an excerpt of the referral:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are two significant concerns that arise as a result of this. This first is that Commissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues. Given this, it was highly inappropriate for Commissioner Fuller to be disclosing any details of the police investigation into Mr Taylor to Prime Minister Morrison other than those that were on the public record. It goes without saying that Prime Minister Morrison has a vested political interest in the police investigation failing to find any misconduct by his Minister.</p> <p>The second significant concern arises from the personal relationship between Commissioner Fuller and Prime Minister Morrison and the fact that this relationship constitutes a clear conflict of interest on the part of Commissioner Fuller. This relationship includes, according to Commissioner Fuller, having been neighbours during which time Morrison would collect his rubbish bins for him. The exact nature of this relationship now appears to be contested by the two men in their very recent public debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shoebridge said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No one, not the prime minister and not the police commissioner, is above the law and people in high office are expected to abide by high standards.</p> <p>We have referred this matter to the LECC because it is a genuinely independent and non-partisan body that\u2019s job is to investigate these kinds of matters.</p> <p>We cannot allow any political interference in a police investigation and both the police commissioner and the prime minister should have known better.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T05:22:58.832Z\">at 5.22am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddf50dd8f08dcf251b4a7f4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T05:06:12.040Z\">5.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">David Shoebridge refers NSW police commissioner to integrity commission</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our colleague <strong>Naaman Zhou</strong> has just spoken to <strong>David Shoebridge</strong>, who says he has referred Mick Fuller to the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission over the phone call with <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> regarding the <strong>Angus Taylor </strong>investigation.</p> <p>Shoebridge is referring Fuller under section 10 of the LECC Act for serious misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cCommissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues.

Mr Speaker, that letter which I authorised was provided to the House and it was tabled here by the attorney general to ensure the House was immediately informed of the necessary correction that had to be made.</p> <p>...

He doesn\u2019t hold serious press conferences too often. </p> <p>Today he actually put in a request for a pair \u2013 at 9:32 \u2013 to avoid going in and voting on it, something that was withdrawn some 10 minutes later. </p> <p>For reasons that are beyond anyone\u2019s comprehension ... Well, he can\u2019t continue to duck and weave. He has to be held to account.

The letter to the clerk provision is for when parliament is not in session. </p> <p>This morning the prime minister was prepared to enter the parliament to vote in gagging this debate, but wasn\u2019t prepared to take that opportunity to correct the record and to treat the parliament with the respect that it deserves. </p> <p>This mob say that they are conservatives. But the truth is they have shut down debate on 20 occasions this week.</p> <p>They are not prepared to allow for a proper debate about the actions of an embattled minister, which arose from him being too smart by half, sending a letter on his letterhead, with his signature, to attack <strong>Clover Moore</strong> and her position on climate change. </p> <p>That\u2019s why this has arisen. This was raised more than 80 days ago. For 80 days this minister has refused to say where the document came from. Because we know it isn\u2019t what he told the parliament. </p> <p>We know it wasn\u2019t downloaded from the City of Sydney website. And instead of him doing the right thing, fessing up early on, he\u2019s just dug in and dug in and dug in, and sunk deeper and deeper. </p> <p>We have a prime minister whose depth is a mile wide but an inch deep. He is incapable of acting in the national interests. </p> <p>So, instead of standing aside the minister under section 7.1 of the ministerial code, he has continued to dig in, made a phone call, which on any assessment he then went into the parliament and said he\u2019d discussed the substance of an investigation with the New South Wales police commissioner. </p> <p>And yesterday implied in parliament again that not everyone has all the facts about that matter \u2013 this matter \u2013 and implied he had more facts about the investigation than what has been publicly released, in spite of the fact that the New South Wales police, as is normal practice, issued an immediate release about Strike Force Garrad and said they wouldn\u2019t be making any further comment. </p> <p>So we have a minister who\u2019s embattled, we have a prime minister who has intervened directly by making that phone call into the investigation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T01:01:55.693Z\">at 1.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ddf18dd8f087410d9874151\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-28T00:48:00.626Z\">12.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Senate seems excited to be talking about something other than the ensuring integrity bill.</p> <p>It\u2019s moved on to its housekeeping section.

The prime minister was forced to correct the record after attributing a 2GB Sydney radio host <strong>Ben Fordham</strong> quote to Victorian police during question time yesterday.</p> <p>Morrison had said that a Victorian detective had said Julia Gillard \u201cis under investigation by police, this is a fact\u201d in 2013 as part of a defence arguing that Labor ministers had not stepped aside during police investigations. But after reporting from the Australian, which showed the quote was actually from Fordham talking about the issue during a radio broadcast, Morrison was forced to write to the Speaker and admit his mistake.</p> <p>Labor is not letting it go. The government is still trying to talk about the economy but it has lost the entire week to this, with each press conference and question time taken up with defending Taylor.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s judgment, in making a phone call to NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>,<strong> </strong>about the investigation has also pulled the prime minister into the saga. Both Fuller and Morrison say there was nothing untoward about the call, and that Morrison had received information which was already available in the public domain. But a political leader calling a police commissioner about an investigation into one of his MPs is not a great look, and the defence \u2013 I told you I was going to do it \u2013 isn\u2019t helping matters.</p> <p>Labor wants the phone call documents. That\u2019ll drag on throughout today.</p> <p>There are also the negotiations over medevac. Jacqui Lambie said she would vote for the repeal on one condition but won\u2019t say what the condition is. The government knows but the public doesn\u2019t. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/lambie-wants-third-country-settlement-deal-in-return-for-medevac-repeal-20191127-p53epe.html\">Nine newspapers are reporting it is the government accepting the New Zealand offer </a>to resettle some of the Manus Island and Nauru asylum seekers. We couldn\u2019t confirm that yesterday, with nothing ruled in or out. </p> <p>We\u2019ll have all of the ongoing shenanigans and whatever else happens in this increasingly insane place. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>,<strong> Katharine Murphy</strong>,<strong> Sarah Martin </strong>and<strong> Paul Karp </strong>are with you. I\u2019ve had three coffees and am looking for my fourth.</p> <p>Ready?</p> <p>Let\u2019s get into it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-27T21:43:39.530Z\">at 9.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Because even if you don\u2019t drink, you\u2019d probably want to take it up after those last few days. A week is a long time in politics and next week the government could be in a completely different position. But for right now, Labor MPs return back to their electorates secure they have had a small win. They\u2019ll all be back on Monday though, with medevac the big legislative ticket item. The Angus Taylor issue will still be ticking over. As will the fallout from One Nation\u2019s last minute switch on IR. Make sure you check back on the Guardian for the latest on all of that over the next few days \u2013 you\u2019ll have all the news and analysis you would need until the blog is back for the final sitting week on Monday. Sadly, I will not be with you. I have been called away on personal business, meaning I will miss the final week. It\u2019s not goodbye though \u2013 I\u2019ll be back on the blog in February when parliament returns for 2020. Let me just say though this year, it has been an absolute pleasure and honour to steer the politics live ship. You guys make turning up to work a dream. As do the entire Canberra team \u2013 Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp \u2013 and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I am truly sorry I miss the final week of 2019 batshit insanity, but I will be with you in spirit. And I know that Chris Knaus will take very good care of you all for the final four sitting days. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday period and summer. I hope your Christmas, if that\u2019s your thing, is full of love and laughter. I hope you get time doing the things and seeing the people who make you shine. You can find me on the socials if you need to send me any missives. Thank you for a wonderful year. And please \u2013 take care of you. \u201cScott Morrison has been a marketing man, not a governor,\u201d says Malcolm Roberts. He wants the government to \u201cstart governing\u201d. Jacqui Lambie has now released a statement on ensuring integrity: I\u2019ve been very clear from the start. Thugs like John Setka should not be allowed to hold office in their union. He has to go. I\u2019ve always said he has to go. I said I\u2019d vote for a bill that would get rid of John Setka and put the CFMEU on notice. The government didn\u2019t want to work with me to get the bill to that final form. If the government really wanted to get rid of Setka they wouldn\u2019t have drafted the bill like this. They would have backed amendments that would have lined him up and taken him down. They would have supported my amendments. They had the chance to. But they didn\u2019t because they were too cocky that they\u2019d get their win without me. Well, guess what. Look where that gets you. Let me be crystal clear \u2013 the decision to not get rid of John Setka wasn\u2019t mine. It was the government who decided to let him off with a warning. The government amendments would have left him there with a clean slate and a blemish-free record. They would have given him a 10-year window to just play nice and go with grace. That\u2019s not something I am going to abide by. And without my amendments, I had to decide whether to support a bill that both wouldn\u2019t remove Setka and would throw every other well-behaved union under the bus. I had to make a call whether to support a bill that makes out like teachers, nurses and fireys are as bad as the CFMEU. It puts the bloody Musicians\u2019 Union of Australia in the same camp as the ETU for goodness sake! There\u2019s no need to put everyone in the firing line. My amendments would have applied serious penalties to serious conduct. The bad guys would have been taken out. But the good guys would be spared. I gave the government the chance to support amendments that protect good unionists and line up bad ones. They said no, we\u2019ll go it alone, and they lost. Now there\u2019s nothing. And thanks to the Coalition\u2019s bloody-minded arrogance, they have nothing to show for their work. Criminal officials bring their union into disrepute. These people don\u2019t deserve to have a leadership role in a union. By being there, they undermine the union movement and they actually hurt union members. I\u2019m the only person in this place who had proposed realistic solutions to address these problems. I gave the government a chance. I put together amendments that hit the worst offenders and spared the overwhelming majority of union members and officials who aren\u2019t big bloody thugs. They said no. They didn\u2019t want to bother. They lost out. Finally, I have a message to the broader union movement that I stood up for today \u2013 it\u2019s time they cleaned house! \u201cMy vote and my opinion will never be based on that...no way in the wide world,\u201d Pauline Hanson says, when asked if this was about the upcoming Queensland election. \u201cIf you think that, then you don\u2019t know this lady,\u201d Malcolm Roberts says. Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts are holding a press conference. She says it is all about the workers. \u201cEspecially this week, when Westpac had 23m breaches...and Scott Morrison said \u2018this is not for us to deal with\u2019...it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d \u201cI just feel that it is not fair on the Australian people. This is a warning shot across the bows of the unions and the Australian government.\u201d Hanson says the unions need to \u201cclean up your act\u201d. And the government: \u201cClean up the white collar crime, go after the banking officials and prove to the people of Australia that you are here for everyone.\u201d Tony Burke has issued a statement: Scott Morrison\u2019s anti-worker union-bashing laws have been defeated in the Senate \u2013 and should now be abandoned. These were extreme laws that would have given the government unprecedented powers, unparalleled anywhere in the developed world, to sack union officials and shut down entire unions for minor breaches. The government arrogantly believed they had this vote in the bag \u2013 but the Senate has delivered them a humiliating rejection. This was a week in which Scott Morrison sought to impose standards on unions that he refused to impose on banks or members of his own Cabinet. Throughout this debate, Labor has been proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Australian workers and the unions that represent them. From the largest unions like the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation to the smallest volunteer-run unions \u2013 Labor stood with them to resist this attack on their capacity to organise. These are the organisations that fight for higher wages, combat wage theft and exploitation and keep workers safe. Labor thanks the crossbenchers who voted with us to oppose these dangerous and extreme laws. But while this bill has been defeated, workers should not rest easy. This has always been two-stage attack from the government. This year, the government has gone after the organisations that represent, protect and fight for workers. Starting next year, they will come after workers\u2019 pay and conditions directly. The Liberals are already talking about watering down unfair dismissal laws and scrapping the Better Off Overall Test. Just a small point - Queensland goes to the polls in October next year. Can\u2019t imagine Pauline Hanson would have been too happy with a union campaign being run against her, with the parliament looking like heading to another minority, given the Palaszczuk government run lately. Even a whiff of holding the balance of power in a home state can be enough. And here is the whole statement from Pauline Hanson on why she switched sides in the final moment: Pauline Hanson has spoken: Penny Wong on Christian Porter saying he will working on bringing the vote back: \u201cIf he does bang his chest and brings this forward next week, my question would be \u2018what\u2019s changed?\u2019\u201d That moment you realise it has all gone wrong. If you go frame by frame on the tape, you can see the exact moment the heart breaks The Senate has moved on to its adjournment debate. Seems time this had a run again The government was aware that Jacqui Lambie was a no, after it rejected her amendments. But it didn\u2019t think that mattered, because with One Nation, they had one more vote than it needed. Eggs in the hand and all that. It is understood that One Nation confirmed its support for the amendments as recently as today. But the government did notice that the unions did go quiet on social media today. Apparently Pauline Hanson has not yet explained herself to the government. This has been a pretty big win for Penny Wong, and Anthony Chisholm (who often does a lot of negotiations with the crossbench) as well. Michele O\u2019Neil says \u201cwe have been talking constructively with senator Hanson, but we did not know the final vote\u201d. Michele O\u2019Neil says the unions have been talking to all the crossbenchers. \u201cWe are convinced not just the time we have spent talking to them, but all the thousands of people who contacted them, made the difference.\u201d But she adds that they weren\u2019t sure of the vote until it happened. Asked about the government bringing back the bill, O\u2019Neil says, \u201cWell, if they want to be humiliated twice, they should do that.\u201d Michele O\u2019Neil says the bill\u2019s defeat is a \u201cvictory for democracy\u201d. \u201cIt is the efforts of ordinary workers who have defeated this bill,\u201d she says. She also thanks the crossbenchers \u2013 Jacqui Lambie and One Nation for \u201ctaking the time\u201d to listen to concerns and defeat the bill. Sally McManus says she has a message for Scott Morrison: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate working people ... they don\u2019t like double standards.\u201d So many headlines are being re-written right now. Which is why we have sentences like \u201cthe Morrison government has secured a shock defeat on industrial relations, with a bill cracking down on rogue unions failing in the Senate.\u201d Christian Porter has released a statement: Obviously I am very disappointed in the result in the Senate. It\u2019s for Pauline Hanson to explain why she voted against a bill that met every requirement she sought through extensive consultation. This is important reform which seeks to ensure that registered organisations obey the law. It is as simple as that. We remain committed to this reform and will be seeking to reintroduce the bill at an appropriate time. This is a pretty big troll. The Greens are the first cab off the rank about the government\u2019s loss on ensuring integrity. From Adam Bandt: \u201cThis is a victory for working Australians and for Australia\u2019s democracy. This is a victory for the power of organising and of everyday people power. We have a government who is determined to limit the power of workers and their unions and reduce their ability to stand up to the powerful, but today, they lost. If this government was really committed to integrity, then we would have a federal anti-corruption watchdog to hold politicians to account. Instead, the prime minister is prepared to let a minister continue to serve while being investigated by the police. This government has no integrity when it comes to integrity. The Australians Greens will always stand up for unions and working Australians in their effort to fight for higher wages and better working conditions. The Greens are proud to stand alongside the union movement and Australian workers in celebrating this victory.\u201d Sally McManus and Michele O\u2019Neil will hold a press conference at 5.30. That\u2019s been a heck of a campaign. To be even clearer - that bill was meant to be the government\u2019s one guaranteed win this week. And then... One Nation just voted with Labor, the Greens and Jacqui Lambie to block the Ensuring Integrity bill. It wasn\u2019t a mistake. Liberal senators were staring at their phones trying to work out what had happened. Labor and Greens senators cheered - and one bitter Coalition senator shouted out \u201cthanks Malcolm [Roberts]\u201d across the chamber. On my way back to the Guardian office I saw a clearly shocked Labor senator Catryna Bilyk profusely thanking Hanson and Roberts. Hanson said that One Nation \u201cvotes on merit\u201d. As we\u2019re not allowed to interview people in the corridor I asked if Hanson would like to invite me into her office to explain. She declined. Paul Karp says One Nation knew what they doing - and they deliberately sat with the government. So the government could bring it back to a vote - a tie means that the status quo remains, but the government can bring it back. Again - what even is today. So just to be clear - One Nation switched its vote at the final hurdle and the bill was defeated. The Senate is dividing on the question that the bill as amended be agreed to. Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts are voting with Labor, the Greens and Jacqui Lambie! It was tied 34-34 - so the question was negated. Labor and Greens clap. We see it but we don\u2019t believe it. Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts just sat with Labor to oppose the Ensuring Integrity Bill. Final vote: Ayes \u2013 34 Noes \u2013 34 That means that the Bill has a tied vote has NOT passed. Moving off Greens amendments to government ones \u2013 at first it looked like Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts were split on one set. But the vote was re-run and Anne Ruston dispatched to explain what was what. Both One Nation senators (and Centre Alliance) voted with the government \u2013 a pattern which, if it continues, will see the bill pass. Then came Jacqui Lambie amendments, which are designed to ensure unions are not deregistered for taking industrial action; and to ask for a review of the bill after 12 months. Here One Nation were split \u2013 with Hanson voting with Labor and the Greens, and Roberts voting with the government. Still, Lambie lost the vote 35 to 33. The last of the ensuring integrity amendments are being voted on. Once this is done, the third reading vote will be held. Then it goes back to the house to be agreed upon with the amendments. Then it goes back to the Senate for one last time. Then once it passes there (which it will, because the crossbench is on board) it just needs royal assent, and then it\u2019s law. Voting has started on a series of amendments to the Coalition\u2019s bill to facilitate deregistration of unions and disqualification of their officials. We\u2019ll get a series of votes on amendments then a final vote at the third reading stage to pass the bill. First up is the Greens amendments, the most controversial of which stipulates the law will not come into effect until after the establishment of a National Integrity Commission. The first Greens amendment \u2013 raising the threshold of demerit points for deregistration \u2013 was voted down 36 to 32. Jacqui Lambie voted with the Greens and Labor in favour; Centre Alliance voted with the government against. I can\u2019t see Pauline Hanson or Malcolm Roberts in the chamber. Labor has put together what it says is the four times Scott Morrison has misled the house in the past 24 hours: Morrison\u2019s misattribution of a radio talkback host quote to a Victorian police officer (which he wrote to the House and corrected), accusing Labor of gagging debate on veterans when it was about the Naif (although Phil Thompson did mention veteran suicides) claiming Labor voted against the second reading of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill (Labor voted for it) and then correcting the record by saying Labor voted against the third reading of that bill (when Labor voted for it). Angus Taylor has responded to Labor\u2019s rejection of the pair: I sought a pair to attend the International Energy Agency\u2019s conference in Paris to finalise discussions with counterparts to address fuel security issues in Australia. At this meeting I was planning to further discussions with the US about access to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and push Australia\u2019s case to modernise the IEA\u2019s outdated rules that disproportionately affect Australia due to its geographic remoteness. Labor have rejected that pair \u2013 they are clearly not serious about fuel security and protecting Australia\u2019s interests. Ensuring integrity is about to get back under way in the Senate. Today, the Greens MP and justice spokesperson David Shoebridge has referred the NSW police commissioner to the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission as a result of his disclosures to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about an ongoing police investigation into the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor. Here is an excerpt of the referral: There are two significant concerns that arise as a result of this. This first is that Commissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues. Given this, it was highly inappropriate for Commissioner Fuller to be disclosing any details of the police investigation into Mr Taylor to Prime Minister Morrison other than those that were on the public record. It goes without saying that Prime Minister Morrison has a vested political interest in the police investigation failing to find any misconduct by his Minister. The second significant concern arises from the personal relationship between Commissioner Fuller and Prime Minister Morrison and the fact that this relationship constitutes a clear conflict of interest on the part of Commissioner Fuller. This relationship includes, according to Commissioner Fuller, having been neighbours during which time Morrison would collect his rubbish bins for him. The exact nature of this relationship now appears to be contested by the two men in their very recent public debate. Shoebridge said: No one, not the prime minister and not the police commissioner, is above the law and people in high office are expected to abide by high standards. We have referred this matter to the LECC because it is a genuinely independent and non-partisan body that\u2019s job is to investigate these kinds of matters. We cannot allow any political interference in a police investigation and both the police commissioner and the prime minister should have known better. Our colleague Naaman Zhou has just spoken to David Shoebridge, who says he has referred Mick Fuller to the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission over the phone call with Scott Morrison regarding the Angus Taylor investigation. Shoebridge is referring Fuller under section 10 of the LECC Act for serious misconduct. \u201cCommissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues. Given this, it was highly inappropriate for Commissioner Fuller to be disclosing any details of the police investigation into Mr Taylor to Prime Minister Morrison.\u201d Shoebridge also claimed there was a conflict of interest between Fuller and Morrison because of the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d the pair have previously spoken of, and being neighbours (or bin-gate) which they now claim was a joke. The talks go from 2 December to 13 December \u2013 so Angus Taylor could still attend the tail end, if he so wished. Labor received a request earlier this week to pair Angus Taylor for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week, so he could attend United Nation-led climate talks in Paris and Madrid. Labor wrote back today to say no \u2013 the reason being it doesn\u2019t think it is appropriate that a minister under police investigation should be granted leave, when there are still questions to be answered. Marise Payne who is going to the same talks, has been granted a pair (as is precedent). The government now needs to decide whether Taylor misses the talks or loses a number. The matter of public importance begins \u2013 it is on robodebt and is being led by Bill Shorten \u2013 and Tim Wilson starts non-stop heckling about the number of Labor MPs who have left the chamber (there are still more Labor MPs in the chamber than Coalition MPs though). \u201cWill you shut up,\u201d someone from Labor yells. Andrew Giles appeals to the deputy speaker, pointing at Wilson, but Wilson seems to get bored of his own steam and wanders off. Anthony Albanese associates the opposition with the comments of Darren Chester about the need to do more on veteran suicide. Tony Pasin is muttering loudly about the \u201cdisrespect\u201d Labor showed earlier. Scott Morrison adds his words and thoughts to the question. He calls an end to question time, but moves to correct the record first and says that Labor voted against the \u201cthird reading\u201d of the defence force homes legislation. He walks out of the chamber as Labor goes nuts, calling Morrison a liar. They can\u2019t bring Morrison back in, because question time is over, so Albanese makes a personal explanation. The prime minister has suggested that I as leader of Labor and the rest of my team voted against the second reading of the legislation, we did not, he just suggested we voted against the third reading, we did not.\u201d It is pretty extraordinary \u2013 the votes are a matter of public record. Labor loses its bid, and the house returns to its seats. We have at least one more dixer. The folders are stacked and the phone has been placed on top, so hopefully Scott Morrison just has one more question in mind. The dixer is from Phil Thompson on veteran suicides. The Labor benches are s i l e n t as Darren Chester speaks. In the most shocking news this week, Tony Pasin has avoided the front bench in this division. Luke Howarth is there though. Karen Andrews and Clint Eastwood\u2019s imaginary Obama sit next to Angus Taylor. We get to the final division, where they swap sides. Or as Tony Pasin thinks of it \u201cfrontbench time\u201d. The screen which shows what the procedure is on the floor of the house just said: \u201cThat the member be no longer hard\u201d following Mark Butler\u2019s contribution, which caused a lot of mirth on the floor of the chamber. Marise Payne, representing the attorney general, has just made a statement about the mysterious imprisonment of Witness J. Payne said that court orders prevent publication of information about the case and the orders were made with the consent of the parties. \u201cIn any legal proceedings the commonwealth attorney general or other parties can seek orders to protect sensitive information. It is always at the discretion of the court whether to make such orders.\u201d Nick McKim took note of the answer: \u201cIn the 21st century there is a person who has been secretly charged, secretly sentenced and secretly imprisoned in Australia ... \u201cWhen asked to provide further information, the attorney general\u2019s representative has refused or been unable to provide further information. This is a shocking example of secrecy and abuse of state power, and our descent into a police state. \u201cOpen justice is critical to the rule of law, which in turn is critical to our democracy.\u201d McKim concludes by suggesting Australia is now an \u201cauthoritarian state\u201d and calling for a bill of rights. Mood The motion I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House notes that this week: detectives from the NSW Police Force\u2019s State Crime Command Financial Crimes Squad launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate whether the Minister for Emissions Reduction committed a crime; the prime minister refused to stand down the minister while the subject of a criminal investigation notwithstanding the Ministerial Standards; the prime minister called the NSW Police Commissioner and discussed the nature, substance and instigation of the criminal investigation; former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, former NSW ICAC Commissioner David Ipp QC, and former NSW ICAC Counsel Assisting Geoffrey Watson SC have criticised the prime minister\u2019s call; the prime minister misled the House while defending the deliberate misleading of the House by the minister and refused to apologise and correct the record; the prime minister failed to answer questions about his conduct, or the conduct of the Minister, and prevented Parliament debating this scandal 20 times; and therefore, the House calls on the prime minister to: acknowledge the Minister for Emissions Reduction deliberately misled the House; acknowledge the prime minister\u2019s decision to call the NSW police commissioner was inappropriate; correct the record in person and apologise for misleading the House on Wednesday; correct the record in person and apologise for misleading the House today by claiming the opposition voted against the second reading of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 2019 when it supported it; undertake to fully cooperate with the NSW Police Force criminal investigation; and stand down the minister for emissions reduction. Would really like someone to unchain my heart from my love of politics at this stage. Labor is now moving to suspend standing orders in question time for what is the third day in a row. Former foreign minister Julie Bishop spoke at lunchtime in Sydney at the Centre for Independent Studies, on \u201cWaking up to the China Challenge\u201d. She said she was asked \u201calmost daily\u201d about the choice Australia was allegedly confronted with, a choice between China (the trade relationship) and the US (the security alliance). Bishop argued it was a false dichotomy. \u201cWe back ourselves, our interests, our values, our principles. We always choose Australia.\u201d \u201cI do believe Australia can continue to maintain its relationship with China while remaining an ally of the US.\u201d Asked about self-declared Chinese \u201cspy\u201d Wang Liqiang, who this week outed himself in the Australian media as he seeks asylum, Bishop said she would not rush to judgement. \u201cI understand that Asio and security agencies are working hard to establish the veracity of the allegations. The fact that he has sought to out himself raises fascinating questions. In my experience, if there were truly a spy, from any nation, that person would be enveloped within our intelligence community and would be nowhere near the media.\u201d Barely half a kilometre away at the Lowy Institute, at the same time, Bishop\u2019s erstwhile colleague, former prime minister Tony Abbott was speaking about ... China. He told the audience there Australia\u2019s China choice was becoming more difficult as the country grew more and more assertive. \u201cIt was much easier to avoid hard choices when China appeared to be liberalising,\u201d he said, citing its militarisation of the South China Sea, its repression and imprisonment of members of the Uyghur minority, and President Xi\u2019s consolidation of power. Abbott said when a country\u2019s biggest trading partner was also its greatest strategic challenge \u201cliving with trouble has to be taken for granted ... we will need to become less starry-eyed about the Chinese government\u201d. If only there was a way MPs could enter information into some sort of internet search engine thing and find the answer to questions they yell out in QT. Scott Morrison: As I assured the House earlier this week, the government of course will cooperate fully with the New South Wales police investigation and as I said, Mr Speaker, we will wait for that investigation and if there are any further matters for me to consider at that time of course I will. The matters I was invited to address earlier this week by the leader of the opposition was the application of the ministerial standards and I addressed myself to those issues in the way I outlined to the House. That\u2019s where the matter stands now. I note in the matters - that the leader of the opposition has raised with me, he has established this principle which says that when a member, when a minister, a senior member of my team, Mr Speaker, who is the subject of an investigation that they should, Mr Speaker, immediately have to stand aside. And I note that that was not a standard that the Labor party pursued when they were in government. I note that it is not a standard that they have sought to apply in opposition when members of their own frontbench, Mr Speaker, have been the subject of police investigation for very serious issues in the past, that has not been the cause for those members to stand aside. What is clear now is the leader of the opposition today was not prepared to apply the same standard that he seeks of the government to his own frontbenchers. He refused to apply this standard to his own frontbenchers. That\u2019s called a hypocrite. That\u2019s called a hypocrite Mr Speaker. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to the Strike Force Garrad investigation and to a report that just before 2pm it has taken copies of correspondence and the metadata showing details of any alterations from the City of Sydney website relating to travel and the suggestions from the minister for emissions reduction. Has the government also provided all relevant emails, documents, text messages, phone records, data, metadata and encrypted messages to the New South Wales police and will it ... \u201cHow do you know that,\u201d comes from the government backbench, including Tim Wilson. Oh I don\u2019t know? Perhaps because it is in the public domain? Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: My question again is to the minister for emissions reduction. On 24 October the minister told the House, and I quote, \u2018The document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney\u2019s website. It was publicly available.\u2019 A claim he repeated in a written statement tabled in the parliament on Monday and stood by in his previous answer today. Does the minister stand by his statement on 24 October? There is a lot of back and forth over whether or not Taylor should answer this question. We eventually get to him returning to the despatch box. Tony Smith looks like he is going to be chewing panadol like peanuts after this session. Taylor: Yes, I do stand by that statement, and I remind those opposite that I said in that statement, \u2018I reject absolutely the suggestion that I or any members of my staff altered the documents in question.\u2019 But the Labor party has, in typical fashion, dramatically overreached by claiming these documents were forged or altered. The Labor party has a track record of using police referrals as a political tool, Mr Speaker. Albanese points out that Taylor himself has apologised over the wrong figures. But we move on. Ed Husic has just been told to \u201cjust end the conversation with yourself\u201d. Husic takes it with good grace. I mean, at least it was a conversation with someone he liked. Here is the the bit the prime minister is talking about, in terms of shutting down Phil Thompson\u2019s contribution: Phil Thompson: I\u2019d like to start by addressing some of the falsehoods that the shadow minister decided to throw around just previously, and then I\u2019ll talk on this bill as well as suicide prevention, and that all comes into the cost pressures, especially in north Queensland. We\u2019re talking about the NAIF, and I found it quite ironic that someone from the south-east corner would be sitting across from me, pointing and saying that we\u2019re not doing anything in the north. Shayne Neumann: What would you know? PT: Maybe you should stay in your patch, mate. Because the NAIF has rolled out some projects within north Queensland which include at JCU and at the airport \u2013 and the JCU did take quite a while to get over the line because the Labor state government decided to put up roadblocks because that\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s OK, I\u2019m happy to educate the shadow minister on how the NAIF works a little bit later, because that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. We are here to talk about the prime minister\u2019s and Minister Chester\u2019s announcement that we would extend the eligibility \u2013 Deputy speaker: The member for Herbert will resume his seat. Michelle Rowland: I move: That the Member be no longer heard. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Has the minister or his office had any communication from the prime minister or the prime minister\u2019s office about the content of the phone call between the prime minister and the New South Wales police commissioner on Tuesday? Taylor: I\u2019ve said to the prime minister what I have said to the House. And I will remind those opposite - I\u2019ll remind those opposite that I made a statement... And I stand by the statement that I made - that I tabled in the House earlier and I have nothing to add to it. Now, as I have said repeatedly to the House, I reject absolutely the suggestion that I or any members of my staff altered the documents in question. Butler jumps up on relevancy, but Tony Smith tells him he has wasted his point of order. Taylor, thinking he has had a win comes back, but badly misjudges the speaker\u2019s mood: This is a pathetic, outrageous accusation by those opposite. We know exactly what this is about. It\u2019s about distracting us from our strong focus on delivering a better deal ... I\u2019ll say to the minister. I\u2019m pleased to report that according to the ABS we\u2019ve had the first ever ... Tony Smith: The minister will \u2013 he\u2019s now straying beyond the question. The minister needs to be directly relevant to the question. The question did not ask about ABS figures or anything of the like so the minister needs to be directly relevant or resume his seat. Taylor, looking a lot like how baby Amy did after getting caught giving my baby sister a haircut (it was eventually evened out after a few subsequent haircuts) returns to the despatch box. \u201cThose opposite are all smear and no idea.\u201d Christian Porter is vying for \u201cbest dramatic performance of union thuggery\u201d and you know what, I think he might have it. Anthony Albanese to Tony Smith, seeking to table Hansard: \u201cI seek leave to table the Hansard that shows that the member for Herbert was talking about NAIF, Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and attacking the Palaszczuk government. Not talking...[about suicide] Smith: I understand the point the leader of the opposition\u2019s trying to make but I\u2019m not going to allow Hansard to be tabled. I mean, there is nothing more accessible than Hansard as the leader of the opposition has shown. Christian Porter: Well, you know on this occasion we\u2019d probably be willing to provide leave to table Hansard given that what the member said was \u2018Then I will talk on this bill as well as suicide prevention.\u2019 So table away. [Imagine the mic drop here] Ed Husic: \u201cIt would have been better if you did Blue Steel. Smith [using his best exasperated dad voice] Sorry, I don\u2019t think anyone was listening. I\u2019m not having Hansard tabled. We move on. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: (Butler\u2019s brow is still appropriately furrowed for those playing at home) Did the prime minister or his office brief Phil Coorey from the Australian Financial Review that, and I quote, \u2018Morrison reported back to the House that he was not standing Taylor aside basically because Fuller told him the investigation was not much more than a phone call to Moore\u2019s office.\u2019 Morrison: I refer the member to my response that I tabled in this House ... as to the nature of my call with the Commissioner of police and I refer them also to the statements made by the commissioner about the contents of that call. Mr Speaker, once again, that is the 64th time I think that the \u2013 those opposite have asked questions about that \u2013 this matter. That is four times the number of questions they have asked on drought and drought policy in this chamber since the election. Mr Speaker, it\u2019s more questions than they\u2019ve asked on the economy, it\u2019s more than they\u2019ve asked on childcare. They\u2019ve asked two questions on national security, three on education, six on health, but 64 on this matter. You know what it says about the leader of the opposition? He\u2019s more interested in the political games of Canberra than he is the real issues that the people of Australia voted for us to focus on. And we\u2019re totally focused on those. Mr Speaker, I\u2019m not distracted by the desperate political games by the leader of the opposition. The leader of the opposition would be the Manager of Opposition Business than he would be the prime minister. Because he\u2019d rather engage himself in all the silly little games and tantrums and sooking and sulking that we have seen from this leader of the opposition. Mr Speaker, but all of that comes to naught when you compare it with the depth of the tactics he stooped to today by silencing a veteran of this country. Senate question time has been all Angus Taylor all the time. Mathias Cormann stuck by Taylor and read a long list of his achievements - a list which did not include reducing emissions, despite him being the minister for emissions reduction. Then Labor switches tack to Simon Birmingham - querying why he had said on the ABC that Taylor sourced the erroneous document from the City of Sydney website, but in the Senate he said only that that is what Taylor has advised. Murray Watt started singing The Wheels on the Bus (Go Round and Round), in reference to his belief Birmingham\u2019s earlier answer had thrown Taylor under the bus. Birmingham said he received briefings from Taylor, and repeated that he was advised it was sourced from the City of Sydney website. \u201cThey can continue to ask again and they\u2019re going to get the same answer again.\u201d Labor\u2019s Penny Wong then asked who doctored the document, and Birmingham rejected the premise because \u201caccording to Mr Taylor\u201d it was downloaded from the council website. Wong makes much of the fact he won\u2019t say in parliament that he doesn\u2019t know who doctored it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. How can the prime minister claim that the opposition made no objection to his statement that he would call the New South Wales police commissioner about the substance of Strike Force Garrad into one of his cabinet ministers when the prime minister has prevented the Parliament debating this deepening scandal 20 times this week. Morrison: I\u2019m sorry to have offended the precious sensitivities of the leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker. On the issue of gag motions, Mr Speaker, that he has raised in his question. The one thing the leader of the opposition should apologise for is by running the sort of political game tactics we have seen on display this week and in its worst form today where the leader of the opposition voted to gag a veteran of this country who was seeking to speak about veteran suicide in this country. He was on the top of the list of those who vetted to gag that member. But it wasn\u2019t only that. The very bill he was speaking on was about the defence service homes amendment bill which expands eligibility for the defence service homes insurance scheme to current and former members of the Australian Defence Force. Mr Speaker, on the second reading, they voted against this bill. The only people who should be apologising in this chamber is the leader of the Labor party. For his grubby political games. Labor points out it did not vote against the bill, but the prime minister has concluded his answer. So many chains to pull. So little time. It\u2019s a small point, and I am sure a lot of people would argue semantics, but on the \u201cwho did you think I was going to call defence/I told you I was going to do it\u201d that Scott Morrison is using, he didn\u2019t actually say he would call the NSW police commissioner - my look over of the Hansard shows he said variations of this: I will be taking advice from the New South Wales police on any matter that they are currently looking at, and I will form a view, based on taking that advice, in considering these issues.\u201d Which is not \u2018I am calling the police commissioner\u2019. That could have meant a departmental officer will call a NSW police departmental officer, to receive the same advice. Not I\u2019m going to give the Commish a call directly about an investigation involving one of my ministers. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister. Former council assisting the independent commission against corruption Geoffrey Watson SC said the prime minister\u2019s phone call to the New South Wales police commissioner should never have happened. Stating, \u2018It just looks like he\u2019s applying pressure and it can\u2019t be anything else. It must be a favour because why else would he be calling?\u2019 I again ask, how on earth was that phone call appropriate? Morrison: I refer the leader of the opposition to my earlier answers. The leader of the opposition invited me earlier this week to inform myself of the matters that he\u2019d raised in the parliament. And in relation to the statement of ministerial standards. And, Mr Speaker, in this very chamber ... Members on my left ... I told him exactly what I was going to do to inform myself both to comply with my duties to this House and to comply with my duties as prime minister under the ministerial statement of standards, Mr Speaker. So, Mr Speaker, I did what I said I was going to do, I was upfront about it with the Australian people. I was upfront about it with the parliament. I went and told them what I\u2019d done. I made a decision. What we have seen since that time is the political games being played by a leader of the opposition who is more interested in the drama and the carryings on of Canberra politics than he is in the serious issues that are being raised in this place. Now, Mr Speaker, I know that because he was on the top of the list when it came to shutting down and gagging a veteran in this chamber who had said they wished to speak on the issue of veteran suicide. Now, the leader of the opposition can use all the fine words he likes, but in this chamber, on his direction, one of his members moved that the member for Herbert no longer be heard. And he wished to speak about veteran suicide. Shame on you. The man who accused those of caring about climate change of being inner-city raving lunatics, wants the chamber to know he has been \u201creally disappointed in the antics this week\u201d. Excuse me while I wipe that wet lettuce off my face. If you ever wandered what a fusty nut missing a kernel looked like, I invite you to look into the chamber as the deputy prime minister takes this dixer. ARE YOU FRICKING KIDDING ME? Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former anti-corruption commissioner and supreme court judge David Ipp AO QC has said in relation to the prime minister\u2019s phone call to the New South Wales police commissioner, and I quote, \u2018You can\u2019t see that it\u2019s information that relates to matters of state interest. It can only relate to matters of party interest.\u2019 How on earth was that phone call appropriate? Morrison: Once again I reject the premise of the question which was raised by the leader of the opposition and I refer the member to the response by Commissioner Fuller yesterday, who said, very plainly, \u2018The prime minister didn\u2019t ask me any questions that were inappropriate. He didn\u2019t ask for anything that was inappropriate and I\u2019m comfortable with the discussion we had over a few minutes.\u2019 They\u2019re the words of the police commissioner, Mr Speaker. If the leader of the opposition wants to cast aspersions against the New South Wales police commissioner he can do so. But I say this. The leader of the opposition raised a very serious issue with me at the beginning of this week. On Tuesday, Mr Speaker, I undertook to fulfil my obligations which he invited me to do under the statement of ministerial standards where I had to assess whether a minister should stand aside in the circumstances he\u2019d presented. I sought to inform myself as is entirely appropriate of the nature and substance and instigation of that investigation. I was upfront with the parliament about doing it. ... So I undertook that action as I in this House and then I went outside this place. I undertook that action and I came and reported back to this action in the parliament and the decision I have taken. What I find strange, Mr Speaker, is that at no time during that period yesterday, I should say the day before, Mr Speaker, did the Leader of the Opposition during the course of that evening and the many interviews that he gave or indeed even after I had come back into this place and explained I\u2019d had that conversation with the Police Commissioner, did he raise any objection. He raised no objection all night. There he was. He didn\u2019t do it until the next day I\u2019m advised. He didn\u2019t do it until the next day until he read it in the Guardian. We know who\u2019s pulling his chain. Zali Steggall used her 90-second statement just before question time to call for silence for Australia\u2019s domestic violence victims: I call on the members of the 46th parliament to remember what we are elected to do in this place, to respect the institution and to fulfil our responsibility to find solutions. One of the biggest issues facing communities out there - beyond these walls - is the scourge of domestic violence. The statistics are horrific. On average, at least one woman dies each week as a result of intimate partner violence. Yet again this morning, we wake to the news of another woman killed. Where is the outrage? Every member of this House either has a mother, wife, sister or daughter. I call on this parliament to draw a line and give this issue the urgent attention it deserves. To show our respect to those women and families that we have failed to protect, I will use the remainder of my speaking time in this Chamber to pause in silence with fellow MPs. Anne Davies has an update on the Angus Taylor investigation: Guardian Australia can reveal the council has also already retrieved data logs, which would reveal details of what was downloaded and the IP addresses of the devices that downloaded pages, including details of who downloaded the 2017-18 annual report, following a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia two weeks ago. So far Guardian Australia has been told that the information would need to be sorted to extract downloads of the annual report at the centre of the controversy and may raise privacy issues. Discussions on how the information might be released are continuing. However, the New South Wales police would be able to access the logs including more detail about an IP address beyond the general geographical location of the machine and the identity of the internet service provider that services that machine. Scott Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition has authorised political games in this place which has gagged a veteran of this country speaking about veteran suicide. The Leader of the Opposition should grow up from his political games and he should focus on the real issues that Australians wish to focus on and get over the politics and get on with the policy. \u201cPolitical games\u201d is getting quite the go here. Looks like the government has found it\u2019s line for the day. If you have a go at political games, you\u2019ll get a go at political games. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: This morning [Scott Morrison] refused to attend this chamber and correct the record and apologise for misleading the House. Why does the Prime Minister think the usual standards of integrity and accountability don\u2019t apply to him? Morrison: I don\u2019t accept the assertion that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The matters that he referred to yesterday, Mr Speaker. With regard to the attribution of a quote. When it was brought to my attention I took immediate action to ensure that the House was informed of that correction. Now, Mr Speaker, I hear the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition ... The reason I wrote a letter last night is because I was on a plane on the way to Sydney for a family event which the Leader of the Opposition knew about. ... Mr Speaker, that letter which I authorised was provided to the House and it was tabled here by the attorney general to ensure the House was immediately informed of the necessary correction that had to be made. ... Now, Mr Speaker, that was followed up with a further letter to the clerk and as you advised the House last night these are the appropriate forms of the House to correct the record. So if the Leader of the Opposition wants to take issue with the Speaker on this matter he\u2019s at liberty do so. But here we are in question time, in the nation\u2019s capital... The Leader of the Opposition is bickering about a quotation in an answer to a question which has been corrected for the record. This is what the Leader of the Opposition believes are the real issues facing this country. And the political games that the Leader of the Opposition, the tawdry political games ... has been engaged in, in this House this week, found their overreach particularly today when the Leader of the Opposition voted to see that the member for Herbert could no longer be heard when he was speaking, Mr Speaker, on the issue of veteran suicide. ... So the political games being played by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor party this week descended so low that a veteran of this country speaking about veteran suicide ... Anthony Albanese has taken the rare step of making a 90-second statement (they are usually for backbenchers) \u2013 and he has timed it on the list for just as Scott Morrison walks into the chamber. \u201cAn ad man with no plan, a showman, covering up a scam,\u201d says Albanese, as Morrison takes his seat. Who\u2019s that MP? It\u2019s Tony Pasin. It was just hard to place him, given he was sitting in the back benches (Pasin likes to make a beeline for the front bench during division votes. Almost without fail. A MP can dream, I suppose) Members have begun their 90 second statements in the House, which means it is almost time for question time. We\u2019ll head into the chamber, but we all know what this hour will be about. Five. More. To. Go. Labor is still gagging government ministers and MPs in the chamber to make their point about the government gagging debate on Angus Taylor. Every time a division is called, all the MPs have to run back to the chamber. Labor MPs might be prepared, but the government MPs are not. The focus. The stance. The furrowed brow. Take note, fellow nodders. On the ministerial standards questions, this is what Anthony Albanese had to say: Q: So, you would stand down one of your shadow ministers in similar circumstances, and you undertake here today to do that if any of your shadow ministers are under police investigations? AA: If I was a minister, if I\u2019m elected to government, I will uphold the ministerial code of conduct. Q: So, only in government? AA: Well, the ministerial code of conduct \u2013 the hint is, it\u2019s a ministerial code of conduct. So, in terms of processes, the ministerial code of conduct should be followed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s there, for a reason. Because ministers make decisions, and they can\u2019t be in a situation whereby they are compromised. Q: So, there are different standards for shadow ministers under investigation, they can continue? AA: Well, I\u2019m not going to answer hypotheticals. I\u2019m answering this specific question about ministerial code of conduct that applies to ministers and has applied for a very long period of time, and has always, always been the case. And what we see here, unlike what happened under Prime Minister Howard, but also under Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, where we had people like Arthur Sinodinos, Sussan Ley, other people, standing aside. Sam Watson will be very missed. Ken Wyatt has issued a statement on his passing: I was saddened yesterday to learn the news of the passing of a great Indigenous Australian, Sam Watson. I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to his family, friends and his community. We have lost a remarkable man whose lasting influence is felt across the country. Sam was a courageous advocate for justice here in Australia and around the world. He was never afraid of tackling some of the most complex issues that Aboriginal people faced, and continue to face, and worked tirelessly to bring these to the fore. I engaged his wise advice and guidance in my early years as a young man. He helped bring about a fundamental and permanent shift in Indigenous policy at the local, state and federal level through his ability to bring people together for a united cause. He was respected by all sides of politics due to his clear commitment and passion to better the lives of Aboriginal people. This is shown in his more recent work with Link-Up Qld which has seen many affected by the stolen generation reunited with their families and culture. He was dependable, always present, and had a way of taking people on the journey. The importance of his life cannot be understated and Sam will be remembered for improving the lives of generations of Indigenous Australians. Anthony Albanese and Tony Burke have put out a statement on Clive James: Clive James was a giant of Australian letters, and one of the greatest poets and intellectuals this country has ever produced. Clive passed away at his home in the UK at the weekend after a long illness, aged 80. The \u2018Kid from Kogarah\u2019 started his working life as an assistant editor at the Sydney Morning Herald before forging a 50-year career as a scholar, poet, lyricist, essayist, novelist, memoirist, critic and broadcaster. At home and abroad, he entertained and moved readers and TV audiences with his profound and provocative insights, acerbic wit and boundless sense of humour. \u2018Common sense and a sense of humour are the same thing, moving at different speeds,\u2019 Clive once wrote. \u2018A sense of humour is just common sense, dancing. Those who lack humour are without judgement and should be trusted with nothing.\u2019 Despite all the impressive achievements that made him a household name in Australia and the UK, he never lost his connection to his working-class roots or his commitment to a \u2018fair go for the workers\u2019. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1992 and that was upgraded to Officer level in 2013. He was similarly honoured in the UK for his services to literature and the media. As Clive once said: \u2018Fiction is life with the dull bits left out\u2019. Clive\u2019s life was certainly not dull \u2013 but the world without him is a less intelligent and less colourful place. Vale Clive James. This is now on its way to the Senate Why we are all talking about Scott Morrison taking in Mick Fuller\u2019s bins when they were Shire neighbours being a \u201cjoke\u201d (which Ben Fordham also raised as a joke on his 2GB show yesterday), just a reminder that on 13 December last year, following the original bin revelation, was this conversation: Ben Fordham: Because, once upon a time when you were neighbours, according to the commissioner, and I think this has been confirmed, you used to bring his bin in. When he\u2019d leave the bin outside, the wheelie bin outside, and he was too lazy himself to bring it in, you would collect his bin and wheel it in for him. True or false? PM: That\u2019s what good neighbours do. That\u2019s what they do. Mick is a great bloke and that\u2019s the Shire way. BF: How come you don\u2019t do it anymore? PM: Well, I don\u2019t take the bins out anymore. BF: Why? PM: Because I haven\u2019t even found where they are yet. BF: Ah of course, at Kirribilli House. PM: At my place, Jen would be home more often than not to take the bins out as I\u2019d be travelling or something. BF: Hang on, hang on, hang on. When you say my place, you mean our place? PM: No, no, when I lived in the Shire. BF: Oh OK, I\u2019m just clarifying there. PM: That\u2019s very true Ben, and you\u2019re right to point that out. Often neighbours would do that for each other, mate. I think that\u2019s done in most parts of the country and Mick\u2019s a good bloke. BF: Well if you really loved him you\u2019d be driving from Kirribilli House back to the Shire just to make sure the bin was in. PM: Fair point, I think that\u2019s a fair point. World Vision has brought three former Miss World Australias to parliament as part of its \u201cpeace pledge\u201d initiative. The women have been spotted in the Parliament House cafeteria, which we all call the trough \u2013 so, really, they have already gone above and beyond. So Labor says that as Anthony Albanese stood up to move the motion to suspend standing orders to bring Scott Morrison into the chamber to apologise for attributing a Ben Fordham quote to a Victorian police officer, the government asked to pair Morrison. Labor says it asked on what grounds, at which point the pair request was withdrawn. Morrison did enter the chamber to vote against the Labor motion. As my Oma used to say, \u2018always look up\u2019. Question: Mick Fuller expects that the investigation, the strike force, will be wrapped up next week. Are you confident the investigation will be independent? And conducted thoroughly? Anthony Albanese: Well, look, I have \u2013 I have no reason to doubt the confidence of the New South Wales police force to conduct investigations. But the problem here is that the prime minister\u2019s intervention will have members of the public thinking, well, if one of my mates has a police inquiry, can I pick up the phone to the police commissioner and ask about that inquiry? That\u2019s why the prime minister\u2019s statement, that the inquiry wasn\u2019t just whether there\u2019s an inquiry or not, that release was out there. And I note Commissioner Fuller also said he had at least four phone calls from the prime minister. Three missed calls from a mobile that he didn\u2019t have before he eventually took the call. Now, I have been a minister of the Crown. The normal processes are not a prime minister ringing on his mobile the head of a police commission. What would happen would be advice would be got from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about appropriateness of it. You would have note-takers, you\u2019d have \u2013 we asked yesterday in the parliament, would that information be released. But, of course, as all of you who are involved in the right to know campaign, this government wants to operate in secret. How is it that that happens? That isn\u2019t the way phone calls happen, from the leader of a nation to the police commissioner about an investigation into one of his ministers. The way that it should happen, if it does at all, is through proper processes. It would appear that none of them were followed in this case, and that, I think, has the public scratching their heads. Anthony Albanese: Yesterday under some pressure he quoted \u2013 allegedly \u2013 a Victorian police detective, when it was, in fact, 2GB radio host Ben Fordham he was talking about, and hasn\u2019t had the courage to come in and do the right thing and correct the record and apologise. What\u2019s more, they have shut down debate. I have been here a while under Prime Minister Howard, under Kevin Rudd, under Julia Gillard. There were debates in the parliament. Indeed, under Tony Abbott. If Christopher Pyne was still the leader of the house there would have been debate about serious matters. You can\u2019t hide from scrutiny. Parliament has a role. Our current prime minister thinks he\u2019s above scrutiny. Scrutiny from the media, scrutiny from the public, where when asked questions he says it is just gossip or it is just in the bubble. He doesn\u2019t hold serious press conferences too often. Today he actually put in a request for a pair \u2013 at 9:32 \u2013 to avoid going in and voting on it, something that was withdrawn some 10 minutes later. For reasons that are beyond anyone\u2019s comprehension ... Well, he can\u2019t continue to duck and weave. He has to be held to account. And what Labor is trying to do in parliament is to do just that. Anthony Albanese has begun his press conference: In attempting to defend a minister who has deliberately misled the parliament, the prime minister himself yesterday misled the parliament. And he has not had the courage to do what other prime ministers, other ministers, have done, which is to go into the parliament and have the courtesy of advising the parliament of the mislead, and then apologise to the parliament. That is the normal procedure that occurs. The letter to the clerk provision is for when parliament is not in session. This morning the prime minister was prepared to enter the parliament to vote in gagging this debate, but wasn\u2019t prepared to take that opportunity to correct the record and to treat the parliament with the respect that it deserves. This mob say that they are conservatives. But the truth is they have shut down debate on 20 occasions this week. They are not prepared to allow for a proper debate about the actions of an embattled minister, which arose from him being too smart by half, sending a letter on his letterhead, with his signature, to attack Clover Moore and her position on climate change. That\u2019s why this has arisen. This was raised more than 80 days ago. For 80 days this minister has refused to say where the document came from. Because we know it isn\u2019t what he told the parliament. We know it wasn\u2019t downloaded from the City of Sydney website. And instead of him doing the right thing, fessing up early on, he\u2019s just dug in and dug in and dug in, and sunk deeper and deeper. We have a prime minister whose depth is a mile wide but an inch deep. He is incapable of acting in the national interests. So, instead of standing aside the minister under section 7.1 of the ministerial code, he has continued to dig in, made a phone call, which on any assessment he then went into the parliament and said he\u2019d discussed the substance of an investigation with the New South Wales police commissioner. And yesterday implied in parliament again that not everyone has all the facts about that matter \u2013 this matter \u2013 and implied he had more facts about the investigation than what has been publicly released, in spite of the fact that the New South Wales police, as is normal practice, issued an immediate release about Strike Force Garrad and said they wouldn\u2019t be making any further comment. So we have a minister who\u2019s embattled, we have a prime minister who has intervened directly by making that phone call into the investigation. The Senate seems excited to be talking about something other than the ensuring integrity bill. It\u2019s moved on to its housekeeping section. But it will be back on the IR train soon enough. The government has declined to table the legal advice it had on robodebt into the Senate. From the Greens: Using the excuse of \u2018long-standing practice\u2019 and \u2018public interest immunity\u2019 is not a legitimate reason to not provide this information which is in the public interest. Clearly this government has something to hide. They continued with this draconian program long after the harrowing evidence of the Senate inquiry in 2017 and the recommendation that it be put on hold while issues of procedural fairness were dealt with and long after the major flaws with the income averaging process were identified. We need to know when and for how long the government had information on the legality of robodebt. The government is trying to evade responsibility for what they have done, years of trying to scrape savings from people on the lowest income in our community and the government have been caught out. At this stage, Westpac is not being recalled to front the economics committee \u2013 but Apra will be appearing, as scheduled on Monday. From the committee: The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will appear before the House Economics Committee at a public hearing on Monday, 2 December 2019, as part of its review of the 2019 APRA Annual Report. Chair, Mr Tim Wilson MP, noted that \u2018APRA appeared at a public hearing in August this year; however, the committee determined that additional information and questioning was required to properly scrutinise APRA\u2019. \u2018The hearing will provide the committee with the opportunity to further question APRA on its performance and operation and, in particular, how it is implementing the recommendations of the Hayne Royal Commission and the APRA capability review.\u2019 Mr Wilson said \u2018a common theme across the Royal Commission and capability review reports was that APRA is a strong regulator in the area of traditional financial risk, but that more work needs to be done to ensure APRA is prepared to respond to future challenges, particularly in relation to non-financial risk\u2019. Mr Wilson added \u2018the committee will scrutinise APRA on how it promotes financial stability through the prudential regulation and supervision of Authorised Deposit taking Institutions, insurers and superannuation licensees, and other related issues.\u2019 Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler have called a press conference for 11.30 in the opposition leader\u2019s courtyard. I wonder what on earth it could be about. Peter Khalil wants you all to know he pulled a hamstring and that is why he missed the division. Could this have had anything to do with Peter Khalil coming up short in the division run this morning? These MPs lead the national security conversations when it comes to parliamentary committees. So when they get together, it always raises a bit of \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d interest. You might remember a little earlier this week Josh Frydenberg said the government would introduce two new bills in response to the banking royal commission recommendations. He has just released a bit more information on what those bills are: The financial sector reform (Hayne royal commission response \u2013 protecting consumers (2019 measures) bill 2019 addresses four recommendations from the Hayne royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry including: Recommendations 1.2 and 1.3 \u2013 requiring mortgage brokers to act in the best interests of consumers when providing consumer credit assistance; reforming mortgage broker remuneration by requiring the value of upfront commissions to be linked to the amount drawn down by borrowers instead of the loan amount; banning campaign and volume-based commissions and payments; and capping soft dollar benefits. These measures will apply from 1 July 2020. Recommendation 4.2 \u2013 ensuring that the consumer protection provisions of the financial services law apply to funeral expenses policies. \u2022 Recommendation 4.7 \u2013 banning unfair contract terms in standard insurance contracts. This will apply from 5 April 2021 which is consistent with the commencement of the design and distribution obligations. The government will also introduce the financial sector reform (Hayne royal commission response \u2013 stronger regulators (2019 measures) bill 2019. The bill implements a further four additional commitments the government announced at the time of responding to the royal commission and will ensure that Asiccan effectively enforce existing laws. How Mike Bowers saw the divisions in the house this morning: From Peter Dutton\u2019s office: The Australian government has declared three terrorist attacks for the purposes of the Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment (AVTOP) scheme. The 15 March 2019 attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand; the 15-16 January 2019 attack in Nairobi, Kenya; and the 8 May 2002 attack in Karachi, Pakistan, have been declared as \u201cterrorist acts\u201d under the scheme. On 15 March 2019, a single perpetrator conducted consecutive mass shootings at the al\u2011Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attack killed 51 people and another 49 people were injured. From 15-16 January 2019, five perpetrators conducted a complex attack on the dusitD2 hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya. The attack killed 21 people and another 28 were injured. On 8 May 2002, a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi, Pakistan. The attack killed 15 people and another 40 people were injured. The Australian government condemns the attacks and extends its deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and injured, and to the governments and people of New Zealand, Kenya and Pakistan. The declaration of these attacks means that eligible Australians who were harmed, or lost a close family member, as a result of the attacks may seek a one-off payment of up to $75,000 in financial assistance. The AVTOP scheme ensures Australian victims of terrorist events overseas have access to financial support. The declaration of these attacks brings the total number of overseas terrorist acts declared by the Australian government for the purposes of the AVTOP scheme to 45. Information on declared attacks and how to apply for financial assistance through the AVTOP scheme is available here or by calling 1800 040 226. The Senate is finishing up its divisions on the ensuring integrity bill. That\u2019s brought on the second reading debate, where we go into the amendments. We\u2019ll be in amendment hell until about 11.45am. Then it\u2019s usual Senate business for a bit, and then straight back into the IR bill. The only thing that will interrupt it then, is question time. Then more amendments, and then once that is done, we hit 4.30pm when the final votes begin and then boom - it will be the third reading debate and it\u2019s done. Honestly, with John Alexander on the pollies team, this is never a fair contest Peter Dutton was on Sydney radio 2GB this morning \u2013 he said he can\u2019t comment on Jacqui Lambie\u2019s condition to vote for the repeal. \u201cI think Jacqui can support the bill,\u201d Dutton said. Anthony Albanese says Labor would give leave for the prime minister to approach the despatch box \u201cgiven he is here\u201d and \u201csay sorry\u201d. Surprisingly, Scott Morrison does not take him up on the offer The divisions end, as expected. Numbers don\u2019t lie - except when you use the wrong ones. Meanwhile And the third division is brought on. The gag motion wins 73 to 66 We move onto the next division to gag Mark Butler. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber to cheers from Labor. While we wait for the divisions to come to their inevitable conclusions (remember, it is a numbers game. And you don\u2019t even need to have passed primary school maths to work that out) we have an Adani update: Regional Queensland has been handed another major win on the Carmichael project today when Toowoomba-based company Wagners was announced as the lead contractor delivering a $35m+ quarry operations package. The contract will see Wagners build and operate the quarry, which will be located about 160km outside Clermont, and deliver quarry materials for supporting infrastructure on the Carmichael mine and rail projects, such as roads, camps, pads, dams and mine civil works. So Labor\u2019s attack has moved from Angus Taylor to the prime minister misleading parliament. Morrison did table a letter. But Labor wants the images of him saying he was wrong. There won\u2019t be enough coffee in the world for today. Christian Porter moves to gag the debate \u2013 and to the divisions we go. Anthony Albanese just had to shush his own side, after he gets up to object to Christian Porter speaking to a motion which has not been allowed. If that gives you some indication of the mood in this place today. Porter looks a little stressed. This is not the week he wanted to have \u2013 especially when he is just about to get a win in the Senate that his colleagues had previously failed to negotiate. The motion: I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House: notes that: in attempting to defend a minister who has deliberately misled the parliament, the prime minister misled the parliament; yesterday in question time, the prime minister told the House that in March 2013, a then detective in Victoria police\u2019s fraud squad, Ross Mitchell, made a statement about former prime minister Julia Gillard; that statement was made word for word by radio host Ben Fordham \u2013 a fact which was clear from the Australian newspaper article dated 27 April 2013 by Hedley Thomas which reports that statement; late yesterday, the prime minister admitted that he had misled the parliament but despite House of Representatives practice being clear that a misleading of parliament can be corrected by either making a statement to the House or writing to the Clerk of the House, the prime minister instead directed that a letter to the Speaker be tabled by another minister; and the prime minister has refused repeated calls from the leader of the opposition to attend the House at 9.30am today to correct the record in the form demanded by the House; and therefore, the House calls on the prime minister to do what is required by both House of Representatives practice and his own ministerial standards and immediately attend the chamber to correct his misleading statement. Scott Morrison tabled a letter correcting the record yesterday. He had been paired because he had a matter outside of Canberra. Labor wants him to come into the chamber and do it verbally. Christian Porter is trying to shut it down. Anthony Albanese is in the House moving to suspend standing orders to bring Scott Morrison back into the chamber to correct his mistake from yesterday. Meanwhile in the Senate, it is all all ensuring integrity. Mathias Cormann is moving to suspend standing orders to bring on the IR bill. Labor is going to be pissed, but there is nothing they can do about it - the crossbench is on board this time. The bells are ringing. So it begins. Anthony Albanese was also asked about whether or not Labor would support the New Zealand option, if that is indeed what Jacqui Lambie\u2019s condition to repeal medevac is: AA: Labor has been saying for a very long time that Australia should have accepted the offer from New Zealand originally made with John Key\u2019s government and when prime minister Gillard began those discussions. Since then, prime minister Key made it very clear, as did his two successors, including prime minister Ardern. The government needs to, once again, needs to have an outcome focus here. They\u2019re all interested in the politics and in conflict. They need to be concerned about an outcome. They haven\u2019t been. And it\u2019s not surprising that the crossbenchers would have a look at what the government\u2019s rhetoric was, about what would happen if medevac was introduced and what has actually happened. Q: Would that deal make the legislation more palatable for Labor? AA: Well, we think that medevac is working. And we think that the government, if it wants to resolve the issue, we think that it needs to work out third-party settlement options. There\u2019s one that has very clearly been available for some time, in New Zealand. And that would resolve the issue because no one would need to be transferred to anywhere from Nauru or Manus because there wouldn\u2019t be people on there. Thanks very much. The Australian Council of Social Services is releasing a survey today, showing the impact of the low rate of Newstart on younger people: The National Union of Students, YOUNG Campaigns, and the Australian Council of Social Service, will today launch a joint report exposing the alarming rates of deprivation among young people currently receiving Youth Allowance and Newstart. The report is the result of a survey 892 people aged between 16-30 who are currently receiving an allowance. Key findings from the survey include: - over 60% of respondents have less than $14 a day left after paying their rent, - over half have couched-surfed or used other unstable forms of accommodation, - more than 9 in 10 skip meals - more than 1 in 3 have withdrawn from their studies because of a lack of funds That will be around 11am And a recap of the whole Angus Taylor day, yesterday, from Katharine Murphy: Scott Morrison has rebuffed an invitation by Labor to release any officials\u2019 notes of his conversation with the New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller, and insisted there was nothing inappropriate about approaching the police chief while he was investigating the conduct of one of his ministers, Angus Taylor. Morrison mocked Labor for pursuing the propriety of the call in question time on Wednesday, declaring no objections were raised by the opposition on Tuesday when he flagged his plan to make contact with Fuller. The prime minister also accused Labor of double standards, declaring both Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten faced police probes and did not vacate their posts. But Morrison ran into trouble later on Wednesday when it emerged he had misled the House by incorrectly attributing a comment about the historical police investigation into Gillard to the detective handling her matter, when the comment had been made by Sydney talkback radio host Ben Fordham. This quote from the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, which was mentioned by Scott Morrison in question time yesterday, is also raising some eyebrows. Fuller said he expected the Angus Taylor investigation to be wrapped up quickly: I just gave him an assurance that we would move the matter as quickly as possible and I didn\u2019t say that was because of any particular person. To be honest with you, these types of investigations can consume an enormous amount of resources from New South Wales police and they area great diverter of my time. There is a whole range of reasons why I want the matter finished quickly but professionally and many of those are selfish. Labor will move to suspend standing orders at the start of parliament \u2013 Anthony Albanese said yesterday he wanted Scott Morrison to front the parliament to correct the record, rather than just send in the letter and, well, we know how that will end. So I would say the smart money would be on an immediate suspension. Anthony Albanese: Well, what\u2019s extraordinary is that the prime minister uses a 2GB presenter\u2019s comments, purportedly to be from a Victorian detective, against former prime minister Julia Gillard. What should have occurred here is that minister Taylor\u2019s position is, quite frankly, untenable in terms of the deliberate mislead of the parliament. What Westminster requires \u2013 and these people are supposed to be conservatives, they\u2019re supposed to respect tradition \u2013 the fact is that you mislead parliament when you\u2019re a minister, you end your ministerial career. That\u2019s what should happen here. We now have a police investigation. There are three issues, potential breaches, here, two of which are punishable by 10 years in prison. Anthony Albanese has stopped by doors \u2013 which is something he does when he feels like he has something to say to kick the day off. It is unusual for the leader to drop by doors (named because they are tiny press conferences held as the MPs enter the building \u2013 but because there are so many ways to enter the building, including ways where you don\u2019t have to go through the doors and can avoid the media if you so wish. So if an MP wanders past the doors, it is because they have something to say publicly). It\u2019s about Angus Taylor, because of course it is. The prime minister should this morning at 9.30 come into the parliament, correct the record in person, and apologise for misleading parliament yesterday, when instead of the quote that he used allegedly from a Victorian detective, it was actually from a 2GB presenter. An extraordinary error in a pre-prepared answer, word for word, extensive quotes used to attack former prime minister Julia Gillard. It just shows yet again the lack of judgment that\u2019s been on display for all to see from this prime minister when placed under pressure. This is a prime minister who doesn\u2019t want scrutiny from the media. He doesn\u2019t want scrutiny from the parliament. He thinks that he can just bluff his way through everything, shutting down debate, as he has done consistently. And remember where this began. This began with a minister in the third scandal in which he\u2019s been involved in just this year, saying that in a letter to Clover Moore that there had been $15m of travel, $14m from her and her fellow councillors on the Sydney city council, with the documentation that we know wasn\u2019t downloaded from the City of Sydney website, even though that is what he said to parliament. On Monday he repeated that in a letter that he tabled. A deliberate mislead, which is ongoing. This minister has had over 80 days now to actually say who gave this document, how was it formed, how is it that he came to refer to it in the letter to Clover Moore. And yet we\u2019ve seen no explanation, just an attempt to cover up, dismiss. And now we have a prime minister ringing the New South Wales police commissioner on the very day that the investigation, Strike Force Garrad, was launched. And in circumstances whereby, in the media release, they said, \u201cNo further comments would be made about the strike force,\u201d and yet the prime minister told parliament that he discussed the substance of the investigation with the New South Wales police commissioner. And there\u2019s a big gap between what the New South Wales police commissioner is saying happened with that conversation and what the prime minister told parliament. Jacqui Lambie is still not confirming anything about what her \u201cone condition\u201d is. Rebekha Sharkie on RN: I think that in this case, given that on Monday, members of the parliament asked for Angus Taylor to speak to the parliament about what he knows about the the actual document and the document that he referred to in his letter to Clover Moore and to detail to the the parliament the circumstances around how he obtained that document. Angus Tyler did not accept that request. And now we\u2019ve come to a point where we understand the conversations been had between the prime minister and the police commissioner on the day that an investigation was announced \u2026 I think if the prime minister releases his transcript that will certainly shed some light on the conversation. If the if the conversation is as the prime minister says, which I\u2019m sure it is, it would would then provide that clarity and that confidence needed within the parliament. The Centre Alliance lower house MP, Rebekha Sharkie, is speaking to ABC radio about how the Angus Taylor saga is just further proof that Australia needs a federal Icac. She also wants the prime minister to release his transcript of his phone call with the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, to put to bed any lingering questions. Christopher Knaus spoke to David Ipp about Scott Morrison\u2019s phone call to Mick Fuller: Former anti-corruption commissioner and senior judge David Ipp says Scott Morrison\u2019s phone call to the New South Wales police chief appears to be an inappropriate attempt to use his position to make a political decision. Ipp, who served on the NSW court of appeal and as an Independent Commission Against Corruption commissioner, said the call was clearly not appropriate. He said it appears to have been made to aid Morrison\u2019s party-political decision making, rather than the interest of the state. \u201cAn ordinary citizen would not be able to get that information from the police \u2026 so what is it about the prime minister that entitles him to that information?\u201d Ipp told Guardian Australia. The ensuring integrity bill didn\u2019t pass last night because there are a truckload of amendments that need to go through, but it will. Pretty much every single Labor senator has something to say about it, with the opposition pointing to repealing it if it wins the next election. But One Nation and Centre Alliance are on board, and that is enough. We enter the fifth last sitting day of the year still talking about Angus Taylor, with a big dose of Scott Morrison as well. The prime minister was forced to correct the record after attributing a 2GB Sydney radio host Ben Fordham quote to Victorian police during question time yesterday. Morrison had said that a Victorian detective had said Julia Gillard \u201cis under investigation by police, this is a fact\u201d in 2013 as part of a defence arguing that Labor ministers had not stepped aside during police investigations. But after reporting from the Australian, which showed the quote was actually from Fordham talking about the issue during a radio broadcast, Morrison was forced to write to the Speaker and admit his mistake. Labor is not letting it go. The government is still trying to talk about the economy but it has lost the entire week to this, with each press conference and question time taken up with defending Taylor. Morrison\u2019s judgment, in making a phone call to NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, about the investigation has also pulled the prime minister into the saga. Both Fuller and Morrison say there was nothing untoward about the call, and that Morrison had received information which was already available in the public domain. But a political leader calling a police commissioner about an investigation into one of his MPs is not a great look, and the defence \u2013 I told you I was going to do it \u2013 isn\u2019t helping matters. Labor wants the phone call documents. That\u2019ll drag on throughout today. There are also the negotiations over medevac. Jacqui Lambie said she would vote for the repeal on one condition but won\u2019t say what the condition is. The government knows but the public doesn\u2019t. Nine newspapers are reporting it is the government accepting the New Zealand offer to resettle some of the Manus Island and Nauru asylum seekers. We couldn\u2019t confirm that yesterday, with nothing ruled in or out. We\u2019ll have all of the ongoing shenanigans and whatever else happens in this increasingly insane place. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp are with you. I\u2019ve had three coffees and am looking for my fourth. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

Political engagement could also re-energise religious institutions, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are [religious leaders] whose first commandment is \u2018Thou shalt not offend.\u2019 Then they wonder why young people don\u2019t come to <em>shul</em> [synagogue]. Synagogues that are thriving have a very clear engagement with justice issues. I have young people by the hordes coming to my shul because we\u2019re offering serious study, we\u2019re wrestling with deep issues and we\u2019re asking big questions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you go to shul, you should have your heart cracked open, you should be weeping, your hands should be shaking \u2013 and you should walk out energised and ready to get to work. If not, why go?

Feminism taught us that the personal is political. My own experience of facing homophobic discrimination, and having to work hard to marry my husband and protect my family, has shaped for me how vital and important this work is.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, faith-based political activism could be \u201crisky and problematic\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is not for the faint of heart. You lose 27 times before you win.\u201d</p> <p>But increasing numbers of faith leaders were engaging in the struggle for justice, he said. More than 2,000 rabbis, for example, have joined <a href=\"https://www.truah.org/about/\">T\u2019ruah</a>, a network dedicated to advancing human rights in North America, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.</p> <p>\u201cMy children and future grandchildren will ask me what I was doing in this moment of great moral crisis,\u201d Latz said. \u201cEvery generation faces a moment of moral conscience and it has to decide what side of history it will fall on. We have one life to live, and we have the power to make the world more whole.\u201d</p>",

If you\u2019re not for moral, humane, comprehensive immigration reform, you are tacitly supporting ripping babies from their parents\u2019 arms at our border.\u201d A network of more than 80 synagogues in the US has offered sanctuary to undocumented migrants. \u201cWe have people living in basements and attics,\u201d Latz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s vital and important holy work, and we are called to do it.\u201d In Minnesota, faith organisations lobbied for legislation to prevent schools from expelling or suspending children under 12 for nonviolent offences. \u201cIt may not sound much,\u201d Latz said, \u201cbut the vast majority of kids who were suspended were children of colour, and there is a direct correlation between being suspended at the age of 10 and landing in prison. So by changing the policy we are stopping the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d He added: \u201cThe next level we\u2019re working on \u2013 which is much harder \u2013 is changing the tax codes in the state, so people who make more contribute more.\u201d Tax reforms instituted by \u201cour dreadful miscreant of a president\u201d have given \u201chorrific tax breaks to people who are obscenely wealthy already\u201d, Latz said. In the present political climate, he added, \u201cwe are acutely aware of how fragile our structures of democracy are, of how technology can be used to undermine democracy. The lines being drawn in society are so bright.\u201d Latz rejected the viewpoint that faith leaders should stay out of politics, saying being political was not the same as being partisan. Political engagement could also re-energise religious institutions, he said. \u201cThere are [religious leaders] whose first commandment is \u2018Thou shalt not offend.\u2019 Then they wonder why young people don\u2019t come to shul [synagogue]. Synagogues that are thriving have a very clear engagement with justice issues. I have young people by the hordes coming to my shul because we\u2019re offering serious study, we\u2019re wrestling with deep issues and we\u2019re asking big questions. \u201cWhen you go to shul, you should have your heart cracked open, you should be weeping, your hands should be shaking \u2013 and you should walk out energised and ready to get to work. If not, why go? Go watch a movie or get a mani-pedi instead.\u201d Latz, 49, who has two children with his husband, said being a gay rabbi was \u201cnot so unusual\u201d these days. \u201cMy commitment to justice comes out of being a gay man and a Jew. Feminism taught us that the personal is political. My own experience of facing homophobic discrimination, and having to work hard to marry my husband and protect my family, has shaped for me how vital and important this work is.\u201d Nevertheless, faith-based political activism could be \u201crisky and problematic\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is not for the faint of heart. You lose 27 times before you win.\u201d But increasing numbers of faith leaders were engaging in the struggle for justice, he said. More than 2,000 rabbis, for example, have joined T\u2019ruah, a network dedicated to advancing human rights in North America, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. \u201cMy children and future grandchildren will ask me what I was doing in this moment of great moral crisis,\u201d Latz said. \u201cEvery generation faces a moment of moral conscience and it has to decide what side of history it will fall on. We have one life to live, and we have the power to make the world more whole.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One of the many unpredictable factors of the 2019 election is the surge in new voter registration. More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/voter-registration-rise-boosts-labours-election-hopes\">three million people</a> have applied to join the electoral roll since the December polling day was announced, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50544602\">and one-third of them</a> are under the age of 25.</p> <p>Large numbers of these young people are likely to be students registering at their university addresses, including influential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/first-time-voters-hold-key-in-56-marginals-analysis-intergenerational-foundation\">first-time voters</a>.</p> <p>In some areas, their impact may only be to increase majorities in existing Labour safe-seats. In others, <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/will-the-student-vote-swing-a-december-election/\">students heading home for the Christmas holidays</a> may mute any expected effect.</p> <p>But there is still a number of important marginals where university populations may hold the balance of power. Here are ten battles where their votes could be crucial.</p> <h2><strong>1. University of St. Andrews</strong></h2> <p><strong>Constituency: North East Fife</strong></p> <p><strong>SNP majority: 2</strong></p> <p>If you\u2019re a student in North East Fife, you probably live in the marginal of all marginals. The Liberal Democrats have improved their Scottish polling numbers since the 2017 election and hope to win the seat back for the first time since 2010, but it isn\u2019t clear that young voters will be queuing up to help them do so.</p> <h2>2. University of Southampton, Solent</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Southampton Itchen</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/27/this-time-we-all-have-to-vote-southampton-residents-relate-their-concerns\">'This time we all have to vote': the view from ultra-marginal Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Conservative majority: 31</strong></p> <p>Southampton Itchen sits at the top of Labour\u2019s list of target seats, having missed out on taking it in 2017 by a mere 31 votes. Students at both Southhampton and Solent universities will be essential to the party if it is to win in a constituency where 60% voted to leave the EU.</p> <h2>3. University of Stirling</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Stirling</strong></p> <p><strong>Conservative majority: 148</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of ultra-marginals to be found in Scotland; and while the SNP will have its eye on winning back Stirling, the Conservative party has been <a href=\"https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/polls_scot.html\">doing </a><a href=\"https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/polls_scot.html\">better in Scottish polls</a> than many expected at the start of the campaign. The SNP will need to mobilise all the student votes they can.</p> <h2>4. University of Suffolk</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Ipswich</strong></p> <p><strong>Labour majority: 831</strong></p> <p>Labour won Ipswich from the Conservatives\u2019 Benedict Gummer in 2017, defeating him by just 0.03% of the vote. Whether Gummer can win it back this time around could be down to the 5,000+ students at the University of Suffolk.</p> <h2>5. University of Glasgow</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Glasgow North</strong></p> <p><strong>SNP majority of 1,060</strong></p> <p>The SNP will expect to hold on to Glasgow North, but a lot will depend on whether students living in the constituency back the independence party or Labour, which has seen its overall support in Scotland <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18025397.snp-voter-support-scotland-42-labour-backing-collapses-poll/\">appear to collapse</a>.</p> <h2>6. Middlesex University</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Hendon</strong></p> <p><strong>Conservative</strong> <strong>majority: 1,072</strong></p> <p>Middlesex University has a student body of almost 20,000, making up a huge chunk of Hendon\u2019s diverse electorate. If they vote in large numbers they could well win the seat for Labour for the first time since 2005. However, <a href=\"https://www.markpack.org.uk/160336/2019-general-election-constituency-opinion-polls/\">a recent poll</a> saw the Conservatives pulling further ahead as previous Labour voters indicated support for the Liberal Democrats.</p> <h2>7. University of Lincoln</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Lincoln</strong></p> <p><strong>Labour majority: 1,538</strong></p> <p>Lincoln is a leave-voting marginal and will be one of Labour\u2019s many tricky defences on election day when they may see their vote squeezed by both the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. The party\u2019s hopes of holding on to the seat could lie at the feet of Lincoln\u2019s students, who are likely to vote mostly in Labour\u2019s favour.</p> <h2>8. University of Roehampton</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Putney</strong></p> <p><strong>Conservative majority: 1,554</strong></p> <p>Putney was held by Justine Greening of the Conservatives, but a fallout over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan saw her lose the whip and subsequently decide not to stand for re-election. It\u2019s a tough seat to call, having voted heavily to remain part of the EU. It could go to the Lib Dems, Labour, or neither. How Roehampton students vote \u2013 and how many \u2013 could be key.</p> <h2>9. University of Northampton</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Northampton South</strong></p> <p><strong>Conservative majority: 1,554</strong></p> <p>Taking leave-voting Northampton South could be a long shot for Labour, which hasn\u2019t won there since 2001. But if it has any hope of doing so, the strategy must lie with persuading a large number of the University of Northampton\u2019s 12,000 students to vote Labour.</p> <h2>10. University of Wolverhampton</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Wolverhampton South West</strong></p> <p><strong>Labour majority: 2,185</strong></p> <p>The Conservatives are taking aim at all of Wolverhampton\u2019s constituencies this election, with a strong pro-Brexit message at the heart of their strategy. But it <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/11/wolverhampton-south-west-love-brexit-may-not-be-enough-turn-seat-blue\">may not be enough</a> in this particular seat, where a large student population will work in favour of Labour\u2019s Eleanor Smith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/should-you-vote-at-home-or-at-uni-students\">Students: will your vote be more effective at home or university?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The wildcard: </strong>University of Bristol</h2> <p><strong>Constituency: Bristol West</strong></p> <p><strong>Labour majority: 37,997</strong></p> <p>You might think that Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire couldn\u2019t be in a safer seat, after defending it in 2017 with a thumping majority of 37,997. But the Green party has been eyeing it up since its strong second place in the 2015 election, and there are signs it may cause an upset. The Liberal Democrats have stood their candidate down, leaving the Greens as the only Remain party on the ticket in a constituency where almost 80% voted to stay in the EU. And in the 2019 European elections, the Greens won the popular vote in Bristol, taking over 35% of all ballots cast. The votes of Bristol\u2019s students could be a crucial factor.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 29 November 2019 because the Green\u2019s Carla Denyer is the only Remain party ticket in Bristol West, but she is not the only Remainer candidate standing in the constituency as an earlier version said.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "One of the many unpredictable factors of the 2019 election is the surge in new voter registration. More than three million people have applied to join the electoral roll since the December polling day was announced, and one-third of them are under the age of 25. Large numbers of these young people are likely to be students registering at their university addresses, including influential first-time voters. In some areas, their impact may only be to increase majorities in existing Labour safe-seats. In others, students heading home for the Christmas holidays may mute any expected effect. But there is still a number of important marginals where university populations may hold the balance of power. Here are ten battles where their votes could be crucial. 1. University of St. Andrews Constituency: North East Fife SNP majority: 2 If you\u2019re a student in North East Fife, you probably live in the marginal of all marginals. The Liberal Democrats have improved their Scottish polling numbers since the 2017 election and hope to win the seat back for the first time since 2010, but it isn\u2019t clear that young voters will be queuing up to help them do so. 2. University of Southampton, Solent Constituency: Southampton Itchen Conservative majority: 31 Southampton Itchen sits at the top of Labour\u2019s list of target seats, having missed out on taking it in 2017 by a mere 31 votes. Students at both Southhampton and Solent universities will be essential to the party if it is to win in a constituency where 60% voted to leave the EU. 3. University of Stirling Constituency: Stirling Conservative majority: 148 There\u2019s no shortage of ultra-marginals to be found in Scotland; and while the SNP will have its eye on winning back Stirling, the Conservative party has been doing better in Scottish polls than many expected at the start of the campaign. The SNP will need to mobilise all the student votes they can. 4. University of Suffolk Constituency: Ipswich Labour majority: 831 Labour won Ipswich from the Conservatives\u2019 Benedict Gummer in 2017, defeating him by just 0.03% of the vote. Whether Gummer can win it back this time around could be down to the 5,000+ students at the University of Suffolk. 5. University of Glasgow Constituency: Glasgow North SNP majority of 1,060 The SNP will expect to hold on to Glasgow North, but a lot will depend on whether students living in the constituency back the independence party or Labour, which has seen its overall support in Scotland appear to collapse. 6. Middlesex University Constituency: Hendon Conservative majority: 1,072 Middlesex University has a student body of almost 20,000, making up a huge chunk of Hendon\u2019s diverse electorate. If they vote in large numbers they could well win the seat for Labour for the first time since 2005. However, a recent poll saw the Conservatives pulling further ahead as previous Labour voters indicated support for the Liberal Democrats. 7. University of Lincoln Constituency: Lincoln Labour majority: 1,538 Lincoln is a leave-voting marginal and will be one of Labour\u2019s many tricky defences on election day when they may see their vote squeezed by both the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. The party\u2019s hopes of holding on to the seat could lie at the feet of Lincoln\u2019s students, who are likely to vote mostly in Labour\u2019s favour. 8. University of Roehampton Constituency: Putney Conservative majority: 1,554 Putney was held by Justine Greening of the Conservatives, but a fallout over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan saw her lose the whip and subsequently decide not to stand for re-election. It\u2019s a tough seat to call, having voted heavily to remain part of the EU. It could go to the Lib Dems, Labour, or neither. How Roehampton students vote \u2013 and how many \u2013 could be key. 9. University of Northampton Constituency: Northampton South Conservative majority: 1,554 Taking leave-voting Northampton South could be a long shot for Labour, which hasn\u2019t won there since 2001. But if it has any hope of doing so, the strategy must lie with persuading a large number of the University of Northampton\u2019s 12,000 students to vote Labour. 10. University of Wolverhampton Constituency: Wolverhampton South West Labour majority: 2,185 The Conservatives are taking aim at all of Wolverhampton\u2019s constituencies this election, with a strong pro-Brexit message at the heart of their strategy. But it may not be enough in this particular seat, where a large student population will work in favour of Labour\u2019s Eleanor Smith. The wildcard: University of Bristol Constituency: Bristol West Labour majority: 37,997 You might think that Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire couldn\u2019t be in a safer seat, after defending it in 2017 with a thumping majority of 37,997. But the Green party has been eyeing it up since its strong second place in the 2015 election, and there are signs it may cause an upset. The Liberal Democrats have stood their candidate down, leaving the Greens as the only Remain party on the ticket in a constituency where almost 80% voted to stay in the EU. And in the 2019 European elections, the Greens won the popular vote in Bristol, taking over 35% of all ballots cast. The votes of Bristol\u2019s students could be a crucial factor. This article was amended on 29 November 2019 because the Green\u2019s Carla Denyer is the only Remain party ticket in Bristol West, but she is not the only Remainer candidate standing in the constituency as an earlier version said.",

Despite high profile promises by the country\u2019s best known supermarkets to tackle the amount of plastic waste they create, their plastic footprint continues to rise, according to research from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and Greenpeace. In 2018, supermarkets put an estimated 903,000 tonnes of plastic packaging onto the market, an increase of 17,000 tonnes on the 2017 footprint.

Also, I currently just use Windows\u2019 built-in security, but wondered whether I should look for something else.</p> <p>Initially, it would just be me, but if things go well then I may have another two or three people helping. I\u2019m assuming I can just scale up any security measures as the need arises. <strong>Allen</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Technology manufacturers cater to two very large markets with different needs: home users and businesses. You\u2019re about to enter the SoHo (small office, home office) market where home technologies dominate because most single traders don\u2019t need proper business systems with all the extra costs and complications involved.</p> <p>Some complications are unavoidable. These include, as you know, backup and security, plus things like coping with data protection requirements. But as you will be a startup business working from home, I suggest using home technologies as far as possible. You can move to a business-oriented approach when you need to expand. When that time comes, you will have a much better idea of what you actually need.</p> <p>However, note that the Home and Personal versions of Office 365 are not licensed for commercial use, even though many people don\u2019t know about or ignore this restriction. If you\u2019re on a Home version, consider switching to one of the <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-gb/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?&amp;activetab=tab:primaryr2\">small business versions</a> (up to 300 users), if only for the 24/7 support.</p> <p>Office 365 Business Essentials is the cheapest because it doesn\u2019t include the desktop Microsoft Office programs, which Office 365 Business does. In the long run, Office 365 Business Premium is the best option because it includes business-class email with your own domain name via Microsoft Exchange. It also includes a calendar and booking feature, SharePoint and Teams collaboration software (<a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Teams</a> is Microsoft\u2019s rival to <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/\">Slack</a>), invoicing, and a lightweight CRM (customer relationship management) program.</p> <h2><strong>Anti-malware solutions</strong></h2> <p>There are many things to consider when choosing anti-malware software. How good is it at protecting your PC? Does it create other problems by making your PC slower or by blocking things unnecessarily? (File blocking and \u201cfalse positives\u201d can be really annoying.) How valuable are the things you need to protect? What are the risks? How much does it cost?</p> <p>Microsoft Defender (formerly Windows Defender) is good enough for most home users and many business users. I use it myself. It doesn\u2019t offer the maximum protection, but it rarely causes any problems, and it\u2019s free.</p> <p>Some people should consider paying for extra protection. For example, they may have data that is particularly valuable, because they work for a financial institution or whatever. They may be potential targets because they work for a non-governmental organisation or, for example, the Dalai Lama. They may be at greater risk because they surf hacking sites or the dark web, or because a lack of understanding leads them to do stupid things. People who have the best AV software can still get their PCs infected by attacks based on scam emails and/or fake websites and \u201csocial engineering\u201d. You can email people password-protected viruses and persuade some of them to decrypt and run the files.</p> <p>Paid-for anti-virus suites try to improve on or offer utilities that Windows lacks. These can include password managers, real-time protection based on scanning background processes, anti-phishing and anti-ransomware features, controlling access to USB ports and external drives, botnet protection and network monitoring. Some of these are useful to small businesses where PCs are used by staff who are not computer experts. Kaspersky\u2019s promotional blog post, <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/the-ten-most-important-features-of-kaspersky-small-office-security/14908/\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/the-ten-most-important-features-of-kaspersky-small-office-security/14908/\">10 most important features of Kaspersky Small Office Security</a>, will give you an overview.</p> <p>There are plenty of reviews of anti-virus products for small business on sites such as <a href=\"https://windowsreport.com/security-software-small-business/\">Windows Report</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/buying-guides/best-antivirus-software-for-business/\">Digital Trends</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/best-antivirus\">Tech Radar</a>. The consensus is that Bitdefender for Business is probably your best bet, and good value. Kaspersky Small Office Security for Business and the Avast Endpoint Protection Suite Plus are also worth a serious look. You can usually get a free trial period so have a quick look at the suites you fancy, preferably on a spare PC.</p> <p>Oddly enough, having a good, trusted backup is also a good form of anti-virus protection. Ransomware doesn\u2019t work on people who know all their data is safely stored offline.</p> <h2><strong>Cloud-based security</strong></h2> <p>Note that pretty much every effective computer security system, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection-uses-cloud-power-to-figure-out-youve-been-pwned/\">including Microsoft\u2019s</a>, now uses the cloud to store, update and check virus signatures, and <a href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/32842/benefits-of-ai-and-machine-learning-for-cloud-security\">Cloud AI</a> to analyse suspicious processes. Some things \u2013 digital fingerprints or even whole files \u2013 may be uploaded for extra checking. I don\u2019t regard this as a threat to privacy and, frankly, I think it\u2019s stupid to block it.</p> <p>Cloud systems lighten the load on the local PC, and as <a href=\"https://www.webroot.com/gb/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-cloud-antivirus\">Webroot</a> showed roughly a decade ago, provide better protection. Companies with \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)\">honeypot</a>\u201d PCs and continuous updates from millions of users can spot and deal with new and emerging threats long before they reach your PC. As a result, a growing number of companies are now marketing <a href=\"https://www.avast.com/en-gb/business/solutions/cloud-antivirus\">Cloud Antivirus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/free-cloud-antivirus\">Security Cloud</a> software. This is clearly where the AV industry is heading.</p> <h2><strong>Simple backups</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been writing about backups for decades, and you can get most of the information you need from earlier answers. Two appropriate ones, in this case, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/aug/28/the-best-way-to-back-up-data\">What is the best way to back up data?</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/11/data-safety-online-drives-back-up-google-drive-dropbox\">Is my data safe in online drives, or should I back it up as well?</a></p> <p>In brief, you should have backups of all your business data on different media (choose between hard drives, optical discs, SD cards, online and so on) and in different places, in case you are burgled or your house burns down. OneDrive should provide an online/off-site backup of all your business data, but I\u2019d still want some form of backup stored outside your house.</p> <p>However, at this stage, I would not buy a NAS (network-attached storage) device. You don\u2019t need one. You could justify a NAS if, for example, you wanted to stream media files to half a dozen laptops and smartphones, or your business depended on several people sharing files at once. For your purposes, the extra complexity and cost don\u2019t make sense.</p> <p>In any case, a NAS is not, by itself, a very good backup. You would certainly want to back it up to an external hard drive. Instead, just use one external hard drive to back up your PC, and a second external hard drive to back that up.</p> <h2><strong>Business recovery</strong></h2> <p>What you really need is a business recovery system. If something failed, how long would it take you to get back up and running?

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m looking to set up a small business working from home, and would like some advice on back up and security measures. I have an Office 365 account so my main directory for saving documents will be OneDrive. I was looking to back up on a Synology NAS drive, perhaps to two separate hard drives as a precaution. Also, I currently just use Windows\u2019 built-in security, but wondered whether I should look for something else. Initially, it would just be me, but if things go well then I may have another two or three people helping. I\u2019m assuming I can just scale up any security measures as the need arises. Allen Technology manufacturers cater to two very large markets with different needs: home users and businesses. You\u2019re about to enter the SoHo (small office, home office) market where home technologies dominate because most single traders don\u2019t need proper business systems with all the extra costs and complications involved. Some complications are unavoidable. These include, as you know, backup and security, plus things like coping with data protection requirements. But as you will be a startup business working from home, I suggest using home technologies as far as possible. You can move to a business-oriented approach when you need to expand. When that time comes, you will have a much better idea of what you actually need. However, note that the Home and Personal versions of Office 365 are not licensed for commercial use, even though many people don\u2019t know about or ignore this restriction. If you\u2019re on a Home version, consider switching to one of the small business versions (up to 300 users), if only for the 24/7 support. Office 365 Business Essentials is the cheapest because it doesn\u2019t include the desktop Microsoft Office programs, which Office 365 Business does. In the long run, Office 365 Business Premium is the best option because it includes business-class email with your own domain name via Microsoft Exchange. It also includes a calendar and booking feature, SharePoint and Teams collaboration software (Teams is Microsoft\u2019s rival to Slack), invoicing, and a lightweight CRM (customer relationship management) program. Anti-malware solutions There are many things to consider when choosing anti-malware software. How good is it at protecting your PC? Does it create other problems by making your PC slower or by blocking things unnecessarily? (File blocking and \u201cfalse positives\u201d can be really annoying.) How valuable are the things you need to protect? What are the risks? How much does it cost? Microsoft Defender (formerly Windows Defender) is good enough for most home users and many business users. I use it myself. It doesn\u2019t offer the maximum protection, but it rarely causes any problems, and it\u2019s free. Some people should consider paying for extra protection. For example, they may have data that is particularly valuable, because they work for a financial institution or whatever. They may be potential targets because they work for a non-governmental organisation or, for example, the Dalai Lama. They may be at greater risk because they surf hacking sites or the dark web, or because a lack of understanding leads them to do stupid things. People who have the best AV software can still get their PCs infected by attacks based on scam emails and/or fake websites and \u201csocial engineering\u201d. You can email people password-protected viruses and persuade some of them to decrypt and run the files. Paid-for anti-virus suites try to improve on or offer utilities that Windows lacks. These can include password managers, real-time protection based on scanning background processes, anti-phishing and anti-ransomware features, controlling access to USB ports and external drives, botnet protection and network monitoring. Some of these are useful to small businesses where PCs are used by staff who are not computer experts. Kaspersky\u2019s promotional blog post, The 10 most important features of Kaspersky Small Office Security, will give you an overview. There are plenty of reviews of anti-virus products for small business on sites such as Windows Report, Digital Trends and Tech Radar. The consensus is that Bitdefender for Business is probably your best bet, and good value. Kaspersky Small Office Security for Business and the Avast Endpoint Protection Suite Plus are also worth a serious look. You can usually get a free trial period so have a quick look at the suites you fancy, preferably on a spare PC. Oddly enough, having a good, trusted backup is also a good form of anti-virus protection. Ransomware doesn\u2019t work on people who know all their data is safely stored offline. Cloud-based security Note that pretty much every effective computer security system, including Microsoft\u2019s, now uses the cloud to store, update and check virus signatures, and Cloud AI to analyse suspicious processes. Some things \u2013 digital fingerprints or even whole files \u2013 may be uploaded for extra checking. I don\u2019t regard this as a threat to privacy and, frankly, I think it\u2019s stupid to block it. Cloud systems lighten the load on the local PC, and as Webroot showed roughly a decade ago, provide better protection. Companies with \u201choneypot\u201d PCs and continuous updates from millions of users can spot and deal with new and emerging threats long before they reach your PC. As a result, a growing number of companies are now marketing Cloud Antivirus or Security Cloud software. This is clearly where the AV industry is heading. Simple backups I\u2019ve been writing about backups for decades, and you can get most of the information you need from earlier answers. Two appropriate ones, in this case, are What is the best way to back up data? and Is my data safe in online drives, or should I back it up as well? In brief, you should have backups of all your business data on different media (choose between hard drives, optical discs, SD cards, online and so on) and in different places, in case you are burgled or your house burns down. OneDrive should provide an online/off-site backup of all your business data, but I\u2019d still want some form of backup stored outside your house. However, at this stage, I would not buy a NAS (network-attached storage) device. You don\u2019t need one. You could justify a NAS if, for example, you wanted to stream media files to half a dozen laptops and smartphones, or your business depended on several people sharing files at once. For your purposes, the extra complexity and cost don\u2019t make sense. In any case, a NAS is not, by itself, a very good backup. You would certainly want to back it up to an external hard drive. Instead, just use one external hard drive to back up your PC, and a second external hard drive to back that up. Business recovery What you really need is a business recovery system. If something failed, how long would it take you to get back up and running? How long a delay is acceptable? I have a desktop PC with all the files on the hard drive synchronised to an external USB hard drive using FreeFileSync, backed up to a second external hard drive. These files are not compressed or encrypted so they don\u2019t need to be restored. If my desktop\u2019s hard drive fails \u2013 which it has done \u2013 then I can switch to a laptop, plug in one of the external monitors, the keyboard and the external hard drive, and carry on as normal in 10-15 minutes. Of course, I had to spend some time the next day installing a new hard drive and restoring my old system from a different backup \u2013 a big, digital blob \u2013 but I could do that at my leisure. It didn\u2019t affect my work.

(My whole work directory of about 10,500 files takes up 3GB.) It might be harder for people with more complicated setups, but should be easier for you if everything is in OneDrive. You might even be able to manage with the online versions of the Microsoft Office programs. Business recovery is a much broader concept than backups. It involves going through your business processes and working out what you would do if any hardware, software or communications link failed, or if you were hacked, or hit by some type of natural disaster. Companies that don\u2019t have viable business recovery strategies can easily go out of business. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, we\u2019re now exactly two weeks out from the vote. Today the climate crisis is high on the agenda \u2013 Labour will unveil its environment policies, there is the leaders\u2019 TV climate debate tonight, and all of this comes after a warning from scientists that the world may already have crossed a series of tipping points meaning \u201cwe are in a state of planetary emergency\u201d. Make sure to keep on top of politics at our live blog. What\u2019s going on? Jeremy Corbyn will be in Southampton where he will set out the party\u2019s environment policies, including the planting of 2bn trees by 2040. Labour also plans to create 10 new national parks as part of a rewilding policy to tackle the climate emergency. The proposals also include an investment of \u00a31.2bn to restore habitats such as woodlands and peat bogs in England, and extra funding for national park authorities. Tonight the leaders of most parties \u2013 as far as we know, Boris Johnson has not accepted the invitation \u2013 will participate in a Channel 4 debate on climate issues. At this stage Nigel Farage also appears to be a non-starter. One plank of Labour\u2019s energy policy is under fire today, as lawyers have warned that the party\u2019s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control puts it on a collision course with EU laws that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers. There may be further fallout from Corbyn\u2019s deadliest line of attack in this election campaign: his claims that leaked documents show Johnson wants to sell off the NHS in a trade deal with the US. The official papers reveal US and UK officials have repeatedly discussed dismantling protections that keep NHS drug prices down as part of their negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal. Dennis Campbell and Jamie Grierson have unpacked what the dossier says and what it means. Heather Stewart writes that \u201cCorbyn had one central aim as he brandished the 451-page \u2018secret\u2019 NHS document at a hastily-arranged press conference on Wednesday: to drag the general election debate safely back into Labour\u2019s comfort zone\u201d after the antisemitism accusations\u201d. A new poll for the Times points to a thumping Conservative victory. While the Guardian is treating all polls with suspicion, read why here, the MRP poll from YouGov came closest to calling the unexpected result of the 2017 general election. The poll predicts the Conservatives will win 359 seats (42 gains), leaving Johnson with a majority of 68. Labour, meanwhile, would fall back to 211 seats \u2013 a result that would be in line with the disaster of 1983. Not everyone is happy with that message, including Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, who has told Brexit supporters that the general election is \u201cmuch tighter\u201d than polls might suggest and urged them to persuade their friends to vote Tory. At a glance Johnson has still not confirmed whether he will submit to an interview with Andrew Neil, causing consternation in the Labour camp. Both the Tories and Labour would struggle to stay in borrowing limits with their election plans, warns the Resolution Foundation. After being criticised for repeatedly refusing to apologise over antisemitism accusations, Corbyn has insisted that Labour has offered \u201cits sympathies and apologies\u201d to victims of antisemitism within the party. \u201cThere is no reason why we should be talking about anything other than how we feed and house people,\u201d said one Norwich North voter, when asked about the issues that will influence her in the election. The Guardian has unearthed a column by Johnson in which he described young people as having \u201can almost Nigerian interest in money\u201d. Aditya Chakrabortty writes that this election poses a big international question of whether the new left is yet capable of winning power. The NHS is relying on less qualified staff to plug workforce gaps because of a huge shortage of nurses, according to a new report. The latest instalment of our Brexit Watch series finds that pay growth has taken a knock as the uncertainty about Britain\u2019s future and slowing global trade dented business confidence. Two former Bank of England rate-setters debate the data. The day ahead Jo Swinson starts the day with a roundtable on homelessness in London and Corbyn will be in Southampton to announce the party\u2019s environment policies. A foreign policy debate, featuring foreign secretary Dominic Raab, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry as well as the foreign affairs spokespeople for the Lib Dems and SNP. If you\u2019re interested, that will be broadcast on Radio 4 tonight. Tonight, party leaders will participate in a debate on the climate crisis, broadcast on Channel 4. Johnson has not confirmed whether he will be there and Farage has rejected the invite, but all other parties will be attending. A quiet day for the Tories, who have no major events or announcements scheduled.

      "bodyText": "More directors may depart Westpac\u2019s board following an investigation of the bank\u2019s money laundering and child exploitation scandal by consulting firm Promontory. Westpac\u2019s board will also set up a new financial crime committee, chairman Lindsay Maxsted said. Investor pressure following bombshell legal action launched by Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency last week has forced Maxsted, along with chief executive Brian Hartzer and the head of the board risk committee, Ewen Crouch, to announce they are leaving the bank. Large investors including the industry super sector and the Future Fund are closely watching how Westpac refreshes its board in the wake of the scandal, amid market talk that more directors should resign. This is something Maxsted has resisted, telling reporters as recently as Tuesday that further defenestrations would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d. In a lawsuit lodged with the federal court last Wednesday, Austrac accused Westpac of breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws 23m times in transactions worth $11bn. It also linked Westpac\u2019s failures to thousands of money transfers to the Philippines that it said were consistent with child exploitation. In addition to lopping heads at board and executive level, the accusations also smashed Westpac\u2019s share price and triggered a raft of additional investigations from the Federal police, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. After discussions with Asic the bank has also been forced to allow mum-and-dad investors who have pledged $500m towards a $2.5bn capital raising to back out of the deal. It is believed Promontory are to start work on Thursday night. Westpac said it would also set up an advisory panel of three independent experts to consider Promontory\u2019s report. The expert panel will \u201cprovide recommendations on governance as well as board accountability\u201d. It is understood \u201cboard accountability\u201d includes the possibility more directors might fall on their swords. The Westpac board\u2019s new financial crime committee will be chaired by Peter Nash, a former KPMG partner who has been on the board since March last year. Its other members are to be Nerida Caesar, a former Telstra executive who has served on the Westpac board since September 2017, Steven Harker, an investment banker who joined the board in March, and Margaret Seale, a former publishing executive who also joined the board in March. Westpac shares were down 0.58%, to $24.665, at about 4pm on Thursday. They were changing hands for $26.55 before last Wednesday\u2019s Austrac lawsuit. As part of the capital raising, retail shareholders are able to purchase additional shares for either $25.32, which is the price institutions that have tipped $2bn into Westpac\u2019s coffers have paid, or at a 2% discount to the current share price when the offer closes on Monday. But Westpac said that \u201cfollowing discussions with Asic\u201d it had decided to allow retail shareholders who decided to buy into the capital raising before Austrac announced its lawsuit to withdraw from the deal.",

This last assumption has proven woefully naive, most especially the belief that ending segregation was synonymous with ending racism.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis wants to add another panel to the Jefferson Memorial, featuring Jefferson\u2019s views on race and slavery, as a counterweight and a reminder of the continuing tensions over race in American society.</p> <p>Ellis\u2019s chapter on John Adams is the most successful, discussing Adams\u2019s prediction that the American aristocracy would be commercial in nature, as in our new gilded age, with money awash in politics. In Ellis\u2019s view, Adams asks us to broaden our minds: \u201cThink about the word \u2018republic\u2019, which comes from the Latin meaning \u2018public things\u2019. Do we still believe, as he did, that there is a \u2018public interest\u2019 beyond the reach of majorities of the moment? Are we a society composed of winners and losers, givers and takers, or is there some larger status we share as citizens?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ellis wants to add another panel to the Jefferson Memorial, featuring Jefferson\u2019s views on race and slavery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The chapters on Madison and modern jurisprudence form a stout defense of the \u201cliving constitution\u201d (which again traces its origins to Jefferson) and sharp criticism of Antonin Scalia and \u201coriginalism\u201d, focusing on the former supreme court justice\u2019s (re)interpretation of the second amendment and gun rights in contrast to what the Framers probably understood.</p> <p>In foreign policy, Ellis helpfully reinterprets George Washington\u2019s policies on Native Americans and the British/French conflicts of the 1770s to offer a more nuanced view of Washington\u2019s presumed support for isolationism. Ellis sees this instead as the start of the realist tradition in American foreign policy in contrast to Jefferson\u2019s idealistic support for the French Revolution. Ellis stands for realism, whether in opposing Jacobins or not invading Iraq.</p> <p>Ellis writes that \u201cmy hope is that the founding era can become a safe place to gather together, not so much as to find answers to those questions as to argue about them \u2026 their greatest legacy is the recognition that the argument itself is the answer.\u201d Yet throughout his own views are crystal clear: he plumps for the liberal tradition in contrast not only to Trumpism but to most of what passes for modern conservatism, starting with Ronald Reagan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe42fe6fccf408eec01cd715427dd9c7b641f519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe42fe6fccf408eec01cd715427dd9c7b641f519/0_46_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple kiss at sunset by the Washington Monument.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A couple kiss at sunset by the Washington Monument.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To his credit, Ellis admits that \u201cobjectivity, in the sense that mathematicians or physicians use the term, is not a realistic goal for historians\u201d. The scientific reference is surely a sly echoing of Jefferson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/virginia-statute-religious-freedom\">Virginia Statute on Religious Freedom</a>, which states that \u201cour civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry\u201d. But if the goal is to encourage national dialogue not only with the past but with ourselves, that\u2019s easier if the author\u2019s thumb isn\u2019t quite so heavy on the scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/13/john-quincy-adams-jefferson-jackson-trump-the-problem-of-democracy-extract\">Adams family values: two presidents with a message for Trump's America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this sense, Ellis is not ambitious enough. Does he really believe Chief Justice John Roberts wants to repeal the school desegregation case Brown v Board of Education? The \u201cNow\u201d sections are, regrettably, sloppier than those on the Founders. Ellis succeeds more in recovering lesser-known history, such as the near abolition of slavery in the territories in 1784 and Washington\u2019s attempts at humane policies towards Native Americans.</p> <p>Despite their personal foibles, the Founders remain as reference points for modern life, not least in exposing contradictions within the American polity and psyche. At some level, this is not new. Walt Whitman wrote \u201cI contain multitudes\u201d. On the academic front, Michael Kammen covered the inherent dissonances of American society in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/People-Paradox-Concerning-Civilization-Paperbacks/dp/0801497558\">People of Paradox, in 1972</a>.</p> <p>Ellis has breathed the air of the Founders for so long that he stumbles somewhat on modern politics. But his book is necessary, and part of the tragedy is that those who need it most are less likely to read it, or to learn from it if they do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "History is misused. Perhaps worse, history is too often ignored. To address both problems, Joseph Ellis hopes to restore dialogue in national life, using the Founders as touchstones rather than infallible guides. Ellis\u2019s career has focused on writing about the Founders and he stands firmly on the side of history: \u201cThe more history you learn, the larger the memory bank you can draw on when life takes a turn for which you are otherwise unprepared.\u201d Indeed. Since 2016, US national life has certainly taken a turn for which we were otherwise unprepared, though its roots go back decades, even in some respects, such as race, beyond the founding itself. Ellis starts with Jefferson and race, writing that the Virginian, who began his career with a failed attempt to make emancipation easier, was \u201cthoroughly embedded in the twin American dilemmas of slavery and racism \u2026 our most eloquent \u2018apostle of freedom\u2019 is also our most dedicated racist, and \u2026 in his mind, those two convictions were inseparable\u201d. Jefferson could simply not imagine a biracial America, despite his longtime romance with Sally Hemings, his slave, though he freed her children. Following the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s, \u201c[t]he new narrative featured the upside of the Jeffersonian legacy while dismissing the downside as a premodern vestige of values that were now, at last, gone with the proverbial wind. This last assumption has proven woefully naive, most especially the belief that ending segregation was synonymous with ending racism.\u201d Ellis wants to add another panel to the Jefferson Memorial, featuring Jefferson\u2019s views on race and slavery, as a counterweight and a reminder of the continuing tensions over race in American society. Ellis\u2019s chapter on John Adams is the most successful, discussing Adams\u2019s prediction that the American aristocracy would be commercial in nature, as in our new gilded age, with money awash in politics. In Ellis\u2019s view, Adams asks us to broaden our minds: \u201cThink about the word \u2018republic\u2019, which comes from the Latin meaning \u2018public things\u2019. Do we still believe, as he did, that there is a \u2018public interest\u2019 beyond the reach of majorities of the moment? Are we a society composed of winners and losers, givers and takers, or is there some larger status we share as citizens?\u201d The chapters on Madison and modern jurisprudence form a stout defense of the \u201cliving constitution\u201d (which again traces its origins to Jefferson) and sharp criticism of Antonin Scalia and \u201coriginalism\u201d, focusing on the former supreme court justice\u2019s (re)interpretation of the second amendment and gun rights in contrast to what the Framers probably understood. In foreign policy, Ellis helpfully reinterprets George Washington\u2019s policies on Native Americans and the British/French conflicts of the 1770s to offer a more nuanced view of Washington\u2019s presumed support for isolationism. Ellis sees this instead as the start of the realist tradition in American foreign policy in contrast to Jefferson\u2019s idealistic support for the French Revolution. Ellis stands for realism, whether in opposing Jacobins or not invading Iraq. Ellis writes that \u201cmy hope is that the founding era can become a safe place to gather together, not so much as to find answers to those questions as to argue about them \u2026 their greatest legacy is the recognition that the argument itself is the answer.\u201d Yet throughout his own views are crystal clear: he plumps for the liberal tradition in contrast not only to Trumpism but to most of what passes for modern conservatism, starting with Ronald Reagan. To his credit, Ellis admits that \u201cobjectivity, in the sense that mathematicians or physicians use the term, is not a realistic goal for historians\u201d. The scientific reference is surely a sly echoing of Jefferson\u2019s Virginia Statute on Religious Freedom, which states that \u201cour civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry\u201d. But if the goal is to encourage national dialogue not only with the past but with ourselves, that\u2019s easier if the author\u2019s thumb isn\u2019t quite so heavy on the scale. In this sense, Ellis is not ambitious enough. Does he really believe Chief Justice John Roberts wants to repeal the school desegregation case Brown v Board of Education? The \u201cNow\u201d sections are, regrettably, sloppier than those on the Founders. Ellis succeeds more in recovering lesser-known history, such as the near abolition of slavery in the territories in 1784 and Washington\u2019s attempts at humane policies towards Native Americans. Despite their personal foibles, the Founders remain as reference points for modern life, not least in exposing contradictions within the American polity and psyche. At some level, this is not new. Walt Whitman wrote \u201cI contain multitudes\u201d. On the academic front, Michael Kammen covered the inherent dissonances of American society in People of Paradox, in 1972. Ellis has breathed the air of the Founders for so long that he stumbles somewhat on modern politics. But his book is necessary, and part of the tragedy is that those who need it most are less likely to read it, or to learn from it if they do.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour party\u2019s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control is on a collision course with international treaties that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers. The rules mean a Labour administration could face rising costs or a legal battle in European tribunals over plans to pay a discount to nationalise energy networks and the big six energy suppliers. The party set out plans in May to renationalise energy networks at below market prices by taking into account the \u201casset stripping and profiteering\u201d since privatisation in the 1980s. The party has also said it would fund the multibillion plans by offering energy company investors Treasury-backed bonds. The plans are part of a wide-ranging policy drive to end \u201crip off\u201d costs and poor customer service by nationalising water, energy, rail and BT\u2019s broadband network. But City lawyers have warned that a web of international treaties could force the cost of Labour\u2019s nationalisation pledges far higher than expected. The law firm Clifford Chance has said the energy charter treaty (ECT) would force the party to offer compensation at a \u201cfair market value\u201d, and would rule out the option of paying shareholders for their assets in government-backed bonds. The ECT would apply to a third of the UK\u2019s energy network companies. These include Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain\u2019s Iberdrola, which runs two electricity networks in the UK and Northern Ireland\u2019s energy networks, which are owned by the Irish company ESB Networks. The treaty would also apply to four of the big six energy suppliers, including Scottish Power, the French-owned EDF Energy, and E.ON UK and Npower, which are both owned by the German utility company E.On SE. British companies that are not covered by the ECT have already set up offshore holdings to take advantage of similar bilateral agreements with tax havens such as Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Singapore. SSE, which owns two energy networks and is the UK\u2019s second largest energy supplier, told the Sunday Times that it had moved the assets into a new Swiss holding company. In the same report National Grid said it had shifted its gas and electricity transmission arm into subsidiaries based in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. UK Power Networks is also understood to be protected by a bilateral treaty because it has been owned since 2010 by CKI, an investor based in Hong Kong. One City source said companies representing half the total value of the water industry, which is first in line for nationalisation under a Labour government, have also followed suit. Anglian Water was reportedly investigating an offshore holding company last December, and Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent are considering a similar move. This leaves only a handful of UK companies \u2013 including British Gas \u2013 which are thought to be facing the general election without cover from a treaty that would help them secure a higher price in the event of a government takeover. According to Clifford Chance, these companies can \u201ctake a degree of comfort from the political quandary the government would find itself in if it is ordered by an international tribunal to pay increased compensation to foreign investors.\u201d The firm added: \u201cThe final result may be that there is little practical choice but to offer a fair value to all.\u201d A spokesman for Labour said the party has consulted \u201cwith a number of lawyers\u201d and is confident that the party will \u201cdeliver the changes that the electorate wants\u201d. \u201cOur whole economy will benefit from affordable and reliable rail, mail, energy, water and broadband.

To the relief of holidaymakers going to the continent, the pound now stands at \u20ac1.18. The recovery was connected with the slowly evaporating threat of leaving the EU without a deal before the 31 October deadline. Support for sterling also came from poor economic figures from the eurozone, which indicated the currency bloc was entering a period of stagnation. A slowdown in the US also helped the pound\u2019s rebound. This month currency traders have remained on guard against Brexit developments, but with the election in full swing, they must wait until its conclusion before the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU becomes a little clearer.</p> \n<h2>Share prices lose ground against Europe and the US</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse100\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse100&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse250\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse250&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Shares in London hit a 12-month peak in July, before entering a jittery period that continued last month. Concerns over Britain\u2019s future trading arrangements was the main cause, but figures showing the UK economy slowing down also dragged on share values. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies dropped as low as 7,200 over the last month and only rarely pushed above 7,400 to fall well short of July\u2019s 7,700 high point. Stock markets across Europe and the US have proved to be much more buoyant, shrugging off the gloom to register strong gains. The S&amp;P 500 in New York has risen almost 7% since August. France is best performing major economy in Europe this year and since August has seen its stock market, the CAC 40, rise by more than 10%. Even the struggling German stock market, the Dax, ahead by 13% rise over the same period.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<p><strong>Inflation drops back after heavy discounting</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"cpi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;cpi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Inflation dropped to 1.5% in October after a slide in fuel and energy prices. Heavy discounting at furniture stores also played a part in average prices rising more slowly along with price cuts across the recreation and culture sectors, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a>. Core inflation, which strips out volatile fuel costs, stayed at 1.7%, only marginally below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. Bank of England officials, who meet eight times a year to set interest rates, could cut the cost of borrowing in the new year if the decline continues, but few City analysts believe a decision is imminent. The higher level of core inflation was the result of increases in clothing and footwear that pulled down inflation from its recent peak of 3.1% in 2017. Most forecasters predict inflation will stay steady for the next few months, but could rise next year after a Brexit deal likely to send the value of the pound down and the cost of imports up.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Trade boosted by rise in exports</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s trade position improved in September after a 5.2% rise in exports that narrowed the trade gap, but not by as much as City economists had hoped. Much of the increase came from the services sector after increases in the export of business services, intellectual property, financial services and travel consultancy work. A \u00a34.3bn increase in goods exports to \u00a389.7bn was driven largely by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals. But the ONS said it was concerned about its own data and how it showed a surge in exports when other indicators pointed in the opposite direction. The ONS also highlighted how the annual trend had worsened. Over the last 12 months, the total trade deficit widened by almost \u00a319bn to \u00a351.6bn. Poorer exports would also fit with the trends in global trade, which has declined since it became clear that the US president, Donald Trump, was serious about launching a full-blown economic war with China. The OECD, the Paris-based club for the wealthiest 36 nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/21/tories-no-deal-brexit-plans-damage-uk-economy-oecd-eu\">said earlier this month</a> that global growth was likely to slow to 2.9% this year before stabilising in 2020 and rising back to 3% in 2021.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Business activity has sharpest drop since the referendum</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A long slide into recession seemed inevitable after figures from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed all areas of Britain\u2019s private sector entering a period of contraction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/22/uk-service-sector-suffers-sharpest-drop-since-brexit-vote\">A flash publication of the index</a> covering about 85% of business activity in manufacturing and the services industry showed that in November, UK companies had the sharpest drop in activity since the EU referendum. Most businesses blamed the situation on faltering confidence among both domestic and overseas customers, who are worn out by continuing political indecision. Not since July 2016 and the weeks after the EU referendum have businesses cut back on new orders and production to such an extent. Analysts said the onset of a general election added to Brexit-related uncertainty and helped to erode business confidence.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Employment levels fall at fastest rate for four years</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"unemployment\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;unemployment&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"wages\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;wages&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/12/rate-of-employment-in-uk-takes-biggest-tumble-in-four-years\">Employment in the UK fell at its fastest rate in four years</a> in the three months to September and pay growth slid backwards, leading to speculation that Brexit uncertainty was taking its toll on the jobs market. The ONS said employment had fallen by 58,000 during the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the biggest fall since May 2015. A 93,000 drop in female employment appeared to indicate the trouble faced by high street stores, which employ large numbers of women and have closed at an alarming rate over the last year. The number of men in employment increased by 35,000. Meanwhile, Brexit uncertainty was also evident in the supply of labour, with non-EU nationals accounting for almost all the net growth in migrant employment over the past year. Pay growth fell to 3.6% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/10/uk-jobs-creation-pay-growth-economy-brexit\">from 4% in July</a>.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Retail spending weak before Black Friday</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"retail\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;retail&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A rash of price cutting in October on the high street and by online retailers failed to cheer consumers who surprised City analysts with a 0.1% drop purchases. City analysts had expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/12/uk-shopping-centres-owner-posts-147m-loss\">heavy discounting by retailers</a> to drive up sales. Instead the October figure for retail volumes represented the weakest monthly figure since April last year. Some analysts speculated that shoppers were reluctant to spend before the proposed 31 October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deadline. Others believed the prospect discount shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday later this month, and Christmas had deterred shoppers from spending vital cash in October. There was also speculation that recent declines in employment and wages growth had deterred consumers from spending on big-ticket items such as furniture and cars. Sales fell in all main retail sectors apart from food stores. Once petrol and diesel sales were stripped out the drop was even more severe at 0.3%. Department stores fared a little better than over the previous year, but the rise in sales was modest compared with the battering these large outlets have faced as shoppers desert the high street in favour.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Public finances hit by Brexit spending</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"borrowing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;borrowing&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Extra government spending since last year on Brexit preparations, the health service and a welter of new posts in Whitehall has dented the public purse and pushed ministers\u2019 deficit reduction plans off course. Figures covering last month showed that government borrowing rose to its highest October level in five years as the shortfall hit \u00a311.2bn \u2013 up \u00a32.3bn on a year earlier. The ONS said borrowing in the first seven months of the 2019-20 financial year was \u00a346.3bn, an increase of \u00a34.3bn on the same period in 2018-19. Not only was spending up, but tax receipts were almost flat at just 0.4% higher from the same month last year, with the weakness spread across VAT and taxes on income and companies. City analysts said the annual shortfall was only going to get larger once the next government has begun to include its election promises in the calculation. Before the election, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had already announced the budget deficit in 2020-21 would be lifted appreciably by a \u00a313.8bn increase to public spending (4.1% in real terms and the fastest increase in 15 years).</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>House prices on hold while buyers wait and see</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;rics&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>House prices have remained steady in most parts of the country over the last year, despite Brexit uncertainty. But while the asking price of a home has moved sideways in many areas, the number of properties coming on to the market has fallen sharply. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rightmove\">Rightmove</a> reported that new listings dropped by nearly 15% this month, in what was the largest year-on-year slump in any month since August 2009.

      "bodyText": "Sterling rebounds as no-deal risk declines The pound stabilised this month near $1.30 after a recovery in October from the summer woes that pushed sterling down below $1.20 and almost to parity against the euro. To the relief of holidaymakers going to the continent, the pound now stands at \u20ac1.18. The recovery was connected with the slowly evaporating threat of leaving the EU without a deal before the 31 October deadline. Support for sterling also came from poor economic figures from the eurozone, which indicated the currency bloc was entering a period of stagnation. A slowdown in the US also helped the pound\u2019s rebound. This month currency traders have remained on guard against Brexit developments, but with the election in full swing, they must wait until its conclusion before the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU becomes a little clearer. Share prices lose ground against Europe and the US Shares in London hit a 12-month peak in July, before entering a jittery period that continued last month. Concerns over Britain\u2019s future trading arrangements was the main cause, but figures showing the UK economy slowing down also dragged on share values. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies dropped as low as 7,200 over the last month and only rarely pushed above 7,400 to fall well short of July\u2019s 7,700 high point. Stock markets across Europe and the US have proved to be much more buoyant, shrugging off the gloom to register strong gains. The S&amp;P 500 in New York has risen almost 7% since August. France is best performing major economy in Europe this year and since August has seen its stock market, the CAC 40, rise by more than 10%. Even the struggling German stock market, the Dax, ahead by 13% rise over the same period. Better than forecast Inflation drops back after heavy discounting Inflation dropped to 1.5% in October after a slide in fuel and energy prices. Heavy discounting at furniture stores also played a part in average prices rising more slowly along with price cuts across the recreation and culture sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics. Core inflation, which strips out volatile fuel costs, stayed at 1.7%, only marginally below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. Bank of England officials, who meet eight times a year to set interest rates, could cut the cost of borrowing in the new year if the decline continues, but few City analysts believe a decision is imminent. The higher level of core inflation was the result of increases in clothing and footwear that pulled down inflation from its recent peak of 3.1% in 2017. Most forecasters predict inflation will stay steady for the next few months, but could rise next year after a Brexit deal likely to send the value of the pound down and the cost of imports up. Worse than forecast Trade boosted by rise in exports Britain\u2019s trade position improved in September after a 5.2% rise in exports that narrowed the trade gap, but not by as much as City economists had hoped. Much of the increase came from the services sector after increases in the export of business services, intellectual property, financial services and travel consultancy work. A \u00a34.3bn increase in goods exports to \u00a389.7bn was driven largely by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals. But the ONS said it was concerned about its own data and how it showed a surge in exports when other indicators pointed in the opposite direction. The ONS also highlighted how the annual trend had worsened. Over the last 12 months, the total trade deficit widened by almost \u00a319bn to \u00a351.6bn. Poorer exports would also fit with the trends in global trade, which has declined since it became clear that the US president, Donald Trump, was serious about launching a full-blown economic war with China. The OECD, the Paris-based club for the wealthiest 36 nations, said earlier this month that global growth was likely to slow to 2.9% this year before stabilising in 2020 and rising back to 3% in 2021. Worse than forecast Business activity has sharpest drop since the referendum A long slide into recession seemed inevitable after figures from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed all areas of Britain\u2019s private sector entering a period of contraction. A flash publication of the index covering about 85% of business activity in manufacturing and the services industry showed that in November, UK companies had the sharpest drop in activity since the EU referendum. Most businesses blamed the situation on faltering confidence among both domestic and overseas customers, who are worn out by continuing political indecision. Not since July 2016 and the weeks after the EU referendum have businesses cut back on new orders and production to such an extent. Analysts said the onset of a general election added to Brexit-related uncertainty and helped to erode business confidence. Worse than forecast Employment levels fall at fastest rate for four years Employment in the UK fell at its fastest rate in four years in the three months to September and pay growth slid backwards, leading to speculation that Brexit uncertainty was taking its toll on the jobs market. The ONS said employment had fallen by 58,000 during the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the biggest fall since May 2015. A 93,000 drop in female employment appeared to indicate the trouble faced by high street stores, which employ large numbers of women and have closed at an alarming rate over the last year. The number of men in employment increased by 35,000. Meanwhile, Brexit uncertainty was also evident in the supply of labour, with non-EU nationals accounting for almost all the net growth in migrant employment over the past year. Pay growth fell to 3.6% from 4% in July. Worse than forecast Retail spending weak before Black Friday A rash of price cutting in October on the high street and by online retailers failed to cheer consumers who surprised City analysts with a 0.1% drop purchases. City analysts had expected heavy discounting by retailers to drive up sales. Instead the October figure for retail volumes represented the weakest monthly figure since April last year. Some analysts speculated that shoppers were reluctant to spend before the proposed 31 October Brexit deadline. Others believed the prospect discount shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday later this month, and Christmas had deterred shoppers from spending vital cash in October. There was also speculation that recent declines in employment and wages growth had deterred consumers from spending on big-ticket items such as furniture and cars. Sales fell in all main retail sectors apart from food stores. Once petrol and diesel sales were stripped out the drop was even more severe at 0.3%. Department stores fared a little better than over the previous year, but the rise in sales was modest compared with the battering these large outlets have faced as shoppers desert the high street in favour. Worse than forecast Public finances hit by Brexit spending Extra government spending since last year on Brexit preparations, the health service and a welter of new posts in Whitehall has dented the public purse and pushed ministers\u2019 deficit reduction plans off course. Figures covering last month showed that government borrowing rose to its highest October level in five years as the shortfall hit \u00a311.2bn \u2013 up \u00a32.3bn on a year earlier. The ONS said borrowing in the first seven months of the 2019-20 financial year was \u00a346.3bn, an increase of \u00a34.3bn on the same period in 2018-19. Not only was spending up, but tax receipts were almost flat at just 0.4% higher from the same month last year, with the weakness spread across VAT and taxes on income and companies. City analysts said the annual shortfall was only going to get larger once the next government has begun to include its election promises in the calculation. Before the election, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had already announced the budget deficit in 2020-21 would be lifted appreciably by a \u00a313.8bn increase to public spending (4.1% in real terms and the fastest increase in 15 years). Better than forecast House prices on hold while buyers wait and see House prices have remained steady in most parts of the country over the last year, despite Brexit uncertainty. But while the asking price of a home has moved sideways in many areas, the number of properties coming on to the market has fallen sharply. Rightmove reported that new listings dropped by nearly 15% this month, in what was the largest year-on-year slump in any month since August 2009. Across Britain, the average asking price is \u00a3302,808. The recent worries over Brexit also hit the average price tag, which fell by \u00a33,900 in November \u2013 the equivalent of a 1% decline \u2013 on the previous month. Agents said there was an element of \u201cwait and see\u201d among would-be buyers, partly in response to the looming Christmas break, but also the prospect of a new government under Boris Johnson cutting level of stamp duty for first time buyers.

The ONS said GDP declined by 0.1% after a 0.2% fall in August.

She would sometimes go to the gym for five to eight hours a day and she obsessed over food. \u201cA lot of that stole the joy of what I was doing, because I was living in a very dark world. I was either working or tormenting myself.\u201d That is why she says she has always been in favour of a Dolls reunion: \u201cI didn\u2019t get to enjoy it before.\u201d</p> <p>Her body image became an addiction, she says; she would wake up on the bathroom floor, having passed out<strong> </strong>from \u201cnot taking care of myself\u201d, as she puts it. She saw doctors, but it was only towards the end of the Dolls, when Scherzinger was in her early 30s, that she started to put her issues behind her. She had been told that her bulimia was affecting her vocal cords: \u201cIt was a real awakening for me.\u201d She saw more doctors, she did therapy, \u201cbut in the end it has to be yourself\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all have a choice,\u201d Scherzinger says firmly. \u201cWe can choose to beat ourselves up or go back to those old patterns, or we can choose to learn and grow and evolve and be like: \u2018I\u2019m going to have to rewire my brain\u2019.\u201d She returns regularly to this theme: that self-love, success, even happiness are all down to a decision, then determination.</p> <p>That narrative, of the triumph of the individual is also a cornerstone of<strong> </strong>The X Factor, of which Scherzinger has been a fixture in the US and the UK since 2011. Scherzinger put together One Direction as a guest judge at the show\u2019s peak (\u201cI remember saying: \u2018They will be undeniable to girls\u2019\u201d); now The X Factor: Celebrity is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/02/have-we-fallen-out-of-love-with-tv-talent-show-simon-cowell-x-factor\" title=\"\">registering its lowest-ever ratings</a>.

The only thing that can burn me out is emotional stuff</p> <footer> <cite>Nicole Scherzinger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The most sexism she has ever encountered has been while in the company of high-profile ex-boyfriends, she says; Lewis Hamilton is implied, although she does not identify him by name. \u201cAll the guys worship them, then they look at me like I\u2019m on the bottom of someone\u2019s shoe. The way that people looked at and treated them, and then how they looked at and treated me by his side; I just thought it was sexist. It made me pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>It is not as if she has not been tested. The week before we speak, in early November, her cousin <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10245253/nicole-scherzinger-cousin-killed-hit-and-run/\" title=\"\">was killed in a hit-and-run accident in Florida</a>, and \u201cbecause my mom took on the stress of that, she was put in the emergency room,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty tough cookie. The only thing that can burn me out is emotional stuff. And honestly, this past week was probably one of my hardest weeks of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother is in a stable condition now, but her cousin\u2019s killer has still not been identified, says Scherzinger, growing tearful. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible thing that I would never wish upon anyone else, and it haunts me every day that \u2026 um,\u201d \u2013 she pauses for a long time, her voice cracking \u2013 \u201cwe have no justice for him yet. It\u2019s hard to think that someone can take someone else\u2019s life. I think we all hold responsibility, in everything in life. I\u2019m mostly sad because I\u2019ll never have my cousin back.</p> <p>\u201cIt really puts things in perspective. Guess what happens when you die?\u201d She meets my eyes with fierce focus. \u201cNothing. Nothing else will ever happen to you, because you\u2019re dead. And that\u2019s a huge awakening, because that means you get one life.\u201d</p> <p>Scherzinger draws evident satisfaction from defying others\u2019 expectations, remembering with pleasure Simon Cowell\u2019s look of stunned disbelief after seeing her perform: \u201cI was like: \u2018You\u2019re a little late to the Scherzi party.\u2019\u201d They are great friends; he has been kind to her after her cousin\u2019s death, she says. \u201cI was probably a bit afraid of him, but now? Nuh-uh. Now I\u2019m very headstrong about my views and what I have to say.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5e158b632f52d76d9e54a6492fe0918eb44e212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5e158b632f52d76d9e54a6492fe0918eb44e212/0_48_3607_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Scherzinger  Cats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doll parts \u2026 Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella in Cats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Scherzinger\u2019s own career as a solo artist never quite took off, peaking with Don\u2019t Hold Your Breath in 2011 (which knocked Someone Like You by Adele from UK No 1). Several albums were scrapped at her request, totalling about 500 songs that no one has ever heard. Scherzinger chalks that up to being a perfectionist: \u201cMy mother said when I was a little girl, if I coloured slightly outside of the lines, I would rip the page and throw it across the room.\u201d</p> <p>Would she like to be a star on Adele\u2019s level \u2013 or Lady Gaga, who toured as Pussycat Dolls\u2019 support? Scherzinger looks at me like it is obvious. \u201cOh, absolutely. It\u2019s been for ever since I\u2019ve put out music, and that\u2019s difficult for me, especially when I always set such high expectations for myself. I want to be on my 15th world tour.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that she isn\u2019t, Scherzinger says, is partly a reflection of her social anxiety and her reluctance to be \u201cmore of a fame whore, as people call it\u201d. \u201cMy team has to wrestle me to to the ground to get me on a red carpet \u2026 I\u2019d much rather just be at home, eating jambon.\u201d</p> <p>But she is working on new music, and diligently sets deadlines to ensure that her personal goals don\u2019t fall by the wayside. In late October she staged two intimate performances for about 150 members of the Broadway community to showcase another side of her as an artist, with plans to repeat it in London. Scherzinger was nominated for an Olivier award for her turn as Grizabella in the West End revival of Cats in 2014, and was set to reprise the role on Broadway two years later before pulling out at the last minute. Scherzinger would have loved to have been in the Cats film, she says, but the casting director refused to see her audition. \u201cThat really upset me, I won\u2019t lie about that. I was devastated.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s wife Madeleine comforted her over the phone, the couple being \u201clike family\u201d to her in London, she says (Lloyd Webber\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/13/andrew-lloyd-webber-gets-claws-out-after-nicole-scherzinger-pulls-out-of-cats\" title=\"\">\u201cabsolute twot\u201d comment</a> behind them, then). \u201cI just wanted to be given a fair opportunity \u2013 then you can turn me down. Turn me down to my face, at least, and they didn\u2019t.\u201d In that light, I say, the Broadway nights seem like she is getting her own back. She smiles, the Pussycat that got the cream. \u201cHey.

Scherzinger had only just returned to London from presenting at the MTV Europe music awards in Spain the previous night. When we first met, I had asked Scherzinger, 41, how she defined herself; what the through line was in the projects she took on, from Lloyd Webber to M\u00fcller. \u201cHow I define myself?\u201d she had repeated incredulously. Then she had said she was \u201cvery relatable\u201d, and I\u2019d hoped my scepticism hadn\u2019t registered on my face.

Legs curled up beneath her on the sofa, snakeskin stilettos kicked to the side, she is visibly more relaxed than a few days ago, and excited about going to see Lizzo perform later on. She does not call herself a feminist (\u201cI\u2019m just for women. I\u2019m also for the human race in general\u201d) but Lizzo, she says, is carrying \u201cthe torch for female empowerment\u201d that Scherzinger held 14 years ago with the Pussycat Dolls. \u201cI would say: \u2018Inside every woman is a Pussycat Doll, inside every woman is a Lizzo.\u2019\u201d The Pussycat Dolls were unleashed into the world in 2005, presented on their debut album PCD as a playfully predatory gang, with Scherzinger the ringleader. As lead singer, she was the only one of the six to gain mainstream name recognition, reportedly a consistent source of tension within the group, and a factor in its dissolution after two albums in 2010.

I was either working or tormenting myself.\u201d That is why she says she has always been in favour of a Dolls reunion: \u201cI didn\u2019t get to enjoy it before.\u201d Her body image became an addiction, she says; she would wake up on the bathroom floor, having passed out from \u201cnot taking care of myself\u201d, as she puts it. She saw doctors, but it was only towards the end of the Dolls, when Scherzinger was in her early 30s, that she started to put her issues behind her. She had been told that her bulimia was affecting her vocal cords: \u201cIt was a real awakening for me.\u201d She saw more doctors, she did therapy, \u201cbut in the end it has to be yourself\u201d. \u201cWe all have a choice,\u201d Scherzinger says firmly. \u201cWe can choose to beat ourselves up or go back to those old patterns, or we can choose to learn and grow and evolve and be like: \u2018I\u2019m going to have to rewire my brain\u2019.\u201d She returns regularly to this theme: that self-love, success, even happiness are all down to a decision, then determination. That narrative, of the triumph of the individual is also a cornerstone of The X Factor, of which Scherzinger has been a fixture in the US and the UK since 2011. Scherzinger put together One Direction as a guest judge at the show\u2019s peak (\u201cI remember saying: \u2018They will be undeniable to girls\u2019\u201d); now The X Factor: Celebrity is registering its lowest-ever ratings. Can the format still make stars? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is still a massive, huge platform. And then afterwards, it\u2019s up to the contestants. Little Mix are so successful because those girls worked their little tushies off.\u201d Little Mix\u2019s Jesy Nelson struggled under the spotlight, particularly with online abuse; does she think that contestants are supported enough? \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t baby these people,\u201d says Scherzinger impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s like, they\u2019ve already given you a platform; this overnight success that you\u2019re getting is what people have taken their whole lives to achieve, and some will never even get there. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park. Anything that\u2019s worth having is going to take work.\u201d Her tone softens. \u201cAnd it comes with it, unfortunately \u2013 we all deal with it.\u201d So Scherzinger has struggled with online abuse herself? \u201cYeah. I just don\u2019t go on the friggin\u2019 internet!\u201d The most sexism she has ever encountered has been while in the company of high-profile ex-boyfriends, she says; Lewis Hamilton is implied, although she does not identify him by name. \u201cAll the guys worship them, then they look at me like I\u2019m on the bottom of someone\u2019s shoe. The way that people looked at and treated them, and then how they looked at and treated me by his side; I just thought it was sexist. It made me pissed off.\u201d It is not as if she has not been tested. The week before we speak, in early November, her cousin was killed in a hit-and-run accident in Florida, and \u201cbecause my mom took on the stress of that, she was put in the emergency room,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty tough cookie. The only thing that can burn me out is emotional stuff. And honestly, this past week was probably one of my hardest weeks of my life.\u201d Her mother is in a stable condition now, but her cousin\u2019s killer has still not been identified, says Scherzinger, growing tearful. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible thing that I would never wish upon anyone else, and it haunts me every day that \u2026 um,\u201d \u2013 she pauses for a long time, her voice cracking \u2013 \u201cwe have no justice for him yet. It\u2019s hard to think that someone can take someone else\u2019s life. I think we all hold responsibility, in everything in life. I\u2019m mostly sad because I\u2019ll never have my cousin back. \u201cIt really puts things in perspective. Guess what happens when you die?\u201d She meets my eyes with fierce focus. \u201cNothing. Nothing else will ever happen to you, because you\u2019re dead. And that\u2019s a huge awakening, because that means you get one life.\u201d Scherzinger draws evident satisfaction from defying others\u2019 expectations, remembering with pleasure Simon Cowell\u2019s look of stunned disbelief after seeing her perform: \u201cI was like: \u2018You\u2019re a little late to the Scherzi party.\u2019\u201d They are great friends; he has been kind to her after her cousin\u2019s death, she says. \u201cI was probably a bit afraid of him, but now? Nuh-uh. Now I\u2019m very headstrong about my views and what I have to say.\u201d Yet Scherzinger\u2019s own career as a solo artist never quite took off, peaking with Don\u2019t Hold Your Breath in 2011 (which knocked Someone Like You by Adele from UK No 1). Several albums were scrapped at her request, totalling about 500 songs that no one has ever heard. Scherzinger chalks that up to being a perfectionist: \u201cMy mother said when I was a little girl, if I coloured slightly outside of the lines, I would rip the page and throw it across the room.\u201d Would she like to be a star on Adele\u2019s level \u2013 or Lady Gaga, who toured as Pussycat Dolls\u2019 support? Scherzinger looks at me like it is obvious. \u201cOh, absolutely. It\u2019s been for ever since I\u2019ve put out music, and that\u2019s difficult for me, especially when I always set such high expectations for myself. I want to be on my 15th world tour.\u201d The fact that she isn\u2019t, Scherzinger says, is partly a reflection of her social anxiety and her reluctance to be \u201cmore of a fame whore, as people call it\u201d. \u201cMy team has to wrestle me to to the ground to get me on a red carpet \u2026 I\u2019d much rather just be at home, eating jambon.\u201d But she is working on new music, and diligently sets deadlines to ensure that her personal goals don\u2019t fall by the wayside. In late October she staged two intimate performances for about 150 members of the Broadway community to showcase another side of her as an artist, with plans to repeat it in London. Scherzinger was nominated for an Olivier award for her turn as Grizabella in the West End revival of Cats in 2014, and was set to reprise the role on Broadway two years later before pulling out at the last minute. Scherzinger would have loved to have been in the Cats film, she says, but the casting director refused to see her audition. \u201cThat really upset me, I won\u2019t lie about that. I was devastated.\u201d Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s wife Madeleine comforted her over the phone, the couple being \u201clike family\u201d to her in London, she says (Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201cabsolute twot\u201d comment behind them, then). \u201cI just wanted to be given a fair opportunity \u2013 then you can turn me down. Turn me down to my face, at least, and they didn\u2019t.\u201d In that light, I say, the Broadway nights seem like she is getting her own back. She smiles, the Pussycat that got the cream. \u201cHey. It will be.\u201d The Pussycat Dolls\u2019 UK tour starts on 5 April 2020. Tickets available from livenation.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Pay growth took a knock in October as slowing global trade and Brexit uncertainty dented business confidence, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. Average wage rises dropped back to 3.6%, down from 3.8% in September and 4% in July, which economists said was likely to represent the peak in pay growth since the 2008 financial crash and was unlikely to be seen again for some time. Employment fell at its fastest rate in four years and the inactivity rate increased as thousands of workers, most of them women, withdrew from the jobs market rather than looked for new work. David Blanchflower, an economist and former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said a rise in inactivity and persistent under-employment helped to explain why wages growth had started to fall. Writing in The Guardian, he said hundreds of thousands of workers wanted to work more hours and this persistent feature of the labour market kept wages in check. \u201cThe UK is a long way from full employment despite the unemployment rate dropping to 3.8%, which is well below the 4.5% level it achieved in the boom years between January 2000 and the start of the recession in April 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cWith unemployment so low, wages growth should be increasing. Instead it is going backwards. For an answer look at underemployment.\u201d The underemployment rate is calculated as the proportion of workers who say they are part-time but want full-time jobs, said Blanchflower, who is a professor at Dartmouth College, the US Ivy League university. \u201cIn the most recent data, there are approximately 865,000 of them versus 1.3 million unemployed. In May 2004 the rate was 1.87% and today it is much higher at 2.64%. It turns out that elevated underemployment rate is what is keeping wage growth in check.\u201d Blanchflower said there was little to cheer in the rest of the economy, which had entered a period of stagnation. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release and in five cases the outcome was worse than expected. Only two areas were better than expected \u2013 inflation was lower than economists expected and house prices fell less than expected. The Bank of England said in its quarterly health check of the UK economy that the outlook had improved following parliament\u2019s decision to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. However, the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) said it expects the level of national output \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 over the next three years to be 1% lower than it anticipated in August. The gloomier forecast for GDP growth persuaded two members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s nine-strong policy body to vote for an interest rate cut. In the first split vote on the MPC since June 2018, the Bank voted by 7-2 to keep official interest rates on hold at 0.75%, but two of the outside experts the government appointed to the committee, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, said the weakness of the economy warranted an immediate reduction. The OECD said in its bi-annual health check of the UK economy that GDP growth will slip to 1% next year from 1.2% this year even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided. But like most international bodies, the Paris-based thinktank dampened the mood further by arguing that Boris Johnson\u2019s threat of a no-deal departure in December 2020 would significantly damage the economy and leave the UK more exposed to a global downturn. Andrew Sentance, a senior adviser to the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cThe evidence from the real economy over the past month suggests little change to the pattern of stagnation we have seen for most of this year. \u201cThe UK economy has been heavily dependent on rising consumer spending over the past few years, but here we are also seeing some negative signals.

      "body": "<p>From this point in the coverage of an election, everything shrinks into minutiae. Whose campaign bus is hurtling into what marginal? Which niche of voters is being wooed by the small print on that policy? Whose poll lead is getting squeezed? What fun it is to play trivial pursuits! Yet it jars a little in this election, because this one bears such significance. Not just for the next five years, not only over Brexit and not solely in the UK. This election puts Britain at the frontline of the international political battle of our time. The votes we cast on 12 December will shape the answer to two questions of far-reaching importance.</p> <p>The first is whether the new hard right can be beaten: whether our democracies can put a halt to the forces represented here by Boris Johnson, or around the world by Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/india-muslims-narendra-modi-bjp-new-dawn\" title=\"\">Narendra Modi</a>, to name just a few. If we cannot block these nationalist hardmen democratically, then they will deform democracy until it is unrecognisable and illegitimate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour\u2019s new manifesto puts the party squarely at the cutting edge of what is now mainstream leftwing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second big question is if the new left is yet capable of winning power. The generation radicalised by the banking crisis of 2008 \u2013 and which camped on Wall Street and outside St Paul\u2019s cathedral, before marching against austerity and climate chaos \u2013 now provides much of the energy for Labour, the US Democratic party and the European left. Post-crash politics has gone mainstream; it is yet to be seen whether it can go into government.</p> <p>Since the summer, the UK has been governed by a prime minister who in the referendum of 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary\" title=\"\">told 350 million lies</a> to the public, and who after entering No 10 tried unlawfully to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49810261\" title=\"\">shut down parliament</a>. He has bullied when he should have united, fibbed when he should have been straight, and he has undermined an already shaky constitutional settlement.</p> <p>Just like Trump, he exercises power by outraging democratic norms. The links between the two are underlined by yesterday\u2019s leak from Jeremy Corbyn of t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/27/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-dossier-proving-nhs-up-for-sale\" title=\"\">rade talks between Whitehall and Washington</a>. Those papers illustrate just what Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and the rest of the hard-right headbangers behind Johnson mean by our \u201cglobal opportunities\u201d \u2013 bargaining away workers\u2019 rights, food labelling and drug prices. Ministers may not have prompted or agreed any of these compromises, but they are where the fever-dreams of the new hard right inevitably lead a country like the UK, shredding its already tattered social settlement.</p> <p>One section of the leaked document shows US officials telling their UK counterparts they will \u201cban\u201d any \u201cmention of greenhouse gas emissions\u201d in negotiations. If, as Johnson has claimed, this is \u201cpure invention\u201d, he has the perfect opportunity to deny it in public next week when Trump visits London.

      "bodyText": "From this point in the coverage of an election, everything shrinks into minutiae. Whose campaign bus is hurtling into what marginal? Which niche of voters is being wooed by the small print on that policy? Whose poll lead is getting squeezed? What fun it is to play trivial pursuits! Yet it jars a little in this election, because this one bears such significance. Not just for the next five years, not only over Brexit and not solely in the UK. This election puts Britain at the frontline of the international political battle of our time. The votes we cast on 12 December will shape the answer to two questions of far-reaching importance. The first is whether the new hard right can be beaten: whether our democracies can put a halt to the forces represented here by Boris Johnson, or around the world by Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini and Narendra Modi, to name just a few. If we cannot block these nationalist hardmen democratically, then they will deform democracy until it is unrecognisable and illegitimate. The second big question is if the new left is yet capable of winning power. The generation radicalised by the banking crisis of 2008 \u2013 and which camped on Wall Street and outside St Paul\u2019s cathedral, before marching against austerity and climate chaos \u2013 now provides much of the energy for Labour, the US Democratic party and the European left. Post-crash politics has gone mainstream; it is yet to be seen whether it can go into government. Since the summer, the UK has been governed by a prime minister who in the referendum of 2016 told 350 million lies to the public, and who after entering No 10 tried unlawfully to shut down parliament. He has bullied when he should have united, fibbed when he should have been straight, and he has undermined an already shaky constitutional settlement. Just like Trump, he exercises power by outraging democratic norms. The links between the two are underlined by yesterday\u2019s leak from Jeremy Corbyn of trade talks between Whitehall and Washington. Those papers illustrate just what Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and the rest of the hard-right headbangers behind Johnson mean by our \u201cglobal opportunities\u201d \u2013 bargaining away workers\u2019 rights, food labelling and drug prices. Ministers may not have prompted or agreed any of these compromises, but they are where the fever-dreams of the new hard right inevitably lead a country like the UK, shredding its already tattered social settlement. One section of the leaked document shows US officials telling their UK counterparts they will \u201cban\u201d any \u201cmention of greenhouse gas emissions\u201d in negotiations. If, as Johnson has claimed, this is \u201cpure invention\u201d, he has the perfect opportunity to deny it in public next week when Trump visits London. My hunch is he wouldn\u2019t dare. Against Johnson and Trump, the liberal establishment has so far reacted with proceduralism \u2013 with justified appeals to civility, with a blizzard of ingenious parliamentary amendments, with deep-voiced barristers in horsehair wigs. Yet this has had only limited success \u2013 because its opponents demonstrably do not care about liberal norms. And so each failure has chipped away further at our democracy.

In a scrubby slum of elm and hazel is a tumble of mossy stones \u2013 all that\u2019s left of a lost story of starvation and ruin.</p> <p>Today is a leaf breaking loose from the sighing tree to drift and fall alone. The scratty wood pigeon, exposed to the dangers of sparrowhawks and peregrines, looks beatific rather than depressed, like a sad song heard from the other side of a cold, wet November morning, maybe Connie Francis singing Who\u2019s Sorry Now?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The wood pigeon looks dejected: a raggedy young bird, fluffed like a mop, feathers grey as the ditchwater sky, an eye peeping down at a sodden November morning, the peeling gilt of lime leaves scattered in the mud, sunlight drained between rains. The temperature is perishing. It squats on a tree stump surrounded by bent nettles and an acre or so of hammered holes that are the hoof prints of an enormous Highland bull and two half-sized versions of himself. Any ambitions his sons may have of testing themselves against this great creature are dashed by the bull\u2019s crushing gaze. The weather\u2019s indifference does the same for birds. A single pied wagtail flirts between the bulls as a band of jackdaws clatters into an old ash tree, the bright-eyed insurgents vanishing into holes in its trunk. Down the lane, there are blackbirds mixed up with redwings that may have travelled together from Scandinavia; how do these northern birds get on with the stay-at-homes? Watchful robins venture from hedges to tzeep an alert, somewhere between resignation and hope, like bored security guards. A coven of long-tailed tits flick around trees shaken loose of leaves to offer a draughty architecture of dark, wet boughs to them and the blue tits, nuthatches and other secretive birds; now exposed, their scuttling is like watching shoplifters on CCTV. Mutations of fieldfare roam the soggy wastes of ploughed earth and drowned worms. A farmer scatters seed from a quad bike over a grey clay quagmire, a show of initiative that comes from a history haunted by famine that feels, on a day such as this, not far behind the hedge. In a scrubby slum of elm and hazel is a tumble of mossy stones \u2013 all that\u2019s left of a lost story of starvation and ruin. Today is a leaf breaking loose from the sighing tree to drift and fall alone. The scratty wood pigeon, exposed to the dangers of sparrowhawks and peregrines, looks beatific rather than depressed, like a sad song heard from the other side of a cold, wet November morning, maybe Connie Francis singing Who\u2019s Sorry Now?",

Other plants will be maintain their power output at 80% of capacity, depending on demand, the Yonhap news agency said. South Korea\u2019s 60 coal-fired power plants generated 40% of its electricity, but burning coal has worsened air pollution, with record-high concentrations of dangerous PM 2.5 particles observed in several major cities earlier this year. The World Health Organisation has warned that air pollution poses a major public health risk due to its links with a host of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Large areas of South Korea were blanketed in fine dust this spring, prompting MPs to warn that air pollution was creating a \u201csocial disaster\u201d. In response, the government introduced a range of emergency measures, including limiting power plant and vehicle use, and cutting the amount of dust generated by building sites. But the measures have had little effect. Non-essential vehicles will be banned from roads every other day in major cities for four months starting on Friday. The air pollution crisis has caused friction with China, which South Korean public health experts say is responsible for between 50% and 70% of fine dust pollution in the Seoul area, home to almost half the country\u2019s population. China rejected those claims and suggested that South Korea\u2019s own power plants, factories and vehicles were to blame. South Korea\u2019s energy ministry said the coal plant suspensions would cut fine dust emissions by 44% over the three months from December compared to last year.

      "bodyText": "At first glance, Norwich North might offer a neat test of how environmental issues will shape this election. Norwich, \u201ca fine city\u201d as its signs declare, is a green place. The Greens are the second-largest party after Labour on the city council. Global heating imperils the Norfolk coast 15 miles away. Norwich South is held by Clive Lewis, the Labour MP who drew up the green new deal bill with Caroline Lucas. But first glances and neat ideas do not apply to contemporary politics. Or Norwich North. The climate crisis and environmental issues are only a distant concern, and only when voters are prompted. When asked whether climate change shapes her voting intentions, Jessamy Selwyn, a disability PA, artist and volunteer for a homeless street kitchen, says: \u201cThere is no reason why we should be talking about anything other than how we feed and house people.\u201d People want to discuss the NHS, social care, fears of Brexit and not Brexiting, and the rise of mental illness, drugs and homelessness. Norwich North appears a divided, anxious place but it is also packed with heroic community action. Five respondents to a Guardian reader callout mention \u201cChip\u201d or the Norwich Soup Movement. When a soup kitchen closed where Chip, 32, volunteered, she started her own DIY version, drumming up support on Facebook. Six years and \u201c45,000 breakdowns later\u201d, the Norwich Soup Movement feeds 80 people, 14 nights in every 28, with 150 volunteers cooking hot meals and delivering them to a city-centre stall. Three other women-led grassroots groups cover other nights so Norwich\u2019s homeless can get a hot meal at 8pm every evening. Chip also established an alternative food bank. Unlike mainstream food banks, people do not need a referral from a doctor or social worker, nor is access rationed. \u201cThere are no questions asked apart from \u2018How are you?\u2019 People need to come and have a cry,\u201d says Chip. \u201cI don\u2019t want proof of poverty \u2013 that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Norwich\u2019s official rough sleeper figures \u2013 a street count recorded 21 in November 2018 \u2013 are a massive underestimate, according to Chip. Police crackdowns on begging have moved people from the centre; others sofa-surf or sleep in tents in woods by the prison. The \u00a311.7m spent on housing or homelessness in Norwich in 2009-10 was cut to \u00a37.1m by 2015-16. This year the council reported its homeless caseload had doubled. Chip snorts when asked how she will vote. \u201cSeeing someone cry because you\u2019ve given them shower gel \u2013 what the fuck? That is what the Tories have done to single working mothers and people with disabilities and people working zero-hours contracts. The Tory government is making people beg. They are putting people through shame and huge embarrassment. When did we become this mean? When did we become this cruel?\u201d Selwyn, who volunteers with Chip, links homelessness to mental health and drug problems in the city. \u201cOnce they are struggling with their mental health they turn to substance misuse. They are completely failed because there is no council housing, no rehab services, no mental health services and the hostels are riddled with drugs. There is no escape. Social mobility is what\u2019s been most compromised by austerity.\u201d Norwich is one of 12 \u201csocial mobility cold spots\u201d given extra government education funding: the city was ranked 294 for social mobility out of all 324 English local authorities in 2017. Norwich currently has the second-highest rate of drug deaths (after Blackpool) among all areas in England and Wales. Eighty people have died in the past three years \u2013 more than in any single London borough. \u201cIt\u2019s a dystopia,\u201d says Selwyn. \u201cNorwich is relatively isolated and we feel the impact of social change more slowly. That makes us complacent, which has led to a city on the point of crisis. I am very sad watching people I know die. It\u2019s exhausting and terrifying and we are all just one crisis away from being there ourselves and falling through the cracks which have become chasms.\u201d Norfolk and Suffolk\u2019s mental health trust is the worst-performing in England, in special measures since 2017. Saskia Walsh, 23, says she survived in spite of Norwich\u2019s mental health provision, suffering severe mental health problems from 13, and finding herself \u201cpalmed off\u201d by a succession of NHS professionals. She felt constantly rushed through the system and never even heard back from several assessments. \u201cI\u2019m obviously aware of the implications of austerity,\u201d she says. She has recovered to study at the University of East Anglia and shares a flat with her boyfriend, Conor Warne, 27, a trainee accountant. They say they are now suffering \u2013 from noise, threats and fireworks aimed at windows \u2013 because a \u201cvulnerable\u201d neighbour is not getting the support he needs. A rough sleeper has spent the night in their flat hallway. Walsh and Warne (recently mugged by someone who was begging) want more help for the vulnerable. \u201cMental illness does not exist in a vacuum,\u201d says Walsh, who is voting Labour. \u201cAn ultra-competitive capitalist system is not conducive to good mental health,\u201d adds Warne. \u201cRather than just mopping up crime with 20,000 more police officers, what about 20,000 more mental health nurses to reduce the demand in the first place?\u201d * * * If this makes Norwich North a likely Labour gain, it is not.

      "bodyText": "In the coastal town of Buka a solemn procession of people makes its way from the Catholic church to Bel Isi park, where worshippers kneel before a makeshift cross. There is one subject that dominates the prayers in Bougainville today. \u201cWe are gathered here this morning in Bel Isi Park to ask you to bless the referendum. May it be peaceful and successful,\u201d says the priest. Besides those at the ceremony, the town is almost deserted. A handful of taxi boats float next to the closed market. The vessels have brought families dressed in their Sunday best for church from other parts of Buka island, some 700km off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Bernadine Perekai from Haku crossed the Buka Channel with her two sons to attend the mass. \u201cIn Bougainville, all our hope is in God.\u201d She says. \u201cWe believe he created our land and us, so our lives and our future are in his hands.\u201d The quiet streets and sombre procession are a stark contrast to scenes in this park the day before, which is the polling booth for Buka town, in a long-awaited referendum on independence from Papua New Guinea. Cars beeped their horns in the streets, as crowds \u2013 singing, dancing, cheering and playing pan flutes \u2013 followed the region\u2019s president John Momis, to the polling booth to watch him as he cast the first vote in the referendum. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that my dream to empower people in a way that is democratically appropriate has been achieved,\u201d said Momis, emerging from the polling booth with arms raised. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the people are now in the mood for celebration and I join them as they have every right to celebrate.\u201d This vote has been 20 years in the making, promised to the people of Bougainville as part of a peace deal reached in 2001, which marked the end of a brutal decade-long civil war that saw an estimated 20,000 out of the region\u2019s 200,000 people killed. Over the course of two weeks \u2013 beginning last Saturday \u2013 more than 206,000 Bougainvilleans, living in the region, on mainland PNG, in Australia and the Solomon Islands, will have their chance to vote to decide whether they wish Bougainville to remain within PNG but with \u201cgreater autonomy\u201d or whether the voters will mark \u201cbox two\u201d and opt to create an independent state. The result will be declared in mid-December and is expected to be overwhelming in favour of independence. \u201cI thank God for what is happening,\u201d said Francesca Semoso, women\u2019s representative and deputy speaker of the Autonomous Bougainville Government House of Representatives after voting. \u201cWe have not slept, but did we think this day would come? We are doing this for our daughters and granddaughters.\u201d Margaret Kila, from Malasang, spoke through tears about how significant it was for her to vote in this election. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered with my people. Seen a lot of injustice done, during the crisis \u2026 I am 65 years old and I\u2019ve seen everything. And this has made me so happy. Thank you God,\u201d she said. The effort required to conduct a vote like this in Bougainville has been \u201ctremendous\u201d, says Mauricio Claudio, the chief referendum officer of the Bougainville Referendum Commission (BRC), which has been set up to administer the vote. Roughly 90% of people in Bougainville live in rural hamlets and villages. Communication is a challenge; there is no radio or television network that covers the entire population and just a few hundred copies of Papua New Guinean newspapers are brought from the mainland each day. On top of this roughy half of the population are illiterate. In order to spread information to people about the vote and the political process that will follow, not-for-profits have travelled through the islands conducting dialogues and putting on awareness-raising events. One of these events is being held in Arawa in the days before voting opened. Arawa, one of the major townships in the region, was once the civic headquarters of Bougainville Copper Limited, which managed the Panguna mine, disputes about which sparked the crisis that led to the civil war. Once, Panguna\u2019s gold and copper provided 45% of Papua New Guinea\u2019s export income. But it has now lain dormant for 30 years as limited remnants of infrastructure, built by the mining company, stand forgotten and idle, with vegetation growing around it. In the middle of Arawa town, a youth group from Rorovana stages a play for locals on what the voting process will be, even down to the detail of what a voting booth looks like. There is an issue with managing expectations, especially the belief that if the vote returns a strong result for independence, as expected, Bougainville will immediately become independent. In reality, the result of the referendum is non-binding, and ultimately the PNG parliament has to vote on whether to allow Bougainville its independence, something that could take up to a decade, according to some experts. Bougainvillean filmmaker, Llane Munau said that when she spoke to many women in villages about the referendum they would respond \u201cEm husait?\u201d (Who is that?). So, Munau created a film called Referendum, Em Husait, which explained the referendum and its importance to them. \u201cThe approach is very grassroots. We have people celebrating in the streets because they think that this is it. But we\u2019re not independent yet. Our people need to understand this,\u201d she says. For now, the people of Bougainville feel optimistic. Travelling through the region, support for independence is evident.

      "bodyText": "Victorians will pay a new mental health tax or levy, the state\u2019s premier confirmed, after the mental health royal commission tabled its interim report to parliament on Thursday. Since it began its hearings in March the commission has received more than 8,200 contributions so far, including through consultations, roundtables, public hearings, surveys and submissions from individuals and organisations. The commission is due to deliver its final report in October, with the interim report making key initial recommendations. The report said while an estimated 3.1% of the population lives with severe mental illness, Victoria\u2019s health system currently only offers enough public specialist clinical mental health services for 1.1% of the population. Victoria\u2019s per capita expenditure on mental health is lower than all other states and territories. \u201cThe commission recommends that the Victorian government adopts a new approach to secure a dedicated and stable level of investment for the mental health system,\u201d the report found, recommending the government design and implement \u201c\u2026 a new revenue mechanism (a levy or a tax) for providing mental health operational funding\u201d. Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Thursday afternoon that the levy would take effect some time in 2020, but that it would take some time for the government to establish what form it would take. He said while a national levy would be preferable, Victoria needed to take immediate action. \u201cSenior members of the government will spend the summer looking at options,\u201d he said. Commission chair Penny Armytage said there was \u201cno question that the status quo must change\u201d. \u201cOne thing we have heard very clearly is that we are in the midst of a mental health crisis, that the system is failing and not meeting the needs of those who need it most. This must change,\u201d Armytage said. \u201cThe time has come to get the funding of mental health services right.\u201d The commission report estimates that the economic cost of poor mental health to Victoria is $14.2bn a year. \u201cOnce admired as the most progressive in our nation, the state\u2019s mental health system has catastrophically failed to live up to expectations,\u201d the report said. \u201cPast ambitions have not been realised or upheld, and the system is woefully unprepared for current and future mental health challenges.\u201d The interim report also proposes the first residential mental health service be designed and delivered by people with lived experience. Other recommendations include an additional 170 youth and adult acute beds to help respond to urgent demand, boosting the mental health workforce including through funded graduate positions, postgraduate scholarships and psychiatry rotations, creating an Aboriginal Social and Emotional Wellbeing Centre, expanding social and emotional wellbeing teams to better support Aboriginal people, and funding outreach and clinical supports for people who have attempted suicide. The state government has committed to implementing all the recommendations made by the commission. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King, agreed that a levy could be part of the mental health funding solution. \u201cThe cost of inaction is much greater than the cost of action,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key thing will be ensuring new investments flow directly to the low-income Victorians who need them most, and who are currently missing out. But our mental health services also need a massive funding boost, right now. That funding can\u2019t be pushed back until the end of the commission.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 131 114.

The document presented to the court argues that \u201cunder the pretext of developing the Amazon Region, the Bolsonaro administration is turning government policy into encouragement for attacks on Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples and their lands\u201d. It says there was a \u201cpreconceived plan\u201d behind the \u201cmistreatment and disrespect\u201d for the rights of Brazil\u2019s nearly one million indigenous people.

In preparing their brief, the lawyers analysed 33 comments and decisions by the president, including the dismissal of 21 of 27 superintendents at the environment agency Ibama and Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to weaken Funai. They also cited Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to discredit his own government\u2019s statistics, which he dismissed as \u201clies\u201d after figures showed that deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon had surged to the highest level since the current monitoring method began. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s actions, words and omissions on environmental rights in Brazil may be categorised as attacks on its civilian population,\u201d the document says.

      "bodyText": "Last year the Indigenous leader Sam Watson was asked to reflect on the legacy of his five decades of radical activism, which began handing out how-to-vote cards at the 1967 referendum. Watson, who died on Wednesday aged 67, said that when groups began establishing \u201csurvival services\u201d to support Indigenous people in the 1960s and 1970s, there were \u201cno black doctors, no black lawyers, no black professionals\u201d. \u201cBecause of the struggles fought in the 1950s and 60s and 70s young people have now got these opportunities, they\u2019ve now got the doorways open where these things can happen,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI think that if we played a small part in creating those opportunities and creating those pathways then I think that in our final moments we can look back at that as being a fitting and true legacy.\u201d Watson was a Wangerriburra and Birri Gubba man, who had blood ties to the Jagara, Kalkadoon and Noonuccal peoples. He was an award-winning author, playwright and activist. \u201cHe was surrounded by loved ones, who held his hand as he made his final journey back to the Old People,\u201d Watson\u2019s daughter, Nicole, said. Watson became exposed to the Indigenous rights movement as a child and recalled being taken to meetings by his parents, and listening to soapbox speakers in Brisbane who exposed him to \u2013 in his words \u2013 the radical trade union movement. In 1971 Watson founded the Brisbane chapter of the Black Panther Party and has talked about how many Indigenous people were at the time inspired by the black power movement in the United States. \u201c(It showed) the need to be strong in our own identity and our own culture and our own language \u2013 the way we look, the way we walk, the way we talk. Instead of being something the white fella hounded in to us, that we should be ashamed of that sort of stuff, we embraced that.\u201d Watson fought the Queensland Bjelke-Petersen government over its repressive treatment of Aboriginal people; he marched against the 1971 Springbok rugby tour, the Vietnam war and for civil liberties. He recalled being beaten by police during those years. He was also a proud staff member of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, and worked with many Indigenous community organisations including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, where he campaigned to help end deaths in custody. \u201cEach year, Sam would be at the forefront of the Invasion Day rally in Brisbane,\u201d Nicole Watson said. \u201cIt is his family\u2019s hope that the Invasion Day rallies will continue to grow each year, because we know that he will be there in spirit.\u201d In recent times Watson has led campaigns to change racist place names; he recalled recently how in 1973 he stopped and removed a road sign bearing an offensive name . Watson fought to keep the name Boundary Street in West End, which had marked an exclusion zone for Aboriginal people until the 1940s. Alongside his activism, Watson was an engaging storyteller and a gifted writer, who was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier\u2019s Literary Awards in 1990 for his novel, The Kadaitcha Sung. He wrote two plays and a short film, Black Man Down. Tributes have flowed for Uncle Sam \u2013 from political leaders and community members \u2013 who has been remembered as a giant of the Brisbane activist community and an irreplaceable voice for Indigenous people. \u201cAcross more than half a century, he made an indelible contribution to the advancement of the rights of Indigenous Australians,\u201d the Queensland deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said. Others shared personal memories of Sam from his involvement in marches and protests.",

Taylor has said he accessed the document from the council\u2019s website, and that he had evidence multiple versions of the annual report existed at various points since they were uploaded, an explanation rejected by the council. Guardian Australia can reveal the council has also already retrieved data logs, which would reveal details of what was downloaded and the IP addresses of the devices that downloaded pages, including details of who downloaded the 2017-18 annual report, following a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia two weeks ago. So far Guardian Australia has been told that the information would need to be sorted to extract downloads of the annual report at the centre of the controversy and may raise privacy issues. Discussions on how the information might be released are continuing. However, the New South Wales police would be able to access the logs including more detail about an IP address beyond the general geographical location of the machine and the identity of the internet service provider that services that machine. Significantly, the logs cover 9 September, the day Taylor said the annual report was downloaded from the council\u2019s website. The council also provided Guardian Australia with some Google Analytics about the number of downloads of the 2017-18 annual report during September. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The City of Sydney has two different formats of its annual reports to be downloaded \u2013 a Word version and a PDF. The Google analytics for the month of September show there were 23 downloads of the Word version but none on 9 September. The PDF was downloaded 174 times during the month but only 10 times on 9 September. There were two downloads from IP addresses in Canberra during September. Over 67% of the downloads were in Sydney and were probably City of Sydney staff checking on information derived from the annual report. Google Analytics do not track every download as it is possible to avoid recording a visit to the annual report by cutting and pasting the URL for the annual report into a browser. However, it indicates that there could be valuable information to be gleaned from the logs. The police investigation comes in response to a request from the Labor shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. He has suggested that Taylor\u2019s reliance on the altered document, made by an unknown person, raises possible offences under section 253 and section 254 of the NSW Crimes Act. These make it an offence for a person to make a false document with the intention of using it to inducing a person ( in this case the journalist from the Daily Telegraph) to influence a person in public office in the exercise of their duties. Inducing a person to accept the document as genuine is also an offence. Labor has also suggested there may be an offence under section 316 if Taylor or his office covered up the use of a false document. The lord mayor has not sought a police investigation.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong police and firemen have entered a university which had been under police siege for more than 10 days despite protesters\u2019 pleas for them not to go in. The operation came less than nine hours after a masked protester told local media that about 20 people were still holed up on campus and urged the police not to enter the site because most were terrified. The protester said they did not trust the police and could not rule out stepping up their action if police stormed the campus. Early Thursday, police sent in a safety team which comprises explosive experts and firemen to collect evidence and to handle hazardous substances at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. They also brought in negotiators, government social workers and clinical psychologists in case they found protesters who remained holed up on campus. At a media briefing, assistant commissioner of police Chow Yat-ming insisted the operation was not to make arrests, but to handle flammable and corrosive materials, including a large number of molotov cocktails, and to gather evidence of what police called a crime scene. He said no riot police and no undercover officers would be deployed. \u201cOn humanitarian grounds, we\u2019re hoping to handle this through peaceful and flexible means, the ultimate goal is the safety of the campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major concern is not arrest but the wellbeing of [people inside]. If we encounter anyone, we will try to convince them to accept medical treatment, we\u2019ll record [their identities] and handle it later,\u201d he said. Media footage shows the campus in a state of chaos, with firemen removing bricks from parapets and picking up glass bottles that were apparently previously filled with flammable liquid. Bricks, rubbish, umbrellas and even a bow were strewn across the college grounds and piled up chairs and other furniture used as barricades were seen everywhere. The operation came as Donald Trump signed legislation backing the protesters in Hong Kong. \u201cI signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong. They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. The Hong Kong government said it \u2018\u201cstrongly opposes and regrets\u201d the legislation and that it would damage the city\u2019s relationship with the US. The government added that the legislation interfered with Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs and would send the wrong signal to protesters. At the campus, university senior staff and pro-democracy lawmakers who had inspected and searched the site said on Wednesday they believed no one was left inside and urged the police to end the siege as soon as possible. The protester who spoke to the media demanded that police retreat from around the campus and not register their identities. Hundreds had been holed up at the Polytechnic University for days after violent clashes broke out between protesters and police on 16 November. The red-brick campus was taken over by demonstrators as they tried to block the neighbouring cross-harbour tunnel as part of a wider plan to paralyse traffic across Hong Kong. After intensive fighting in which police used teargas and rubber bullets and protesters threw Molotov cocktails and fired arrows at police, officers locked down the campus, announcing that anyone coming out would be immediately arrested for taking part in a riot. Hundreds of protesters tried to leave, only to be beaten back by teargas, rubber bullets and water cannon. After dozens were caught, they sought more desperate measures, including crawling through sewage and storm water drains, abseiling down ropes, jumping from bridges and escaping on to train tracks.

Labor said the figures \u201cshame us as a nation\u201d, and underscored the need for a serious incident response scheme that had first been recommended in 2017. \u201cHow can members of this government face the families of older Australians who have been victims of assault in aged care and not have responded to its own reports?\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow minister for ageing Julie Collins said. \u201cThe prime minister has been sitting on a key recommendation to help fix this shameful situation for more than two years. \u201cScott Morrison must act immediately to ensure older Australians get the quality aged care services they need.\u201d The report also gives an update on the number of missing residents reported each year, which requires nursing homes to inform the department when a resident is absent from a residential aged care service without explanation. In 2018\u201319, there were 1,514 notifications of unexplained absences of residents, up slightly from the 1,450 reported in 2017\u201318. The recommendation for a serious incident response scheme was first made in the Australian Law Reform Commission\u2019s report on elder abuse, and supported by a report on the regulatory failures that led to the events at the Oakden nursing home in South Australia. The review of national aged care quality regulatory processes, undertaken by Kate Carnell and Ron Paterson, said enacting a serious incident response scheme would also ensure the reporting of \u201cthe outcome of an investigation into a serious incident, including findings and action taken\u201d. In evidence to the royal commission into aged care, Paterson said he had been \u201cgratified\u201d by the initial response from then aged care minister Ken Wyatt about the report\u2019s recommendations. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, however, to learn of the slowness in implementation of the recommendations,\u201d Paterson said. On Monday, the government announced it would spend an extra $537m on aged care to address three priority areas identified by the scathing royal commission interim report: a massive shortage of home-care packages, overuse of chemical restraint, and removing younger people in aged care. Most of the package ($496.3m) will be spent on 10,000 home-care packages, with the rest spent on improving medication management to reduce use of chemical restraints, extra dementia training, and measures to speed up targets to remove younger people from aged care.",

Never mind that you\u2019re far more likely to suffer violence at the hands of someone you know than at the hands of a random bloke with a patch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/new-zealand-national-party-elects-maori-leader-jacindamania\">New Zealand: National party elects Maori leader and deputy to take on Jacindamania</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stereotypes are hard to shake and overestimating a gang\u2019s impact on people\u2019s lives and communities is one reason the \u201cwar on gang\u201d rhetoric is so effective, even if as a policy it fails time after time. In a play to this very overestimate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/new-zealand-national-party-elects-maori-leader-jacindamania\">National leader Simon Bridges</a> is promising a police unit to quite literally harass gang members. Its name: \u201cStrike Force Raptor\u201d.</p> <p>Australian readers might recognise the borrowing: New South Wales police operate their own Strike Force Raptor, using the specialist unit to disrupt gang activities across the state. The unit takes a no-policing-measure-too-small approach, doing everything from suspending bikie\u2019s licenses for minor infractions to raiding their gang headquarters and confiscating assets.</p> <p>The approach is National\u2019s inspiration. Bridges praises the unit as a \u201cremarkable success\u201d. And in a small way he\u2019s right. Motorcycle gangs across the eastern state are on the back foot. Famous clubhouses and grog pits are shut down. Some estimate membership numbers are down.</p> <p>The irony is New South Wales can thank New Zealand for that. At the heart of Raptor\u2019s strategy are the 501s, deportees with tenuous links to New Zealand \u2013 often no more than citizenship from an accident of birth \u2013 who are \u201csent back\u201d. The deportees are in large part responsible for the growth in gang numbers and organised crime in New Zealand. Most arrive with no family or memory of their new home. Their social connections are west. So too their economic connections. Often they just pick up right where they left off as Comancheros or Bandidos or Hells Angels.</p> <p>So this is the question Bridges must answer: why copy-cat the Aussie unit responsible for exporting its own gang problem here?

      "bodyText": "It took me almost 10 years to notice that the green ink snaking across my old man\u2019s forehead said \u201cMongrel Mob\u201d. I never thought the bulldogs wrapping around his hands meant gang member. I mean, he was a dog lover, and he was Dad. You never really know your parents\u2019 life before you were born, right, even when it\u2019s written across their bodies. You only know the person who is, your mum or dad in the here and now, and it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine they\u2019re someone other people might fear. This is why it took almost 10 years to figure out that the thing on Dad\u2019s head was the reason people were locking their car doors when our family was walking past. And in one sense, who can blame them? \u201cGang member\u201d is a vivid signifier, and to most people it signals all the worst things: crime, violence, and a community gone wrong. Never mind that you\u2019re far more likely to suffer violence at the hands of someone you know than at the hands of a random bloke with a patch. Stereotypes are hard to shake and overestimating a gang\u2019s impact on people\u2019s lives and communities is one reason the \u201cwar on gang\u201d rhetoric is so effective, even if as a policy it fails time after time. In a play to this very overestimate National leader Simon Bridges is promising a police unit to quite literally harass gang members. Its name: \u201cStrike Force Raptor\u201d. Australian readers might recognise the borrowing: New South Wales police operate their own Strike Force Raptor, using the specialist unit to disrupt gang activities across the state. The unit takes a no-policing-measure-too-small approach, doing everything from suspending bikie\u2019s licenses for minor infractions to raiding their gang headquarters and confiscating assets. The approach is National\u2019s inspiration. Bridges praises the unit as a \u201cremarkable success\u201d. And in a small way he\u2019s right. Motorcycle gangs across the eastern state are on the back foot. Famous clubhouses and grog pits are shut down. Some estimate membership numbers are down. The irony is New South Wales can thank New Zealand for that. At the heart of Raptor\u2019s strategy are the 501s, deportees with tenuous links to New Zealand \u2013 often no more than citizenship from an accident of birth \u2013 who are \u201csent back\u201d. The deportees are in large part responsible for the growth in gang numbers and organised crime in New Zealand. Most arrive with no family or memory of their new home. Their social connections are west. So too their economic connections. Often they just pick up right where they left off as Comancheros or Bandidos or Hells Angels. So this is the question Bridges must answer: why copy-cat the Aussie unit responsible for exporting its own gang problem here? We can hardly return the members our own Raptors might catch, immediately making them less effective than their Australian parent. There\u2019s no on-sending to another country either. Instead the tools available to disrupt gangs and diminish their numbers and impact are the same as always: employment, housing, education, and public health. Think about it this way. More than a third of all New Zealand prisoners have gang connections of one kind or another. Over 60% suffer from a traumatic brain injury. Approximately 70% suffer from numeracy and literacy problems. Is this really a gang problem or is this a health and education crisis? The latter, surely. That makes it a crisis of successive governments\u2019 own making. Nowhere is this more obvious and more tragic than in the royal commission into abuse in care where former state ward after former state ward testified they were driven into the arms of gangs after violence and abuse in state institutions. In other words, \u201cthe war on gangs\u201d \u2013 that phrase swapping the dogwhistle for the megaphone \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily won with criminal law policy. It\u2019s best won in social policy. If you meant your Raptors policy as gang-buster rather than vote-winner you might realise as much. Of course none of this is to suggest gangs or organised crime aren\u2019t a problem. In a decent society they wouldn\u2019t exist. The trouble, for me at least, is I find the political rhetoric that shapes people\u2019s understanding of gangs difficult to square with I know.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday the federal government settled a landmark challenge to its robodebt program, conceding that income-averaging alone was not a proper basis to claim the plaintiff, Deanna Amato, owed it a debt. The admission explains why last week the government services minister, Stuart Robert, was forced to dismantle a central plank of the robodebt program\u2019s automation by abandoning sole reliance on income averaging to calculate debts. But what do the federal court judgment and the changes mean for the 900,000 Australians who Centrelink has claimed owe it a debt? What did the federal court say? In orders made by consent on Wednesday \u2013 agreed by the commonwealth \u2013 the federal court declared Amato\u2019s debt was \u201cnot validly made\u201d, that an order to garnish her tax return was also invalid and there was no basis to add a 10% penalty to the debt. In a statement explaining the orders, Justice Jennifer Davies noted the initial debt of $2,900 was calculated based on Australian Taxation Office income data averaged across fortnightly periods, as if this were Amato\u2019s actual income in each period. The court said the conclusion Amato had received social security benefits she was not entitled to was \u201cnot open on the material before the decision-maker\u201d because there was \u201cno probative material\u201d that the average reflected Amato\u2019s actual income. \u201cIn the circumstances, there was no material before the decision-maker capable of supporting the conclusion that a debt had arisen \u2026 The conclusion that a debt had arisen was therefore irrational, in the requisite legal sense.\u201d The court ordered the commonwealth to pay Amato\u2019s costs and $92 interest. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What has this got to do with the overhaul of robodebt? In an email to staff last week the Department of Human Services revealed it would abandon sole reliance on the controversial \u201cincome-averaging\u201d method and instead require additional proof before demanding welfare recipients pay back alleged debts. The judgment in Amato\u2019s case explains why \u2013 if the commonwealth concedes that income-averaging is not a lawful basis to claim a debt \u2013 the same argument would apply to many others. Although Robert has claimed only a \u201csmall cohort\u201d is affected, human services staff have been told that up to 600,000 of the 900,000 robodebts that have been issued used income-averaging and will need to be reassessed, and more than 220,000 may require refunds or waivers. What will happen now? The department has already committed to reviewing existing robodebts \u2013 including those already paid back \u2013 to consider possible refunds for people whose debts were based solely on income-averaging. The general manager of the customer compliance division said in an email to staff, seen by Guardian Australia: \u201cWe will methodically work through previous debts identified as part of the online income compliance program. \u201cWe will focus on debts where the person did not respond to our requests for clarification. We will look at each of those instances with a view to assessing whether further information is available to clarify what debt may still be owed. \u201cFor customers who are affected, the department will freeze debt recovery as they are identified and will then look at each debt. The department will write to customers to let them know this will happen automatically.\u201d So not all people who have received robodebts will have their debts waived \u2013 and not everybody who has paid a debt back will get a full refund. It depends whether the department can get extra information to show what welfare recipients\u2019 actual income was, and whether a discrepancy still exists with the amount of income the recipient declared. How much could the government be on the hook for? It is still unclear how much of the $660m raised by the program so far will have to be repaid, because the government has refused to provide more detail on how many robodebts are affected. The cost is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The projection that the program would ultimately involve 1m robodebts and achieve savings of $2.1bn is also clearly in doubt. What about the class action? The Gordon Legal class action, supported by Labor, will continue. The case, formally launched last week, has so far attracted 4,000 expressions of interest. But as Peter Gordon explained to Guardian Australia, people will have a right to participate if they are captured by the group description of affected welfare recipients, because of the opt-out nature of class actions in Australia. If successful, the case could trigger refunds for hundreds of thousands of people whose debts were calculated using income-averaging. As well as seeking that debts be waived on the basis the government had unjustly enriched itself, the class action argues it owed vulnerable welfare recipients a duty of care, a duty that was breached through threatening notices claiming a debt was owed. It seeks damages for stress, anxiety and stigma. The class action may not increase the number of people who ultimately receive refunds \u2013 because dodgy debts based solely on income-averaging should be repaid by the department anyway \u2013 but it holds the government\u2019s feet to the fire, and provides a mechanism for court-enforcement if the case is successful. It also increases the financial risk to the commonwealth, because if the class action wins on the negligence point, welfare recipients could be owed damages.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s long spell of hot and dry weather that has increased the risk of bushfires is set to continue into summer, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning communities should prepare for more severe fire danger. The BoM\u2019s summer outlook shows a higher than usual chance of above-average day and nighttime temperatures for most of the country, and an above-average chance of drier than average conditions for large parts of eastern Australia. The bureau said spring, which brought catastrophic fire danger to the east coast, was likely to have been one of the driest on record. Andrew Watkins, the BoM\u2019s head of long-range forecasts, said there was an 80% chance of warmer than usual days and nights for much of the country through summer. The outlook is similar for rainfall, with coastal areas of Western Australia from the midwest to the Kimberley the only locations showing increased odds of wetter-than-average conditions. \u201cSummer\u2019s looking particularly dry with high odds of drier-than-average conditions right down the east coast, including Tasmania,\u201d Watkins said. A positive Indian Ocean dipole, which moves weather systems that would typically bring rain away from Australia, and a negative southern annular mode, are driving the continued hot and dry conditions. The onset of the northern monsoon is expected in mid-summer, which Watkins said could increase the odds of closer to average rainfall from January and February. But he said communities should be preparing for severe weather risks and a continuation of severe fire danger over the coming months. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen significant bushfire activity during spring, and the outlook for drier and warmer-than-average conditions will maintain that heightened risk over the coming months,\u201d Watkins said. The outlook for heatwaves is also heightened. Australia recorded its hottest summer on record in 2018-19. The recent spring bushfires caused six deaths and destroyed more than 600 homes. The BoM said this spring is likely to have been the fifth driest for NSW and one of its 10th warmest overall. The trend was the same in almost all other states and territories, with the exception of western Tasmania, where weather conditions were cooler and wetter than usual. Victoria recorded record-breaking heat in November in many locations but its mean minimum temperatures for spring are on track to be the lowest since 2003. Meanwhile, firefighters in New South Wales on Thursday were battling more than 150 blazes and issued a warning for residents to prepare for fires to worsen over the weekend. While there were no total fire bans in place for Thursday, the greater Hunter, greater Sydney, Illawarra-Shoalhaven, southern ranges, central ranges and northern slopes were under \u201cvery high\u201d fire danger rating, as was the ACT. \u201cWith more than 150 fires burning across #NSW and the forecast of more hot and windy weather for the weekend please use this time to prepare. Review your bush fire plan, prepare your properties and discuss as a household what you will do if threatened by fire,\u201d the NSW Rural Fire Service tweeted. On Thursday morning, 64 of the 157 fires across NSW were uncontained. The Bureau of Meteorology said lightning strikes from thunderstorms which hit Sydney and the state\u2019s north-east on Tuesday had sparked fresh blazes, with an estimated 100 new fires igniting in a 24-hour period.",

Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair.</p> <p>Mr. Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistle-blower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, to conduct investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s congressional allies have argued he could not have participated in a bribery scheme, as <strong>Democrats </strong>have alleged, because the funds were eventually released.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Monday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened today: Trump signed legislation backing Hong Kong protestors despite opposition from the Chinese government. The US Navy has dropped the reviews of three other officers after Trump intervened in the disciplining of Navy Seal Edward Gallagher. Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU and a key witness in the impeachment inquiry has been accused of sexual misconduct. Three women have said he retaliated against them after they rejected his advances. Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine before the White House released military aid to Kyiv. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani reportedly pursued business from Ukrainian, even as he pushed officials there to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. Don McGhan won\u2019t have to testify to the House \u2014 for now. A judge issued a temporary stay as she considers whether to grant the justice department a longer stay as it challenges her ruling that he must comply with the House\u2019s subpoena. Report finds that the government separated families knowing that it didn\u2019t have the technology to track them The government separated thousands of families as part of a Trump administration policy, even though it lacked the technology to document and track their whereabouts, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security watchdog. Border officers took children from parents being criminally prosecuted for entering the country as part of a policy to deter illegal immigration. A U.S. judge eventually ended the practice and ordered officials to reunite families. The report by the DHS Inspector General\u2019s office says that officials knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to track the whereabouts of parents and children, and continued with the practice regardless. Reunification has been chaotic and coordinated via email instead of through a shared system that various government agencies could all access, the report found. The president signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was almost unanimously approved by both legislative houses, despite objections from the Chinese government. The law requires the State Department to certify that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy, and threatens sanctions for human rights violations. Trump also signed another law that prohibits the export of teargas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun guns to Hong Kong. \u201cI signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThey are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.\u201d The US Navy has thrown out plans to review three officers under scrutiny following Donald Trump\u2019s decision to intervene in a related case. Trump issued a direct order to halt disciplinary measures against a Navy Seal accused of war crimes in Iraq. On Sunday, defense secretary Mark Esper fired the navy secretary Richard Spencer after Spencer resisted pressure to intervene in the case of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher. Now the reviews of three other Navy Seals \u2014 Lieutenant Jacob Portier, Lieutenant Commander Robert Breisch and Lieutenant Thomas MacNeil \u2014 who were being scrutinized as Gallagher\u2019s supervisors, have been dropped. Gallagher was found to have posed for a \u201ctrophy\u201d photo with the corpse but acquitted of more than a dozen other charges, including ones related to the staping of an Isis militant. Ousted Navy secretary Spencer has now published a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post, writing that Trump\u2019s involving himself in the Gallagher case \u201c was a shocking and unprecedented intervention in a low-level review\u201d. \u201cIt was also a reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices,\u201d he wrote. Immigration officers have arrested an additional 90 students at fake university created by Homeland Security As part of a sting operation, federal agents enticed foreign-born students, mostly from India, to a Detroit school that marketed graduate programs in technology and computer science. The students paid about $12,000 in tuition and fees per year to attend the university, which was created in 2015. Agents have since arrested about 250 students, many of whom have been deported. The Detroit Free Press reports: The students had arrived legally in the U.S. on student visas, but since the University of Farmington was later revealed to be a creation of federal agents, they lost their immigration status after it was shut down in January. The school was located on Northwestern Highway near 13 Mile Road in Farmington Hills and staffed with undercover agents posing as university officials... Attorneys for the students arrested said they were unfairly trapped by the U.S. government since the Department of Homeland Security had said on its website that the university was legitimate. An accreditation agency that was working with the U.S. on its sting operation also listed the university as legitimate... No one has filed a lawsuit or claim against the U.S. government for collecting the money or for allegedly entrapping the students. Attorneys for ICE and the Department of Justice maintain that the students should have known it was not a legitimate university because it did not have classes in a physical location. Some CPT programs have classes combined with work programs at companies. Here\u2019s who\u2019ll be moderating the next Democratic primary debate The next Democratic presidential primary debate, which will take place at Loyola Marymount University on December 19, will be co-moderated by PBS Newshour\u2019s Judy Woodruff, Amna Nawaz, and Yamiche Alcindor and Politico\u2019s Tim Alberta. Earlier this month, NBC reported that some at the DNC were fretting over having Alberta moderate the debate due to this previous work for the National Review, a conservative magazine, and the fact that he\u2019s spent much of his recent career writing about the Republican party. So far, six candidates appear to have qualified for the debate: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Candidates have until December 12 to meet the criteria to qualify. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who has become a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women. The accusers said the wealthy hotel owner professionally retaliated against them after they rejected his advances. The highly anticipated report from the justice department inspector general on the origins of the Russia investigation is expected to debunk Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the FBI attempted to spy on his 2016 campaign. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was reportedly pursuing business opportunities with Ukrainian officials as he pressured the country to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 campaign, raising questions about whether he was simultaneously trying to advance the interests of both Trump and leaders in Kyiv. Giuliani called Trump this week to reassure him that he was joking when he told multiple media outlets he had \u201cinsurance\u201d in case the president turned against him. A federal judge has granted a temporary stay in the case of Don McGahn and will now consider whether to approve the justice department\u2019s request for a longer stay as it appeals her ruling that the former White House counsel must testify to Congress about his time working in the Trump administration. The blog will be off for Thanksgiving tomorrow and Friday, so I will be back on Monday. And Maanvi will have much more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. A third woman, Natalie Sept, said Gordon Sondland offered to help her with her career in 2010 but he cut off communication after she rejected a forcible kiss from the hotel owner. Sept told ProPublica that Sondland dangled a job with the Oregon governor\u2019s film board and arranged a dinner to discuss the opportunity. After the dinner, during which the job only came up briefly, Sondland invited her to have a drink at a nearby bar. \u201cWhen I come back [from the bathroom], he is sitting on the booth side of this big table,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe says, \u2018Come sit next to me.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh my god, this isn\u2019t good.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Oh, I forgot, I have to go home.\u2019\u201d Sondland insisted on walking Sept back to her car and then leaned in for a hug. \u201cSo I give him a quick hug and he holds onto my shoulders and looks at me and pushes himself into me and tries to kiss me,\u201d Sept said. She managed to speed off in her car, but the job opportunity did not come up again. Jana Solis claimed Gordon Sondland exposed himself to her and forcibly kissed her when she was inspecting some of his properties and possessions in 2008. Sondland had asked Solis to evaluate his personal art collection, even though she didn\u2019t have expertise in art valuations. At one point, Sondland asked her to meet him in the pool house. \u201cI get out to the pool house, and he is now naked from the waist down,\u201d Solis told ProPublica. \u201cHe said something about, \u2018I thought we could chat.\u2019 And I said something, trying to keep his ego intact \u2014 not that he needed that, not that it wouldn\u2019t have been anyway \u2014 I said something like, \u2018I can\u2019t have that conversation.\u2019\u201d The situation did not escalate beyond that, but Solis encountered Sondland a few months later as she was inspecting some of his other properties and holding training sessions with hotel staff. On the last day of the trainings, Sondland invited her to the penthouse, which served as his private living quarters. Solis remembers Sondland asking her to have a drink on the couch with him, which she agreed to. \u201cThe next thing I know, he\u2019s all over me,\u201d Solis said. \u201cHe\u2019s on top of me. He\u2019s kissing me, shoving his tongue down my throat. And I\u2019m trying to wiggle out from under him, and the next thing you know, I\u2019m sort of rising up to get away from him, and I fall over the back of the couch.\u201d Solis said Sondland later called her at work to yell about her job performance, which she blamed on her rejection of his advances. (Sondland denied the allegations detailed in the ProPublica report, inclduing Solis\u2019.) The three women accusing Gordon Sondland of sexual misconduct all shared their names and allegations on the record with ProPublica. One of Sondland\u2019s accusers is Nicole Vogel, the owner of Portland Monthly, which co-published the report about the allegations against the ambassador. (An editor\u2019s note specifies that Vogel was not involved in editorial decisions about the piece.) Vogel said Sondland tried to forcibly kiss her when she was raising money to start the magazine in 2003. Sondland, who owns five hotels in Portland with his company Provenance Hotel Group, had already said he would invest in the magazine when he invited Vogel to see one of the rooms at his nearby property. Accordig to Vogel, she lavished praise on the rather mundane room and was turning to leave when Sondland asked for a hug. \u201cAnd as I pulled back, he grabs my face and goes to kiss me,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cI said, \u2018Ooh Gordon, you\u2019re a married man, and you\u2019d just break my heart.\u2019\u201d Vogel then hurried to leave the hotel. A few weeks later, after another uncomfortable encounter in which Sondland put his hand on her thigh, he told Vogel he would not be investing in the magazine after all. Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who has become a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women who say he retaliated against them after they rejected his advances. ProPublica reports: In one case, a potential business partner recalls that Sondland took her to tour a room in a hotel he owns, only to then grab her face and try to kiss her. After she rejected him, Sondland backtracked on investing in her business. Another woman, a work associate at the time, says Sondland exposed himself to her during a business interaction. She also recalls falling over the back of a couch trying to get away from him. After she made her lack of interest clear, she says Sondland called her, screaming about her job performance. A third woman, 27 years Sondland\u2019s junior, met him to discuss a potential job. She says he pushed himself against her and kissed her. She shoved him away. She says his job help stopped. Sondland, who testified last week that he considered Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election as Trump held up the country\u2019s military aid to be a definite case of quid pro quo, denied the allegations in a statement. \u201cThese untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, coordinated for political purposes,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThey have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them.\u201d Sondland\u2019s lawyer even suggested the women may be retaliating against the ambassador after failed business opportunties. \u201cNotably, what each of these three women share in common is that they pursued Ambassador Sondland for financial and personal gain \u2014 an investment, a job, and insurance brokerage work \u2014 and he declined their proposals,\u201d said lawyer Jim McDermott. McDermott added that the timing of the article\u2019s publication could be viewed as \u201cveiled witness tampering,\u201d but the authors of the piece noted they began reporting on the story last month. However, the report from justice department inspector general Michael Horowitz is not expected to completely let FBI leaders off the hook for their handling of the Russia investigation. The New York Times reports: [Horowitz] found that F.B.I. leaders did not take politically motivated actions in pursuing a secret wiretap on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page \u2014 eavesdropping that Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have long decried as politically motivated. M r. Horowitz will sharply criticize F.B.I. leaders for their handling of the investigation in some ways, and he unearthed errors and omissions when F.B.I. officials applied for the wiretap, according to people familiar with a draft of the report. The draft contained a chart listing numerous mistakes in the process, one of the people said. The highly anticipated report from the justice department\u2019s inspector general on the origins of the Russia investigation is expected to debunk Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the FBI attempted to spy on his 2016 campaign. The New York Times reports: The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general found no evidence that the F.B.I. attempted to place undercover agents or informants inside Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 as agents investigated whether his associates conspired with Russia\u2019s election interference operation, people familiar with a draft of the inspector general\u2019s report said. The determination by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is expected to be a key finding in his highly anticipated report due out on Dec. 9 examining aspects of the Russia investigation. The finding also contradicts some of the most inflammatory accusations hurled by Mr. Trump and his supporters, who alleged not only that F.B.I. officials spied on the Trump campaign but also at one point that former President Barack Obama had ordered Mr. Trump\u2019s phones tapped. The startling accusation generated headlines but Mr. Trump never backed it up. Previous reports have also indicated that Horowitz did not find any evidence of FBI senior leadership acting out of anti-Trump bias in their handling of the investigation, although the inspector general harshly criticized some decisions made early on by lower-level officials. Put all together, it\u2019s looking like Horowitz\u2019s report may not turn out to be the bombshell Trump was hoping for. However, if history is any indication, the president will likely cherry-pick the worst anecdotes from the report and simply repeat the claims debunked by Horowitz\u2019s other findings. Charles Kupperman, who served as John Bolton\u2019s deputy at the national security council, has filed a motion to add the House sergeant-at-arms to his lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the impeachment inquiry. Kupperman argues in his lawsuit that he is in \u201cimminent and substantial risk\u201d of being held in inherent contempt by the House and that, because the sergeant-at-arms would enforce such an order, he should be added to the lawsuit. However, there have been no signs as of yet that House Democrats are preparing to hold anyone in contempt for defying congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry. Kupperman also noted in a separate brief that he did not believe the ruling in Don McGahn\u2019s case applied to him because the former White House counsel had been suibpoenaed by the House, while Kupperman\u2019s subpoena was withdrawn. Rudy Giuliani called the president this week to reassure him that he had been joking when he told media outlets he had \u201cinsurance\u201d if Donald Trump turned on him in the Ukraine impeachment scandal, Giuliani\u2019s lawyer said today. The attorney, Robert Costello, said Giuliani \u201cat my insistence\u201d had called Trump \u201cwithin the last day\u201d to emphasize that he had not been serious when he said he had an \u201cinsurance policy, if thrown under the bus.\u201d \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t joke, he is not a funny guy. I told him, \u2018Ten thousand comedians are out of work, and you make a joke. It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u2019\u201d Costello told Reuters. Giuliani has already said that he was being sarcastic when he made the comments. Trump, too, has brushed them off, telling reporters in the Oval Office this week that \u201cRudy is a great guy.\u201d The White House declined to comment on Costello\u2019s remarks, Reuters writes. As the Guardian reported earlier this month, Giuliani had said he was confident the president will remain loyal to him as the impeachment inquiry unfolded - in which the former New York mayor has become a central figure. But he joked that he had good \u201cinsurance\u201d in case Trump did turn on him, amid speculation Republicans will seek to frame Giuliani as a rogue actor. In a telephone interview with the Guardian at the time, in response to a question about whether he was nervous that Trump might \u201cthrow him under a bus\u201d in the impeachment crisis, Giuliani said, with a slight laugh: \u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, who was also on the call, then interjected: \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d US district judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has granted a seven-day stay in the case of former White House counsel Don McGahn as she considers whether to approve a similar stay requested by the justice department as it appeals her decision. Jackson ruled Monday that McGahn must comply with a congressional subpoena to testify about his time as Trump\u2019s White House counsel, despite the administration\u2019s claims that the former senior adviser was \u201cimmune\u201d from such requests. \u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,\u201d Jackson said in her ruling. The House did not oppose the temporary stay, but the chamber\u2019s lawyers have filed a briefing opposing a longer stay in the case, arguing such a delay would prevent lawmakers from considering McGahn\u2019s testimony before voting on articles of impeachment. Georgia governor Brian Kemp pushed back against a Wall Street Journal report that he has clashed with Trump over who to appoint to the state\u2019s open Senate seat According to the Journal, Kemp intended to appoint Atlanta businesswoman Kelly Loeffler to the seat, which has been open since late August after Republican senator Johnny Isakson stepped down due to health issues. But Trump has been pushing GOP reprentative Doug Collins for the seat becuase of the congressman\u2019s aggressive efforts to push back against the impeachment inquiry. The president\u2019s allies have assured him that Collins, currently the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, would be a guaranteed vote against removing Trump from office if the Senate was forced to hold a trial. Loeffler, on the other hand, has been criticized by some Trump advisers for occasionally donating to Democratic candidates and spending more than $750,000 to support the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, one of the president\u2019s few Republican critics. The Trump administration initially estimated that 26,000 migrant children wold be separated from their families at the southern border if the president\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy were allowed to continue through 2018, according to a new report from the department of homeland security\u2019s internal watchdog. NBC News reports: Officials at Customs and Border Protection, the DHS agency responsible for separating families under the May-June 2018 policy, estimated in May of that year that it would separate more than 26,000 children by September, according to the report from the DHS Office of Inspector General, released publicly on Wednesday. After mounting pressure, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the policy on June 20, 2018. Previously, the administration has said in court that an estimated 2,800 children were separated as a result of zero tolerance. But the report released Wednesday said that the lack of technology to track which children had been separated meant the agency had to revise that estimate to 3,014. ... Wednesday\u2019s report said CBP officials forged ahead with the policy even though they knew ahead of time that the agency lacked the proper technology to track and reunify children with their parents. \u2018Because of these IT deficiencies, we could not confirm the total number of families DHS separated during the Zero Tolerance period,\u2019 the report said. The latest news about Rudy Giuliani raises the possibility that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer was trying to advance the interests of both the president and Ukrainian officials as he pushed for the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, which could run afoul of lobbying laws. The New York Times reports: Prosecutors and F.B.I. agents in Manhattan are examining whether Mr. Giuliani was not just working for the president, but also doing the bidding of Ukrainians who wanted the ambassador removed for their own reasons, the people said. It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign government, politician or party without registering as a foreign agent. Mr. Giuliani did not register as one, he has said, because he was acting on behalf of his client, Mr. Trump, not Ukrainians. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, reportedly explored business opportunities with Ukrainian officials as he pressured the country to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. (Trump appeared to distance himself from Giuliani in an interview that streamed yesterday, claiming he did not direct his lawyer to push for the probes.) Trump reportedly knew of the whistleblower complaint on his communications with Ukraine when he released the country\u2019s military aid, casting serious doubt on one of congressional Republicans\u2019 key criticisms of the impeachment inquiry. Another poll showed Joe Biden leading the 2020 Democratic field as his opponents struggle to challenge his frontrunner status. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The New York Times also reports that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, explored a business deal with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor who clashed with Maria Yovanovitch -- the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post after being smeard by Giuliani and other Trump allies. Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have Yovanovitch recalled. The Times reports: In another unsigned draft proposal that was not on letterhead, Mr. Giuliani looked to enter into a similar deal with Yuriy Lutsenko, who was then Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor. At the time, Mr. Giuliani had been working with Mr. Lutsenko to encourage investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani was critical of Ms. Yovanovitch, whom he and other Republicans have said was opposed to the president. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s moves against her, however, were also aligned with the interests of Mr. Lutsenko, who had butted heads with the ambassador. Ultimately, Ms. Yovanovitch was removed from her post in May, and Mr. Lutsenko was replaced in August after a new Ukrainian president took office. Reports have emerged that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was pursuing business opportunities from Ukrainian officials as he pressured the country to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The New York Times reports: Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, has repeatedly said he has no business in Ukraine, and none of the deals was finalized. But the documents indicate that while he was pushing Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda with Ukrainian officials eager for support from the United States, Mr. Giuliani also explored financial agreements with members of the same government. His discussions with Ukrainian officials proceeded far enough along that he prepared at least one retainer agreement, on his company letterhead, that he signed. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani played down the discussions. He said that a Ukrainian official approached him this year, seeking to hire him personally. Mr. Giuliani said he dismissed that suggestion, but spent about a month considering a separate deal with the Ukrainian government. He then rejected that idea. Federal prosecutors have reportedly launched a broad probe into Giuliani\u2019s consulting business to determine whether his activities broke any lobbying laws. Some of the charges being considered include obstruction of justice, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the US. The office of the US trade representative announced it is moving forward with its investigation of France\u2019s digital tax, which previously prompted threats from Trump that he may impose tariffs on French wine. The US and France had declared a 90-day truce on the dispute, but that has now expired. The New York Times has more context on the feud: French leaders voted this year to impose a new tax on economic activity that takes place online and crafted it in such a way that it would largely hit large American tech companies like Amazon and Facebook. In response, the Trump administration opened an investigation into whether the tax posed a threat to national security and should be met with American tariffs on French products. Mr. Trump vocalized the threat of tariffs in July. Soon after, the countries reached a 90-day agreement that paused the American retaliation, while leaders from wealthy countries including France and the United States pursued negotiations toward an international agreement on digital taxation. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the president\u2019s most loyal defenders against the impeachment inquiry, has once again denounced the process of the investigation over Twitter. The South Carolina criticized Adam Schiff for not allowing Trump to participate in the House intelligence committee\u2019s hearings and claimed, \u201cSalem witches got a better deal than this!\u201d That dubious assertion prompted at least one White House reporter to remind Graham of the dozens of people who were executed during the Salem witch trials in 1692. Trump has been given the option to provide counsel for the House judiciary committee\u2019s first impeachment hearing next week, but it\u2019s unclear whether the president will choose to do so. It\u2019s also important to remember that the White House blocked some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and energy secretary Rick Perry, from testifying during the intelligence committee hearings, so it\u2019s not as if the president has been deprived of opportunities to present additional evidence. A new poll out this morning shows Joe Biden leading the rest of the 2020 Democratic field by double digits, the second survey in two days to indicate the former vice president holds a solid lead in the race. According to the CNN/SSRS poll, Biden has attracted the support of 28% of Democratic voters -- compared to Bernie Sanders\u2019 17%, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 14% and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 11%. This marks the first CNN national poll that has Buttigieg registering in the double digits. A Quinnipiac poll released yesterday similarly showed Biden hitting 24%, putting him 8 points ahead of Buttigieg, who was in second place at 16%. With about two months left to go until the Iowa caucuses, it appears Biden\u2019s opponents are having a hard time ousting him from the frontrunner perch he has occupied since entering the race in April. Biden\u2019s lasting support appears to be bolstered by his popularity among African-American voters. According to the Quinnipiac poll, 43% of black Democrats back Biden, putting him more than 30 points ahead of any of his opponents in that category. In some good news, former president Jimmy Carter has been released from the hospital after a successful surgery to address a brain bleed from a recent fall. The 95-year-old former president was hospitalized twice last month due to falls, but the Carter Center said he was recovering well and looked forward to spending Thanksgiving at his Georgia home. More specifically, the photoshopped picture Trump shared appears to be taken from the poster for the movie \u201cRocky III,\u201d starring Sylvester Stallone. (Stallone actually visited the White House last year when Trump signed a posthumous pardon for the boxing champion Jack Johnson.) Trump\u2019s tweet of the photo immediately kicked off a caption contest, given that the president did not provide one of his own. As Trump faces the looming threat of impeachment as well as a difficult reelection, the president is projecting confidence by ... sharing a photoshopped image of himself as a boxing prize fighter. According to White House pool reports, the president is currently golfing at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, so this photo was likely shared from the links. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has returned money he received from lawyers who represented Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation process after being contacted by the Guardian about the donations. Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: Buttigieg\u2019s campaign received $7,200 from Alexandra Walsh \u2013 $3,150 of which had already been returned because it exceeded limits \u2013 and attended a fundraiser in July that was co-hosted by the Washington lawyer. Buttigieg also received $2,800 from Beth Wilkinson, Walsh\u2019s law partner, who also represented Kavanaugh. When asked by the Guardian about the donations, the campaign said it had overlooked the lawyers\u2019 role in the Kavanaugh confirmation and had made a mistake in accepting the donations. It said: \u2018With nearly 700,000 donors, a contribution we would otherwise refuse sometimes gets through. We believe the women who have courageously spoken out about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s assault and misconduct, and we thank the Guardian for bringing this contribution to our attention.\u2019 Democratic representative Stephen Lynch -- a member of the House oversight committe, which helped conduct closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry -- argued in a CNN interview this morning that the testimony from the public hearings has established clearly impeachable behavior on the president\u2019s part. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, announced yesterday that his panel would hold its first impeachment hearing next week, which could keep the House on track to vote on articles of impeachment by Christmas. Officials are still unclear about what caused the airspace violation that triggered yesterday\u2019s brief lockdown at the White House and the Capitol, but one Capitol Police source said a \u201cslow-moving blob\u201d on the radar had sparked concern. CNN has more: Senior national security officials across the agencies convened to coordinate and monitor the situation after the mysterious \u2018blob\u2019 was seen on radar at the Capitol Police command center flying just south of the National Mall, according to a law enforcement source. Military aircraft were scrambled in response. Initial assessments indicated that the \u2018blob\u2019 was an unauthorized aircraft entering restrictive airspace, leading to the brief lockdown. ... But hours after the all clear was given, a defense official told CNN that a final determination had not yet been made as to what exactly caused the event. There are currently three possible causes being analyzed, a US defense official confirmed to CNN: Birds, an atmospheric anomaly or a drone. In an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly that streamed yesterday, Trump appeared to be trying to distance himself from Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer who has become increasingly embroiled in the impeachment inquiry for his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Asked whether he directed Giuliani to launch the pressure campaign in Ukraine, Trump said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior.\u201d But Giuliani has said he was pursuing the investigations on Trump\u2019s behalf, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, testified to the House intelligence committee last week that he only worked with Guiliani because the former New York mayor was clearly doing the president\u2019s bidding. Trump went on to say in the interview, \u201cRudy has other clients, other than me. ... He\u2019s done a lot of work in Ukraine over the years.\u201d The president\u2019s comments also come as reports emerge that federal prosecutors have launched a probe broad of Giuliani\u2019s consulting business. Meanwhile, the White House has not yet provided a clear answer on whether Trump intends to send a lawyer to the House judicary committee\u2019s first impeachment hearing next week, instead simply criticizing the entire inquiry as a \u201csham.\u201d The president has until Sunday to decide whether he wants to send counsel to the Dec. 4 hearing, but some Trump advisers have reportedly advised him not to send a lawyer because it could add credibility to the hearing. Good morning, live blog readers! The drip, drip, drip of revelations from the impeachment inquiry continued last night when the New York Times reported that Donald Trump was aware of a whistleblower complaint about his communications with Ukraine when the president released the country\u2019s military aid. The Times reports: Lawyers from the White House counsel\u2019s office told Mr. Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the people said. The revelation could shed light on Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 with Kyiv. Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair. Mr. Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistle-blower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to conduct investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances. Trump\u2019s congressional allies have argued he could not have participated in a bribery scheme, as Democrats have alleged, because the funds were eventually released. However, if Trump only released the money in the hope of neutralizing the whistleblower complaint, that sounds more like a cover-up than a defense. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Trump is at Mar-a-Lago with his family for Thanksgiving and has no events on his public schedule. Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris are campaigning in Iowa today. Deval Patrick is spending the day in Columbia, South Carolina. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "In a full embrace of 90s nostalgia, I donned a pair of brown corduroy trousers, cracked a cold longneck of Carlton Draught and settled in to watch Recovery: The Music &amp; The Mayhem, a documentary about the generation-defining ABC music show that aired on Saturday mornings from 1996 to 2000. Celebrated for bringing local and international bands into suburban living rooms, it was also rife with pranks, games and zany segments that took in everything from nude lawn-mowing to horror movies. But while it was a thrill to relive the tide of wackiness Recovery embodied, perhaps the documentary is most interesting in its attempt to create a coherent narrative about a show that often lacked one. Featuring interviews with hosts Dylan Lewis, Jane Gazzo, the show\u2019s producers and a slew of musicians, it makes the case that not only did Recovery provide a stage for Regurgitator to sing I Piss Alone in skintight spacesuits, it also helped shape politics and Indigenous affairs. Perhaps this is why the show attracted concern from those in power.

The sheer chaos and unpredictability of their appearances was enough to get the grey hairs in my house shaking their heads. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s had a shower in months,\u201d my mother would say, glancing over my shoulder at Jay Whalley. \u201cAnd why does he have purple dreadlocks? I wouldn\u2019t even know where to buy that colour.\u201d As a teenager at home, watching the blast of Punch In The Face felt more than cathartic; it felt something like freedom. I didn\u2019t fully comprehend the song\u2019s class commentary and lambasting of \u201cmiddle class white boys,\u201d but I could sense that these punks who seemed like they could barely play their instruments had married stupidity and anti-authority in a way that was uniquely Australian. They were larrikins. Oh nostalgia, there\u2019s life in you yet. I\u2019m off to put batteries in my walkman and trawl eBay for original Tumbleweed concert posters \u2013 and one of the Enforcer\u2019s T-shirts. \u2022 Recovery: The Music &amp; the Mayhem is streaming on iView",

The Woman Who Cracked the Anxiety Code \u2013 a biography of my hero Dr Claire Weekes by Judith Hoare (fine writer, fine topic).

It traces the uses made by fascist activists of trolling, meming and internet culture as a whole; it unpicks new developments like \u201caccelerationism\u201d and \u201ceco fascism\u201d. Most of all, it argues that if we are to prevent further massacres, we need to understand the ideology driving them.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I read an advance copy of David Renton\u2019s book The New Authoritarianism, which greatly influenced aspects of my argument.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>After the Count by Stephanie Convery.

Most of the people I\u2019ve profiled are Australian (among them Ian Thorpe and Liane Moriarty), and many have toiled long and hard in their respective fields over a lifetime, sustained by their deep passion for what they do. It has been my privilege to eavesdrop on their working lives, and to catch glimpses of bodies of knowledge and ways of being and working that are often inaccessible to outsiders. I hope that the book might inspire readers to reignite their own interests and obsessions, and perhaps even find a way to build a career around them.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I wrote these profiles over about seven years, and while writing them I read everything I could find by the people I was writing about, for insights into their daily work. Some standouts include Alice Gorman\u2019s Dr Space Junk vs The Universe, Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin\u2019s The Novel Cure: An A-Z of Literary Remedies, and Lyndall Ryan and Jane Lydon\u2019s edited volume Remembering the Myall Creek Massacre.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>The next Australian book I plan to read is Tyson Yunkaporta\u2019s Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World. I\u2019ve just started dipping into it and I\u2019m already excited by the possibility of drawing on concepts from the book to think about outer space differently \u2013 since I\u2019m currently obsessed with social and environmental justice in space, and how we can find new forms of relating out there instead of exporting our failed earthly traditions of narcissism and greed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tim Flannery<br></strong><em><strong>Life: Selected Writings</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Text</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"40c76d82ea9a5693c3887429e1a70a9f2eb415b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40c76d82ea9a5693c3887429e1a70a9f2eb415b8/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Life: Selected Writings by Tim Flannery\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Its a strange business looking back on 30 years of writing to select pieces for a collected work. I\u2019m not terribly self-reflective, so my reading earlier works systematically was new for me. The trajectory the exercise revealed \u2013 an expansion of perspective with an odd circling back to various topics \u2013 was intriguing because I was unaware of it as I wrote. I came away from it feeling proud of some of my earlier works, especially my early attempts at understanding the Australian environment, and my adventures in New Guinea. They were rugged and edgy in a way my later writing was not.</p> <p>It\u2019s odd how things that might make you cringe at some stages of your life later look like virtues. Writing the introduction was the most difficult thing. After all, it has to be about the writer and his journey. I kept wishing that someone else could write it. But there it is, the most self-reflective piece I\u2019ve ever penned.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>James Scott\u2019s Against the Grain. The earliest cities were gulags according to Scott, the city walls designed to keep people in rather than invaders out. A grim start to so-called civilisation \u2013 and what a journey us urbanites have been on over the past 6,000 years \u2013 a journey that continues with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/27/they-surrendered-hong-kong-activists-mull-next-move-as-university-siege-ends\">protesters in Hong Kong.</a></p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Peter Temple\u2019s The Red Hand.

But it\u2019s true: up until the mid-19th century it was usual for things to be passed and sold on until they were completely worn out. And even then, uses were found for them: cotton rags made paper, furniture for fuel, even food scraps and floor sweepings were recycled. There was, it was said, \u201cno such thing as waste\u201d.</p> <p>Nothing New traces the history of second-hand, as a practice that gained a stigma only as consumerism taught us to venerate the new. Yet secondhand has kept breaking through, in guises ranging from jumble sales to the Trading Post, garage sales, the used-car trade, op shops and high-end vintage. Now, the flipside of fast fashion is peak secondhand. Nothing New celebrates secondhand as a pleasure, a deviance and a force for good.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Old newspapers, digitised and online at Trove, hosted by the National Library of Australia. Better than any other source, they brought me up close to people\u2019s shifting relationship with secondhand over time. And breaking news carried the story forward \u2013 the recycling crisis, fashion pollution, the decluttering craze, op shops overwhelmed.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Andrew McGahan\u2019s The Rich Man\u2019s House promises to be a thrilling genre-buster and, at 600-odd pages, an immersive post-publication treat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2017/07/booklisted/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2017/07/booklisted/boot.js\" data-alt=\".\"> </figure>",

I made a call to read very little as I wrote \u2013 deprivation of this pleasure was a great motivator in getting me to clock in my daily wordcount! But I did reread one old-fashioned underrated classic several times during my writing called Self Help for Your Nerves by Dr Claire Weekes. This was the book that saved my life at age 21. Bloody winner, that one. What will you read next? I have three books Aussie books on my side table at the moment. The Woman Who Cracked the Anxiety Code \u2013 a biography of my hero Dr Claire Weekes by Judith Hoare (fine writer, fine topic). Paris or Die by Jayne Tuttle, one of my favourite Australian Parisian authors, who just moved back to the Victorian coast to run the Queenscliff bookstore. And Leigh Robshaw\u2019s You Had Me at Hola: I did an event with Leigh in Maleny and she was a hoot. It\u2019s self-published and apparently rather adventurous, I hear. Summer here I come! Jeff Sparrow Fascists Among Us: Online Hate and the Christchurch Massacre Scribe Tell us about your book. Fascists Among Us was written in the aftermath of the Christchurch massacre. It\u2019s an argument about the nature of 21st century fascism, an examination of the relationship between the extremely online fascism of Pepe memes and gun massacres and the old-style fascism of Nuremberg rallies and Blackshirts. It looks at how the events of 9/11 reshaped the right as a whole, and how a distinctively fascist current exploited the new political environment. It traces the uses made by fascist activists of trolling, meming and internet culture as a whole; it unpicks new developments like \u201caccelerationism\u201d and \u201ceco fascism\u201d. Most of all, it argues that if we are to prevent further massacres, we need to understand the ideology driving them. What were you reading while you wrote it? I read an advance copy of David Renton\u2019s book The New Authoritarianism, which greatly influenced aspects of my argument. What will you read next? After the Count by Stephanie Convery. Reader, I married her. Ceridwen Dovey Inner Worlds, Outer Spaces Hamish Hamilton Tell us about your book. This book is a collected edition of profiles I\u2019ve written of people in unusual careers, from moon dust scientists to women\u2019s rugby stars to space archaeologists to bibliotherapists. Most of the people I\u2019ve profiled are Australian (among them Ian Thorpe and Liane Moriarty), and many have toiled long and hard in their respective fields over a lifetime, sustained by their deep passion for what they do. It has been my privilege to eavesdrop on their working lives, and to catch glimpses of bodies of knowledge and ways of being and working that are often inaccessible to outsiders. I hope that the book might inspire readers to reignite their own interests and obsessions, and perhaps even find a way to build a career around them. What were you reading while you wrote it? I wrote these profiles over about seven years, and while writing them I read everything I could find by the people I was writing about, for insights into their daily work. Some standouts include Alice Gorman\u2019s Dr Space Junk vs The Universe, Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin\u2019s The Novel Cure: An A-Z of Literary Remedies, and Lyndall Ryan and Jane Lydon\u2019s edited volume Remembering the Myall Creek Massacre. What will you read next? The next Australian book I plan to read is Tyson Yunkaporta\u2019s Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World. I\u2019ve just started dipping into it and I\u2019m already excited by the possibility of drawing on concepts from the book to think about outer space differently \u2013 since I\u2019m currently obsessed with social and environmental justice in space, and how we can find new forms of relating out there instead of exporting our failed earthly traditions of narcissism and greed. Tim Flannery Life: Selected Writings Text Tell us about your book. Its a strange business looking back on 30 years of writing to select pieces for a collected work. I\u2019m not terribly self-reflective, so my reading earlier works systematically was new for me. The trajectory the exercise revealed \u2013 an expansion of perspective with an odd circling back to various topics \u2013 was intriguing because I was unaware of it as I wrote. I came away from it feeling proud of some of my earlier works, especially my early attempts at understanding the Australian environment, and my adventures in New Guinea. They were rugged and edgy in a way my later writing was not. It\u2019s odd how things that might make you cringe at some stages of your life later look like virtues. Writing the introduction was the most difficult thing. After all, it has to be about the writer and his journey. I kept wishing that someone else could write it. But there it is, the most self-reflective piece I\u2019ve ever penned. What were you reading while you wrote it? James Scott\u2019s Against the Grain. The earliest cities were gulags according to Scott, the city walls designed to keep people in rather than invaders out. A grim start to so-called civilisation \u2013 and what a journey us urbanites have been on over the past 6,000 years \u2013 a journey that continues with Extinction Rebellion and the protesters in Hong Kong. What will you read next? Peter Temple\u2019s The Red Hand. Its a posthumous collected works of an Australian writer of crime fiction who I greatly admire. I guess that producing my own collected works has made me curious to read more in the genre. Robyn Annear Nothing New Text Tell us about your book. It\u2019s hard to imagine there was ever a time when new was an aberration and secondhand the norm. But it\u2019s true: up until the mid-19th century it was usual for things to be passed and sold on until they were completely worn out. And even then, uses were found for them: cotton rags made paper, furniture for fuel, even food scraps and floor sweepings were recycled. There was, it was said, \u201cno such thing as waste\u201d. Nothing New traces the history of second-hand, as a practice that gained a stigma only as consumerism taught us to venerate the new. Yet secondhand has kept breaking through, in guises ranging from jumble sales to the Trading Post, garage sales, the used-car trade, op shops and high-end vintage. Now, the flipside of fast fashion is peak secondhand. Nothing New celebrates secondhand as a pleasure, a deviance and a force for good. What were you reading while you wrote it? Old newspapers, digitised and online at Trove, hosted by the National Library of Australia. Better than any other source, they brought me up close to people\u2019s shifting relationship with secondhand over time. And breaking news carried the story forward \u2013 the recycling crisis, fashion pollution, the decluttering craze, op shops overwhelmed. What will you read next? Andrew McGahan\u2019s The Rich Man\u2019s House promises to be a thrilling genre-buster and, at 600-odd pages, an immersive post-publication treat.",

Napoli left no space, no angles to make those killer diagonal passes. There was no room in that low blue block for the front three to create the usual whirl of movement.</p> <p>Probably Liverpool were due a game like this. Some of the players had begun to look a little tired. The loss of Fabinho with a foot injury after 20 minutes disrupted the flow. They also missed their playmaker here. Without Alexander\u2011Arnold the flatness of the midfield is suddenly an issue. There is no comparison with Gomez on the right flank, a converted centre-half who looked like one here, slowing the play on his side of the pitch like the squeaky wheel on a wonky supermarket trolley.</p> <p>Plus, of course, Napoli are a seriously good team, with a coach in Carlo Ancelotti who knows how to twang away at those tender points in a Klopp team. The opening goal echoed Napoli\u2019s success down the flanks in their 2-0 win in Naples.</p> <p>As Liverpool pressed high the ball was turned over and Giovanni Di Lorenzo lofted a pass in behind Andy Robertson. Dries Mertens was ready, haring off alone into all that green space. He let the ball bounce, let it bounce again and then smashed a thrilling low shot across Alisson and into the far corner.</p> <p>Premier League teams really could do a lot worse than study the tapes of these 180 Champions League minutes. It\u2019s a simple plan. Defend deep, break quickly, look for the long pass in behind the full-backs. Above all, don\u2019t see red-shirted furies in front of you. Napoli\u2019s players were calm, stayed compact and saved their adrenaline. It helps, of course, if you can defend like an Italian team. Spurs tried something here and were eaten alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When in doubt, send for more Henderson.

And for a while as Liverpool\u2019s fans absorbed the sense of resale, scarves twirling, this was a beautiful sporting spectacle, the players moving as blocks of blue and red under those brilliant white lights. Liverpool had done it again, wearing their opponents down relentlessly. But Napoli gave them plenty to ponder; not to mention a lesson \u2013 who knows \u2013 for the rest of the league in how to resist that rising tide.</p>",

But there were misfires and missed beats from the start. Napoli left no space, no angles to make those killer diagonal passes. There was no room in that low blue block for the front three to create the usual whirl of movement. Probably Liverpool were due a game like this. Some of the players had begun to look a little tired. The loss of Fabinho with a foot injury after 20 minutes disrupted the flow. They also missed their playmaker here. Without Alexander\u2011Arnold the flatness of the midfield is suddenly an issue. There is no comparison with Gomez on the right flank, a converted centre-half who looked like one here, slowing the play on his side of the pitch like the squeaky wheel on a wonky supermarket trolley. Plus, of course, Napoli are a seriously good team, with a coach in Carlo Ancelotti who knows how to twang away at those tender points in a Klopp team. The opening goal echoed Napoli\u2019s success down the flanks in their 2-0 win in Naples. As Liverpool pressed high the ball was turned over and Giovanni Di Lorenzo lofted a pass in behind Andy Robertson. Dries Mertens was ready, haring off alone into all that green space. He let the ball bounce, let it bounce again and then smashed a thrilling low shot across Alisson and into the far corner. Premier League teams really could do a lot worse than study the tapes of these 180 Champions League minutes. It\u2019s a simple plan. Defend deep, break quickly, look for the long pass in behind the full-backs. Above all, don\u2019t see red-shirted furies in front of you. Napoli\u2019s players were calm, stayed compact and saved their adrenaline. It helps, of course, if you can defend like an Italian team. Spurs tried something here and were eaten alive. When in doubt, send for more Henderson. Just past the hour mark Klopp removed Gomez, put the captain at right-back and almost instantly the game changed. Liverpool began to crank up through the higher registers, to switch the ball from side to side with some of that familiar disorientating vim. The goal was coming: it duly arrived on 65 minutes. And for a while as Liverpool\u2019s fans absorbed the sense of resale, scarves twirling, this was a beautiful sporting spectacle, the players moving as blocks of blue and red under those brilliant white lights. Liverpool had done it again, wearing their opponents down relentlessly. But Napoli gave them plenty to ponder; not to mention a lesson \u2013 who knows \u2013 for the rest of the league in how to resist that rising tide.",

The analysis by Ucas showed that most universities extended offers to more than four out of every five applicants, while even those institutions requiring the highest A-level grades were not far behind in all but the most prestigious courses.</p> <p>A record rate of 34% of UK 18-year-olds entered higher education in 2019, a total of 241,515. Of the remaining 66%, many are likely to enter higher education before they turn 30, based on current trends.</p> <p>Clare Marchant, Ucas\u2019s chief executive, said the figures \u201cshow the unprecedented opportunity for anyone currently thinking of applying to university to be ambitious with their choices. The trends identified through our analysis are very likely to continue into this year, with universities, colleges, and schools continuing to support students from a variety of backgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>Many students took advantage of the \u201cbuyer\u2019s market\u201d by using Ucas\u2019s post-results clearing service to hunt for improved offers, with 73,000 applicants \u2013 more than one in eight \u2013 finding places. Thousands took advantage of a new option to \u201cself-release\u201d from previously accepted offers, many in hope of finding a more attractive choice.</p> <p>Students with predicted A-level grades of AAB or ABB were the most in demand overall, with an 87% likelihood of receiving an offer from each university to which they applied. About 39% of applicants received competing offers from each of their maximum of five choices.</p> <p>Ucas\u2019s end-of-cycle analysis noted that universities have expanded their use of contextual offers to attract applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds.

      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s school-leavers are enjoying \u201cthe best time ever\u201d to take their pick of university courses, thanks to fierce competition between institutions recruiting from a shrinking pool of 18-year-olds, according to the UK\u2019s university admissions administrator. Ucas, which operates the admissions process for undergraduate courses, said nearly 98% of applicants received offers of a place to study for a degree this year, and that could be even higher next year as the demographic dip among British school-leavers reaches its lowest point. \u201cConsidering the likely impact of the further decline in the 18-year-old population, and the expansion of applicant choice in the admissions process, now may be the best time ever for students to realise their higher education ambitions,\u201d Ucas said in its review of 2019 application statistics. The figures lay bare the intense scramble among universities relying on undergraduate tuition fees. The analysis by Ucas showed that most universities extended offers to more than four out of every five applicants, while even those institutions requiring the highest A-level grades were not far behind in all but the most prestigious courses. A record rate of 34% of UK 18-year-olds entered higher education in 2019, a total of 241,515. Of the remaining 66%, many are likely to enter higher education before they turn 30, based on current trends. Clare Marchant, Ucas\u2019s chief executive, said the figures \u201cshow the unprecedented opportunity for anyone currently thinking of applying to university to be ambitious with their choices. The trends identified through our analysis are very likely to continue into this year, with universities, colleges, and schools continuing to support students from a variety of backgrounds.\u201d Many students took advantage of the \u201cbuyer\u2019s market\u201d by using Ucas\u2019s post-results clearing service to hunt for improved offers, with 73,000 applicants \u2013 more than one in eight \u2013 finding places. Thousands took advantage of a new option to \u201cself-release\u201d from previously accepted offers, many in hope of finding a more attractive choice. Students with predicted A-level grades of AAB or ABB were the most in demand overall, with an 87% likelihood of receiving an offer from each university to which they applied. About 39% of applicants received competing offers from each of their maximum of five choices. Ucas\u2019s end-of-cycle analysis noted that universities have expanded their use of contextual offers to attract applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. But it found that only 17% of the most disadvantaged applicants reported receiving one, while others remain unaware of their use. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Ucas was wrong to suggest teachers should do more to \u201cfamiliarise\u201d themselves with contextual offers. \u201cThis is easier said than done. Ucas itself acknowledges that contextualised admissions practices vary substantially between higher education providers. And schools and colleges have suffered years of real-terms cuts which means they are simply unable to provide the level of student support that they would like to be able to offer,\u201d Barton said. Barton also noted the \u201cworrying decline\u201d in applications to study mathematical sciences, which has been attributed to the tougher maths curriculum in England and fewer students taking the subjects at A-levels. \u201cIt is hard to escape the conclusion that some students have been put off maths by the difficulty of the new so-called \u2018big, fat\u2019 maths GCSE,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe hope the decline in entries turns out to be a blip but it is important the government reviews what has happened and addresses any problems.
