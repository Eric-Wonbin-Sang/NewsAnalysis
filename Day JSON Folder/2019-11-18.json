      "bodyText": "Labour is to pledge in its animal welfare manifesto to provide more police to investigate foxhunting and hare coursing crimes. The party plans to close loopholes in the 2004 Hunting Act that it said allow in practice the continuation of illegal hunting of foxes, hares and deer. Its policies are intended to contrast with previous moves by the Conservatives, who got into hot water in 2017 over Theresa May\u2019s pledge to hold a free vote on legalising foxhunting. Tory sources said the party was not intending to make the same mistake again this time and its manifesto will make clear that Boris Johnson will not seek to overturn the hunting ban. However, Labour will go further when it officially unveils the plans on Tuesday, with a promise to tighten the law around hunting. The shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, said Labour would bring animal welfare policy into the 21st century \u201cwhile the Tories continue with their mass slaughter of badgers and flip-flop on bringing back foxhunting\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are calling time on those who have been allowed to get away with illegally hunting, maiming and killing wild animals such as deer, hen harriers, foxes and hares. \u201cBy increasing the number of wildlife and rural police forces across the country, we will help protect both wild animals and property in rural communities, and ensure a crackdown on the types of crimes against animals that this Tory government has turned a blind eye to.\u201d The pledge to increase policing of wildlife crimes will be supported by a \u00a34.5m funding boost, doubling officer numbers from 88 to 170. They would be tasked with targeting offences including hare coursing, which is a problem across farmlands, and acts outlawed by the Hunting Act, such as stag hunting, badger and raptor baiting, livestock theft and dog fighting. The party also promised stricter rules around foxhunting, including a \u201crecklessness\u201d clause that would prevent trail hunts being used as cover for the illegal hunting of wild mammals. It would remove the exemption for \u201cresearch and observation\u201d hunting and another for the \u201cuse of dogs below ground to protect birds for shooting\u201d. Labour said it also wanted to review the penalties for breaches of the Hunting Act and consult on the introduction of jail terms for illegal hunting. In response, George Eustice, the Tory farming minister, highlighted his party\u2019s record on animal welfare, claiming Brexit would mean the UK could ban the live export of animals. \u201cThe UK is a global leader when it comes to animal welfare, and outside the EU we will be able to go even further \u2013 including proposals to ban the live export of animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already introduced one of the world\u2019s toughest bans on ivory sales, introduced compulsory CCTV in slaughterhouses and overhauled laws on a number of animal-related licensing schemes including regulations on the licensing of puppy breeders.\u201d Martin Sims, a former head of the police\u2019s National Wildlife Crime Unit and now director of investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, welcomed Labour\u2019s plans, which he described as \u201cbold\u201d. \u201cI urge other parties to stand united against hunting, to pledge to finally stop the barbaric chasing and killing of foxes with packs of hounds that still takes place today, 14 years after the foxhunting ban came into force,\u201d he said. \u201cIntroducing custodial sentences for foxhunting would bring it in line with other animal welfare crimes, and will serve to be a more effective deterrent to those who insist on continuing to kill animals for \u2018sport\u2019.\u201d",

Still, the image of junior doctor Max Liebermann hanging from his fingertips over the city of Vienna after being hurled from the door, proved a thrilling, if completely avoidable \u2013 \u201chypnosis would be easier\u201d \u2013 end to the first episode of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bpx1\" title=\"\">Vienna Blood (BBC Two)</a>.</p> <p>It is set in Vienna in 1906, where gruff detective Oskar Rheinhardt (Juergen Maurer) is told that a young doctor \u2013 Liebermann (Matthew Beard), a fan of Freud \u2013 will be shadowing him to learn about \u201cthe psychopathy of the criminal mind\u201d. \u201cCatchy,\u201d deadpans Rheinhardt. The three-part series will be compared, unavoidably, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/21/how-sherlock-went-from-super-sleuth-to-the-baker-street-men-behaving-badly\" title=\"\">to Sherlock</a>: its writer, Steve Thompson, adapting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/09/frank-tallis-interview-the-incurable-romantic-fiction-psychology\" title=\"\">Frank Tallis novels</a>, was also a Sherlock scriptwriter. But Liebermann\u2019s character study of his reluctant new mentor is so Holmesian it feels like a spoof. For the first half an hour, it feels as if the makers are failing to repress their Sherlock complex \u2013 the jaunty camera angles, the hyperreal look, the jangly music \u2013 until it starts to relax into itself.</p> <p>A medium has been murdered \u2013 a crime that has been made to look like suicide. Except, points out just about every character \u2013 as if we didn\u2019t get the significance the first time \u2013 where is the weapon? Rheinhardt is, in the classic tradition, one of those troubled but maverick detectives with quirks \u2013 he munches coffee beans \u2013 and who needs a quick conviction. His relationship with Liebermann is predictably tricky at first, but it is nice to watch him thaw. \u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d says Rheinhardt. \u201cI was told I could observe,\u201d says the young doctor. The police officer is humble enough to value Liebermann\u2019s talents for personality profiling, and asks for help. And hurrah, (possibly) TV\u2019s first forensic psychologist is born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be18ff9f7d26e1a7228d890194b66ef6b215ae37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be18ff9f7d26e1a7228d890194b66ef6b215ae37/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Beard and Jessica de Gouw in Vienna Blood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Beard and Jessica de Gouw in Vienna Blood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Production/BBC/MR Film/Endor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liebermann is implausibly good at this: he points out that the woman\u2019s apartment is \u201clike a stage set\u201d (they realise she holds seances), and is puzzled by the absence of clothes in her wardrobe, until he makes the giant leap that she must have been pregnant, her clothes all taken to be altered by a seamstress. \u201cWelcome to the case, Inspector,\u201d says the doctor. Goodness, he\u2019s cocky, under that cool demeanour. Back to the morgue where his theory is confirmed. \u201cFind the father of this child, he\u2019s your killer,\u201d he tells the experienced older detective, who inexplicably fails to thank him sarcastically for the suggestion.</p> <p>Is the killer Otto Braun, one of the men they track down who attended the seance? There is a good rooftop chase that makes him look guilty. \u201cWelcome to the case, doctor,\u201d says Rheinhardt back to Liebermann, when they catch him.

      "bodyText": "For someone who professes to be into the new-fangled science of what makes people tick, I\u2019m not sure it was the cleverest move to get into a rickety carriage on a fairground ferris wheel with a psychopathic killer. Still, the image of junior doctor Max Liebermann hanging from his fingertips over the city of Vienna after being hurled from the door, proved a thrilling, if completely avoidable \u2013 \u201chypnosis would be easier\u201d \u2013 end to the first episode of Vienna Blood (BBC Two). It is set in Vienna in 1906, where gruff detective Oskar Rheinhardt (Juergen Maurer) is told that a young doctor \u2013 Liebermann (Matthew Beard), a fan of Freud \u2013 will be shadowing him to learn about \u201cthe psychopathy of the criminal mind\u201d. \u201cCatchy,\u201d deadpans Rheinhardt. The three-part series will be compared, unavoidably, to Sherlock: its writer, Steve Thompson, adapting the Frank Tallis novels, was also a Sherlock scriptwriter. But Liebermann\u2019s character study of his reluctant new mentor is so Holmesian it feels like a spoof. For the first half an hour, it feels as if the makers are failing to repress their Sherlock complex \u2013 the jaunty camera angles, the hyperreal look, the jangly music \u2013 until it starts to relax into itself. A medium has been murdered \u2013 a crime that has been made to look like suicide. Except, points out just about every character \u2013 as if we didn\u2019t get the significance the first time \u2013 where is the weapon? Rheinhardt is, in the classic tradition, one of those troubled but maverick detectives with quirks \u2013 he munches coffee beans \u2013 and who needs a quick conviction. His relationship with Liebermann is predictably tricky at first, but it is nice to watch him thaw. \u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d says Rheinhardt. \u201cI was told I could observe,\u201d says the young doctor. The police officer is humble enough to value Liebermann\u2019s talents for personality profiling, and asks for help. And hurrah, (possibly) TV\u2019s first forensic psychologist is born. Liebermann is implausibly good at this: he points out that the woman\u2019s apartment is \u201clike a stage set\u201d (they realise she holds seances), and is puzzled by the absence of clothes in her wardrobe, until he makes the giant leap that she must have been pregnant, her clothes all taken to be altered by a seamstress. \u201cWelcome to the case, Inspector,\u201d says the doctor. Goodness, he\u2019s cocky, under that cool demeanour. Back to the morgue where his theory is confirmed. \u201cFind the father of this child, he\u2019s your killer,\u201d he tells the experienced older detective, who inexplicably fails to thank him sarcastically for the suggestion. Is the killer Otto Braun, one of the men they track down who attended the seance? There is a good rooftop chase that makes him look guilty. \u201cWelcome to the case, doctor,\u201d says Rheinhardt back to Liebermann, when they catch him. It is cheesy, but their relationship is developing so nicely I\u2019ll let them off. But it\u2019s not Braun \u2013 the killer is an adulterer with a reputation to lose, and anyway, Braun soon ends up dead. The sleuths arrange another seance, presumably \u2013 though it\u2019s not clear \u2013 to pretend to contact the dead medium, and flush out one of the other attendees, a wealthy banker, Heinrich Holderlein, whose wife makes him go to this sort of thing. It doesn\u2019t work but he is questioned, until rich and powerful people conspire to put pressure on the police, and get Rheinhardt taken off the case. As if that would work; Rheinhardt is dogged and anyway, he says, \u201cwork is all I have\u201d. He deduces the murder weapon is an antique gun, stuffed with fragments of human bone instead of shot, so it leaves no trace (I still don\u2019t understand why the killer thought this necessary) \u2013 and Liebermann figures the door was locked from the outside using steel forceps. Which makes them suspicious of the Vienna steel magnate and mayor\u2019s right-hand man, Hans Br\u00fcckm\u00fcller \u2013 as if he\u2019s the only one in the city with access to such a device. But it must be him \u2013 the police commissioner was keeping the mayor\u2019s office informed of the investigation, so Br\u00fcckm\u00fcller was always a step ahead. Invited anonymously by Liebermann to meet him at the fairground and ride the big wheel, Br\u00fcckm\u00fcller is revealed not so much as a Moriarty mastermind but as a frighteningly recognisable trumped-up politician wanting to rid Vienna of \u201cthe vermin \u2013 the subversives, the intellectuals, the muck-raking journalists\u201d. He spits contemptuously at Liebermann: \u201cDr Jew.\u201d Still, Liebermann gets his confession, and stuffs a life-saving finger in Br\u00fcckm\u00fcller\u2019s fresh bullet wound. It is all absurd but enjoyable, the extended length more or less justified by the subplots: the advent of a more humane treatment of mental health v the electroshocks championed by Liebermann\u2019s arrogant professor; Viennese overt antisemitism and Liebermann\u2019s father\u2019s desperation to fit in; the difficulty of convicting powerful men who think they are untouchable.

So that\u2019s encouraging, yes?<br></p> <p>This will be the teams\u2019 sixth meeting in the last two years plus a week, with the previous five ending, in order of excitement, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 1-1 and 1-5, with one rogue Christian Eriksen-inspired Denmark thumping in Dublin interrupting an otherwise humdrum sequence.</p> <p>There is one decent cause for optimism: the Republic of Ireland must win. If they do, they qualify automatically for Euro 2020. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll have to play off. Unless they\u2019re already winning, there will come a point where they have nothing to lose, and will boldly throw caution to the wind. Less encouragingly Denmark know a draw will see them safely through, either in first place (if Switzerland somehow fail to beat Gibraltar) or second (if they do), so have every reason to hold out for another goalless draw.</p> <p>Anyway, a game of football to be played. It will probably be more fun than at least one and possibly all five of the Republic of Ireland-Denmark clashes in recent memory. So let\u2019s gather round football\u2019s glowing brazier and let the flickering flames of international qualifying football warm our hands and our spirits.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll be all from me. Here\u2019s a round-up of tonight\u2019s qualifying action. Bye! Finally, Mick McCarthy talks: Obviously disappointed that we lost. We went to sleep and conceded a bad goal, so I\u2019m disappointed with that. Overall very pleased with the performance, very proud of the players and immensely proud of the reaction after conceding, and pushing them right to the limit. I said beforehand if my players, my team give me everything, I\u2019ll take the result that comes. I\u2019ve got to take the defeat, but they left everything and a bit more there. Play like that in the play-offs, then we can beat anybody. You just need that bit of luck. We had opportunities that we could have done better with, but I\u2019m not going to criticise the lads. I think they\u2019ve been terrific, I\u2019m really proud of them. If we could have got that 15-minute onslaught, who knows? But it\u2019s all hypothetical, and it didn\u2019t happen. Between now and March I\u2019ll be making sure they realise it has been a good campaign, and if we can play like that, why can\u2019t we win in March? That was what I first said to them. We\u2019re out of this, now let\u2019s win the play-offs. Matt Doherty has a chat now. He too had a fine game, capped with his first international goal: We knew we had to win the game and we haven\u2019t managed to do that, so even though we played well and restricted them to not much, it\u2019s flat as a pancake right now. We had control of the game, it was wave after wave of attack. I wouldn\u2019t say there were massive clear-cut chances but we all felt a goal was going to come. We were playing out from the back, our movement was good, the crowd was right behind us, everything looked like it was going to fall into place for us, but an individual mistake just deflated the whole place. It was a tough group and we went all the way with it. We just have to make sure we\u2019re right for March. We gave absolutely everything. At the final whistle we all dropped to the floor. We just have to make sure everybody stays fit and healthy and we bring this kind of performance into March. David McGoldrick, one of Ireland\u2019s outstanding players tonight, has a chat: It\u2019s very difficult to take. We gave it our all, that\u2019s what the manager asked for. I think we probably deserved to win the game. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Now we\u2019ve got to think about March. I had a few chances. I had a header that hit my shoulder, a chance I skied over, got to do better. As a striker I\u2019ve got to do better, but what can I say? It\u2019s heartbreaking. We\u2019ve got to think, any way to qualify for these Euros. We\u2019re a tough team to play against, I don\u2019t think many people want to play against us. We haven\u2019t conceded many goals. We haven\u2019t been free-scoring. We\u2019ve been hard to play against us. We\u2019ve got to take that mentality, that desire, and the quality as well into March and we should be OK. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report: In the end Ireland were not quite good enough to force a twist in a taut but predictable drama. They tried their damnedest but inspiration eluded them and then, in the 73rd minute, so did concentration. Martin Braithwaite stepped in to send Denmark to Euro 2020 with their first shot on target. Matt Doherty headed an equaliser five minutes from time but the valiant hosts were to fall agonisingly short. Ireland may still reach the finals through play-offs in March. They could meet Bosnia, Wales, Slovakia or Northern Ireland depending on the result of Wales\u2019s match against Hungary on Tuesday. Much more here: One reason why Duffy will be downhearted is that he is in large part responsible for the Denmark goal. He was standing five yards behind the rest of the Ireland back-line, and had his positioning been better Braithwaite would either have been offside, or unable to reach the cross. Shane Duffy is sad: Disappointing. I thought we were the better team, probably. One slip and it\u2019s cost us on the night, which is disappointing. We believed that we could beat them, and we kept going til the end. We\u2019ve got to pick ourselves back up, and a big game in March. They didn\u2019t really create that many clear-cut chances, and we had a few. I had a feeling all game, that this was our game. It\u2019s a hard one to take right now. We always believed. We\u2019d scored a few late goals in this campaign already and we know we can score goals, but it wasn\u2019t to be. We\u2019ll do everything we can to get there in March. Denmark will be in Pot 3 when the Euro 2020 draw is made on Saturday week. Here are the pots as they stand: Today was the third time in this qualifying campaign that Ireland scored an 85th-minute goal to come from behind and earn a 1-1 draw. Ireland chucked ye olde kitchen sink at that one, but Denmark snaffled a goal with a rare foray forward and from there the home side had the proverbial mountain to climb. Several Irish players are on the turf at the end of the game, while Denmark go to celebrate their qualification for Euro 2020 with their fans. Philippe\u2019s got a point here: 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! An excellent, rousing second-half performance from the Irish, but it\u2019s the play-offs for them! 90+3 mins: Schmeichel takes a ludicrous amount of time over the goal kick, and as the referee books him for timewasting the keeper is hit on the head by a cigarette lighter thrown from the crowd. After some angry gesticulation, he plays on. 90+2 mins: Schmeichel hares out of his goal to claim a lofted cross but doesn\u2019t! The ball bounces through to Stevens, who gets a bit overexcited and slams a shot high from a crazy angle. 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time. Can they? It starts with Doherty thumping a crossfield pass straight into touch. 90 mins: It\u2019s not a great corner, and though Denmark don\u2019t effectively clear it Stevens overhits his through-ball and the Danes have a goal kick. 89 mins: McGoldrick\u2019s excellent cross is turned behind. Another corner! 87 mins: Denmark break, and a ball from the left bounces conveniently off Poulsen, who fell over at the crucial moment, to Eriksen. His first-time shot hits a defender, probably in the arm, but the referee waves play on! Ireland crank up the pressure, playing a succession of balls into the area that Denmark can\u2019t properly clear. Finally, they produce a zinger. Stevens clips one to the far post, and Doherty slams his header into the ground and into the net! 84 mins: Denmark make their final change, bringing Christensen on for Schone. 83 mins: McClean\u2019s 25-yarder rolls through to Schmeichel. Ireland are working up a nice head of steam here, but still no clear chances. 82 mins: Ireland bring Sean Maguire on for Whelan. The corner drops inside the six-yard box, but not at the foot of an Irishman. 81 mins: McGoldrick totally mistimes a header and shoulders the ball over the bar. The referee for some reason gives Ireland a corner. 81 mins: Ten minutes to play here, and Ireland need two goals. They do not look likely to get them, but then it only takes a second etc and so forth. 79 mins: Meanwhile in Palermo it\u2019s Italy 9-1 Armenia, and with 10 minutes to go there\u2019s a double-figure scoreline in the air. 78 mins: The referee gives a foul against James McClean, who is so furious about it he ends up with a yellow card as well. 76 mins: There have been two goals in a minute in Gibraltar, where Switzerland now lead 4-1. As it stands, Denmark top the group. 75 mins: That was Denmark\u2019s first shot on target. Ireland have also had one. Two Denmark players fall into each other, and for some reason the referee gives them a free kick. From nowhere, a goal for Denmark! It\u2019s a lovely left-footed, right-wing cross from Dalsgaard, and Braithwaite breaks the offside trap as the defence snoozes, sprints clear and flings out a leg to touch it past Randolph! 72 mins: Chance for Denmark! It\u2019s their best passing move of the game, which ends with Dolberg being played through. Doherty, who is having an excellent game, gets back to nick the ball away from him, at which he flings himself to the turf in search of a penalty, which he doesn\u2019t get. 68 mins: Ireland make their second change, bringing Robinson on for Hourihane. 67 mins: Half a chance for McGoldrick! He\u2019s picked out by Stevens\u2019 cross from the left, but his control isn\u2019t good enough. No matter, the ball bounces back to him off a defender, but he spoons his half-volley high! 65 mins: They can\u2019t make anything from it. Denmark are resolute, but really disarmingly short of ideas and quality. 65 mins: A better couple of minutes for the Danes ends with Ireland breaking forward and winning another corner. 61 mins: Clark wins the header again, but turns the ball well over the bar. 60 mins: McGoldrick does well to win Ireland another corner. Eriksen has barely touched the ball since half-time. 58 mins: Doherty\u2019s nice run and pass leftwards creates a fine crossing opportunity for McClean, which he emphatically fails to grasp. 56 mins: And now it\u2019s Gibraltar 0-3 Switzerland, Christian Fassnacht further extending the Swiss lead in the 57th minute. 55 mins: Whelan slides in to take the ball just ahead of Strygar Larsen, but follows through to take out the player as well and is booked. 54 mins: Switzerland now lead Gibraltar 2-0. 53 mins: Denmark try to let the air out of Ireland\u2019s freshly-inflated half-time balloon, passing the ball among themselves in their own half for a while. 51 mins: Ireland have started this half excellently. 49 mins: Ireland have already had more corners in this half than in the last one. From their first, Clark\u2019s header is deflected over the bar. From the second, played short, Hourihane\u2019s lovely ball in bounces across goal, just past two desperately-outflung Irish boots and away to safety! 47 mins: Poulsen takes out McClean on the left, and Ireland have a chance to whip a tasty ball into a crowded penalty area. But when the delivery comes, it\u2019s poor. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! Ireland are 45 minutes, one goal and a clean sheet away from Euro 2020. The players are back out and ready for half two. Ireland are making a change, bringing Ciaran Clark on for John Egan. \u201cIt\u2019s an engaging enough drama so far, but when do or die is substituted with do or do it again, it lacks a certain edge,\u201d writes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cThe Romans had it right: Kill the lion or be his lunch!\u201d It\u2019s certainly tempting to wonder how much better this match might be in a world without play-offs. 45+3 mins: The referee decides not to bother with the full three bonus minutes, and understandably. It is, for now, over. 45+2 mins: Hourihane\u2019s corner is headed back out to him. He passes back to Whelan, whose lovely dipping, curling cross is only just too high for Duffy at the back stick. Goal kick. 45+1 mins: There will be three bonus minutes at the end of the first half. Ireland celebrate this by winning their first corner. 45 mins: Ireland concede a free kick, from which Denmark concede a free kick. 43 mins: Another shot! This time it\u2019s from McGoldrick\u2019s right boot, but Ireland\u2019s shots are coming from further and further away from goal, and their aim becoming less and less true. 39 mins: Braithwaite pings a crossfield pass from left to right. Sadly there\u2019s no Dane within 15 yards of it when it lands. Ireland throw-in. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how possession stats are calculated when no one knows how to control a football,\u201d asks Philip Maddock. \u201cDoes time in the air count?\u201d 37 mins: Another shot! Whelan\u2019s long ball is nodded down by McGoldrick to Browne, whose 25-yard left-foot volley bounces wide! 34 mins: Chance! And the game\u2019s first shot on target! McGoldrick\u2019s pass is poor but the nearest defender falls over and misses the ball, allowing Hourihane to run onto it, burst into the area and shoot straight at Schmeichel from an unhelpful angle. 33 mins: Yellow card! Schone gets a booking for bringing down Browne. Meanwhile, Dolberg has replaced Cornelius. Denmark have just the one substitution left. 31 mins: Now Cornelius, having got over his head wound, pulls up, clutches a hamstring and immediately, being right by the tunnel at the time, leaves the pitch and vanishes from view. 28 mins: A bit of a delay, as Cornelius is treated for a head wound sustained in winning one of those headers. There has been blood. 26 mins: A shot! Eriksen hooks a volley goalwards after Schmeichel\u2019s long clearance had been headed on twice, but Duffy gets in the way. 25 mins: Denmark have now touched the ball in the Ireland penalty area. It was from a corner, and the ball pinged off a couple of heads before bouncing to Randolph. 23 mins: \u201cSchmeichel has been relatively untroubled so far,\u201d says Sky\u2019s commentator. Relatively? The lad\u2019s had more stressful hotel breakfast buffets. 22 mins: The game is not as dull as the total absence of goalscoring chances might suggest, the jeopardy giving it a little extra frisson. \u201cAs a longtime expat I used to have the level of nerves JR describes, bunking off work to watch do-or-die matches in the then smoky pubs,\u201d writes Patrick Carr. \u201cNow it\u2019s easier on the nerves. Maybe it\u2019s age, maybe it\u2019s the 415 ways we can qualify for the Euros. Either way my advice to JR is to relax, it\u2019s gonna be fine. If we lose tonight maybe the kids will get to play in the playoffs. I would very much like to see Maguire, Parrott and Connolly start together.\u201d 19 mins: No shots yet. Or chances. Or touches by any player in the opposition penalty area (unless I\u2019ve forgotten one). 16 mins: Mathias Jorgensen has had the ball for most of the last couple of minutes, assessing his options, slowly and deliberately passing it to a team-mate, getting it back again and repeating. 13 mins: Delaney\u2019s night is over. Hojbjerg has replaced him. 13 mins: Apparently while Delaney received treatment David McGoldrick changed his shorts, and put the new pair on the wrong way round. 12 mins: There has been a goal in the night\u2019s other game in this group, Cedric Itten putting Switzerland ahead against Gibraltar. As it stands the Swiss lead the group, ahead of Denmark with the Irish third. 10 mins: Delaney is on his feet, and is going to try to limp his injury off. 8 mins: Delaney goes down and stays down, after turning an ankle in challenging the opposition No8, Browne. Ireland leave him writhing and attack regardless, but Schmeichel claims the ball and boots it straight out of play. 6 mins: Denmark are pressing high when Randolph gets the ball, which does mean that a long punt forward leaves them dangerously undermanned, 3 v 3 at the back. Ireland try just such a ball, but it\u2019s overhit and Schmeichel collects. 6 mins: Denmark have a spell of possession, but don\u2019t get close to the Irish goal. 3 mins: Ireland have managed to keep the ball in Denmark\u2019s half for pretty much the entire game so far, despite barely having the ball, by getting right in the face of any Dane unfortunate enough to find himself in possession. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Denmark get the game started! \u201cIf I were in charge of the spread in the Ireland dressing room I would have laid out a platter of Danish pastries,\u201d suggests Peter Oh. \u201cNothing gees up your team like symbolically devouring your opposition.\u201d Perhaps, though you\u2019d be well advised not to adopt the tactic before a game against Greece. Exactly 10 years ago tonight, this happened. Will there be more qualifying heartbreak for Ireland tonight? We\u2019re just a couple of anthems and an entire game of football away from finding out! The players are in the tunnel! Ireland are 90 minutes from qualification. Can they grasp the hand of destiny? \u201cSo old Mick McCarthy has \u2018butterflies with boots on\u2019?\u201d writes JR. \u201cWell I\u2019m having kittens over here. And in the off moment when I\u2019m not having kittens I\u2019m bricking it. OK, break time\u2019s over. I\u2019ve got just under a half hour left to finish making room behind the couch.\u201d Christian Eriksen says \u201che\u2019d rather play somebody else\u201d than Ireland yet again: We\u2019ve been in Ireland a lot. Of course we\u2019d rather play somebody else, but in the end it\u2019s whoever we get drawn against. Here are Mick McCarthy\u2019s thoughts on this game: This is the most important game a few of the lads might have played for Ireland and you need to take the chance when it comes around. There have been a few shouts of \u2018go and make a name for yourself\u2019 and there are players in our squad who can do that. Much more here: Ireland have gone for a clever split-table formation, opening up the midfield: A glimpse inside Denmark\u2019s changing room reveals fruit bowls, sports drinks and, er, blue toilet roll? The team news again, now with added handy Twitter graphics: Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Doherty, Duffy, Egan, Stevens, Browne, Hendrick, Whelan, Hourihane, McClean, McGoldrick. Subs: Kevin Long, Clark, Parrott, Cullen, Byrne, Brady, Robinson, James Collins, O\u2019Hara, Maguire, Travers, Judge. Denmark: Schmeichel, Dalsgaard, Jorgensen, Kjaer, Larsen, Schone, Braithwaite, Eriksen, Delaney, Poulsen, Cornelius. Subs: Andersen, Ronnow, Hansen, Dolberg, Hojbjerg, Norgaard, Ankersen, Knudsen, Gytkjaer, Christensen, Skov, Wass. Referee: Felix Brych (Germany). Fourth official: Marco Fritz (Germany). Assistant referees: Mark Borsch (Germany), Stefan Lupp (Germany) Uefa Delegate: Roland Tis (Belgium). The teams are in, and here are the starting XIs: Republic of Ireland: Randolph, Doherty, Stevens, Duffy, Egan, Whelan, Browne, McGoldrick, McClean, Hendrick, Hourihane. Denmark: Schmeichel, Dalsgaard, Zanka, Kj\u00e6r, Stryger, Sch\u00f6ne, Delaney, Eriksen, Poulsen, Cornelius, Braithwaite. Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s reaction: David McGoldrick returned to the Republic of Ireland starting line-up for Monday night\u2019s Euro 2020 decider against Denmark. The Sheffield United striker, who missed last month\u2019s double-header in Georgia and Switzerland through injury, was included in one of three changes to the side which lost 2-0 in Geneva as he, Matt Doherty and Conor Hourihane replaced Aaron Connolly, the suspended Seamus Coleman and James Collins. M\u2019learned friend Barry Glendenning, in his preview of this game, described the recent spate of Ireland-Denmark encounters as \u201ca never-ending series of mind-numbingly tedious football matches\u201d. So that\u2019s encouraging, yes? This will be the teams\u2019 sixth meeting in the last two years plus a week, with the previous five ending, in order of excitement, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 1-1 and 1-5, with one rogue Christian Eriksen-inspired Denmark thumping in Dublin interrupting an otherwise humdrum sequence. There is one decent cause for optimism: the Republic of Ireland must win. If they do, they qualify automatically for Euro 2020. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll have to play off. Unless they\u2019re already winning, there will come a point where they have nothing to lose, and will boldly throw caution to the wind. Less encouragingly Denmark know a draw will see them safely through, either in first place (if Switzerland somehow fail to beat Gibraltar) or second (if they do), so have every reason to hold out for another goalless draw. Anyway, a game of football to be played. It will probably be more fun than at least one and possibly all five of the Republic of Ireland-Denmark clashes in recent memory. So let\u2019s gather round football\u2019s glowing brazier and let the flickering flames of international qualifying football warm our hands and our spirits. Or something. Here\u2019s that preview in full: Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT",

      "bodyText": "Washington\u2019s announcement that it no longer considers Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank illegal has elicited a wave of euphoria from Israeli rightwing figures and indignation from Palestinians. Senior Israeli officials and settler groups said the shift in US policy meant the time was ripe for Israel to take permanent control of the settlements \u2013 a move that is largely seen as an end to Palestinian aspirations of statehood. The former Israeli justice minister and pro-settlement hardliner Ayelet Shaked thanked Donald Trump and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in a tweet. \u201cThe Jewish People have the legal and moral right to live in their ancient homeland,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow is the time to apply our sovereignty to these communities,\u201d she added. The Yesha Council, the main Israeli settler organisation, also called on the Israeli government to immediately claim sovereignty over settlements. In September, days before he was due to run in a national election, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he intended to annex Jewish settlements, but gave only a vague timeframe. His political future may also be in jeopardy after an inconclusive election threw Israeli into political paralysis.

The US policy shift comes just a week since the European court of justice ruled products made in Israeli settlements must be properly labelled, a move that was widely decried in Israel. Israel\u2019s transportation minister, Betzalel Smotrich, head of a pro-settler party, said before the US announcement, which was expected, that it would be \u201can appropriate response to the hypocritical decision by the European court\u201d. Since he entered office, Trump has repeatedly made moves welcomed by Israeli hardline nationalists that have been interpreted as detrimental to Palestinians and their hopes for a future state.

As the confrontation continued, Rudolph lunged at Garrett. Garrett reared back and, using Rudolph\u2019s helmet, struck Rudolph\u2019s unprotected head. Garrett <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/15/myles-garrett-suspension-browns-steelers-fight\">was suspended indefinitely by the NFL for his actions</a>, and he will have his appeal heard on Wednesday.</p> <p>As the Browns returned to practice on Monday without their best defensive player, Richardson said Rudolph should have been disciplined for grabbing Garrett\u2019s face mask and scratching him.</p> <p>\u201cOf course he was,\u201d Richardson said when he was asked if Garrett had been defending himself. \u201cIf a guy is scratching at your face, what you going to do? The helmet is overboard, let\u2019s get that clear. But defending yourself, I don\u2019t blame him for defending [himself] at all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/15/damarious-randall-myles-garrett-browns-steelers\">The NFL cares more about optics than actions in its fight against dirty play</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garrett was not the only player suspended for his actions during the game. Cleveland\u2019s Larry Ogunjobi was banned one game for shoving Rudolph, while Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey was suspended for three games for kicking and punching Garrett. Richardson believes Rudolph, who is likely to be fined, should also be suspended. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to suspend Myles indefinitely, I don\u2019t know, a game or two. A game?\u201d he said. \u201cMake it sound like you just can\u2019t be a quarterback and do as you please in this league. Have some type of consequences for your actions as well. I don\u2019t blame Pouncey for protecting his quarterback. I\u2019d go overboard for my guys, too. So nobody\u2019s knocking him for that. That\u2019s what football is.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett\u2019s coach, Freddie Kitchens refused to address whether he felt Rudolph deserved to be disciplined. \u201cEverybody here saw the tape,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI am just here to support. I will support Myles. Our team will support Myles. I am not going to get into that. You saw the tape.\u201d</p> <p>Kitchens was pressed about seemingly sending mixed messages: condemning Garrett\u2019s behavior, but also blaming Rudolph. \u201cI never said anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not insinuate anything. I was asked for a comment, and I was not making a comment on it. I just asked if you saw the tape, so form your own conclusion. I have my conclusion that I did not say. There is no excuse for that to happen on a football field. I know that, Myles knows that, and all of the players in the locker room know that.\u201d</p> <p>Kitchens met with Garrett on Saturday, and plans to continue doing so. Garrett, the top overall pick in the 2017 draft, is not allowed to be at the team\u2019s facility during his suspension. \u201cMyles Garrett\u2019s a good person,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pile on Myles. He had a bad lapse in judgment and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m still a Myles fan and I\u2019m going to support him. ... Myles is part of our family.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cleveland Browns defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson believes Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph deserves to be punished for his role in a brawl that overshadowed last week\u2019s game between the two teams. In Thursday\u2019s win over the Steelers, Cleveland\u2019s Myles Garrett ripped Rudolph\u2019s helmet from the quarterback\u2019s head. As the confrontation continued, Rudolph lunged at Garrett. Garrett reared back and, using Rudolph\u2019s helmet, struck Rudolph\u2019s unprotected head. Garrett was suspended indefinitely by the NFL for his actions, and he will have his appeal heard on Wednesday. As the Browns returned to practice on Monday without their best defensive player, Richardson said Rudolph should have been disciplined for grabbing Garrett\u2019s face mask and scratching him. \u201cOf course he was,\u201d Richardson said when he was asked if Garrett had been defending himself. \u201cIf a guy is scratching at your face, what you going to do? The helmet is overboard, let\u2019s get that clear. But defending yourself, I don\u2019t blame him for defending [himself] at all.\u201d Garrett was not the only player suspended for his actions during the game. Cleveland\u2019s Larry Ogunjobi was banned one game for shoving Rudolph, while Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey was suspended for three games for kicking and punching Garrett. Richardson believes Rudolph, who is likely to be fined, should also be suspended. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to suspend Myles indefinitely, I don\u2019t know, a game or two. A game?\u201d he said. \u201cMake it sound like you just can\u2019t be a quarterback and do as you please in this league. Have some type of consequences for your actions as well. I don\u2019t blame Pouncey for protecting his quarterback. I\u2019d go overboard for my guys, too. So nobody\u2019s knocking him for that. That\u2019s what football is.\u201d Garrett\u2019s coach, Freddie Kitchens refused to address whether he felt Rudolph deserved to be disciplined. \u201cEverybody here saw the tape,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cI am just here to support. I will support Myles. Our team will support Myles. I am not going to get into that. You saw the tape.\u201d Kitchens was pressed about seemingly sending mixed messages: condemning Garrett\u2019s behavior, but also blaming Rudolph. \u201cI never said anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not insinuate anything. I was asked for a comment, and I was not making a comment on it. I just asked if you saw the tape, so form your own conclusion. I have my conclusion that I did not say. There is no excuse for that to happen on a football field. I know that, Myles knows that, and all of the players in the locker room know that.\u201d Kitchens met with Garrett on Saturday, and plans to continue doing so. Garrett, the top overall pick in the 2017 draft, is not allowed to be at the team\u2019s facility during his suspension. \u201cMyles Garrett\u2019s a good person,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pile on Myles. He had a bad lapse in judgment and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m still a Myles fan and I\u2019m going to support him. ... Myles is part of our family.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Max makes it look easy</h2> <p>What a difference a year makes. Max Verstappen, after his travails at this race last year, where he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/11/lewis-hamilton-brazilian-grand-prix-max-verstappen\" title=\"\">hit by Esteban Ocon while leading</a>, could not have delivered a more impressive performance. Since his crash in practice at Monaco last year he has returned a more complete driver. Red Bull\u2019s team principal, Christian Horner, has praised how far he has come and believes he has the ability to beat Lewis Hamilton in a straight fight. On this evidence it would be an unmissable battle. Weaknesses remain \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/max-verstappen-mexican-grand-prix-qualifying\" title=\"\">qualifying at Mexico was a glaring error</a> but in Brazil he was calm, controlled and flawless \u2013 dominant in qualifying and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/17/max-verstappen-brazilian-grand-prix-late-crashes\" title=\"\">untouchable in the race</a>. Not only did he retake the lead twice but exhibited some exquisite skill. His pass on Charles Leclerc to chase Hamilton was a decisive thrust he had to execute quickly and perfectly. Equally, the final restart was a piece of old-school racecraft that even Hamilton acknowledged was outstanding. Praise indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/18/ferrari-summon-vettel-and-leclerc-to-headquarters-after-brazil-collision\">Ferrari launch investigation into Vettel and Leclerc's collision at Brazil GP</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Ferrari flounder again</h2> <p>Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/18/ferrari-summon-vettel-and-leclerc-to-headquarters-after-brazil-collision\" title=\"\">have been summoned to see the beak at Maranello</a> to explain themselves after the biff that cost them both. With Ferrari secure in second place in the constructors\u2019 championship, the points they lost are irrelevant \u2013 although Leclerc, on the verge of beating his teammate at the first attempt, will doubtless be seething. However, such a public and potentially divisive incident is not what they need going into the close season. The team principal, Mattia Binotto, kept a cool head, stressing they should apologise to the team, but how he deals with this looking towards 2020 is vital. The stewards found neither driver to be wholly at fault but it seems almost impossible not to imagine that Ferrari\u2019s examination will find Leclerc blameless. The only light at the end of the tunnel for the Scuderia is that the incident has momentarily overshadowed the continuing speculation over the legality of their power unit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b740ae7dbb61242c35eb2601414a7f4727d871d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b740ae7dbb61242c35eb2601414a7f4727d871d/516_247_3130_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel have been summoned to explain the collision that ended the hopes of both Ferraris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel have been summoned to explain the collision that ended the hopes of both Ferraris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mercedes hold up their hands</h2> <p>Hamilton and his team knew going into the race they were likely to struggle in Brazil. The architecture of their power unit, particularly the turbo, has been optimised to work on the majority of tracks \u2013 specifically the ones that do not take place at altitude. As a result they expected to be under the cosh in both Mexico and Brazil. At the former they pulled out an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/27/lewis-hamilton-wins-mexico-grand-prix-wait-for-title\" title=\"\">unlikely, brilliant win for Hamilton</a>, but despite trying everything could not repeat it in Brazil. The exceptionally rare sight of one of the Silver Arrows parking up trackside with a smoking power unit must have quite thrown them. Certainly the decision to pit Hamilton under the final safety car was an even rarer incidence of indecision and error. The technical director, James Allison, admitted they should not have given Hamilton the option of deciding, since the driver did not have all the information, and that, when he did come in, it was the wrong call. They had miscalculated the places he would lose and how long the safety car might remain out. Allison described it as \u201cjust plain dumb\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Happy days at Honda</h2> <p>Verstappen\u2019s victory could perhaps not have come on a more auspicious occasion for Honda, a one-two on the anniversary of the birth of their founder, Soichiro Honda. The engine supplier\u2019s one-two with Pierre Gasly\u2019s superb second was what the team have been building towards since returning in 2015, although that it was a Toro Rosso \u2013 Red Bull\u2019s junior team \u2013 that finished the job had probably not been anticipated. Their previous one-two was Gerhard Berger and Ayrton Senna at the Japanese Grand Prix in 1991 \u2013 when Senna secured his final title.

      "bodyText": "Max makes it look easy What a difference a year makes. Max Verstappen, after his travails at this race last year, where he was hit by Esteban Ocon while leading, could not have delivered a more impressive performance. Since his crash in practice at Monaco last year he has returned a more complete driver. Red Bull\u2019s team principal, Christian Horner, has praised how far he has come and believes he has the ability to beat Lewis Hamilton in a straight fight. On this evidence it would be an unmissable battle. Weaknesses remain \u2013 qualifying at Mexico was a glaring error but in Brazil he was calm, controlled and flawless \u2013 dominant in qualifying and untouchable in the race. Not only did he retake the lead twice but exhibited some exquisite skill. His pass on Charles Leclerc to chase Hamilton was a decisive thrust he had to execute quickly and perfectly. Equally, the final restart was a piece of old-school racecraft that even Hamilton acknowledged was outstanding. Praise indeed. Ferrari flounder again Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have been summoned to see the beak at Maranello to explain themselves after the biff that cost them both. With Ferrari secure in second place in the constructors\u2019 championship, the points they lost are irrelevant \u2013 although Leclerc, on the verge of beating his teammate at the first attempt, will doubtless be seething. However, such a public and potentially divisive incident is not what they need going into the close season. The team principal, Mattia Binotto, kept a cool head, stressing they should apologise to the team, but how he deals with this looking towards 2020 is vital. The stewards found neither driver to be wholly at fault but it seems almost impossible not to imagine that Ferrari\u2019s examination will find Leclerc blameless. The only light at the end of the tunnel for the Scuderia is that the incident has momentarily overshadowed the continuing speculation over the legality of their power unit. Mercedes hold up their hands Hamilton and his team knew going into the race they were likely to struggle in Brazil. The architecture of their power unit, particularly the turbo, has been optimised to work on the majority of tracks \u2013 specifically the ones that do not take place at altitude. As a result they expected to be under the cosh in both Mexico and Brazil. At the former they pulled out an unlikely, brilliant win for Hamilton, but despite trying everything could not repeat it in Brazil. The exceptionally rare sight of one of the Silver Arrows parking up trackside with a smoking power unit must have quite thrown them. Certainly the decision to pit Hamilton under the final safety car was an even rarer incidence of indecision and error. The technical director, James Allison, admitted they should not have given Hamilton the option of deciding, since the driver did not have all the information, and that, when he did come in, it was the wrong call. They had miscalculated the places he would lose and how long the safety car might remain out. Allison described it as \u201cjust plain dumb\u201d. Happy days at Honda Verstappen\u2019s victory could perhaps not have come on a more auspicious occasion for Honda, a one-two on the anniversary of the birth of their founder, Soichiro Honda. The engine supplier\u2019s one-two with Pierre Gasly\u2019s superb second was what the team have been building towards since returning in 2015, although that it was a Toro Rosso \u2013 Red Bull\u2019s junior team \u2013 that finished the job had probably not been anticipated. Their previous one-two was Gerhard Berger and Ayrton Senna at the Japanese Grand Prix in 1991 \u2013 when Senna secured his final title. As Gasly proved in his drag race with Hamilton through the final corners, their turbo was well-suited to the rarefied air at Interlagos but nonetheless it is clear they have made real steps forward this season. Further advances could make them a real player next year. Honda\u2019s technical director, Toyoharu Tanabe, even had the good grace to acknowledge former colleagues with whom their relationship had ended so sourly: \u201cCongratulations to McLaren, with whom we scored that last win in 1991, for finishing on the podium.\u201d Woking\u2019s finest finish the job Carlos Sainz did not receive his plaudits on the podium for the third place he secured after Hamilton was penalised but at least he and the team were able to climb the steps and celebrate after the decision had been made.

The Duke of York admitted ties to Maxwell and Epstein during the bombshell BBC Newsnight interview \u2013 while adamantly denying wrongdoing and expressing regret for continued association with Epstein. Andrew said he met Epstein through Maxwell, the daughter of late media baron Robert Maxwell. Maxwell has vehemently denied allegations of wrongdoing but her current whereabouts are unknown, with media reports placing sightings of her in various cities in the US and Europe. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August, following his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges. At the center of this controversy is Epstein\u2019s accuser Virginia Giuffre, who claims Maxwell recruited her to work as his masseuse when she was 15 years old. Giuffre has alleged that a sexual encounter took place with Andrew around 2001, when she was 17. Giuffre claims Epstein flew her to London on his private jet.

Given that she was speaking only hours before Boris Johnson announced that he was abandoning a proposed further cut in corporation tax, her comment could be seen as an implicit criticism of the policy her leader was about to announce. She told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve reduced corporation tax from 28% to 19%, making it the lowest in the G20, is we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of tax taken by the exchequer.</p> </blockquote> <p>This afternoon the <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong>, the tax and spending thinktank, has published <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/article/cancelling-further-cut-to-corporation-tax-rate-leaves-revenue-the-same-as-before-the-2008-crisis\">a short briefing note</a> on the Johnson announcement. It says that, while Leadsom may be correct in saying overall revenue has gone up while the rate has gone down, she would have been wrong if she was implying a causal relationship. The IFS says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Corporation tax revenue has increased since 2010 even while the headline rate has been cut. But that does not mean that rate reductions have increased revenue.</p> <p>First ... much of the rise in revenue since 2010 is simply recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and recession. We would have expected a recovery in profits even if the corporation tax rate had not been cut.</p> <p>Second, while the government has reduced the headline rate of corporation tax, at the same time it has increased corporation tax in other ways, including reducing capital allowances for investment, introducing the bank surcharge, restricting companies\u2019 ability to offset past losses against future profits, and a raft of anti-avoidance measures ... Taken together these measures recoup around \u00a310bn of the \u00a313bn spent reducing the headline rate.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IFS also says the Johnson decision to abandon the proposed cut in corporation tax will free up \u00a36bn for the government to spend on other things.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T16:20:48.997Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2bc2c8f08eeb483f19ba6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:44:11.748Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These are from the Press Association\u2019s <strong>Ian Jones.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196358967280226304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How the polls have moved over the past six weeks. <br><br>A 10-point Tory lead has become a 13-point Tory lead. <a href=\"https://t.co/KuTWEb55LU\">pic.twitter.com/KuTWEb55LU</a></p>&mdash; Ian Jones (@ian_a_jones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196358967280226304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196393957787361281\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Tories&#39; average poll rating is now the highest it has been this year. <a href=\"https://t.co/37LNpovTAQ\">pic.twitter.com/37LNpovTAQ</a></p>&mdash; Ian Jones (@ian_a_jones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196393957787361281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2bbcf8f08aab51e1c1410\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:42:55.855Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-set-to-commit-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\">net zero carbon emissions by 2030</a> after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment, my colleagues <strong>Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart </strong>and<strong> Matthew Taylor</strong> report.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/labour-persuaded-to-soften-pledge-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\">Labour persuaded to soften pledge of net zero emissions by 2030</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2b5f28f08eeb483f19b7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:20:20.063Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an interview with BBC News <strong>Jo Swinson</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, has just ridiculed the idea that Brexit would be \u201cdone\u201d under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to pass his withdrawal agreement.

We see it on both sides of the political divide.</p> <p>On the right, we have the threat of \u2013 even preference for \u2013 no deal as the end point of our Brexit negotiations ...</p> <p>For some on the right \u2013 this preference for no deal is driven by a zeal for something beyond this and that is the wholesale deregulation of the UK economy.</p> <p>But I want to be clear that this is not what British firms, large or small, want. They are intent on improving the quality of good jobs and not diminishing them.</p> <p>They accept Brexit and will do all they can to make it work. But when no deal becomes an ideology of its own, seemingly intent on ignoring the impact on jobs and livelihoods, then we have a problem.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ideology from the left is at least as damaging. The Labour party is proposing the biggest programme of renationalisation this country has ever seen at great cost with uncertain returns to the taxpayer and with no clear route to better customer service.</p> <p>Its most recent proposed nationalisation of part of BT was a bolt from the blue and has sent a chill through boardrooms at home and abroad. With many firms questioning whether their investment is safe. And some thinking: are we next?</p> <p>These ideologies from both sides are causing great harm to our economy.

These are from members of the CBI audience, not journalists.</p> <p><em>Q: What is your attitude towards the sharing economy?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says he approves of sharing, not wasting.</p> <p><em>Q: What are you going to do to disprove claims that Labour is \u201cfor the many, not the Jew\u201d, and to show that you care about antisemitism and racism?</em><br></p> <p>Corbyn says racism is a scourge and an evil for all of us. Whether it is antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other form of racism, it is evil. He says it has no place in a civilised society. Labour will continue to fund protection for synagogues and other places of worship, and it will continue to fund anti-racist education in schools.</p> <p>He says Labour will audit the way the public sector recruits to promote diversity.</p> <p>He says he was brought up to hate racism. He has opposed it all his life. He says he will carry that attitude into Downing Street.</p> <p><em>Q: You have not mentioned industrial strategy. Are you going to follow the current government\u2019s strategy?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says Labour will increase corporation tax, but not beyond 2010 levels.</p> <p>Poverty is a terrible waste, he says. Children growing up in poverty can find it hard to learn if they do not have space to do their homework. </p> <p><em>Q: How will a four-day week help productivity?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says this will be funded and paid for by productivity increases. He says over many years working times have come down as a result of productivity increases.</p> <p>He ends by saying he thinks everyone would support a fairer and more egalitarian society.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

In many rural areas it hardly exists. So getting businesses to move there is unrealistic.</p> <p>He says the government did not allocate enough money for this. And private firms were taking too long. This has led to some groups having to organise their own provision.</p> <p>Corbyn says Labour\u2019s proposals is a fair and good one. You accept the case for universal provision of energy services, and mail services. These days universal provision of broadband is essential.</p> <p><em>Q: Can you name a FTSE 100 company you admire?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says most companies have social impact funds. And most of them give to social enterprises. His concern is about the behaviour of some oil and mineral companies.</p> <p>He says he is not anti these companies. But where social or environmental damage has been causes, firms have an obligation to behave differently.</p> <p><em>Q: Would you nationalise bus services outside London?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says bus services outside London were deregulated. He says mayors like Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester want to be able to run regulated bus services. Some can do this, and some can\u2019t. Labour would extend these powers, so they can run these services. And it would legislate for integrated transport systems. </p> <p><em>Q: Isn\u2019t it clear that your Brexit policy won\u2019t sort out Brexit quickly?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says his party represents people who voted leave and remain. There has been a huge demand for a second referendum. Labour\u2019s approach is sensible and credible, he says.</p> <p>He says he wants to bring uncertainty to an end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dff9e582f39ac1740d5b84ef7fd0e95b47ce7140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dff9e582f39ac1740d5b84ef7fd0e95b47ce7140/0_65_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the CBI annual conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the CBI annual conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T12:11:11.194Z\">at 12.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd284458f08aab51e1c1181\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T11:45:36.341Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn tells his audience that there are many things they agree on.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a Labour government will do is raise the platform on which our whole society stands so that businesses and individuals can build themselves up even higher and reach their dreams.</p> <p>You know despite people\u2019s differences, there are things we can all agree on.

By comparison, the decision to abandon the proposed corporation tax cut does seem to amount to a big ticket spending announcement. Boris Johnson said it would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. It may be one of the biggest Tory election announcements we\u2019ve had so far.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Johnson announced this, or even why he opted for the \u00a36bn figure. This is the exact figure announced by Labour last week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/labour-nhs-rescue-package-to-be-paid-for-by-higher-taxpayers-says-mcdonnell\">it announced its own spending increase for the NHS. </a>Here is an extract from the notes from the Labour press notice issued at the time. (Bold type in original.)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Labour\u2019s funding plan would deliver:</strong> A real terms increase of \u00a326bn (\u00a340bn in cash terms) from 2018-19 to 2023-24 \u2013 the period over which the Conservatives promised \u00a320bn more.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Johnson has neutralised the Labour bid to outspend the Tories on the NHS.</p> <p>(At least, he has if his figures are accurate - at the moment we have had no detail of what is is proposing.)</p> <p>In one sense this is a win for Labour; it shows that Jeremy Corbyn has been setting the agenda, and he just justifiably argue that this means the opposition is changing the policy of the governing parties.</p> <p>But in campaign terms, this is a setback for Corbyn. At least one element of his distinctive pitch on the NHS has now been eliminated - even though there are still plenty of other differences been Labour and Tory health policy. (Spending totals aren\u2019t everything.)</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Looking at the Treasury red book from 2016, when this corporation tax cut was announced, it looks as if the \u00a36bn figure that Johnson announced is a cumulative, five-year figure, not an annual figure, which would mean he was a long way off matching what Labour has promised.

      "bodyText": "We have now closed today\u2019s live blog. Thanks for all your comments and for reading. Here are our latest political stories and my colleague Andrew Sparrow\u2019s roundup from earlier. At a Hope Not Hate summit in London this evening the former prime minister Gordon Brown will say the UK\u2019s \u201cbitter divisions are now not just over Brexit, but between north and south, rich and poor and between the four nations\u201d. And he is to warn it could take a generation to \u201cdrain the poison that is increasingly infecting\u201d national life, with the rebuilding of national unity to require \u201ctackling head-on divisive nationalisms and racism - not least with new laws to root out anti-Semitism and Islamophobia\u201d. He will also caution that \u201cnationalists on both sides are more interested in exploiting divisions rather than ending them\u201d. It will take far more than an election - perhaps a generation - to end our country\u2019s now-widening divisions and to drain the poison that is increasingly infecting our national life. A huge majority of people in Britain - 77% - now think that Brexit is fuelling prejudice and is making our country more divided than ever. With more parliamentary candidates than ever sacked because of racism, sexism or homophobia, more and more social media activists exploiting the internet to troll and abuse, and with fake news debasing our public discourse, and with - it is sad to say - so many women giving up as MPs in the face of threats of violence, our country\u2019s bitter divisions are now not just over Brexit but between north and south, rich and poor and between the four nations that, until recently, formed a cohesive United Kingdom. With the SNP now threatening the hardest of \u2018hard\u2019 separations and the Conservatives whipping up English nationalism with their claim Scotland will run England if there was a Labour government, nationalists on both sides are more interested in exploiting divisions rather than ending them. His comments came as a Hope Not Hate poll found only 7% of the black and minority ethnic community believe racism is not on the rise. Endorsing the Labour party, Brown said all the UK \u201cwill have to work far harder to heal the wounds of recent years\u201d, and politicians need to \u201creach out to and enter into a dialogue\u201d with the public. \u201cIt will need measures to end the economic insecurity that is the breeding ground for populist nationalism.\u201d Here is an edited extract of his speech published earlier: ITV should not be allowed to give Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to \u201csidestep\u201d debating Brexit, the Liberal Democrats have said after the High Court ruled the debate between the two party leaders tomorrow evening will go ahead as planned. In a statement following the decision, Lib Dem president Sal Brinton said: The Liberal Democrats\u2019 position in this election and that of our leader is unique - Jo Swinson is the only leader of a national party fighting to stop Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn should not be allowed to sidestep debating the issue of Brexit with someone who wants to remain, and ITV should not give them the opportunity to do so. That is why this is an incredibly disappointing verdict. Not just for the Liberal Democrats but also for democracy in this country, and for every remainer who deserves to have a voice in this debate. This law needs to change. ITV needs to change. Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats brought this court case because our politics needs to change too. Televised debates between political party leaders should be framed in stronger legislation. But more than that, our democracy should not be in the hands of invisible corporate structures, and arrangements for such debates should always be accessible and transparent. Earlier, (see 5.10pm) the SNP said excluding Nicole Sturgeon from the debate meant Scots were being treated as second-class citizens. ITV said in a statement: \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision and will continue with our comprehensive election coverage as planned.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has paid tribute to a Labour campaigner with terminal breast cancer who died days after describing being left in hospital without treatment for hours. Jayne Rae, 53, from Whittle-le-Woods in Lancashire, died on Monday morning after a year with the disease. In a video shared by the Labour leader on Sunday she painted a grim picture of the difficulties patients faced in accessing treatment. \u201cI have never seen people lying in corridors covered in blood, dying, doctors under stress, nurses unable to help to the point of they were crying in frustration,\u201d she said, adding that her mother was \u201cbegging\u201d staff for help as she spent several hours waiting for treatment in \u201cextreme pain\u201d. Corbyn tweeted following news of her death: \u201cIncredibly sad to hear that Jayne died this morning. Jayne\u2019s life ended as she lived it: making the world a better place for others. Jayne sent me this video which shows her passion for defending our NHS and making sure it\u2019s there for everyone whenever they need it.\u201d An ITV election debate featuring just Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is due to go ahead tomorrow night after a legal challenge from the Lib Dems and the SNP failed. The two smaller parties both objected to their leaders not being included, but the high court concluded that this was not a matter over which it could exercise judicial review and that, even if it could, ITV was not ignoring its impartiality obligations. The SNP says this means Scottish voters are being treated like second-class citizens. Even though leaders\u2019 debates have been a feature of ever UK election since 2010, tomorrow\u2019s will be the first to feature just the PM and the leader of the opposition and smaller parties argue that this means voters are being given the impression that the election is a binary choice between two parties. There is some evidence to suggest that, in England at least, voters are already coming to this conclusion, before the first debate has already aired. Opinion polls may not be accurate predictors of final election outcomes, but they are seen as being reliable guides to shifts in opinion during campaigns, and so far the GB-wide polls have been showing support for the two main parties rising since the campaign started, and the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party seeing their vote squeezed (particularly the Brexit party, whose vote may even be collapsing.) Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson all gave speeches at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, which led to the event becoming something of an electoral beauty parade for the benefit of corporate Britain. And corporate Britain was not over-impressed. In a speech Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said extremists on the right and the left in politics were causing \u201cgreat harm to the economy\u201d. My colleague Phillip Inman, economics editor of the Observer, says it was Swinson who got the best reception. After her speech Paul Drechsler, a former CBI president, posted this on Twitter. Boris Johnson has told business leaders he will shelve a planned cut in corporation tax, claiming he would put \u00a36bn into public services instead. In his speech he did not commit to ringfencing the money for the NHS, but he strongly implied that this was where much of it was going. He told his audience: We understand that it is ... you who are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS. And, by the way, because the NHS is the nation\u2019s priority, and because we believe emphatically in fiscal prudence, I hope you will understand if I also announce today that we are postponing further cuts in corporation tax. And before you storm the stage and protest, let me remind you that this saves \u00a36bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS. As explained earlier, this surprise move neutralises the Labour announcement last week to beef up spending on the NHS - also to tune of \u00a36bn a year. In a Guardian fact check, my colleague Richard Partington explains that Johnson\u2019s announcement also undercuts frequent Tory claims that cutting the headline rate of corporation tax is the best way to increase total revenue from it. Swinson has confirmed that the Lib Dems would abolish business rates, and replace them with a commercial landowner levy. This policy would \u201cshift the burden from the tenant to the landlord so that we can breathe new life into our high streets\u201d, she told the CBI. Corbyn has told the CBI that Labour\u2019s nationalisation programme does not represent a return to the failed policies of the past. He told the conference: We will bring some key services into public ownership. I make no apology for that. It\u2019s not an attack on the foundations of a modern economy; it\u2019s the very opposite. It\u2019s the norm in many European countries. It\u2019s taking the essential steps to build a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. Even the city editor of the Financial Times called the privatisation of water an \u201corganised rip off.\u201d So I understand you are cautious about some of our plans but your businesses, your workers and your consumers have been failed by rip-off energy bills and poor rail and bus services. And I think many of you know that because you know things can\u2019t go on as they are. Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman at the centre of conflict of interest allegations against Boris Johnson, has said she warned the prime minister last week that she would speak out against him after he repeatedly refused to take her calls. Extinction Rebellion activists have begun hunger strikes outside a number of UK political party headquarters to push for more robust policies on tackling the climate emergency in the general election. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. ITV\u2019s Rachel Younger has more on the reason for the high court\u2019s decision not to allow the Lib Dem/SNP legal challenge to tomorrow\u2019s two-party election leaders\u2019 debate. From my colleague Jim Waterson The SNP has said the high court decision allowing ITV to go ahead with an election leaders\u2019 debate excluding Nicola Sturgeon means that Scottish voters are being treated as \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d. This is from Ian Blackford, the party\u2019s leader at Westminster. This election is a chance for people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose their own future with independence \u2013 yet they will not hear that argument in the debate tomorrow night. Instead, they will only hear from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking Scotland out of the EU against its will \u2013 who want to lock Scotland into the union. That means the views of around 50% of Scottish voters who favour independence and around 70% who favour remain will be completely ignored. Nicola Sturgeon was ready, willing and able, to take on Johnson and Corbyn in tomorrow night\u2019s debate \u2013 now it is incumbent on them to commit to the all party debate on 1st December or tell everyone what they are so scared of. It was already clear that the Westminster political system is utterly broken and incapable of properly representing Scotland\u2019s interests. What is now clear is that the UK broadcasting system is similarly incapable. Indeed the result of the decision to exclude the SNP is to discriminate against Scottish voters and to effectively treat them as second-class citizens. The SNP says decisions about who gets invited to election debates should be taken by an independent body, not by politicians or broadcasters. A Labour government would launch an investigation into British colonialism and its legacy today, the party\u2019s election manifesto is expected to declare, according to this HuffPost UK story by Paul Waugh. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary who is trying to defend his South West Hertfordshire seat as an independent, having been thrown out of the parliamentary party for rebelling over Brexit, has been campaigning today with Amber Rudd, another former Tory cabinet minister who resigned the whip over Brexit. Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader in Scotland, has claimed the Lib Dems are \u201cstronger\u201d as a party after their time in coalition with the Tories. But he admitted he has \u201cregrets\u201d about some of the policies that were introduced. He told BBC Radio Scotland. In terms of the welfare stuff, there was some stuff as part of the coalition we had to vote through. There are a lot of things we managed to achieve in return. There are some regrets I have, of course I have that, I think the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 should never have happened and said so at the time .... Yes, I regret some of the things but I can tell you we\u2019re a stronger party as a result because we understand much more about the hard choices you have to make in government and it has been really instructive for us in terms of our current campaign to stop Brexit. We are resolute in trying to stop doing the damage the Conservatives can do to our country. They are hell bent on this dangerous Brexit. Speaking at a Unite conference in Brigton, the union\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, described Boris Johnson as \u201cEton\u2019s answer to Del Boy\u201d. He said: Ultimately this election is about trust. Who do we trust to charter our communities out of the troubled waters, to a better future? Is it Boris Johnson, a man whose privileged upbringing has given him such an arrogant sense of entitlement to rule, and would appear to be prepared to stop at nothing to keep the keys to Number 10. Eton\u2019s answer to Del Boy. Or is it Jeremy Corbyn, the only leader able and determined to speak for our whole nation, on Brexit as on other issues. And here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story on the high court decision. The Press Association has just snapped this. The Liberal Democrats and SNP have lost a high court challenge against ITV over its decision to exclude their party leaders from a televised election debate. Patience Wheatcroft, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and former editor of the Sunday Telegraph, has announced that she is supporting the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna to be the next MP for the Cities of London and Westminster. She is a strong opponent of Brexit and supports a second referendum. Here is the CBI reaction to Jo Swinson\u2019s speech. This is from Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general. It was good to hear commitments from the Liberal Democrats on working with firms to tackle climate change, improve skills and backing business as a force for good. Increasing investment in infrastructure will better connect the UK\u2019s regions and nations, close productivity gaps and facilitate a step change in exports. The Liberal Democrats recognise the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform. But moving to a land value tax is mired in complexity, and it remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field. Much more detail will be needed. Employee engagement is hugely important, but there are numerous ways to ensure staff views are represented at the highest levels rather than simply asking employees to sit on boards. We have not written much here today about Jennifer Arcuri, who has been giving interviews about her friendship with Boris Johnson, which has now led to him being subject to various investigations into whether he abused his position as London mayor because her firm benefited from sponsorship and trade mission access during his term in office. But my colleague Marina Hyde has been watching, and she has a great write-up here. And here is an extract. The most worrying moment for Johnson\u2019s team will have been the bit where [Victoria] Derbyshire told the otherwise elliptic Arcuri she could help him out by saying there was no conflict of interest. Quick as a flash she shot back: \u201cAnd he could help me out. Like, two months ago.\u201d She\u2019d sent him a text, she revealed. \u201cYou wanna read it?\u201d she asked, reaching for her phone. \u201c\u2018Is this the price of loyalty? To be hung up on, ignored and blocked? Why would I remain silent if you can\u2019t even speak to me?\u2019\u201d So there you have Jennifer Arcuri in all her, like, glory \u2013 this election\u2019s picaresque anti-heroine. And I\u2019m afraid we all know what happens to those. In the story of Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, who would definitely have been monstered on GMB, Thomas Hardy is clear: \u201cThe woman pays.\u201d And so with Jennifer of the Arcuris. The woman pays. The prime minister? Nah, seems unlikely. But that\u2019s business. Try not to choke on it. On the Today programme this morning Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said that cutting the rate of corporation tax had led to the overall income to the government from this tax going up. Given that she was speaking only hours before Boris Johnson announced that he was abandoning a proposed further cut in corporation tax, her comment could be seen as an implicit criticism of the policy her leader was about to announce. She told the programme: What we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve reduced corporation tax from 28% to 19%, making it the lowest in the G20, is we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of tax taken by the exchequer. This afternoon the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, has published a short briefing note on the Johnson announcement. It says that, while Leadsom may be correct in saying overall revenue has gone up while the rate has gone down, she would have been wrong if she was implying a causal relationship. The IFS says: Corporation tax revenue has increased since 2010 even while the headline rate has been cut. But that does not mean that rate reductions have increased revenue. First ... much of the rise in revenue since 2010 is simply recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and recession. We would have expected a recovery in profits even if the corporation tax rate had not been cut. Second, while the government has reduced the headline rate of corporation tax, at the same time it has increased corporation tax in other ways, including reducing capital allowances for investment, introducing the bank surcharge, restricting companies\u2019 ability to offset past losses against future profits, and a raft of anti-avoidance measures ... Taken together these measures recoup around \u00a310bn of the \u00a313bn spent reducing the headline rate. The IFS also says the Johnson decision to abandon the proposed cut in corporation tax will free up \u00a36bn for the government to spend on other things. These are from the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones. Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart and Matthew Taylor report. In an interview with BBC News Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has just ridiculed the idea that Brexit would be \u201cdone\u201d under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to pass his withdrawal agreement. That would not be Brexit over, she said. She said it would just be the end of \u201cseries one\u201d; there would be a whole \u201cbox set\u201d yet to come, because of the post-Brexit trade negotiation with the EU. Swinson said the Lib Dem policy of abandoning Brexit and staying in the EU was the only way of resolving this quickly. The Federation of Small Businesses has welcomed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s promise to tackle the late payments crisis, which has left many small businesses waiting without cash for invoices to be honoured. \u201cOur late payment crisis remains the biggest scourge afflicting the UK\u2019s small business community. It destroys 50,000 firms a year at a cost of at least \u00a32.5bn to the economy,\u201d said chairman Mike Cherry. Q: Could the Lib Dems work with Labour if it replaced its leader? Swinson says, if the Lib Dems do not get a majority, they will still want to stop Brexit. She says neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn deserve to be PM. Lib Dems votes will not put either of them there, she says. She says there is a real fear in the Jewish community about Corbyn becoming prime minister. There is no way the Liberal Democrats could vote for him to be PM on that basis, she says. Jo Swinson is now taking questions. Q: Won\u2019t your plan to abolish business rates, and replace them with a levy on landlords, just lead to rents going up? Swinson says business rates can be a crippling cost. Swinson says the offer from the two main parties is a \u201cterrible choice\u201d. The Conservatives do not respect the rule of law. And Labour thinks little of property rights, she says. Swinson says the Lib Dems would scrap business rates and replace them with a levy on landowners. The party would also give every adult in England a \u00a310,000 \u201cskills wallet\u201d so that they can invest in training. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is addressing the CBI conference now. She says any party that wants to get Brexit done, or get Brexit sorted, cannot be said to be the party of business. She says the Liberal Democrats are the only party that can really claim to be the party of business because they are opposed to Brexit. A Tory official has been in touch to say that an Office for Budget Responsibility report earlier this year said cutting corporation tax from 19% to 17% would have cost the Treasury \u00a35.4bn by 2023-24. (See para 4.36 on page 83 here [pdf].) (So, when Boris Johnson told the CBI abandoning this tax cut would save \u00a36bn for the NHS and other public services, it seems he was generously rounding up the total.) From Sky\u2019s business correspondent Paul Kelso, who\u2019s at the CBI conference: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims small businesses would benefit from a \u201cclean break\u201d Brexit. Jo Swinson is to present the Liberal Democrats as \u201cthe natural party of business\u201d when she speaks to the CBI conference this afternoon, primarily as the party wants to prevent Brexit. Swinson, with an ever-growing entourage of reporters and TV crews in tow, took one of the Lib Dem battlebuses to Kings Langley, just north of London, to visit Imagination Technologies, a sizeable UK firm which specialises in graphics processing and other computing functions, though from the marketing and intellectual property side, rather than manufacturing. This was explained at some length to Swinson as she toured a big room in the firm\u2019s HQ lined with various laptops, phones and tablets using the company\u2019s products. At one point she was shown a device designed to answer voice questions, which happily provided details about Imagination Technologies. \u201cWhich UK party wants to stop Brexit?\u201d Swinson asked it, getting a long, slightly awkward silence in response. Speaking to reporters at the visit, Swinson said she would have some \u201csome very specific\u201d policies to announce at the CBI, but provided a message that was, as is much the party does in this election, centred around Brexit: The Liberal Democrats are now the natural party of business. Instead of the Brexit plans of the Conservatives and the Labour party, that are going to hit the economy hard, the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit. We also want to make sure that businesses can get the skills and the talent they need. Earlier, in her speech to the CBI conference, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, its director general, said that extremists on the right and the left in politics were causing \u201cgreat harm to the economy\u201d. (See 10.17am.) She was referring to Tory Brexiters who favour a no-deal Brexit, and Labour Corbynites pushing a nationalisation agenda. Here are the full quotes from her speech. I believe we are facing a danger that could get in the way of a bright future. And it takes the form of extreme ideology. We see it on both sides of the political divide. On the right, we have the threat of \u2013 even preference for \u2013 no deal as the end point of our Brexit negotiations ... For some on the right \u2013 this preference for no deal is driven by a zeal for something beyond this and that is the wholesale deregulation of the UK economy. But I want to be clear that this is not what British firms, large or small, want. They are intent on improving the quality of good jobs and not diminishing them. They accept Brexit and will do all they can to make it work. But when no deal becomes an ideology of its own, seemingly intent on ignoring the impact on jobs and livelihoods, then we have a problem. Meanwhile, ideology from the left is at least as damaging. The Labour party is proposing the biggest programme of renationalisation this country has ever seen at great cost with uncertain returns to the taxpayer and with no clear route to better customer service. Its most recent proposed nationalisation of part of BT was a bolt from the blue and has sent a chill through boardrooms at home and abroad. With many firms questioning whether their investment is safe. And some thinking: are we next? These ideologies from both sides are causing great harm to our economy. Not just in the future but right now. The Overseas Development Institute is holding what it says may be the only general election hustings devoted to the topic of overseas aid. It is just starting now, and there is a live feed here. Those taking part include Ray Collins, the former Labour general secretary, Lady Sheehan from the Lib Dems, Natalie Bennett from the Greens and Elizabeth Babade from the Brexit party. Tory sources are saying that the \u00a36bn figure for the amount saved by not going ahead with next year\u2019s corporation tax is an annual figure, not a cumulative, five-year figure. (See 12.44pm.) More on how much the government will save by abandoning the corporation tax cut from 19% to 17% due to come into force next year. In 2016 the Treasury said this tax cut was worth just \u00a3945m a year. (See 12.44pm.) Earlier this year my colleague Richard Partington said that this cut was expected to cost the Treasury much more than originally assumed. \u201cAn analysis based on HMRC data suggests that the loss of revenue from the planned cuts, initiated by former chancellor George Osborne but supported by incumbent Philip Hammond, could add up to more than \u00a36bn,\u201d his report said. And, according to Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu, in 2017 the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that by 2022 this tax cut would cost almost \u00a37bn. These are from Newsnight\u2019s economics editor, Ben Chu. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has put out a statement saying Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon the corporation tax cut planned for next year will not repair the damage caused by Tory tax cuts. He said: Johnson has announced a temporary pause in the Tories\u2019 race to the bottom on corporation tax It cannot compensate for the lives that have been lost and will not repair the damage done to our communities to pay for the Conservatives\u2019 handouts to big business since 2010. The government\u2019s own figures show that billions have been lost to the public purse, which has had real consequences across the country. Labour is committed to gradually raising corporation tax to 26%, which would still be lower than the 28% level it was at when Labour left office in 2010. This is from Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury, on Boris Johnson\u2019s corporation tax announcement - an effective tax rise. The main rate of corporation tax is 19%, but it was due to fall to 17% in April next year. At the time this cut was announced, by George Osborne in the March 2016 budget, the Treasury said this would cost \u00a3945m in 2020-21. It is not clear yet why Johnson is saying this would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. He may be using a cumulative, five-year figure - in which case what he has announced today is a long way off matching the Labour plans, which Labour itself says would lead to health spending being \u00a36bn a year higher in real terms than under current government plans. (See 11.26am.) UPDATE: I\u2019m still waiting for clarification from CCHQ, but there have been reports saying that the corporation tax cut was going to cost far more than assumed in 2016, and that \u00a36bn a year is a fair figure. (See 1.13pm.) FURTHER UPDATE: The \u00a36bn figure is an annual figure, the Tories say. (See 1.26pm.) Extinction Rebellion protesters have been at Labour HQ this morning as part of their campaign for parties to commit to much tougher action to deal with the climate crisis, including reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. The group says it is going to target all the UK political parties. And here is the CBI response to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. It\u2019s time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face. The challenge is not what Labour wants to achieve, it\u2019s how. Firms share many of the same ambitions, on skills, climate change, delivering high-paid jobs and making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country \u2013 but those challenges need a joint response. Some of Labour\u2019s proposals do open the door to partnership. Greater flexibility on the apprenticeship levy is something firms have long asked for. A step up in all forms of vocational training for school leavers and those switching careers offers opportunities and works for the economy. Re-skilling the economy to achieve net zero and adapt for increased automation is critical, and apprenticeships can have a big role to play in this. But false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes on to thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill. A high-growth, fair mixed economy is within our grasp, but only if business is welcomed and supported as a provider of opportunity, not falsely portrayed as the root cause of inequality. Here is the CBI reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. Conservative commitments to unblock the pent-up potential of British enterprise will be welcomed by businesses who have faced an ever-growing burden of costs and uncertainty. Postponing further cuts to corporation tax to invest in public services could work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth. Reforming business rates has been a key priority for CBI members. This means that we will finally get to grips with a broken system that damages investment and jobs and could breathe new life into our high streets and other sectors. Business welcomes the prime minister\u2019s passion for levelling up opportunities throughout the country through investment in education, infrastructure and technology. But his words must become firm commitments in the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto in order to get the UK economy back on track. Action at home must be accompanied by the right type of Brexit certainty. That means a new relationship with the EU that maintains frictionless trade, keeps close regulatory alignment and supports our services sector. Unnecessary deadlines and damaging cliff-edges should be replaced by taking the time needed to secure a sustainable, ambitious relationship. Corbyn is taking three more questions. These are from members of the CBI audience, not journalists. Q: What is your attitude towards the sharing economy? Corbyn says he approves of sharing, not wasting. Q: What are you going to do to disprove claims that Labour is \u201cfor the many, not the Jew\u201d, and to show that you care about antisemitism and racism? Corbyn says racism is a scourge and an evil for all of us. Whether it is antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other form of racism, it is evil. He says it has no place in a civilised society. Labour will continue to fund protection for synagogues and other places of worship, and it will continue to fund anti-racist education in schools. He says Labour will audit the way the public sector recruits to promote diversity. He says he was brought up to hate racism. He has opposed it all his life. He says he will carry that attitude into Downing Street. Q: You have not mentioned industrial strategy. Are you going to follow the current government\u2019s strategy? Corbyn says Labour will increase corporation tax, but not beyond 2010 levels. Poverty is a terrible waste, he says. Children growing up in poverty can find it hard to learn if they do not have space to do their homework. Q: How will a four-day week help productivity? Corbyn says this will be funded and paid for by productivity increases. He says over many years working times have come down as a result of productivity increases. He ends by saying he thinks everyone would support a fairer and more egalitarian society. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: Do you accept your surprise announcement to nationalise BT Openreach worried business? Corbyn says every business has been arguing for years they need better broadband. In many rural areas it hardly exists. So getting businesses to move there is unrealistic. He says the government did not allocate enough money for this. And private firms were taking too long. This has led to some groups having to organise their own provision. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s proposals is a fair and good one. You accept the case for universal provision of energy services, and mail services. These days universal provision of broadband is essential. Q: Can you name a FTSE 100 company you admire? Corbyn says most companies have social impact funds. And most of them give to social enterprises. His concern is about the behaviour of some oil and mineral companies. He says he is not anti these companies. But where social or environmental damage has been causes, firms have an obligation to behave differently. Q: Would you nationalise bus services outside London? Corbyn says bus services outside London were deregulated. He says mayors like Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester want to be able to run regulated bus services. Some can do this, and some can\u2019t. Labour would extend these powers, so they can run these services. And it would legislate for integrated transport systems. Q: Isn\u2019t it clear that your Brexit policy won\u2019t sort out Brexit quickly? Corbyn says his party represents people who voted leave and remain. There has been a huge demand for a second referendum. Labour\u2019s approach is sensible and credible, he says. He says he wants to bring uncertainty to an end. Corbyn tells his audience that there are many things they agree on. What a Labour government will do is raise the platform on which our whole society stands so that businesses and individuals can build themselves up even higher and reach their dreams. You know despite people\u2019s differences, there are things we can all agree on. None of us wants to live in a society where we have to step over rough sleepers on our way to work. None of us wants to live in a society where foodbank collection points are needed in every supermarket. None of us wants to live in a society where one in three children grows up in poverty. I just want to live in a decent society. And I know you do too. It doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or choice because the opportunities created for businesses under a Labour government will be immense. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plans mean tackling inequality and addressing the climate crisis can go hand in hand. Our green industrial revolution means that tackling the climate crisis and reducing inequality can go hand in hand because the inequality that scars our society is not inevitable; it\u2019s not an act of God or a law of physics. It\u2019s the result of deliberate government policy that has made us one of the most unequal countries in Europe both between the billionaires at the very top and everybody else and between the different parts of the UK. This inequality is unsustainable and immoral. Ending it requires government action so that investment reaches all and people are supported to unlock their talents. Corbyn is now giving details of Labour\u2019s proposed 320,000 new climate apprenticeships. Corbyn claims the PM wants to hand over parts of the NHS to American companies under a trade deal with the US. He claims that this could lead to \u00a3500m a week handed over to US drug companies. Labour would legislate to stop this, he says. (The \u00a3500m per week figure is not particularly plausible, because it is an extreme, worst-case scenario. This Channel 4 News FactCheck explains why.) Corbyn says Labour supports the proposals in the CBI\u2019s own manifesto for the election. Contrary to what some people claim, Labour does not think the state can address all the problems facing the country without help from business, he says. Corbyn says Labour will ask big businesses to pay their fair share of tax. And some services will be brought back into public ownership. But this is normal in many parts of Europe, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is addressing the CBI now. He starts by saying that, if Labour is elected, the CBI will see more infrastructure being built than it has ever dreamt of. And he says small businesses will benefit from Labour plans to ensure that suppliers have their invoices paid on time. Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the CBI, but there is a problem with the autocue. The business tax cuts announced by the Conservative party overnight (see 11.02am) did not have a price tag attached, but they all seemed to involve a relatively small outlay from the exchequer. By comparison, the decision to abandon the proposed corporation tax cut does seem to amount to a big ticket spending announcement. Boris Johnson said it would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. It may be one of the biggest Tory election announcements we\u2019ve had so far. It is not hard to see why Johnson announced this, or even why he opted for the \u00a36bn figure. This is the exact figure announced by Labour last week when it announced its own spending increase for the NHS. Here is an extract from the notes from the Labour press notice issued at the time. (Bold type in original.) Labour\u2019s funding plan would deliver: A real terms increase of \u00a326bn (\u00a340bn in cash terms) from 2018-19 to 2023-24 \u2013 the period over which the Conservatives promised \u00a320bn more. In other words, Johnson has neutralised the Labour bid to outspend the Tories on the NHS. (At least, he has if his figures are accurate - at the moment we have had no detail of what is is proposing.) In one sense this is a win for Labour; it shows that Jeremy Corbyn has been setting the agenda, and he just justifiably argue that this means the opposition is changing the policy of the governing parties. But in campaign terms, this is a setback for Corbyn. At least one element of his distinctive pitch on the NHS has now been eliminated - even though there are still plenty of other differences been Labour and Tory health policy. (Spending totals aren\u2019t everything.) UPDATE: Looking at the Treasury red book from 2016, when this corporation tax cut was announced, it looks as if the \u00a36bn figure that Johnson announced is a cumulative, five-year figure, not an annual figure, which would mean he was a long way off matching what Labour has promised. See 12.44pm. I will post more when I get more clarification on this. FURTHER UPDATE: The Tories have now confirmed that the \u00a36bn figure is an annual figure, not a cumulative figure. (See 1.26pm.) Q: The CBI think you are wrong about how long it will take to negotiate a trade deal and about immigration. Are they wrong? Johnson says he has a deal that will protect the needs of business and industry. On immigration, he favours immigration. But you must have democratic control. An Australian-style points system would be of great value in showing people that the UK does have control of the system. Q: Did you share the incredulity of the rest of the UK about Prince Andrew\u2019s interview? Johnson says he does not want to be drawn into commentary about that. Q: If you win the election, will you keep Sajid Javid as chancellor? Johnson says he will. He says Javid is doing a fantastic job. Johnson promises to keep Sajid Javid as chancellor if he wins election. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: To get Brexit done, you will have to get a deal by next June, or delay the transition? Johnson claims that people said he would not be able to change the withdrawal agreement. But he did get it changed. He says the UK and the EU are already \u201cin a state of grace\u201d on tariffs and regulatory alignment. They are off to a flying start. He does not see why the trade deal cannot be negotiated next year. Q: Will you encourage the Duke of York to cooperate with the US inquiry into Jeffrey Epstein? Nice try, says Johnson. And Johnson adds a new announcement. Johnson says the Tories would postpone further cuts in corporation tax. That would free up \u00a36bn for the NHS, he says. Corporation tax was due to fall from 19% to 17%. Johnson says he is announcing package of measures to help business flourish. Here is how they were summed up in an overnight press notice from the Conservative party. (Bold from original release.) A business rates cut. The burden of business rates will be reduced as part of a fundamental review. A jobs tax cut. National insurance contributions will be cut by \u00a31,000 for over half a million employers. A construction tax cut. Tax relief on the purchase, building or leasing of a structure will be increased by 1%. A research tax cut. We will review the scope of R&amp;D tax credits and increase the rate by 1%. Johnson says the country needs a government that \u201cbelieves in business\u201d and understands the importance of wealth creators. He claims more businesses have been created in the UK since 2010 than in France and Germany combined. Johnson is broadening out his speech now to wider policy areas. The Tories would cut crime, he says, and invest in education. Young people must be able to, literally, find work, he says. And that is why infrastructure is so important, he says. He says, as well as focusing on big infrastructure projects, Johnson says he wants to focus on smaller transport projects too: better roads, better buses, more cycleways. He loves cycleways, he says. He says, by doing this, government can create \u201cthe platform for growth\u201d. And, if it does that, the market will respond, he says. Johnson says he wants to cut the productivity gap in the UK. But he will do that not be decapitating the tall poppies, but by levelling up. Johnson claims Jeremy Corbyn would be dependent on an alliance with the SNP. And he says Corbyn\u2019s position on the EU is \u201cpositively mind-boggling\u201d. He says it is still not clear whether or not Corbyn will campaign for the deal he will negotiate with the EU. Or, like Alec Guinness in the Bridge on the River Kwai, will he blow up the bridge he has himself constructed? Johnson says there is a pent-up, tidal wave of investment waiting to come into the UK once Brexit is resolved. He says he would not normally introduced party politics into a speech like this. But this is an election campaign, he says. He says the Tory Brexit deal is ready to go. You just add hot water and stir, he says (using his Pot Noodle simile again). He says the Conservative plan would give stability and certainty to business. It is a Blue Peter deal - \u201chere\u2019s one I prepared earlier\u201d. And he says every single Conservative party candidate has explicitly backed his deal. (In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph yesterday, he said they had been asked to give a pledge to that effect.) Johnson says the economy is not achieving as much as it could. There is so much more natural energy to unleash, he says. The country is being held back by politics, by parliament, he says. He is using a version of the passage released in advance. (See 9.29am.) Boris Johnson starts by saying it is a pleasure to be at this venue, a hotel near the O2 arena. He says as London mayor he gave planning permission for it to be built. He is now delivering his familiar riff about who much the UK exports to the rest of the world. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, introduces Boris Johnson. She says, as London mayor, he was very pro-enterprise. This is his first speech to the CBI as prime minister, she says. These are from the BBC\u2019s business editor, Simon Jack, on the speech and Q&amp;A from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. All the main UK parties are proposing a resolution to the Brexit deadlock. In his speech to the CBI later Boris Johnson will argue that the Conservatives would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d early next year so that the government can focus on the people\u2019s priorities. Jeremy Corbyn is also promising to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d, although under his plan it would take six months, for a renegotiation and a referendum. In his speech opening the CBI conference, John Allan, the Tesco chairman and CBI president, claimed that both main parties were being simplistic. He said: Currently no party has the answers. It\u2019s not as simple as \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019. Or \u2018sorting Brexit in six months\u2019. Or even \u2018stop Brexit\u2019. Whatever happens in this election we\u2019ll be negotiating with the EU for years to come. Whether as a close friend or distant neighbour. So we need to have an honest conversation. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, is speaking at the conference now. She has just argued that business is at risk from ideologues on both the right and the left in politics: from those on the right, who want a no-deal Brexit because it will lead to deregulation; and from those on the left pushing a nationalisation agenda. I will post the quotes shortly. The CBI conference has started. John Allan, the CBI president, is giving the opening speech. There is a live feed here. Prof Sir John Curtice, the elections expert who is in charge of the exit poll used by the BBC and other broadcasters, told the Today programme this morning that he thought Labour had made \u201ca bit of ground at the expense of the Liberal Democrats amongst remain voters\u201d during the campaign so far but that it was still struggling with leave voters. The Labour party has spent most of the last week not talking about Brexit but trying to persuade voters on the leave side of the argument to come to the Labour party on the basis of its domestic agenda. The truth is the polls suggest this is not having any cut-through at all. Labour\u2019s share of the vote amongst leave voters \u2013 a grand total of 14% \u2013 is exactly the same now as it was a week ago, and that\u2019s the other clear message from the polls. Curtice also said the Liberal Democrats were finding it difficult to win over remain voters from the Conservatives. Equally for the Liberal Democrats, another absolutely clear message, that a lot of them think they can forge ahead by taking away remain voters from the Conservatives \u2013 well, I have to say the polls suggest that so far again their strategy is not doing much good. Curtice said there was a \u201cbinary choice\u201d when it came to Brexit at the election. Either we get a Conservative majority, and in the wake of that majority Boris Johnson will be able to pursue Brexit along the lines he proposes - and at the moment that is the direction in which the polls are quite firmly pointing - or perhaps we get a hung parliament and given that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru are apparently all on the same page in wanting to have a second referendum, then presumably that is what would happen in the wake of a hung parliament. The leaders of the three main UK parties will be speaking at the CBI conference in London today and, as my colleague Peter Walker reports in his preview story, they will all be making arguments about why their policies are advantageous to business. But it is not just business who will be listening, and the speeches will also illustrate how the leaders are trying to frame the election. For Labour, it is about reversing a decade of austerity, and Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking about the number of apprentices that could be created by his party\u2019s \u00a3250bn green transformation fund. But for the Tories primarily the election is about Brexit, and Boris Johnson will argue that he needs a majority because parliament has been trying to \u201csabotage the democratic will of the people\u201d. Here is an extract from his speech released overnight by CCHQ. Johnson is expected to say: Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, big business didn\u2019t want Brexit. You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other. But what is also clear is that what you want now - and have wanted for some time - is certainty. So that you can plan and invest, so you can grow and expand, so that you can create jobs and drive prosperity. Whilst you didn\u2019t want it, the people did vote for it. And so it was for politicians to deliver it. It has been politicians in a broken parliament \u2013 not you \u2013 that have failed in this and in some cases actively tried to sabotage the democratic will of the people. This is why we had to have this election. Our hung and broken parliament was set on prolonging this delay. It is interesting to note that Johnson is admitting that big business does not want Brexit. Four years ago the CBI conference in London was disrupted by two protesters from Vote Leave, the organisation that Johnson subsequently went on to lead (in November 2015 he still had not yet committed himself to the leave cause), who accused the CBI of being the voice of Brussels, and not representative of business. One of the protesters said at the time: We\u2019re worried about the CBI misrepresenting British businesses\u2019 views. We don\u2019t want the British public to be swayed by the CBI making claims about the views of British businesses when in reality a lot of particularly small and medium-sized businesses in the UK feel that the EU hinders rather than helps them. At its party conference in September Labour passed a motion saying the party should work \u201ctowards a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030\u201d. But that does not necessarily mean the 2030 target will be in the party\u2019s manifesto, and on the Today programme this morning Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, implied the manifesto target will be looser. This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. UPDATE: This is what Gardiner told Today: We will have a power sector 90% powered by renewables by 2030. That is absolutely in line with achieving the overall targets that we have set which is to make sure that well before 2050 we have achieved the net-zero which we need to do ... The target that we\u2019ve already committed to is to make sure that we have a net-zero economy well before 2050. What we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ll be making sure that the power sector \u2013 and this was the key thing that intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) said \u2013 that you have to have halved your emissions by 2030 in order to have a chance of achieving the targets, the global targets, that we need. Here are the election items in the diary for today. 10.15am: The Liberal Democrat and the SNP take legal action in the high court against their exclusion from the ITV leaders\u2019 debate taking place tomorrow. 10.40am: Boris Johnson speaks to the CBI conference. 11.15am: Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the CBI conference. 2.25pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, speaks to the CBI conference. In an interview on the Today programme Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said that if the Conservatives won the election their immigration rules would be \u201cfair to the world\u201d and not just the EU. She explained: The immigration rules at the moment allow free movement from all EU nations and then quite significantly tighter rules from the rest of the world. Our immigration rules will be fair to the world once we leave the European Union. What that means is, instead of being open, free-access to benefits, to work and to coming here without a job to the EU but tight for the rest of the world, what we will have is a system that can control the types of workers that we need in our economy, that can be driven by the needs to the UK economy, and that will be fair to the entire world instead of just free movement from the EU. Labour\u2019s David Lammy has accused her of \u201cmigrant bashing\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh. As my colleague Matthew Weaver reports, Boris Johnson is facing fresh pressure over his relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. Arcuri gave an interview to ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning and, although she has refused to say whether she had an affair with Johnson when he was London mayor, she described their relationship as \u201cvery special\u201d. Asked directly on\u201cwas it an affair\u201d, Arcuri replied: I\u2019m not going to answer that question, but as you can tell there was a very special relationship there and when it did come out, half the people already assumed the affair and told me to admit. The other half just wanted me to deny, deny, deny. We will be pausing the live blog for a while and resuming shortly. Thank you The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, are also speaking at the CBI conference. Labour has promised to create a climate apprenticeship programme that will train an average of 80,000 people a year. Under the plans, they said they will deliver 320,000 apprenticeships in England during their first term in government, with the programme creating 886,000 by 2030. The conference comes after the CBI director general, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, said Corbyn\u2019s nationalisation plans would \u201cfreeze investment\u201d, and called on Labour to work with business. She told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cWe look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy.\u201d Boris Johnson will announce cuts to national insurance and business tax in a speech today. The prime minister will tell leaders at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference on Monday that the Tories will put an end to Brexit \u201cuncertainty and confusion\u201d if they are returned to power on 12 December. Johnson will increase the employment allowance from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000, providing a cut in NI of up to 1,000 for more than half a million businesses. They have also promised to increase the structures and buildings allowance (SBA) from 2% to 3% to increase the tax relief on the purchase, building or leasing of a structure. Johnson is expected to say: Let\u2019s not beat around the bush. Big business didn\u2019t want Brexit. You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other. But what is also clear is that what you want now \u2013 and have wanted for some time \u2013 is certainty. So that you can plan and invest, so you can grow and expand, so that you can create jobs and drive prosperity. He is expected to add: While you didn\u2019t want it, the people did vote for it. And so it was for politicians to deliver it. Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: These measures lay down a gauntlet to other parties, and we hope there will be more to come at this election. Actions to reduce the cost of employment and fix business rates should be complemented with clear commitments to tackle the scourge of late payments and help ensure the government is helping the self-employed. For example, through introducing a \u2018self-employment legislative lock\u2019 and measures to help the self-employed have better access to maternity, paternity and adoption support, and mortgages and pensions. That\u2019s it from me, I am now handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh, who will then pass the baton to Andrew Sparrow. Thanks for reading. If you need to wake up fast, click on this offering on rail transport from Jeremy Corbyn and turn the volume up to 11. That\u2019s the papers. Time for a little more on the latest from the Arcuri investigation from Matthew Weaver. The London assembly\u2019s oversight committee is going to review a case stemming from 2010, when Johnson failed to declare an interest after having affair with the City Hall adviser Helen Macintyre, who later had a child with him. At the time, Johnson acknowledged that a potential conflict of interest had not been disclosed and vowed to \u201cbear in mind the definition of close associate for the future\u201d. Len Duvall, a Labour assembly member who chairs the committee, said: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the paperwork into Helen Macintyre. We need to understand that because he was advised to make those declarations in the future. The question is why did he hide the new relationship with Arcuri?\u201d You can read more here. The i takes a similar tack to the Guardian, with the calls for Andrew to meet the FBI following his interview. It notes that he could face a subpoena to testify if he were to travel to the US. The Financial Times reports on the latest developments in the Saudi Aramco IPO and gives its picture slot to the unrest in Hong Kong at the weekend. The Daily Express sticks to the election schedule, and gives Boris Johnson\u2019s business boost top billing, but mentions Andrew\u2019s widely derided TV interview in a blurb at the top. The Daily Mirror has its own exclusive, quoting a former royal protection officer\u2019s view of Andrew\u2019s denials regarding Virginia Giuffre\u2019s allegations that he had sex with her when she was 17. The Daily Mail engages in damage limitation for Andrew, quoting the prince\u2019s friends as saying he regretted not showing more sympathy for Epstein\u2019s victims. The Sun says Andrew told the Queen the interview was \u201ca great success\u201d, and reports on criticism of Jeremy Corbyn for saying he would be prepared to give up the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent. The Times says Prince Andrew is defiant despite the fallout, and pushes its exclusive about the encounter by Emily Maitlis. It gives its fifth column to Johnson\u2019s attempt to heal the rift with business caused by Brexit. The Telegraph splashes with an unhappy Queen (in a very striking hat), quoting a royal source as saying she did not give the BBC interview her blessing. It gives Boris Johnson its anchor spot underneath with his pitch to businesses at the CBI today. Today\u2019s newspapers are almost entirely taken up with the fallout from Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, variously described as a \u201ccar crash\u201d or a \u201cgreat success\u201d on today\u2019s front pages. Today\u2019s Guardian focuses on Epstein\u2019s victims, with their lawyers demanding that Andrew speak to the FBI. Happy Monday to you and welcome to today\u2019s politics liveblog. I will be showing you the lie of the land for the first hour before handing over to my colleagues. Here\u2019s what we can expect today \u2026 At a glance: Investigators looking into Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri will also review an affair with an adviser that he failed to declare while mayor of London. On the campaign trail, he is preparing to woo business owners with a range of tax cuts at the Confederation of British Industry conference. He will promise tax relief for the construction and research industries, plus a tax cut for small employers by raising the allowance for their national insurance bills from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. Jeremy Corbyn will also speak at the CBI. Labour will unveil a compromise position on immigration this week that would not commit fully to free movement after Brexit but would expand the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK. The Liberal Democrats are challenging ITV in the high court this morning over its exclusion of leader, Jo Swinson, from its televised debate. Two judges in London will also hear a similar action by the SNP. Swinson will be in Hertfordshire this morning. That\u2019s enough chat for now \u2013 off we go!",

      "bodyText": "Hubris and overconfidence caused by excellent financial performance is a major driver of irresponsible corporate behaviour, according to new research. Di Fan, a senior lecturer at the business school of the Australian National University, said his research showed companies making above-average profits were more likely to breach their environmental or social obligations than run-of-the-mill firms. He said internal corporate governance had failed to curb bad behaviour and, based on his earlier research of US companies, fines needed to be increased as much as sixfold to encourage better behaviour. Fan\u2019s research, published in a paper co-authored with colleagues from Spain, Ireland and Hong Kong, comes amid fallout from widespread corporate misconduct in the financial services sector, and scandals over wage underpayment in various other industries. Company executives are under political pressure to resist activists who demand environmental, safety and governance issues be taken more seriously. Australia\u2019s banks are facing billions of dollars in costs to remediate customers they ripped off by providing poor services including shoddy financial advice and junk insurance, while one of the country\u2019s biggest retailers, Woolworths, says it will spend up to $300m to compensate a group of workers it has underpaid for as much as a decade. Fan said his research found that companies were more likely to breach environmental and social regulations if they were either financial under-performers or \u2013 counter-intuitively \u2013 over-performers. Under-performers were under economic pressure to \u201ctake shortcuts\u201d to catch up financially, he said. But in the case of star companies, \u201cwe find that it is hubris behind this tendency\u201d. \u201cThey are overconfident that when they do those illegal things they will not get caught,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have resources to maintain environmental and safety procedures, but we find that even though they have resources, they do not use them.\u201d He said the internal control systems of companies had failed and it was up to regulators and shareholders to put pressure on executives to do the right thing. \u201cFines could be a way to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our earlier research we found that fines are actually quite low.\u201d Tying executive pay to corporate social responsibility (CSR) measures has been controversial in Australia, with some large investment funds rejecting the use of so-called \u201csoft\u201d measures of performance. However, Fan said remuneration structures that forced chief executives to have skin in the game by owning a lot of shares in the company could help force better behaviour. \u201cPracticing good CSR is an expectation from customers and shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any CSR scandals come out, the share price will decrease. If the CEO has a lot of stock, those stock price decreases will immediately affect the personal wealth of the CEO.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe entertainment experience of a lifetime,\u201d trumpeted the poster for Ben-Hur upon its release in 1959. It was an absurdly pompous claim that the universe nonetheless did its level best to reward, as if to justify the film-makers\u2019 sheer commitment to scale: at the now quaint-sounding figure of $15m, William Wyler\u2019s epic was at the time the most expensive film (with the largest sets) in Hollywood history, with a marketing budget nearly as high as the production one. Sure enough, audiences and awards voters took them at their word. Ben-Hur swiftly took its place behind only Gone With the Wind in the all-time box office charts, and roared through the Oscars with 11 wins \u2013 a record that stood alone until Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King equalled it decades later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/10/ben-hur-film-failure-2016-version\">Don't judge Ben-Hur by the 2016 version</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet there was an oddly, inadvertently back-handed undertone to that grandstanding: Ben-Hur may have been the entertainment experience of <em>one </em>lifetime, yes, but has it endured through subsequent ones? The biblical spectacular celebrates its 60th anniversary this month, yet it doesn\u2019t feel as broadly celebrated today as other films marking the same milestone: Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot, for example, or Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s North By Northwest, or Francois Truffaut\u2019s The 400 Blows.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe entertainment experience of a lifetime,\u201d trumpeted the poster for Ben-Hur upon its release in 1959. It was an absurdly pompous claim that the universe nonetheless did its level best to reward, as if to justify the film-makers\u2019 sheer commitment to scale: at the now quaint-sounding figure of $15m, William Wyler\u2019s epic was at the time the most expensive film (with the largest sets) in Hollywood history, with a marketing budget nearly as high as the production one. Sure enough, audiences and awards voters took them at their word. Ben-Hur swiftly took its place behind only Gone With the Wind in the all-time box office charts, and roared through the Oscars with 11 wins \u2013 a record that stood alone until Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King equalled it decades later. Yet there was an oddly, inadvertently back-handed undertone to that grandstanding: Ben-Hur may have been the entertainment experience of one lifetime, yes, but has it endured through subsequent ones? The biblical spectacular celebrates its 60th anniversary this month, yet it doesn\u2019t feel as broadly celebrated today as other films marking the same milestone: Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot, for example, or Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s North By Northwest, or Francois Truffaut\u2019s The 400 Blows.

      "bodyText": "The global climate crisis could lead to more renewable electricity being generated by spurring faster wind speeds for the world\u2019s growing number of windfarms, according to research. Scientists have discovered that the world\u2019s shifting ocean circulation patterns may have triggered a rapid increase in wind speeds over the last 10 years. The international research team analysed data from 9,000 international weather stations since the late 1970s and found that wind speeds had unexpectedly increased after a three-decade slowdown. Dr Zhenzhong Zeng, a professor at Princeton University and the lead author of the report, said the research team was surprised by the findings after setting out to study the slowdown in global wind speeds. The faster than expected wind speeds could help increase the amount of renewable electricity generated by each turbine by more than a third to 3.3m kilowatt hours (kWh) by 2024. Zeng said the unexpected acceleration is likely to have played a bigger role in improving the efficiency of windfarms in the US than technological innovations. The research paper, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, suggests that faster global speeds may continue for at least another decade in what would be a major boost for windfarm owners. Dr Adrian Chappell, a professor at Cardiff University and a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in global wind speed bodes well for the expansion of renewable energy which will be central to keeping global heating to below 2C. The findings mark a major reversal in a trend of decreasing wind speeds over the last three decades \u2013 known as global terrestrial stilling \u2013 which threatened to halve the world\u2019s wind power potential by the end of the century. Previous studies have found that increased \u201croughness\u201d on the Earth\u2019s surface, from new buildings and urbanisation, has acted as a buffer by slowing wind speeds by up to 2.3% every decade since the late 1970s. But the latest research has demonstrated that large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns could be making wind speeds faster again. The study found that the main drivers of the world\u2019s quickening wind speeds were the Pacific decadal oscillation, the North Atlantic oscillation and the Tropical North Atlantic index. Zeng said that the effect of global heating on the world\u2019s wind speeds remained largely uncertain because rising temperatures would have a diverse range of impacts that are not fully understood. \u201cWe believe our study advances [the] understanding on how climate change affects wind, and we appeal for more scientists to focus on this important climate variable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe study of wind can also shed light on the dynamic mechanisms of climate change.\u201d \u2022 The article was updated on 19 November 2019 to reflect a correction notice from Cardiff University.

      "bodyText": "Human rights campaigners have criticised the London Stock Exchange Group for including G4S on ethical investment indices, after the British security company was accused of contributing to human rights violations. The FTSE4Good index, run by the London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s FTSE Russell subsidiary, has included G4S for the past three years. During that time, G4S, one of the world\u2019s largest public sector employers, with 546,000 employees in 90 countries, has been at the centre of multiple controversies over its treatment of workers. In September, it said it will end its involvement in the immigration and asylum sector following a scandal at a detention centre near Gatwick. Norway\u2019s $1.1tn (\u00a3850bn) government pension fund last week announced it had excluded shares in G4S from its investment portfolio, after its ethics watchdog found an \u201cunacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations\u201d among workers in the Middle East. On Sunday the Labour party criticised the company following the revelation that a board member helped to set the UK\u2019s minimum wage. Vaidehee Sachdev, a senior research manager at ShareAction, which campaigns on responsible investment, called on FTSE Russell to remove G4S until it showed progress on improving its human rights record. \u201cEven before Norway\u2019s deeply distressing findings, the company\u2019s human rights record was questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who want to do good with their money would rightly be horrified to be invested in a company that fails to meet basic human rights standards.\u201d Index providers such as FTSE Russell are highly influential in the investment industry, and so-called ethical indices, which claim to exclude companies on environmental, social or governance grounds, have grown in popularity in recent years. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK\u2019s economic affairs programme director, said ethical indices are often \u201clittle more than soft corporate PR \u2013 reliant on partial and outdated information, rather than anything genuinely independent\u201d. He said: \u201cNorway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund is likely to offer a better assessment of whether G4S is actually doing enough to root out modern forms of slavery from its Gulf supply chains.\u201d FTSE Russell\u2019s largest competitors, including MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s Stoxx, do not include G4S on their ethical indices. G4S in September said its inclusion on FTSE4Good highlighted its contribution on the United Nations\u2019 eighth sustainable development goal, which calls for \u201cimmediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking\u201d, and to \u201cprotect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers\u201d. However, Norway\u2019s Council of Ethics found that some of G4S\u2019s employment practices were indicators of forced labour, a type of modern slavery, under the conventions of the UN International Labour Organisation. Migrant workers mainly from India, Pakistan and Nepal \u2013 working in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 were routinely subjected to misinformation about working conditions, restrictions on freedom of movement and \u201cdebt bondage\u201d from high recruitment fees, the council found. G4S last week said it had investigated the council\u2019s findings and that it was making progress on improving its employment practices. The London Stock Exchange Group declined to comment.",

My, how they tried \u2026 but all the smoke, mirrors, bells and whistles, singing and dancing, clapping and screaming could not disguise the swaths of empty seats in the Caja M\u00e1gica for the opening ceremony of DC Mark II. While the artful and expensive legerdemain strained to convince the third-full stadium that consigning 119 years of Davis Cup tradition to the history books was a good idea, the new tournament did grab the attention of the faithful. There was a lot of noise for Italy and Canada in the afternoon session on court two; the Russians and Croatia roused the cheers of their respective hardcore on centre court; and court three, where Great Britain will surely bring a bigger crowd against the Netherlands on Wednesday, had Belgium and Colombia going at it like kids at a party. Yet confusion is attended by uncertainty. As fans are educated in the new ways, they remain part of the experiment. Nevertheless there is decent goodwill for this solid try at saving the oldest event in international team sport. Everyone, it seems, likes Gerard Piqu\u00e9, whose baby it is, with $3bn pledged over 25 years. But that is a bit like promising to bring a free turkey round to your house every year, with the reasonable expectation you will forget about it after Boxing Day.

      "bodyText": "Russia could be banned from next year\u2019s Olympic Games and the European Championship in football after the World Anti-Doping Agency was expected to recommend it be found \u201cnon-compliant\u201d over anomalies in drug testing results. Wada\u2019s executive committee will meet on 9 December to assess the conclusion of its independent compliance review committee, which has been inspecting laboratory data belonging to Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency Rusada. If the executive agrees with the findings, Russia could not only receive a blanket ban from participation in major sporting events but also have hosting rights removed, including St Petersburg\u2019s status as a Euro 2020 venue. The data, subject to inspection by the CRC, relates to a period from January 2012 to August 2015. It was obtained by Wada earlier this year under the terms of a settlement relating to a previous drugs ban. The data is missing positive results that were made public by a whistleblower and a deadline for Rusada to explain those omissions has passed. A statement released by Wada on Mondayread: \u201cWada confirms its independent CRC met yesterday, 17 November, to consider a report from the Agency\u2019s Intelligence and Investigations Department and independent forensic experts and, accordingly, to discuss the ongoing compliance procedure brought against Rusada. \u201cIn line with the process, the CRC will now bring a formal recommendation to the Wada executive committee, under the chairmanship of Wada president Sir Craig Reedie whose term of office runs until December 31, 2019. The ExCo is scheduled to meet on 9 December to discuss the recommendation.\u201d While the contents of the CRC\u2019s recommendation have not been made public, that they would choose to make one at all suggests they have not had the answers they needed from Russian authorities. If the ExCo confirms the recommendation and Russia appeals, it would be up to the court of arbitration for sport to adjudicate and confirm any eventual punishment. The latest developments will serve to rekindle the controversy over the handling of Russia\u2019s doping infractions. An independent inquiry led by Professor Richard McLaren in 2016 found \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d doping had occurred across multiple sports. Russia was declared non-compliant but the country\u2019s athletes still competed during the 2016 Olympic Games, in Brazil, and Russia hosted the football World Cup in 2018. The country was then reinstated as compliant in September 2018, with access to the Moscow laboratory data one of the conditions laid down.",

And now they want us to think their promises of giving billions to the NHS \u2013 totalling less than that cumulatively lost \u2013 will solve the problems. But the damage done by the neglect of maintenance and loss of staff will take a decade to put right; staff cannot be found overnight.

When managers\u2019 quest for neutrality bans this, how about they write (\u201cname and address supplied\u201d, perhaps) to the Guardian? Then their outline might be researched, contextualised etc and written up for all to read, as in another report in the same edition (NHS shortage of dozens of medicines leading to rationing, leaked files reveal, 18 November). We must know what\u2019s going on in our NHS, and the Guardian is reliable, whereas social media not so much. Dr Jane Frances Cambridge \u2022 Can I suggest those working in the NHS unburden themselves to their friends, who, like reporters in the media, might quote a source close to the NHS. Those friends just might choose to use social media. Dr Philip Scown (non-NHS) Sheffield \u2022 The graph showing the decline in the proportion of A&amp;E patients seen within four hours is very revealing (NHS England\u2019s A&amp;E waiting times worst ever recorded, 15 November). It clearly shows how a slight decline under the coalition steepened considerably after the Tories gained unfettered power in 2015. And now they want us to think their promises of giving billions to the NHS \u2013 totalling less than that cumulatively lost \u2013 will solve the problems. But the damage done by the neglect of maintenance and loss of staff will take a decade to put right; staff cannot be found overnight. As ever, it costs more and achieves less if ongoing needs are left unmet than it does to keep up to date. Michael Miller Sheffield \u2022 A few years ago I had cancer, and when I picked up an infection during chemotherapy an ambulance took me to Brighton A&amp;E. Throughout my cancer, the majority of the staff who cared for me \u2013 from my consultant to the cleaners on the wards \u2013 were born outside the UK; without their care, I would be dead. I see from your report that A&amp;E waiting lists are their worst ever, while the Conservative party is promising to cut immigration. The NHS relies on staff from all over the world. Without immigration, people in Britain will die. Jim Endersby University of Sussex \u2022 In the debate on NHS funding, it\u2019s hard to grasp what the promised billions mean. There is one way to measure how well-funded the NHS is \u2013 comparing global health expenditure. Based upon World Bank data, the UK spends 9.8% of GDP, France 11.5%, Germany 11.1% and the US 17.1%. The NHS has been chronically underfunded and the burden is borne by patients and staff. Prof Colin Pritchard Southampton",

It\u2019s taking the essential steps to build a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. Even the city editor of the Financial Times called the privatisation of water an \u2018organised rip off\u2019. So I understand you are cautious about some of our plans but your businesses, your workers and your consumers have been failed by rip-off energy bills and poor rail and bus services. And I think many of you know that because you know things can\u2019t go on as they are. Meanwhile Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman at the centre of conflict of interest allegations against Boris Johnson, has said she warned the prime minister last week that she would speak out against him after he repeatedly refused to take her calls. Extinction Rebellion activists have begun hunger strikes outside a number of UK political party headquarters to push for more robust policies on tackling the climate emergency in the general election.

      "bodyText": "This election falls between the 101st anniversary of some women winning the right to stand for parliament and the 50th anniversary of the landmark Equal Pay Act. Yet in the outgoing parliament just a third of MPs were women \u2013 4% were black and minority ethnic women. Meanwhile, it will take another 60 years to achieve pay equality for white women, and longer for BME and disabled women. This election season, we are reminded of how far we have come and how far we have to go. Women MPs are leaving politics at an alarming rate too, many because of online abuse. With fewer women in positions of power, issues that disproportionately affect women are at risk of being drowned out. The next government must address these issues, which include unacceptably low rates of rape convictions, and the sharp increase in food bank use. Ministers must acknowledge that women are still taking up the majority of unpaid care work and make up the majority of homeless people, single parents living in poverty and victims/survivors of domestic abuse. For many black, minority ethnic and migrant women, basic rights to maternity care and safe housing remain out of reach and discrimination remains high. That\u2019s why this week we have launched a Manifesto for Women and Girls supported by 29 women and human rights organisations up and down the country. Because we know it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The policies contained in these pages are more than just words on a page: they are the evidence-based approach to building a society where all women, including those further marginalised by race, ethnicity, disability and other characteristics, have access to safety, equality, representation and justice. This election we\u2019re passing on all our years of experience. We\u2019re calling on women and allies everywhere to hold their representatives to account on the decisions that matter most.

The celebrity chef\u2019s food and media empire increased sales to \u00a343.5m in the year to December 2018, but pretax profits almost halved to \u00a37.8m, largely because of a \u00a39.8m one-off charge related to the restaurant business. Speaking about the new openings, Oliver said: \u201cOver the past 20 years, I have travelled around the world to discover exciting flavour combinations, picking up incredible influences along the way. The new restaurants will bring those inspirations to life and serve some of my absolute all-time favourites. Whether you want to grab a quick bite in a relaxed setting, have a proper sit-down meal with friends and family, or grab a drink at the bar, we have created a beautiful space for everyone to enjoy the food I truly love.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the many years that Leon Smith has brought the disparate bits and pieces of British tennis together in a Davis Cup team capable of great things Andy Murray has been the unchallenged centrepiece of the captain\u2019s strategy. That might not be the case here this week. Smith said on Monday as he prepared for the first match in the revamped 18-team World Cup Of Tennis \u2013 on Wednesday against the Netherlands, on the smaller Court 3, curiously \u2013 the three-slam champion will be in the selection mix alongside Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans. \u201cBetween the three of them it\u2019s a conversation,\u201d is Smith\u2019s mildly surprising take on it. \u201cIt\u2019s not between two people. It\u2019s between three people who can all go out and do a job. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been playing very well in practice. The courts are quite quick at altitude and the ball\u2019s moving quickly through the air. For different reasons it suits our players well. So it\u2019s quite an open book for who is going to play on each different day.\u201d He added: \u201cAny time you can bring Andy into the team is going to make your team better. He\u2019s still working his way back to the level he wants to get to, so people have to keep the expectations of the right level of where he\u2019s at just now. He\u2019s making brilliant strides. \u201cWhat he did in Antwerp [where he won his first tournament in nearly two and a half years] was much talked about and a brilliant step forwards but you do have to remember this is early days in him coming back. \u201cWe\u2019ve got really good options. With Andy, with Evo, with Kyle, guys playing a very similar level \u2013 and with Jamie [Murray] and Neal [Skupski] we\u2019ve got strong doubles options. \u201cEqually, the singles guys can play doubles and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to need with this format, especially since we start on Wednesday and we\u2019ll be playing every day if we\u2019re going to be successful. Making use of the squad could be important. \u201cAndy has been our leading figure for so many years now, and was such a massive part of our team. The bottom line is everyone looks up to him. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the players, the support team. He brings a huge amount of energy, experience and quality into the team. Everyone soaks that in.

      "body": "<p>What was most striking about the Duke of York\u2019s interview with Emily Maitlis? It was a toss-up: his views on sex (it\u2019s a \u201cpositive act\u201d for a man, apparently; and if you can\u2019t remember it, ergo it didn\u2019t happen) set off a logical cascade into the abyss (if, by extension, it\u2019s a negative act for women, does that mean we don\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to do it? In which case, are we always, basically, waiting for it to be done?). His line about adrenaline \u2013 that he overdosed on it during the Falklands war, and can therefore no longer sweat \u2013 has triggered a race between medics and picture editors to see who can disprove him fastest. His use of the Pizza Express in Woking as an alibi circa 2001 has generated a lot of mirth (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/17/wokings-pizza-express-customers-struggle-to-remember-first-visit\" title=\"\">check out online reviews since Sunday night</a>). But surely the slam-dunk astonishment lay in what he didn\u2019t say: that he was sorry for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein; or indeed, that he had given them any thought at all.</p> <p>\u201cThere was always something tragicomic to Prince Andrew\u2019s trajectory,\u201d says Catherine Mayer, the author of Charles: The Heart of a King, and co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party. \u201cOr at least it was tragicomic until we found out about his association with Epstein, and then the comedy drained away.\u201d The \u201cplayboy prince\u201d, they called him in the 1990s, after his divorce from Sarah Ferguson; before the marriage, pretty much from the age of 18, he was known as Randy Andy, or as the Daily Mail put it, \u201cRandy Andy and His Web of Armcandy\u201d.</p> <p>Not that the prince would recognise this characterisation. Asked by Maitlis why the public perceived him as \u201cthe party prince\u201d, he told her this was \u201ca bit of a stretch. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve collected that title because I don\u2019t \u2026 I never have really partied.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2277bf18e15a1cbf58346aaed9893f0a7212f9da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2277bf18e15a1cbf58346aaed9893f0a7212f9da/6_130_2580_1548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Koo Stark in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Koo Stark in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Davidson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his youth, though, partying was what second sons were expected to do. As Alan Rusbridger put it in 1986, \u201cthat is the problem with being the younger brother of the heir to the British throne. The press can, on the whole, think of only one interesting thing about you, and that is who you go out with/are destined to marry.\u201d And it was moderately interesting at the time for its sheer variety, and, in retrospect, for the insight that coverage gives to the way society thought about women, men, relationships, class, hierarchy, the lot. What Rusbridger called his \u201cgallery of crumpet\u201d were always described in terms of hair colour \u2013 usually \u201cblond\u201d but occasionally \u201cflame-headed\u201d. There were some weird formulations \u2013 \u201cTracie Lamb, an ex-college girl from Surrey\u201d (you can tell she\u2019s unsuitable, but is it the college or Surrey?), and some much more obvious ones: \u201cmodel\u201d, \u201cformer Miss UK\u201d, \u201cmodel and actress\u201d \u2026</p> <p>\u201cHe particularly enjoyed the friendships of the model and actress Katie Rabett, the actress Finola Hughes and the model Clare Park because of the different worlds they opened up for him,\u201d intoned the Daily Record, which as late as 1996 was still trying to imbue this coverage with respect, portraying the friendships as some kind of cultural safari for the curious mind. Generally speaking, by the time of his separation in 1992, that kind of sycophancy had ebbed away. As Mayer puts it, \u201che very quickly went from being a sort of bachelor prince to being somebody who has no use, no purpose, spends money too obviously, takes too many flights, gets his bad nickname, gets married, gets divorced. He went from being the golden prince to being the embarrassing uncle in a series of very inevitable steps. And that was before he became as embarrassing as he is now.\u201d</p> <p>Even during his heyday, there were multiple tensions to his role, his image and his self-fashioning. To have a shagger in the royal family was hardly a new thing, and the tabloids revelled in the rich history. This is from the Daily Record again: \u201cHis great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, for example, was one of the most celebrated playboys in Europe, dedicating his life to horse racing, yachting, carousing and \u2013 above all \u2013 mistress-bedding\u201d. Prince Andrew\u2019s very existence returned the troubled psyche to simpler times, when mistresses were hunted like stags \u2013 and, hey, maybe being bedded was a trace more empowered than being the other kind of royal female, who just gets to dress in a pie-crust collar and produce young.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37358f6e5a16e2fe531675d05a106bdb51233ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37358f6e5a16e2fe531675d05a106bdb51233ca0/109_401_4236_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Donald Trump and his future wife, Melania, in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Donald Trump and his future wife, Melania, in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Davidoff Studios Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet this was the 80s. So even though Prince Andrew\u2019s relationship with the actor Koo Stark at the start of the decade was mainly a problem for the Queen, according to rumour (of particular concern was the film Cruel Passion, in which Stark\u2019s character gets raped by a peer and two grave diggers, and is savaged by alsatians), there was also an amount of feminist disquiet. I mean, nobody thought that every relationship ought to end in marriage, least of all an 80s feminist. But a relationship with a woman who, never mind a ring on her finger, would probably not be allowed round an aristo dining table \u2026 it looks a tiny bit like using her. As an understanding of women as equals gained ground as the normal way to look at the world, Prince Andrew was increasingly marginal to that.</p> <p>He was redeemed in the mainstream by his stint as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands war, though that generated some stomach-churning brown-nosing: \u201cHis arrival on the scene has given a new meaning to the initials HRH. With Andrew, they stand for His Royal Heart-throb,\u201d is a line biographer Andrew Morton must surely have paid for in self-respect. \u201cWarrior prince\u201d came up a lot, too. So for a while, Prince Andrew was just Classic Royal, maybe a wastrel and a gadabout in peacetime, but a standup guy in a war. And then in 1986 he married, and all the Queen\u2019s qualms were soothed. For about one second.</p> <p>The union with Sarah Ferguson was not an especially happy one \u2013 10 years later, Ferguson joked that she passed the time renting videos while he frolicked with 27 concubines \u2013 but rich people\u2019s unhappy marriages aren\u2019t fundamentally more interesting than regular people\u2019s. When they separated in 1992, their problems became more specific: it was the same year as Charles and Diana separated. Because Andrew and Fergie had always seemed like more of a joke couple, a bit more boisterous, a bit less dignified, and because of the lurid infidelities that surrounded the split (obviously, the toe-sucking stands out \u2013 if you\u2019re too young to remember all this, I would strongly discourage Googling it), theirs seemed more like a comedy subplot to the main tragedy. Yet both divorces represented quite a serious crisis for the royal family. As Mayer explains: \u201cThe monarchy is smoke and mirrors. It exists, and there is a consensus, though a fraying one at this point, because it appears to have a unifying representation of the ideals and values of the nation. So when they started getting divorced, there was a sense that they were reflecting too accurate a portrait of who we really were.\u201d</p> <p>That is even more of a problem when your job is as amorphous as Prince Andrew\u2019s was by 2001: no longer in the navy, he was a roving trade envoy, spreading the amorphous message that Britain was \u2013 God knows, as good as its word? Classy? For sure, his wasn\u2019t a very feelgood life story; but he probably could have weathered these questions of constitutional purpose were he living a life of green wellies and speciality dogs. Instead, he was at the model Heidi Klum\u2019s Halloween party in New York, where the theme was \u201ckinky sex\u201d, according to the Mail. From beaches in Thailand with \u201cbikinied beauties\u201d to \u201cthree-day flirtations with a Playboy pinup\u201d in Los Angeles, there was a pictorial record of a man who has \u201ctrade ambassador\u201d on his lapel, but doesn\u2019t seem terrifically interested in the steel industry, put it that way. Ghislaine Maxwell was always tacitly blamed for introducing him to the \u201cfast set\u201d (he had met the daughter of the disgraced Robert Maxwell while she was at university); obviously, that was before we started blaming her for his friendship with Epstein.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"321ecfe196c0f45a0d638033ac93ae1f3e6cc6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/321ecfe196c0f45a0d638033ac93ae1f3e6cc6c7/32_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Andrew during his BBC interview.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Andrew during his BBC interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the problem was not so much that his behaviour didn\u2019t befit his office, as that it didn\u2019t befit his years. Really, this was no different from his life in the 80s \u2013 it just wore better on a man with a future ahead of him. Yet there was always this catastrophic carelessness, the myopia and indolence of intense privilege commingled with the weird self-pity he seems to have himself brought to the mix. He was known to be not very bright, but there is a distinctive flavour to the stupid things he says. Even without the Maitlis interview. Even if the questions go no deeper, the accusations against the prince himself are never substantiated, and the extent of his knowledge of the crimes of others never proved, Mayer says, \u201cthis much we absolutely know: that he stayed with a convicted child sex offender and he gave cover by doing so. This is how it works. These are the circles that close ranks precisely when they should be open.\u201d</p> <p>In the light of which, all that jollity, all that eye-rolling, all the indulgence of his early public life curdle. It\u2019s such a thin line, isn\u2019t it, between devil-may-care and sociopathy?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Catherine Mayer as the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, when she is its co-founder. The title of a book attributed to her has also been changed.</p>",

But surely the slam-dunk astonishment lay in what he didn\u2019t say: that he was sorry for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein; or indeed, that he had given them any thought at all. \u201cThere was always something tragicomic to Prince Andrew\u2019s trajectory,\u201d says Catherine Mayer, the author of Charles: The Heart of a King, and co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party. \u201cOr at least it was tragicomic until we found out about his association with Epstein, and then the comedy drained away.\u201d The \u201cplayboy prince\u201d, they called him in the 1990s, after his divorce from Sarah Ferguson; before the marriage, pretty much from the age of 18, he was known as Randy Andy, or as the Daily Mail put it, \u201cRandy Andy and His Web of Armcandy\u201d. Not that the prince would recognise this characterisation. Asked by Maitlis why the public perceived him as \u201cthe party prince\u201d, he told her this was \u201ca bit of a stretch. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve collected that title because I don\u2019t \u2026 I never have really partied.\u201d In his youth, though, partying was what second sons were expected to do. As Alan Rusbridger put it in 1986, \u201cthat is the problem with being the younger brother of the heir to the British throne. The press can, on the whole, think of only one interesting thing about you, and that is who you go out with/are destined to marry.\u201d And it was moderately interesting at the time for its sheer variety, and, in retrospect, for the insight that coverage gives to the way society thought about women, men, relationships, class, hierarchy, the lot. What Rusbridger called his \u201cgallery of crumpet\u201d were always described in terms of hair colour \u2013 usually \u201cblond\u201d but occasionally \u201cflame-headed\u201d. There were some weird formulations \u2013 \u201cTracie Lamb, an ex-college girl from Surrey\u201d (you can tell she\u2019s unsuitable, but is it the college or Surrey?), and some much more obvious ones: \u201cmodel\u201d, \u201cformer Miss UK\u201d, \u201cmodel and actress\u201d \u2026 \u201cHe particularly enjoyed the friendships of the model and actress Katie Rabett, the actress Finola Hughes and the model Clare Park because of the different worlds they opened up for him,\u201d intoned the Daily Record, which as late as 1996 was still trying to imbue this coverage with respect, portraying the friendships as some kind of cultural safari for the curious mind. Generally speaking, by the time of his separation in 1992, that kind of sycophancy had ebbed away. As Mayer puts it, \u201che very quickly went from being a sort of bachelor prince to being somebody who has no use, no purpose, spends money too obviously, takes too many flights, gets his bad nickname, gets married, gets divorced. He went from being the golden prince to being the embarrassing uncle in a series of very inevitable steps. And that was before he became as embarrassing as he is now.\u201d Even during his heyday, there were multiple tensions to his role, his image and his self-fashioning. To have a shagger in the royal family was hardly a new thing, and the tabloids revelled in the rich history. This is from the Daily Record again: \u201cHis great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, for example, was one of the most celebrated playboys in Europe, dedicating his life to horse racing, yachting, carousing and \u2013 above all \u2013 mistress-bedding\u201d. Prince Andrew\u2019s very existence returned the troubled psyche to simpler times, when mistresses were hunted like stags \u2013 and, hey, maybe being bedded was a trace more empowered than being the other kind of royal female, who just gets to dress in a pie-crust collar and produce young. Yet this was the 80s. So even though Prince Andrew\u2019s relationship with the actor Koo Stark at the start of the decade was mainly a problem for the Queen, according to rumour (of particular concern was the film Cruel Passion, in which Stark\u2019s character gets raped by a peer and two grave diggers, and is savaged by alsatians), there was also an amount of feminist disquiet. I mean, nobody thought that every relationship ought to end in marriage, least of all an 80s feminist. But a relationship with a woman who, never mind a ring on her finger, would probably not be allowed round an aristo dining table \u2026 it looks a tiny bit like using her. As an understanding of women as equals gained ground as the normal way to look at the world, Prince Andrew was increasingly marginal to that. He was redeemed in the mainstream by his stint as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands war, though that generated some stomach-churning brown-nosing: \u201cHis arrival on the scene has given a new meaning to the initials HRH. With Andrew, they stand for His Royal Heart-throb,\u201d is a line biographer Andrew Morton must surely have paid for in self-respect. \u201cWarrior prince\u201d came up a lot, too. So for a while, Prince Andrew was just Classic Royal, maybe a wastrel and a gadabout in peacetime, but a standup guy in a war. And then in 1986 he married, and all the Queen\u2019s qualms were soothed. For about one second. The union with Sarah Ferguson was not an especially happy one \u2013 10 years later, Ferguson joked that she passed the time renting videos while he frolicked with 27 concubines \u2013 but rich people\u2019s unhappy marriages aren\u2019t fundamentally more interesting than regular people\u2019s. When they separated in 1992, their problems became more specific: it was the same year as Charles and Diana separated. Because Andrew and Fergie had always seemed like more of a joke couple, a bit more boisterous, a bit less dignified, and because of the lurid infidelities that surrounded the split (obviously, the toe-sucking stands out \u2013 if you\u2019re too young to remember all this, I would strongly discourage Googling it), theirs seemed more like a comedy subplot to the main tragedy. Yet both divorces represented quite a serious crisis for the royal family. As Mayer explains: \u201cThe monarchy is smoke and mirrors. It exists, and there is a consensus, though a fraying one at this point, because it appears to have a unifying representation of the ideals and values of the nation. So when they started getting divorced, there was a sense that they were reflecting too accurate a portrait of who we really were.\u201d That is even more of a problem when your job is as amorphous as Prince Andrew\u2019s was by 2001: no longer in the navy, he was a roving trade envoy, spreading the amorphous message that Britain was \u2013 God knows, as good as its word? Classy? For sure, his wasn\u2019t a very feelgood life story; but he probably could have weathered these questions of constitutional purpose were he living a life of green wellies and speciality dogs. Instead, he was at the model Heidi Klum\u2019s Halloween party in New York, where the theme was \u201ckinky sex\u201d, according to the Mail. From beaches in Thailand with \u201cbikinied beauties\u201d to \u201cthree-day flirtations with a Playboy pinup\u201d in Los Angeles, there was a pictorial record of a man who has \u201ctrade ambassador\u201d on his lapel, but doesn\u2019t seem terrifically interested in the steel industry, put it that way. Ghislaine Maxwell was always tacitly blamed for introducing him to the \u201cfast set\u201d (he had met the daughter of the disgraced Robert Maxwell while she was at university); obviously, that was before we started blaming her for his friendship with Epstein. Perhaps the problem was not so much that his behaviour didn\u2019t befit his office, as that it didn\u2019t befit his years. Really, this was no different from his life in the 80s \u2013 it just wore better on a man with a future ahead of him. Yet there was always this catastrophic carelessness, the myopia and indolence of intense privilege commingled with the weird self-pity he seems to have himself brought to the mix. He was known to be not very bright, but there is a distinctive flavour to the stupid things he says. Even without the Maitlis interview. Even if the questions go no deeper, the accusations against the prince himself are never substantiated, and the extent of his knowledge of the crimes of others never proved, Mayer says, \u201cthis much we absolutely know: that he stayed with a convicted child sex offender and he gave cover by doing so. This is how it works. These are the circles that close ranks precisely when they should be open.\u201d In the light of which, all that jollity, all that eye-rolling, all the indulgence of his early public life curdle. It\u2019s such a thin line, isn\u2019t it, between devil-may-care and sociopathy? \u2022 This article was amended on 19 November 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Catherine Mayer as the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, when she is its co-founder. The title of a book attributed to her has also been changed.",

But it\u2019s not true that all politicians lie. Treating all politicians as liars gives a licence for the total collapse of integrity of British politics, a collapse that habitual liars such as Johnson are delighted to exploit.

As with Donald Trump, for Johnson there seems to be no political price to pay for deceit and falsehood. The mainstream media, as Washington\u2019s response to Johnson\u2019s speech shows, prefers to go along with his lies rather than expose them. Recently the hugely experienced broadcaster Andrew Marr allowed Johnson to go unchallenged in saying the Tories \u201cdon\u2019t do deals with other political parties\u201d. What about the coalition government with the Liberal Democrats in 2010? Or the \u00a31bn \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d deal struck with the Democratic Unionist party just two years ago? Marr let Johnson get away with it. So do many others. A big reason for Johnson\u2019s easy ride is partisanship from the parts of the media determined to get him elected. I have talked to senior BBC executives, and they tell me they personally think it\u2019s wrong to expose lies told by a British prime minister because it undermines trust in British politics. Is that a reason for giving Johnson free rein to make any false claim he wants? Others take the view that all politicians lie, and just shrug their shoulders. But it\u2019s not true that all politicians lie. Treating all politicians as liars gives a licence for the total collapse of integrity of British politics, a collapse that habitual liars such as Johnson are delighted to exploit. The British media is not holding him to account for his repeated falsehoods. It\u2019s time we journalists did our job, and started to regain our self-respect. \u2022 Peter Oborne is a journalist, commentator and author.

She said Olympians could share their journeys \u201cand make some much-needed income\u201d. Airbnb and the IOC did not state how much money athletes would be able to charge. Other experiences currently offered by Airbnb include \u00a377-a-person boxing lessons with Keisher \u201cFire\u201d McLeod, a world champion; a prehispanic Shaman renewal ceremony in Mexico for \u00a363 a person; and \u201chorse whispering with an equine therapist\u201d in Barcelona for \u00a370 a person. The Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia refused to respond to questions at the press conference about the company\u2019s tax affairs in the UK. Airbnb, which is valued at up to \u00a332bn, paid less than \u00a3400,000 in UK taxes last year, according to accounts filed at Companies House. It reported UK sales of more than \u00a3300m. This summer 10 European cities demanded more help from the EU in their battle against Airbnb and other holiday rental websites, which they argue are locking locals out of housing and changing the face of neighbourhoods. In a joint letter, representatives of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Krak\u00f3w, Munich, Paris, Valencia and Vienna said the \u201cexplosive growth\u201d of short-stay lettings platforms should be on the agenda of the next set of European commissioners.",

It\u2019s not often something accurate escapes into one of his speeches. He wouldn\u2019t let it happen again.</p> <p>After 20 minutes of verbal nihilism, the CBI president, John Allan, stormed the stage and begged Johnson to stop. Boris took no notice and ploughed on regardless. This was all about him. His needs, his time, his ego.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/lib-dems-and-snp-lose-high-court-bid-over-tv-election-debate\">Lib Dems and SNP lose high court bid over TV election debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you could wind up as soon as you can,\u201d Allan interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cAh, there you are, Allan,\u201d Boris blurted, having not even bothered to learn his host\u2019s name.

Which is to say he went down a storm compared with Johnson. It may be touch and go whether the CBI disliked the probability of a botched Boris Brexit more than the Labour leader\u2019s plans for renationalisation of public services, but at least Corbyn attempted to engage with the things that mattered to them. A soft, customs union and single market Brexit. The need to reskill the workforce. The climate emergency. Inequality of opportunity. They might not agree on the solutions but Corbyn did seem to have his head and heart in the right place. Much more of this and the Labour leader will be confused with a details man.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d said Fairbairn, as Corbyn left to a smattering of applause from those who weren\u2019t still having their stomachs pumped after Johnson\u2019s horror show. \u201cThat\u2019s the aversion therapy training session over. Now go off and have some lunch and then join us for some team bonding with Jo Swinson in the afternoon. Jo\u2019s going to tell you lots of things about cancelling Brexit that you are going to love.\u201d And she did. And they did.

So he chucked in a few businessy things \u2013 cancelling the reduction in corporation tax that he had claimed would increase revenues in order to save \u00a36bn, reducing national insurance contributions for employers by ensuring businesses would have to lay off staff \u2013 before reverting back to slagging off Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cVenezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cThat bit\u2019s true,\u201d he added, surprising himself as well as the hall. It\u2019s not often something accurate escapes into one of his speeches. He wouldn\u2019t let it happen again. After 20 minutes of verbal nihilism, the CBI president, John Allan, stormed the stage and begged Johnson to stop. Boris took no notice and ploughed on regardless. This was all about him. His needs, his time, his ego. \u201cIf you could wind up as soon as you can,\u201d Allan interrupted. \u201cAh, there you are, Allan,\u201d Boris blurted, having not even bothered to learn his host\u2019s name. He carried on regardless. Apprentices were good. Especially ones that taught you IT and could be invited on trade missions. An apprentice to whom he could do what he\u2019d like to do to business. As for immigration, only the brightest and the best would be allowed in. Cabbage pickers with PhDs. Johnson smirked when asked about Prince Andrew and left as gracelessly as he had arrived. Jeremy Corbyn was greeted with mere indifference. Which is to say he went down a storm compared with Johnson. It may be touch and go whether the CBI disliked the probability of a botched Boris Brexit more than the Labour leader\u2019s plans for renationalisation of public services, but at least Corbyn attempted to engage with the things that mattered to them. A soft, customs union and single market Brexit. The need to reskill the workforce. The climate emergency. Inequality of opportunity. They might not agree on the solutions but Corbyn did seem to have his head and heart in the right place. Much more of this and the Labour leader will be confused with a details man. \u201cOK,\u201d said Fairbairn, as Corbyn left to a smattering of applause from those who weren\u2019t still having their stomachs pumped after Johnson\u2019s horror show. \u201cThat\u2019s the aversion therapy training session over. Now go off and have some lunch and then join us for some team bonding with Jo Swinson in the afternoon. Jo\u2019s going to tell you lots of things about cancelling Brexit that you are going to love.\u201d And she did. And they did. The Lib Dems winning at the CBI.

Chris Buxton, the chief executive of the British Fluid Power Association (BFPA), which represents companies that make hydraulic and pneumatic equipment, told Swinson during a question and answer session after her speech that he was drawn to her policies, but the threat of a Corbyn government was driving him toward voting for the Conservative party. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death of a Corbyn government,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak as a remainer when I say I would rather crash out of the EU without a deal than have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10.\u201d",

The data from the EU department Eurostat suggests that only men from the region around theSpanish capital, Madrid, are expected to live as long as the fortunate subset of Londoners. Prof Michael Marmot, a former government adviser and the author of a landmark report on life expectancy in 2010, warned, however, against characterising west London as a place of privilege. \u201cThere is huge inequality,\u201d Marmot said. \u201cAt the time of the Grenfell Tower disaster the median income in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea was \u00a332,700-a-year.

Since life expectancy was first recorded, women around the world have been found to significantly outlive men. Eurostat\u2019s analysis, looking at a three-year period between 2015 and 2017, showed the life expectancy of a newborn male across the EU was 78.1 years but women tended to live 5.4 years more than that. Marmot said the gender life expectancy gap was so common that he believed it could only be explained by a difference in \u201cbiological programming\u201d. \u201cWe expect the ratio of men to women to be 100 to 105 and when we don\u2019t see that, there is trouble,\u201d Marmot said, adding that deviations from that norm could usually be explained by high childbirth mortality levels and mistreatment of women or war and systemic ill health among men. The lowest male life expectancy in the EU was recorded by Eurostat in a region of central and western Lithuania, where men on average died at the age of 69.7. Women can expect to live over 10 years more than their male counterparts in two regions of the country: Sostin\u0117s and Vidurio ir vakar\u0173 Lietuvos \u2013 the largest gap between the sexes recorded. According to the latest World Health Organization data, Lithuanians are the world\u2019s heaviest drinkers. The shortest life expectancy for males in the UK was found in a statistical area of west central Scotland, where men die on average at the age of 75.5, compared to 80 for women in the same area. The narrowest gap between the sexes in the EU was found in Mayotte, a French archipelago in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mozambique. Women in Mayotte live just 1.1 years longer then men. A small gender gap of 2.8 years was also found in the central Dutch region of Flevoland. A gap of three to 3.2 years was recorded in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, Cheshire, and Essex and the Dutch regions of Utrecht, Overijssel, Gelderland, Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland. Last year a statistical analysis of life expectancy in England and Wales suggested males might expect to live as long as women by 2032.

      "body": "<p>The Stadia is nothing short of revolutionary. Its core technology delivers on a promise decades in the making: console-quality gaming, without the console. But revolutions have unpredictable outcomes, leave a trail of destruction in their wake, and have a tendency to destroy those who start them. Will Google be able to see this through?</p> <h2>The streaming</h2> <p>It works! For some, that\u2019s all that matters. Once Stadia is up and running, the system is nearly indistinguishable from playing a game on a console sitting under your TV, except there\u2019s no fan noise, no downloads or discs, and, well, no console.</p> <p>The bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google\u2019s servers over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the same. For \u201cbest performance\u201d, Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every other time, it was perfect.</p> <p>That not only goes for the visual quality, but also for input lag. In a bold show of confidence, the reviewers\u2019 kit for the Stadia includes not only Destiny 2, a fairly fast-paced shooter, but also Mortal Kombat 11, a fighting game that represents a genre where fans count individual frames for advantage. Doubtless, in the hands of a pro, the time lag matters. But, for me, with the reflexes of a short-sighted journalist approaching 30, I couldn\u2019t tell the difference.</p> <p>There are caveats. I have a fairly good internet connection (100Mbps fibre to the home) and a fairly old TV (1080p, non-HDR, and a 5.1 set-up). Google recommends a connection of at least 10Mbps, for Switch-quality visuals \u2013 720p with stereo output \u2013 and 35Mbps for full HDR 4K. I also don\u2019t have a bandwidth cap on my internet, which is for the best, since you can plausibly expect to churn through at least 10GB an hour if streaming at the highest quality.</p> <p>Things are shakier, too, if you move off the Chromecast. Mortal Kombat was stuttering when played in handheld mode.</p> <h2>The controller</h2> <p>Only two pieces of hardware come in the box: a Chromecast Ultra, and the Stadia\u2019s controller. The Ultra\u2019s not new, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/chromecast-ultra\">is a fairly solid streaming stick in its own right</a> \u2013 which is good because you have to use it for the Stadia to stream to your TV. In fact, you have to use the one in the box, since it\u2019s running special firmware. A software update is coming for the rest, Google says.</p> <p>So, when it comes to hardware, the Stadia <em>is</em> its controller. And it\u2019s fine. It looks a bit like a fake prop knocked up for a BBC TV show that was a bit too strict about the rules for product placement, but the triggers feel nice, the buttons click and don\u2019t stick, and it doesn\u2019t waste resources on gimmicks such as motion sensitivity or a whopping great touchpad. Instead, the notable feature of the controller, alongside the standard gameplay buttons, are a pair offering tight integration to Google\u2019s other services: one that launches Google Assistant, and one that can be configured to instantly share a live stream to YouTube.</p> <p>Except, not yet.

      "bodyText": "The Stadia is nothing short of revolutionary. Its core technology delivers on a promise decades in the making: console-quality gaming, without the console. But revolutions have unpredictable outcomes, leave a trail of destruction in their wake, and have a tendency to destroy those who start them. Will Google be able to see this through? The streaming It works! For some, that\u2019s all that matters. Once Stadia is up and running, the system is nearly indistinguishable from playing a game on a console sitting under your TV, except there\u2019s no fan noise, no downloads or discs, and, well, no console. The bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google\u2019s servers over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the same. For \u201cbest performance\u201d, Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every other time, it was perfect. That not only goes for the visual quality, but also for input lag. In a bold show of confidence, the reviewers\u2019 kit for the Stadia includes not only Destiny 2, a fairly fast-paced shooter, but also Mortal Kombat 11, a fighting game that represents a genre where fans count individual frames for advantage. Doubtless, in the hands of a pro, the time lag matters. But, for me, with the reflexes of a short-sighted journalist approaching 30, I couldn\u2019t tell the difference. There are caveats. I have a fairly good internet connection (100Mbps fibre to the home) and a fairly old TV (1080p, non-HDR, and a 5.1 set-up). Google recommends a connection of at least 10Mbps, for Switch-quality visuals \u2013 720p with stereo output \u2013 and 35Mbps for full HDR 4K. I also don\u2019t have a bandwidth cap on my internet, which is for the best, since you can plausibly expect to churn through at least 10GB an hour if streaming at the highest quality. Things are shakier, too, if you move off the Chromecast. Mortal Kombat was stuttering when played in handheld mode. The controller Only two pieces of hardware come in the box: a Chromecast Ultra, and the Stadia\u2019s controller. The Ultra\u2019s not new, and is a fairly solid streaming stick in its own right \u2013 which is good because you have to use it for the Stadia to stream to your TV. In fact, you have to use the one in the box, since it\u2019s running special firmware. A software update is coming for the rest, Google says. So, when it comes to hardware, the Stadia is its controller. And it\u2019s fine. It looks a bit like a fake prop knocked up for a BBC TV show that was a bit too strict about the rules for product placement, but the triggers feel nice, the buttons click and don\u2019t stick, and it doesn\u2019t waste resources on gimmicks such as motion sensitivity or a whopping great touchpad. Instead, the notable feature of the controller, alongside the standard gameplay buttons, are a pair offering tight integration to Google\u2019s other services: one that launches Google Assistant, and one that can be configured to instantly share a live stream to YouTube. Except, not yet. Neither of the features actually existed on the reviewers\u2019 units. Google says a software update that should enable them is coming. The games Ooof. Stadia is launching with one solitary exclusive: the charming but uninspiring Gylt, which looks like Coraline and plays like Metal Gear Solid.

Foster\u2019s strongly worded intervention comes as a new poll suggests a majority of voters in Tasmania are opposed to the Morrison government\u2019s plan to scrap the medevac procedures. Peter Dutton wants to repeal the medical transfer procedures for unwell asylum seekers passed by the parliament while the Coalition governed in minority in 2018. But the government will not be able to proceed with that plan unless the Tasmanian independent senator Jacqui Lambie agrees, and votes to scrap the regime. With only two parliamentary sitting weeks remaining before the summer break, the UComms poll of 1,136 Tasmanian voters, funded by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, suggests there is majority support in the state for keeping the current medevac policy, with 63% in favour and 27% backing repeal. The survey says 10% are unsure of how to proceed. Foster, who intervened forcefully earlier this year to assist the Australian refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi after he was arrested at Bangkok airport, told Guardian Australia he had met refugees in Port Moresby recently and found people who had suffered horribly. \u201cThe physical and psychological torment from almost seven years of detention is difficult for most of us to truly understand,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI implore anyone involved to uphold the basic right of humans to access adequate care.\u201d He said parliamentarians needed to understand firsthand the harm that was being inflicted before they moved to wind back protections. \u201cAnyone ruling on the lives of detainees should, at a minimum, travel to PNG and Nauru to meet them and see the devastation first hand. \u201cI invite all MPs to come with me to meet those directly affected by our decisions \u2013 there are real people at the end of each clause, flesh and blood resting on every vote.\u201d It was expected the repeal vote would be brought on last week, when the Senate sat in Canberra, but the government, while trying to build the public case for repeal, has so far not forced the vote. Lambie has previously warned the government against launching pre-emptive action. The final sitting weeks for 2019 begin next Monday. The medevac laws allow for Australian-based doctors to recommend a refugee or asylum seeker offshore be transferred to Australia for care. The minister can refuse if he disagrees with the clinical assessment \u2013 in which case it goes to the independent medical panel for review \u2013 or on security or criminal grounds. The panel cannot override vetoes based on security or criminal concerns. Labor, the Greens, key crossbenchers and most relevant stakeholders, including the medical profession, have opposed a repeal of the laws. There has been concern among refugee advocates that the medical transfer process has been slowed as the Morrison government has counted down the weeks until it can attempt to repeal the medevac regime. The doctors overseeing the transfer of asylum seekers to Australia for medical treatment have also raised concerns about delays in their advice being presented to Dutton, in the latest official snapshot of activity under the medevac regime. As well as the complaint that advice isn\u2019t getting to Dutton quickly enough, the Independent Health Advice Panel (IHAP) has also flagged concerns about the lack of in-person interpreters available for transferees \u2013 \u201cespecially those with mental health issues\u201d \u2013 and about \u201clack of movement from Nauru when the panel has recommended transfer to Australia\u201d.

The IPA says its YouTube film, Beige Reef, is a \u201cmust watch\u201d because it shows healthy Acropora corals living at Stone Island, near Bowen. This, the film claims, is in a place where a study published in 2016 claimed all those corals had died. But Dr Tara Clark, of the University of Wollongong, says the film\u2019s central claim is wrong because her 2016 study did not make any such statement and the IPA\u2019s film had focused on a different location. Clark told Guardian Australia: \u201cOur work has clearly been misrepresented.\u201d The IPA, which has been heavily funded by the mining magnate Gina Rinehart, is known for promoting fringe views on human-caused climate change. Study never claimed no coral present in 2012 In the film, the IPA\u2019s Dr Jennifer Marohasy claims the study, appearing in the journal Scientific Reports, reported that \u201cthere are no longer any Acropora at Stone Island\u201d before showing footage taken from her filming expedition. \u201cThis claim is of course irreconcilable with what we saw,\u201d she says in the film, which has been promoted by the Sky News commentator Andrew Bolt and the Liberal MP Craig Kelly. Clark\u2019s paper does reference a visit to the site in 1994 by Dr David Wachenfeld, now the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and a co-author on the study, and states that \u201cno living Acropora colonies\u201d were present at Stone Island at that time. This is the section of text highlighted by the IPA in the film. But Clark said the surveys of Stone Island for her 2016 study were conducted in 2012 and the information presented in the video had been misinterpreted. \u201cFor example, we never claimed that there were no Acropora corals present in 2012,\u201d she said. The paper states that in 2012, in a deeper area from the reef flat, \u201cliving tabular Acropora [species] and Porites [species] colonies were occasionally found\u201d. Clark said: \u201cMarohasy\u2019s interpretation of [my 2016 paper] is incorrect.\u201d Clark said the two main aims of the study were to revisit the precise locations of historic photographs taken around 1890 \u2013 sites revisited by Wachenfeld in 1994 \u2013 and to test a method to date the death of corals. IPA video was filmed in a different location Clark also said her study was conducted \u201cin a different location and environment\u201d to Marohasy\u2019s film, \u201cmaking it a little like comparing apples and oranges\u201d. Marohasy\u2019s filming had taken place over subtidal reefs rather than over the reef flats that were the focus of her study, Clark said. The 13-minute IPA video features drone and underwater footage from a chartered boat trip to Stone Island, with extensive commentary from Marohasy. In a separate video promoting Beige Reef, the IPA\u2019s policy director, Gideon Rozner, says what Marohasy found \u201crefutes a key claim\u201d in Clark\u2019s paper \u201cthat there are no living colonies of Acropora coral at all\u201d.\u2019 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rozner says: \u201cThe suggestion that the Great Barrier reef is dying is based on claims like this from the Nature paper. If this is wrong then what else are they wrong about?\u201d (Rozner and Marohasy say the study appeared in the \u201cprestigious journal Nature\u201d but in fact the study appeared in Scientific Reports.) Associate Professor Andrew Hoey, of James Cook University\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said: \u201cConcluding the reef is fine from a single visit to one section of one reef is ludicrous, and is akin to visiting a house that is left standing after a natural disaster (earthquake, tsunami, bushfire) and concluding there has been no damage. \u201cImportantly the video [the IPA] show is of areas of subtidal reef, yet the study by Clark and others describes changes on the intertidal reef flat,\u201d he said. Misleading claims about coral bleaching Hoey added that a separate claim in the video that no bleached corals had been found was misleading, because \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t expect to see any unless that area was experiencing an extended period of elevated temperatures at that time\u201d. He said: \u201cThe majority of corals that bleached on the GBR in 2016 and 2017 died shortly after and were subsequently covered by algae within a few weeks.\u201d The Liberal MP Craig Kelly shared the IPA video on his Facebook page, with the heading \u201cYET ANOTHER CLIMATE ALARMIST LIE DEBUNKED.\u201d Kelly wrote: \u201cEverytime their lips are moving, those from the climate alarmist industry are peddling lies trying to recruit the naive and gullible to act as their useful idiots.\u201d At the end of the video, a credit says the film was \u201cproduced with financial support from the B.Macfie Family Foundation\u201d. In a response to questions from Guardian Australia, Marohasy pointed to sections of Clark\u2019s study that she said backed her claim. She said that Clark and colleagues \u201ctook just two transects each of 20 metres at Stone Island\u201d and stated in the study that \u201conly nine dead corals were found along transects 1 and 2, and that these corals were covered in mud and algae.\u201d She claimed Clark and colleagues had drawn \u201cerroneous conclusions\u201d from those transects. Responding, Clark said the reason they described the numbers of dead corals they found was because they were specifically seeking dead samples to test a dating method. Marohasy admitted the location of her filming was \u201cjust around the headland from the location of the two transects\u201d but said she was planning further films that would show more live corals. Arguments over what conclusions could be drawn from the 1890 and 1994 Stone Island photographs were the catalyst for the censuring and then sacking of the James Cook University academic Dr Peter Ridd, who had complained about their use. With the IPA\u2019s backing, Ridd successfully sued his old university, which is appealing the case.",

The talented young forward, a four-time Matilda making her first professional appearance, led Adelaide\u2019s line in the No 9 shirt.</p> <p>Before kick-off, questions were asked as to how she might make the step up to full-time senior football at such a tender age, how she would adapt to the demands of the W-League. She gave an emphatic answer with her first W-League goal after just 39 minutes.</p> <p>The second Alex Huynh left out out her leg in an attempt to prevent the nimble Fowler from advancing any further into the penalty area, there was no question as to who would be charged with taking the spot kick. Composure personified as she shouldered on the responsibility, Fowler took the honour of becoming the first goalscorer of the new season. </p> <p>For Fowler, opening her professional account relieves the pressure to some extent. The teenager has made no bones about the fact that she is here to score goalsand an attack is being built around her own prodigious potential. How that will manifest as the season progresses remains to be seen, but what cannot go unnoticed for now is how she threatened the Wanderers back line throughout Thursday\u2019s game. It was a a warning to the rest of the W-League. Mary Fowler is here. Take note.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31a685807679cc1e9acb5c675cb8cf98b7166e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31a685807679cc1e9acb5c675cb8cf98b7166e0/0_0_3793_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Fowler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Fowler looks to get a shot off at Marconi Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Hemmings/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Sunday, as the 19th edition of the W-League\u2019s Big Blue entered its 86th minute, there was little chance of Sydney FC letting the game slip from their fingers with a two-goal buffer and only minutes left on the clock. Having shown themselves to have recruited astutely during the off-season, , Sydney could have directed the ball to the corners and managed the game until the clock hit 90.</p> <p>Cue Evans, who entered the fray to make only her second W-League appearance, replacing the returning Remy Siemsen, whose two goals had put the defending champions into a match-winning position. With no pressure on her shoulders \u2013 Siemson\u2019s first half efforts had ensured that \u2013 Evans had the freedom to announce herself to the game any way she liked.</p> <p>And so she did. Evans\u2019s first act was to latch onto a ball pumped down the right wing, making herself a thorn in the side of American defender Emily Menges, as she cleverly used her body to dispossess the American and then turn the recently capped Matilda Jenna McCormick, to make her first foray into the penalty area. Evans\u2019s own warning sounded out: she too is here to play.</p> <p>Then, as she ghosted between Emma Robers and Haley Hanson to meet Angelique Hristodoulou\u2019s 92nd minute cross, there was a hint of inevitability about the outcome. Evans\u2019s celebration was something to behold as she wheeled away in an exuberant expression of pure, unbridled delight. In that instance there was more than something reminiscent of the unadulterated joy Kerr expresses in her own goals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/nov/17/sportwatch-w-league-and-a-league-big-blue-double-header-and-more-live\">Sportwatch: Sydney FC claim Big Blue double-header, Roar beat City - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both moments, both goals, could have import beyond the context of games in which they were scored.</p> <p>Ultimately, Fowler\u2019s goal counted for nought on the night, as Adelaide succumbed 2-1 to Western Sydney; and Sydney, mathematically, didn\u2019t need Evans\u2019s strike as Victory were already well beaten. </p> <p>In their own discrete moments, neither youngsters\u2019 goals meant much in the immediacy of the match, yet therein lies the pure, uncomplicated joy and significance of such moments, confined as they are to the seconds in which they occur.</p> <p>As more young players grace W-League pitches and experience the rush of scoring their first goals, in a season where many teams are rebuilding, more moments like these will undoubtedly emerge.

The storylines thrown up by these opening exchanges \u2013 the face-off between last season\u2019s premiers and champions in this year\u2019s first Big Blue; a club legend returning to her old stomping ground in new colours; the blooding in of new import players \u2013 wrenched attentions immediately back onto the league and the players still in it.

Sixteen-year-old Fowler, Kerr\u2019s heir apparent, featured in the first \u201cHersday\u201d fixture of the season as Western Sydney Wanderers hosted Adelaide United. The talented young forward, a four-time Matilda making her first professional appearance, led Adelaide\u2019s line in the No 9 shirt. Before kick-off, questions were asked as to how she might make the step up to full-time senior football at such a tender age, how she would adapt to the demands of the W-League. She gave an emphatic answer with her first W-League goal after just 39 minutes. The second Alex Huynh left out out her leg in an attempt to prevent the nimble Fowler from advancing any further into the penalty area, there was no question as to who would be charged with taking the spot kick. Composure personified as she shouldered on the responsibility, Fowler took the honour of becoming the first goalscorer of the new season. For Fowler, opening her professional account relieves the pressure to some extent. The teenager has made no bones about the fact that she is here to score goalsand an attack is being built around her own prodigious potential. How that will manifest as the season progresses remains to be seen, but what cannot go unnoticed for now is how she threatened the Wanderers back line throughout Thursday\u2019s game. It was a a warning to the rest of the W-League. Mary Fowler is here. Take note. On Sunday, as the 19th edition of the W-League\u2019s Big Blue entered its 86th minute, there was little chance of Sydney FC letting the game slip from their fingers with a two-goal buffer and only minutes left on the clock. Having shown themselves to have recruited astutely during the off-season, , Sydney could have directed the ball to the corners and managed the game until the clock hit 90. Cue Evans, who entered the fray to make only her second W-League appearance, replacing the returning Remy Siemsen, whose two goals had put the defending champions into a match-winning position. With no pressure on her shoulders \u2013 Siemson\u2019s first half efforts had ensured that \u2013 Evans had the freedom to announce herself to the game any way she liked. And so she did. Evans\u2019s first act was to latch onto a ball pumped down the right wing, making herself a thorn in the side of American defender Emily Menges, as she cleverly used her body to dispossess the American and then turn the recently capped Matilda Jenna McCormick, to make her first foray into the penalty area. Evans\u2019s own warning sounded out: she too is here to play. Then, as she ghosted between Emma Robers and Haley Hanson to meet Angelique Hristodoulou\u2019s 92nd minute cross, there was a hint of inevitability about the outcome. Evans\u2019s celebration was something to behold as she wheeled away in an exuberant expression of pure, unbridled delight. In that instance there was more than something reminiscent of the unadulterated joy Kerr expresses in her own goals. Both moments, both goals, could have import beyond the context of games in which they were scored. Ultimately, Fowler\u2019s goal counted for nought on the night, as Adelaide succumbed 2-1 to Western Sydney; and Sydney, mathematically, didn\u2019t need Evans\u2019s strike as Victory were already well beaten. In their own discrete moments, neither youngsters\u2019 goals meant much in the immediacy of the match, yet therein lies the pure, uncomplicated joy and significance of such moments, confined as they are to the seconds in which they occur. As more young players grace W-League pitches and experience the rush of scoring their first goals, in a season where many teams are rebuilding, more moments like these will undoubtedly emerge. And as one superstar departs the W-League, others are nascent and beginning to sparkle.",

      "bodyText": "The gross state product figures for the 2018-19 financial year reveal that Tasmania, the ACT and Victoria were the strongest-performing states and territories, but that the weakness in the national economy is widespread and so too is the stagnation of household living standards. While we get the Australian GDP figures every three months, we only get the gross state product figures once a year. The quarterly GDP figures only provide us with what is known as state final demand. Essentially, that is all the production and consumption that occurs within the state, but does not count trade \u2013 either international or interstate. As you can imagine, for a state like Western Australia trade makes a big difference. In 2018-19 for example, WA\u2019s state final demand fell 1.2% but its overall economy grew 1%. But in 2018-19 the big economic performer was Tasmania. Its economy grew 3.6% \u2013well above the next best performing state, Victoria, and just under double the 1.9% growth of the Australian economy: Even when taking into account population growth, Tasmania remains the best-performing state or territory, with the ACT and Victoria in second place. The figures, however, show the overall slowing of the national economy. Every state and territory saw its economy grow slower on a per capita basis in 2018-19 than it did the previous year: But when we look at the overall contribution to the growth of the national economy, we really see where the strength lies. Victoria\u2019s economy accounts for 23% of Australia GDP, and yet it contributed 37% of the growth in the nation\u2019s economy \u2013 vastly ahead of any other state, including the much larger NSW economy: In a sense Victoria made up for the poor performance of Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia \u2013 all of which underperformed. But pound for pound, Tasmania was again the strongest performer \u2013 its economy is just 1.6% of GDP and yet it contributed 3.2% of the GDP growth \u2013 nearly double the expected amount. These overall figures, however, hide somewhat the underlying health of each state\u2019s economy. It has become clear over the past year that increased government spending has been vital to keeping the economy afloat. The contribution of government spending and investment to GDP growth is now nearing the levels that occurred during the GFC. In the 2018-19 financial year, the public sector contributed half of the growth of Australian GDP, despite only being around a quarter of the actual economy. In NSW, more than 60% of the state\u2019s growth came from the public sector \u2013 nearly three times the amount that would be expected given the size of the public sector in that state: From this we can see that NSW, Queensland and Tasmania were the states most dependent upon the public sector for growth, and Victoria and Western Australia were the least dependent. Thus when we look at the growth of the private sector, rather than overall GSP, Victoria is the strongest state, and NSW falls below the national average: Where there is also widespread weakness is household living standards. Every state has seen real gross household disposable income fall at least once in the past four years on a per capita basis, and the nation overall has had falling household living standards now for four consecutive years: National household living standards in 2018-19 were actually below what they were in 2011-12, and this was broadly the case across all states. Only South Australia and Tasmania had higher levels of household disposable income per capita in 2018-19 than they did in 2011-12: The GSP figures highlight the big problems the Australian economy is currently facing. Unlike in previous years when we had a two-speed economy, with the mining and non-mining states taking it in turns being the ones growing fast, now we mostly have a one speed economy \u2013 and that speed is slow. And while exports are largely ensuring we are nowhere near a recession, the weakness of the private sector across all states and the need for government spending \u2013 both state and federal \u2013 to do more than its share highlights how fragile the economy across the nation remains. And it is a large reason why household living standards remain completely stagnant. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

John Lever, a Rockhampton businessman who runs the Koorana Crocodile Farm in central Queensland, received the grant to build crocodile-rearing pens aimed at improving the quality and value of leather for export. Lever ran for the Nationals in the 2001 and 2004 federal elections as the candidate for the seat of Capricornia, which is now held by the Nationals MP Michelle Landry. In the run-up to this year\u2019s election, Landry visited the farm with a cohort of LNP senators, including candidates Paul Scarr and Susan McDonald, to promote the grant, and filmed an advertisement with Lever talking up the $220m regional jobs and investment packages. The RJIP program was the subject of a damning auditor general report released earlier this month, and has seen dozens of projects receive funding against the recommendations of the department. According to the audit, ministers declined to fund 28% of grant applications recommended to them by officials, and approved 17% of applications that had not been recommended to them. The grant to the crocodile farm, through the company Farnmont Pty Ltd, was announced in March 2018. However, the media event to promote the package took place 12 months later in March this year \u2013 just eight weeks before the election. Capricornia was the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seat, held by Landry on a margin of just 0.6%. Landry and Scarr both promoted the visit on their social media pages. According to local media coverage at the time, the visit was to \u201ccheck on the progress of the funding\u201d, with Landry saying the project had \u201cfacilitated\u201d eight jobs as the grant was spent and created three permanent jobs at the farm. Guardian Australia reported on Monday that the top eight projects recommended for funding in another Queensland region based on the department\u2019s merit-based scoring system were all rejected by the ministerial panel overseeing the scheme. However, in the same region, two known political donors to the LNP were among those that successfully secured funding. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It is not known if the crocodile farm project was among those recommended by the department for funding, as the government is refusing to release the documentation underpinning the grant decisions. Guardian Australia can also reveal that another federal government grant under the regional jobs and investment packages scheme went to a New South Wales south coast termite and building inspector to develop an online building course and app, which is yet to be delivered. The $82,000 grant to Property Works Pty Ltd, trading as Surety Property, was made under the RJIP\u2019s business innovation stream, with the project to \u201ccreate an online course and app for buyers of properties and for those building for the first time\u201d. Under the guidelines for the grant, applicants were required to commit to being able to commence work within 12 weeks of the grant agreement being executed. Applicants also needed to outline how many full-time jobs would be created and the level of net economic benefit the project would create for the region. The Property Works director, Bruce Cohen, would not comment on the status of the project when contacted by Guardian Australia on Monday, saying it was a \u201cprivate\u201d matter. \u201cWe are working with the government on it and I am not going to discuss it,\u201d Cohen said. According to the Surety Property website, the company is run by Cohen and his wife, Sharlene, with promotional material saying they are \u201cbuilding and termite specialists\u201d. Guardian Australia has reported on a host of other projects that have raised questions about the rigour of the application process, including another project in the south coast region of NSW that attempted to raise money through a fish-based cryptocurrency. A Gilmore-based campervan company also won a grant while it was possibly trading insolvent, while in Queensland a ferry project that received a grant is losing money and unlikely to happen for two more years. Labor is calling on the government to release details of which projects were approved against the advice of the department, and has asked parliament\u2019s audit committee to delve into the scheme\u2019s administration.",

Its oriental pastels and concrete floors speak of a zoo as a place of oddities from far-flung places. A place for gawking and gift shops. Which, of course, it was. \u201cIt\u2019s not a history that anyone\u2019s particularly proud of today,\u201d says Cameron Kerr, chief executive of Taronga Conservation Society, which runs Taronga zoo and Western Plains zoo.

Entertainment remains important, but its form has changed. A little way from the old elephant temple (no longer used by elephants) is the zoo\u2019s newest exhibit, the Sumatran tiger enclosure. To enter, visitors must first board a virtual cargo plane flight to Way Kambas national park, in Indonesia, during which they look out the windows to see deforestation caused by the palm oil industry and listen to an Indonesian guide extoll the virtues of sustainable palm oil and the personal responsibility of visitors to shop ethically. Visitors wind through the green exhibit, clustering at vantage points to see the three tiger cubs and adults sleep and stalk. Before they leave, they pass through a mock supermarket where they can check the WWF palm oil rating of a range of foods, and then send an email lobbying brands to do better.

      "body": "<p>Earlier today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/nov/18/can-you-solve-it-the-two-child-problem\">I set you the following four questions</a>:</p> <p><strong>1. Mrs Smith has two children. The eldest one is a boy. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys.</strong></p> <p><strong>2. Mrs Jones has two children. At least one is a boy. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Mrs Robinson has two children. At least one is a boy born on a Monday. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Mrs Taylor has two children. At least one is a boy called Oscar. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p>(Assume Mrs Smith, Jones, Robinson and Taylor are each chosen randomly from the population of families with exactly two children. The phrase \u2018at least one is a boy\u2019 is understood in the literal sense, i.e. in this case either one child is a boy, or both children are boys.)</p> <p>The answers are: <strong>1. </strong>1/2 or 50 per cent, <strong>2.</strong> 1/3 or 33.3 per cent, <strong>3. </strong>13/27 or about 48 per cent, <strong>4. </strong>very very close to 1/2 or 50 per cent</p> <p>Yes, the answers are all different. It does make a difference when you mention the child\u2019s day of birth, or name.</p> <p>We\u2019ll get to the workings later. First, the results of the questionnaire I asked parents of exactly two children to fill in.</p> <p>1. Two child families where eldest child is a boy. Total submissions: 4949. Of these families, the percentage with two boys was 44.9 per cent.</p> <p>2. Two child families where at least one child is a boy. Total submissions: 6060. Of these families, the percentage with two boys was 39.5 per cent.</p> <p>3. Two child families where at least one child is a boy born on a Monday. Of these families, the percentage with two boys was 54.0 per cent.</p> <p>4. Two child families where eldest child is a boy named Oscar. Total submissions: 1961. Of these families, the percentage with two boys was 55.6 per cent.</p> <p>In an ideal world, in which two-parent families are selected genuinely randomly, in large enough numbers and respond truthfully, we\u2019d expect the percentages of \u2018families with two boys\u2019 to approximate the answers to the questions.</p> <p>And they sort of do. [There is a large margin of error, but, pleasingly, <strong>2 </strong>is closest to 33 per cent, and the others all hover around 50 per cent. A surprising percentage of total respondents have sons called Oscar, although I guess I did, shamelessly and unscientifically, suggest you could submit for friends who had a son called Oscar.]</p> <p>Most people find it hard to believe that the probabilities change when you mention the week day or name. I hope the questionnaire might give a little insight as to why it might be the case.</p> <p>Let\u2019s now get to the nitty gritty. In the proofs below, we are assuming that the chance of a boy or a girl is 50/50. And also that the chance of being born on any day of the week is equal. (Neither of these might be true, as readers have said BTL.)</p> <p><strong>1. Mrs Smith has two children. The eldest one is a boy. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys.</strong></p> <p>If the eldest one is a boy, the youngest one is either a boy or a girl, with a 50/50 chance of each. So the chance both are boys is 1 in 2, or 50 per cent.</p> <p><strong>2. Mrs Jones has two children. At least one is a boy. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p>If at least one is a boy, there are three possible equally likely gender-assignations of two siblings. boy-boy, boy-girl, or girl-boy. Only 1 in 3 cases, or 33 per cent are both boys. The lesson here is that when considering equally likely scenarios we must consider birth order. If the birth order of the boy is not specified \u2013 i.e. if we don\u2019t know if he is the eldest or the youngest \u2013 the probability of two boys drops to 1 in 3.</p> <p><strong>3. Mrs Robinson has two children. At least one is a boy born on a Monday. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p>There are many ways to solve this. I think the easiest to understand is by considering frequencies. Imagine selecting 196 two-children families at random. (It will later become clear why I chose this number).</p> <p>We\u2019d expect the following frequencies of the four possible pairs of siblings, BB, BG, GB, GG, because each of the four sets is equally likely. (B is boy, G is girl. Eldest child is first one, youngest child is second one)</p> <ul> <li><p>BG 49</p></li> <li><p>GB 49</p></li> <li><p>BB 49</p></li> <li><p>GG 49</p></li> </ul> <p>Now let B<sub>M </sub>be a boy born on a Monday, and B<sub>NM</sub> be a boy not born on a Monday. Our expected frequencies become</p> <ul> <li><p>B<sub>M</sub>G 7</p></li> <li><p>BN<sub>M</sub>G 42</p></li> <li><p>GB<sub>M </sub>7</p></li> <li><p>GBN<sub>M</sub> 42</p></li> <li><p>B<sub>M</sub>B<sub>M </sub>1</p></li> <li><p>B<sub>NM</sub>B<sub>M</sub> 6</p></li> <li><p>B<sub>M</sub>B<sub>NM</sub> 6</p></li> <li><p>B<sub>NM</sub>B<sub>NM</sub> 36</p></li> <li><p>GG 49</p></li> </ul> <p>The number of families with a boy born on a Monday is 7 + 7 + 1 + 6 + 6 = 27. Of these, 13 have two boys, so the probability of having two boys is 13/27, which is about 48 per cent.</p> <p><strong>4. Mrs Taylor has two children. At least one is a boy called Oscar. What\u2019s the chance that both are boys?</strong></p> <p>Here the unknown is the chance of a boy being called Oscar. I\u2019d say, even among Guardian readers, it is going to be quite low. Say, 1 in 500 boys. We now do the same calculation as in part <strong>3</strong> but instead of a 1/7 chance of a particular day, there is a 1/500 of a particular name. The result is going to be very close <em>but not equal to </em>1 in 2. (If anyone wants to fill in the dots of the calculation below, please do.)</p> <p>To summarise, when no information is specified apart from the child\u2019s gender (part <strong>2</strong>) the chances of two boys is 33 per cent. The more information that is supplied about the child \u2013 such as day of birth (part <strong>3)</strong>, and name (part <strong>4)</strong> \u2013 the more the chances of two boys approaches 50 per cent. When birth order is specified (part <strong>1)</strong>, the chances are exactly 50 per cent.</p> <p>Some mathematicians love this problem, because the answer is so counter-intuitive. Others don\u2019t like it, because they feel the language is misleading, or that there is no realistic situation when anyone would ever meaningfully state that \u2018at least one\u2019 of their children is a boy.

It would be better if he didn\u2019t repeat them all again, although he could probably get away with it. Such was the effect of the barrage of Beatles\u2019 hits last time, that the crowd chose to ignore his between-song patter (a lot of \u201chey wow man\u201d stuff about ley lines, his vision of Glastonbury apparently having been fixed in the early 70s) and instead streamed away from the Pyramid stage still singing en masse the refrain from Hey Jude. It would be a brave person who bet against something similar happening this time around.",

The body of 14-year-old Elsie Frost was found at the bottom of some steps by a railway bridge in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on 9 October 1965. Within days, Peter Pickering \u2013 who later became notorious as the \u201cBeast of Wombwell\u201d after he committed a brutal attack in a town near Barnsley \u2013 was identified as a likely suspect but police could not trace him, the inquest at Wakefield coroner\u2019s court heard. Two months later, another man, Ian Spencer, was charged with her murder but was eventually cleared \u2013 leaving the case unsolved for nearly 50 years, the inquest was told. The new inquest into Elsie\u2019s death is being held after her siblings, Anne Cleave and Colin Frost, campaigned successfully for a fresh review. It comes after West Yorkshire police revealed that Pickering was close to being charged with Elsie\u2019s murder at the time of his death in March last year. Cleave spoke of her anger that the case had been left \u201cin limbo\u201d following the exoneration of Ian Spencer in March 1966 \u2013 leaving Pickering free to go on to murder 14-year-old Shirley Boldy and kidnap and rape an 18-year-old woman in Wombwell in 1972.

And while recorded police pat-downs and rough-ups have started to decline, they are disproportionately increasing for black people, up to 52% in 2016, 57% in 2017 and 2018, and 60% in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data\">according</a> to the New York Civil Liberties Union.

In 1966, James Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/report-occupied-territory/\">wrote</a> movingly in A Report from Occupied Territory about what it means to live under stop-and-frisk policies as a black person: \u201cThe police are afraid of everything in Harlem and they are especially afraid of the roofs, which they consider to be guerrilla outposts. This means that the citizens of Harlem who, as we have seen, can come to grief at any hour in the streets, and who are not safe at their windows, are forbidden the very air. They are safe only in their houses \u2013 or were, until the city passed the No Knock, Stop and Frisk laws, which permit a policeman to enter one\u2019s home without knocking and to stop anyone on the streets, at will, at any hour, and search him.

In that case, incidentally, I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little. It\u2019s exactly the reverse of what they\u2019re saying.

Written in 1830, when Charlotte was 14, it is part of a series of six produced by the author in her teens. Only five are known to have survived, with one missing since around 1930.</p> <p>The book will go to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum, the former family home in Haworth, Yorkshire, which already holds the other four surviving miniature books entitled \u201cThe Young Men\u2019s Magazines\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/13/judi-dench-appeal-charlotte-bronte-book-auction-parsonage-museum\">Judi Dench appeals for public help to bring rare Bront\u00eb book to UK as auction looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The unpublished manuscript features three handwritten stories, including one regarded as a precursor to a scene in Jane Eyre. It last came up for auction in 2011 when the Bront\u00eb Society lost out to an investment scheme. The society had feared the manuscript would fall into private hands again, but thanks to a four-week public campaign backed by names including Judi Dench and Jacqueline Wilson, the society received more than \u00a385,000 in public donations, as well as grants from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and other trusts.</p> <p>\u201cWe were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary \u2018little book\u2019 to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum and now can\u2019t quite believe that it will be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago,\u201d said Kitty Wright, executive director of the Bront\u00eb Society. \u201cWe have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can\u2019t wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world.\u201d</p> <p>Ann Dinsdale, principal curator, said the return of the unique manuscript was \u201can absolute highlight of my 30 years working at the museum\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCharlotte wrote this minuscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible,\u201d Dinsdale added. </p>",

      "bodyText": "After years of chasing an \u201cincredibly rare\u201d little book by the teenage Charlotte Bront\u00eb, the Bront\u00eb Society has succeeded in acquiring it at auction, after fears that it would disappear into private hands again. At a Paris auction on Monday, the charity paid \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3512,000) plus auction costs to acquire the book, which measures just 35mm x 61mm. Written in 1830, when Charlotte was 14, it is part of a series of six produced by the author in her teens. Only five are known to have survived, with one missing since around 1930. The book will go to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum, the former family home in Haworth, Yorkshire, which already holds the other four surviving miniature books entitled \u201cThe Young Men\u2019s Magazines\u201d. The unpublished manuscript features three handwritten stories, including one regarded as a precursor to a scene in Jane Eyre. It last came up for auction in 2011 when the Bront\u00eb Society lost out to an investment scheme. The society had feared the manuscript would fall into private hands again, but thanks to a four-week public campaign backed by names including Judi Dench and Jacqueline Wilson, the society received more than \u00a385,000 in public donations, as well as grants from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and other trusts. \u201cWe were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary \u2018little book\u2019 to the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum and now can\u2019t quite believe that it will be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago,\u201d said Kitty Wright, executive director of the Bront\u00eb Society. \u201cWe have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can\u2019t wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world.\u201d Ann Dinsdale, principal curator, said the return of the unique manuscript was \u201can absolute highlight of my 30 years working at the museum\u201d. \u201cCharlotte wrote this minuscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible,\u201d Dinsdale added.",

According to a statement from the Clark county sheriff, Jason Watson, Terry David Bateman and Bradley Allen Rowland, of Henderson State University, were arrested and charged with manufacturing meth and use of drug paraphernalia. The case gained international attention thanks to its echoes of the hit TV series Breaking Bad, in which Bryan Cranston played Walter White, a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher who made and sold meth on the side. A spokeswoman for the college in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, said in a statement the two professors had been on administrative leave since 11 October, shortly after an undetermined chemical odour was detected at a university science centre. The centre was closed for three weeks, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. It reopened after a test confirmed it met Environmental Protection Agency standards regarding air quality. The college spokeswoman said an investigation was ongoing. The charges facing the professors carry sentences of up to 40 years, for making meth, and up to 20 years for use of drug paraphernalia.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has told business leaders he will shelve a planned cut in corporation tax, claiming he would put \u00a36bn into public services instead. The prime minister used a speech at the CBI conference to say corporation tax will not be cut from 19% to 17%, and issued a plea for business leaders to show understanding about his priorities. Johnson\u2019s decision to keep corporation tax unchanged comes as he attempts to distance the Conservatives from being seen as the party of big business, while promising tax cuts for small businesses, such as reducing rates and raising the employment allowance. George Osborne had originally announced the plan to reduce the tax to 17% by 2020. Labour has relentlessly portrayed the Tories as the party of the wealthy and has promised a number of nationalisations, which they claim would make utilities, railway, broadband and other services work better for the public. The prime minister\u2019s calculations of the money saved will raise questions about Tory claims that cutting corporation tax does not cost the Treasury money. Johnson also dropped a heavy hint he would include a major pledge on childcare in his manifesto. Speaking at a hotel in Greenwich, south-east London, Johnson said the Conservatives were the party of business but cancelling the cut to corporation tax would save \u00a36bn. \u201cI hope you understand that it is the fiscally sensible thing to do,\u201d he said. Elsewhere in his speech, the prime minister made a pitch to business leaders that he would get Brexit done and create certainty for them. He said the economy was \u201clike a formula one supercar firing on half its cylinders with so much more natural energy waiting to be unleashed\u201d because Brexit was not completed. \u201cThe country is being held back by politics and parliament,\u201d he said. Speaking at the same conference, Jeremy Corbyn took a conciliatory approach to the business leaders, saying he was not anti-business and setting out all the reasons that executives should be supportive of a Labour administration. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes claimed that I\u2019m anti-business,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is complete nonsense.

Just so the man who said \u2018fuck business\u2019 can sit in No 10.\u201d",

Bale played 60 minutes as Wales beat Azerbaijan 2-0 in Baku on Saturday and will start against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday, when victory would secure automatic passage to Euro 2020. Bale, who last week admitted he prefers playing for Wales than for Real Madrid, was his country\u2019s top scorer in the previous European qualifying campaign and remains the talisman but the Wigan striker Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson, the Liverpool winger on loan at Bournemouth, found the net in Baku and the emergence of Daniel James has also helped share the load. \u201cMaybe now we\u2019ve got more attacking options, which is good,\u201d Bale said. \u201cTo qualify is the main goal and you can\u2019t qualify with one player.

And it is quite a spectacle, replete with pyrotechnics, costume changes, crowd participation and confetti. Swedish metal outfit Ghost have arrived in the big league with a bang.</p> <p>The man in the mask is the band\u2019s leader Tobias Forge, taking to the stage here as Cardinal Copia, a sort of satanic Barry Manilow who serves as the latest in a string of creative personas. He\u2019s flanked by a slick band who perform under horned silver helmets and go by the collective sobriquet Nameless Ghouls. It\u2019s all terribly silly, and tremendous fun.</p> <p>This tour is Ghost\u2019s most ambitious to date, but they wear the bubbling pre-curtain excitement well. Their recent album, Prequelle, was a Top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic and in the years since their emergence as an occult metal oddity with a flamboyant streak, Forge has fine-tuned his writing to combine rock bombast with a winning line in pop classicism.</p> <p>Beginning with the thunderous Rats, he plots a course through a set brimming with outlandish camp and pantomime theatre. The music does the heavy lifting to offset some hackneyed stagecraft: if call and response isn\u2019t your thing then the tiered psych-pop harmonies of Mary on a Cross or the monstrous Cirice, 70% doomy riff-fest, 30% Total Eclipse of the Heart, offer more intriguing fare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/07/ghosts-tobias-forge-bands-need-to-be-larger-than-life\">Ghost\u2019s Tobias Forge: \u2018Bands need to be larger than life\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time the disco-derived stomp of Dance Macabre has reduced the crowd to a giddy mess of hugs and awkward shape-throwing, Ghost have successfully retrofitted their schlocky origins with a thrilling sense of scope and ambition. The closer, Square Hammer, is fitting. It keeps Forge\u2019s obsession with melody close to its heart, but it\u2019s also the sort of head-banging imperative that satisfies the old guard.</p> <p>Ghost\u2019s arena show is loud, self-aware and studded with outstanding songs. Pop and metal have long found common ground in a shared love of over-the-top pageantry, and there are few better at delivering that than Forge and his anonymous crew. \u201cAre you with us?\u201d he yells. The answer from the floor is a resounding yes.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://ghost-official.com/#tour\">Touring the UK</a> until 23 November.</p>",

The man in the mask is the band\u2019s leader Tobias Forge, taking to the stage here as Cardinal Copia, a sort of satanic Barry Manilow who serves as the latest in a string of creative personas. He\u2019s flanked by a slick band who perform under horned silver helmets and go by the collective sobriquet Nameless Ghouls. It\u2019s all terribly silly, and tremendous fun. This tour is Ghost\u2019s most ambitious to date, but they wear the bubbling pre-curtain excitement well. Their recent album, Prequelle, was a Top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic and in the years since their emergence as an occult metal oddity with a flamboyant streak, Forge has fine-tuned his writing to combine rock bombast with a winning line in pop classicism. Beginning with the thunderous Rats, he plots a course through a set brimming with outlandish camp and pantomime theatre. The music does the heavy lifting to offset some hackneyed stagecraft: if call and response isn\u2019t your thing then the tiered psych-pop harmonies of Mary on a Cross or the monstrous Cirice, 70% doomy riff-fest, 30% Total Eclipse of the Heart, offer more intriguing fare. By the time the disco-derived stomp of Dance Macabre has reduced the crowd to a giddy mess of hugs and awkward shape-throwing, Ghost have successfully retrofitted their schlocky origins with a thrilling sense of scope and ambition. The closer, Square Hammer, is fitting. It keeps Forge\u2019s obsession with melody close to its heart, but it\u2019s also the sort of head-banging imperative that satisfies the old guard. Ghost\u2019s arena show is loud, self-aware and studded with outstanding songs. Pop and metal have long found common ground in a shared love of over-the-top pageantry, and there are few better at delivering that than Forge and his anonymous crew. \u201cAre you with us?\u201d he yells. The answer from the floor is a resounding yes. \u2022 Touring the UK until 23 November.",

Here is where things stand: Hundreds of activists remain besieged inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the site of intense clashes today between protesters \u2013 many trying to flee the campus after nearly a week inside \u2013 and the police determined to keep them holed up. Protesters have tried to rush the police cordons outside the university in an attempt to break the siege. Human chains have kept the crowds supplied with water, umbrellas and helmets as they have tried repeatedly to crack the police lines. Some are hurling petrol bombs, while police are returning fire with rubber bullets, teargas and water cannon. Hong Kong authorities have said the Red Cross is inside the campus and that those requiring hospitalisation will be permitted to leave. As for the rest of the activists: \u201cOther than coming out to surrender, I don\u2019t see, at the moment, there is a viable option for them,\u201d said Cheuk Hau-yip, regional commander of Kowloon West, in a press conference this evening. Those who are arrested risk being charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence. Parents of some of those trapped inside PolyU (who include about 100 secondary school students) are sitting down in front of the police cordon blocking access to the campus holding signs that read, \u201cSave Our Kids\u201d. Protesters are clashing with law enforcement in other parts of the city, partly as a tactic to draw police resources away from the blockaded university, giving activists there a chance to escape. Activists claim some students have managed to get out of the campus through an unguarded path. Footage shows some have escaped by rappelling down a footbridge and being whisked away by waiting motorcycles. It is unclear how many managed to get away safely. Administrators have warned the continued unrest might mean the postponement of district council elections scheduled for Sunday. That could further stoke the protesters, who see the polls as one of the few institutional mechanisms to voice their grievances and influence Hong Kong politics. Earlier today, protesters won a legal victory with the high court finding a law against wearing masks in public was unconstitutional. Police say they have already stopped enforcing that controversial law. China\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, spoke to the media today at the country\u2019s embassy in London. Patrick Wintour was there and filed this report. The Chinese ambassador to London has accused Britain of being two-faced in its approach to Hong Kong \u2013 pretending to be even-handed in the face of the violent demonstrations, but in reality supporting the demands of the protesters. He also said UK politicians, including the foreign affairs select committee, were fanning the flames of unrest by referring to violent demonstrators as pro-democracy protesters. The ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, at his third press conference on the Hong Kong crisis, said: \u201cWe have made our position known to the British side when they have made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong. I think when the British government criticise Hong Kong police, criticise the Hong Kong government in handling the situation, they are interfering into China\u2019s internal affairs. They look like they are balanced but as a matter of fact they are taking sides. That is our position.\u201d We noted reports below of activists trying to escape the siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University by abseiling down a footbridge. Footage has now been posted online. The reporter Michael Zhang says he saw up to 50 protesters escape this way, jumping on motorcycles waiting below, until police moved in with teargas and closed the route. Seze Li, 26, a protester who is in PolyU, said protesters have been hiding in buildings throughout the campus, in offices and small spaces where they can barricade themselves in. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone is running around, looking for exits. We heard the protesters [trying to break the police siege] are coming. We are just waiting for them.\u201d Some have escaped by climbing out of the building. \u201cBut not everyone can do that,\u201d she says. \u201c[The mood] is not just angry. It\u2019s anxious and frightened. We are isolated here and people are afraid. We don\u2019t know when the police will strike inside.\u201d Li said protesters have been watching the live streams and communicating with people outside trying to reach them, including their families. Now they have started to rally the protesters who have been hiding so they can prepare to join the protesters trying to reach the campus. \u201cInside we are gathering protesters .\u2026 we are separated, hidden in offices and small rooms, just blocking ourselves in to hide from police. We are trying to find them all and say we will fight, and we will just walk outside.\u201d Even by the standards of the five-month protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong, the scenes unfolding on the streets of the city this evening are remarkable. Protesters are pouring into the streets and streaming towards the cordons established by police around Hong Kong Polytechnic University, attempting to free the thousands of activists who are trapped inside the campus. The crowds appear to be coming from three sides surrounding the besieged university and are being met by teargas, rubber bullets, and cannons firing water mixed with blue dye \u2013 to stain demonstrators and make them easier to identify for arrest. People are forming human chains to pass supplies including umbrellas, water and helmets to those at the front lines of the stand-off with police. The UK Foreign Office has just issued this statement calling for police to grant protesters safe passage out of Hong Kong university campuses: The UK is seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protesters and the authorities around Hong Kong university campuses. It is vital that those who are injured are able to receive appropriate medical treatment, and that safe passage is made available for all those who wish to leave the area. We need to see an end to the violence, and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue ahead of the district council elections on Sunday. For the past hour, crowds of protesters have trying to break the police siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), where hundreds of activists are trapped and have been prevented from leaving. Police are firing teargas to beat back the demonstrators. Our correspondent Lily Kuo is in the neighbourhood of Tsim Sha Tsui and has been posting what she sees on Twitter. Nearby, in a neighbourhood near the university called Jordan, police are firing rubber bullets and teargas and protesters are throwing petrol bombs. It is evening now in Hong Kong, and hundreds of activists remain besieged inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the site of intense clashes today between protesters \u2013 many trying to flee the campus after nearly a week inside \u2013 and the police determined to keep them holed up. Hong Kong authorities have said the Red Cross is inside the campus and that those requiring hospitalisation will be permitted to leave. As for the rest: \u201cOther than coming out to surrender, I don\u2019t see, at the moment, there is a viable option for them,\u201d said Cheuk Hau-yip, regional commander of Kowloon West, in a press conference this evening. Those who are arrested risk being charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year jail sentence. Parents of some of those trapped inside PolyU (who include around 100 secondary school students) are sitting down in front of the police cordon blocking access to the campus holding signs that read, \u201cSave Our Kids\u201d. Protesters are clashing with law enforcement in other parts of the city, partly as a tactic to draw police resources away from the blockaded university, giving activists there a chance to escape. Activists claim some students have managed to get out of the campus through an unguarded path. Administrators have warned the continued unrest might mean the postponement of district council elections scheduled for Sunday. That could further stoke the protesters, who see the polls as one of the few institutional mechanisms to voice their grievances and influence Hong Kong politics. Earlier today, protesters won a legal victory with the high court finding a law against wearing masks in public was unconstitutional. Police say they have already stopped enforcing that controversial law. In Tsim Sha Tsui, an area south of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, hundreds of protesters are facing off against riot police after having dug up bricks from the sidewalks and scattered them along the road. The longer the siege goes on at the university the more other places turn into flash points as protesters and their supporters rally and try to pull police resources away. Hong Kong media is now reporting that district council elections may not be held this Sunday as scheduled because of the ongoing demonstrations, which included the arrest of 154 people on the weekend (bringing the total number of those arrested throughout the five-month movement to 4,491). The Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Patrick Nip, told RTHK news that the government\u2019s position was that it would still endeavour to hold the elections. the government\u2019s position is clear that it will try its very best to ensure that the polls can go ahead smoothly. \u201cHowever, the situation in the past weekend has obviously reduced the chance of holding the elections as scheduled and I\u2019m very worried and anxious about this,\u201d Nip said. \u201cI must say that postponing the election is a difficult decision to make and we will not take this step unless absolutely necessary.\u201d Cancelling elections is likely to make things much worse. Some protesters have been demanding that the government promise to hold the polls, seen as the last institutional venue people have for expressing their views. Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement has evolved throughout the five months it has raged in the harbour city. Its latest phase is taking place on Hong Kong\u2019s university campuses \u2014 traditionally sites of political activism \u2014 some of which have been transformed into makeshift fortresses by demonstrators in the past fortnight. The immediate trigger for the battle to shift to campuses appears to have been the 8 November death of a Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student. Since then, several campuses have been barricaded by students, some of who are using footbridges or or near the campuses to block major roads. At least three campuses are currently blockaded, including most prominently the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and an adjacent road leading to the cross-harbour tunnel \u2014 a key artery for traffic in the city, and one that authorities will be determined to re- open. The campus confrontations have been desperate: activists are using petrol bombs, bamboo poles and other weapons including javelins and bows and arrows. Observers have told the Guardian the shift to campuses represents a major escalation. Many of those occupying the campuses are current students or alumni, and until recently, riot police have refrained from entering universities. \u201cThe university is the home turf of the students,\u201d Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University, has told the Guardian. \u201cThere is this notion of academic freedom and the university as a bastion of free ideas, this notion of autonomy. To people, this should not be breached by authorities.\u201d There has been confusion throughout Monday about whether protesters will be allowed to leave the besieged university campus they have been occupying for the past few days. Earlier attempts to escape have been met with tear gas and arrest, prompting some of the protesters to retreat back inside. Hong Kong police have just issued a statement saying the Red Cross has been allowed onto the campus and will be allowed to convey some students to hospital \u201cif necessary\u201d. Here\u2019s the statement: Police are aware of injuries inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) which has been struck by recurrent violence. Police attach great importance to the situation and have arranged for ambulances to convey injured people to hospital for treatment. This morning (November 18), Police started to make arrangement for Red Cross volunteers to enter the PolyU. At around 2pm [6am GMT], Red Cross volunteers arrived at PolyU to provide first aid to injured people, some of whom would be conveyed to hospital if necessary. Police have formed a tight perimeter around Hong Kong Polytechnic University and are not letting anyone in, including journalists. Protesters trying to escape have been tear gassed and arrested, and some have retreated back inside. A volunteer inside the campus says there are about 300 or 400 people left in the university. Asked what they plan to do, she says: \u201cThey are 20 year old kids. They don\u2019t have plans. Everyone is nervous.\u201d Parents have also collected by a police cordon nearby. Our correspondent in Hong Kong, Lily Kuo, has posted these views of the besieged Hong Kong Polytechnic University, that show thick smoke billowing from the campus and multiple explosions \u2014 with hundreds of students still inside. The Associated Press has published its latest update, which describes how police are preventing protesters from leaving the campus: Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong are trapped inside a university campus, with police firing rounds of teargas at them to stop them breaking through a cordon to escape the area. Protesters stuck in Hong Kong Polytechnic University advanced on the police from outside the cordon, while others emerged from the campus. However, they faced teargas and in some places police swooped in to make arrests. It is unclear if any of those who have been stuck in the area have managed to make it out. For days, protesters fortified the campus to keep police from getting in. Becoming cornered by authorities, they tried to get out but officers repelled one attempt Monday morning with teargas. They drove a few hundred protesters back onto the campus. The protesters want to avoid arrest and the police want to pick up as many as they can. Many protesters wear masks to shield their identities from surveillance cameras that could be used to prosecute them. Police have charged protesters for hiding their faces, despite protesters winning a legal front that challenged a \u201cban on masks\u201d imposed by the government. \u2026 Police have set up a dragnet around the campus to try to arrest protesters, who typically try to melt away after blocking traffic or causing other disruption before police run in to grab as many as they can. Hello, this is Sarah Marsh, taking over our live coverage of Hong Kong, where police and protesters have been clashing on the outskirts of the Polytechnic University. The latest images from chaotic scenes in and around the campus, which has become the site of the most prolonged and tense confrontation between police and demonstrators in more than five months of political unrest. Thanks for following our rolling coverage of the latest developments in Hong Kong. We are going to pause the liveblog now, but will continue in-depth coverage. Here is our full news story on what happened today. To recap: Protesters and police remain locked in a standoff at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Hong Kong\u2019s High Court has ruled that a ban on masks and face-coverings is unconstitutional. Hundreds of people in other parts of the city have been arrested as they express support for those within the university. Confusion reigns over whether protesters can leave the university. At 7am, they were told by the Poly U president that they could leave the campus under a police ceasefire \u2013 but they were driven back inside by round after round of teargas. At 12pm, police told protesters to lay down their weapons and leave peacefully, but a source told media that they could still be arrested. Police claimed they shot teargas at the earlier attempt to leave because protesters threw petrol bombs and charged at officers. A senior United States official has condemned the \u201cunjustified use of force\u201d and says they are monitoring events in Hong Kong. The ban on face coverings was enabled by the declaration of emergency powers, under a colonial British-era rule that had not been used since 1967. The emergency regulations ordinance was created by the British in 1922, and grants the government power to \u201cmake any regulations\u201d in the public interest during \u201can occasion of emergency or public danger\u201d. Chief executive Carrie Lam had declared the ordinance in October, and used it to pass the anti-mask rule. But that declaration of emergency powers was itself not overruled by today\u2019s High Court judgment. Some text of the judgment below. The court found that the mask ban went \u201cfurther than is reasonably necessary\u201d, and was a \u201crestriction on fundamental rights\u201d. The ban on face coverings failed a test of proportionality. Though it was \u201crationally connected to legitimate societal aims\u201d, it went too far. Breaking news. The High Court has ruled the ban on face masks and coverings, established in October, unconstitutional. More details to come soon. Two big updates on the standoff at Poly U, from the South China Morning Post. Quoting a police source, the newspaper reports that protesters will still be arrested if they leave Poly U peacefully. Earlier, the police had told protesters to \u201cdrop their weapons\u201d, take off gas masks and leave through one particular exit. \u201cWe may record that they leave peacefully for future court reference,\u201d the police source said, but confirmed they could still be arrested. At the same time, SCMP correspondent Jeffie Lam reports that the council chairman of Poly U had asked Hong Kong police to meet to discuss \u201chow to resolve the crisis in a peaceful manner\u201d. But police are yet to reply. The acting president of the student union, Ken Woo, also claims more than 600 people remain inside the university, higher than previous estimates of 200. Earlier today, chief executive Carrie Lam visited an injured police officer in hospital. The officer had been shot in the leg with an arrow on Sunday during the early stages of the Poly U standoff. An escalating situation along Gascoigne Road, in Jordan, on the outskirts of Poly U. Police are currently advancing along the road and firing tear gas, while protesters respond with \u201cat least one petrol bomb\u201d, according to the South China Morning Post. Protesters and police are 100 metres apart, SCMP report. Here is Deutsche Welle reporter Phoebe Kong on the same theme. The Foreign Correspondents Club has condemned the police obstruction of media coverage of the Poly U standoff. The FCC says journalists were blocked from entry and exit, searched and threatened with arrest under riot charges. They are also calling on police to investigate reports of an incident in Mong Kok where an officer allegedly targeted a journalist. \u201cThe FCC calls on the police to conduct a thorough investigation of a police officer who allegedly targeted a journalist in Mong Kok this weekend with a sponge grenade. Police said the officer was put on leave and that they are investigating the incident. \u201cThe FCC considers this a serious breach of press freedom and the right of the media under Hong Kong law to cover the protests free of intimidation or violence...We again call for an independent investigation into police violence against journalists and any interference with the media\u2019s right under Hong Kong law to cover the unrest.\u201d The full statement is here. On the outskirts of the university, a protester has also been shot in the forehead with a projectile and is bleeding, according to Hong Kong Free Press and the South China Morning Post. The man is on Gascogne Road outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei. At the same time, police have also fired tear gas into a crowd across the West Kowloon Corridor, the SCMP reports. Hong Kong police have released a statement, calling on protesters to leave the campus via a specific route: the top level of Cheong Wan Road South Bridge. Earlier, protesters had attempted to leave, but had been driven back in by multiple rounds of tear gas. The statement has no indication of whether protesters will be arrested or not. \u201cThe police appeal to everyone inside the Polytechnic University to drop their weapons and dangerous items, remove their gas masks and leave via the top level of Cheong Wan Road South Bridge in an orderly manner,\u201d it says. \u201cThey should follow police instructions and must not charge at police cordons.\u201d The statement says tear gas was fired during the last attempt to leave because the protesters had thrown petrol bombs and \u201ccharged\u201d at cordons. \u201cAfter repeated warnings were ignored, police officers dispersed the rioters with tear gas, the minimum force necessary,\u201d they said. \u201cThe rioters are hereby warned to stop their unlawful acts.\u201d Over the past two hours, attention has turned to the streets of Tsim Sha Tsui \u2013 outside Poly U \u2013 where over a hundred people have been arrested and detained in public. As those inside the campus continue their standoff with police, dozens of people outside, who have variously been trying to reach the university, provide support or ask police to lift the siege, have been arrested. A senior US official has also condemned the \u201cunjustified use of force\u201d in Hong Kong in recent days, and said they are monitoring the situation. Earlier, the university president, Professor Teng Jin-guang, said he had negotiated a temporary suspension of the use of force with the police and urged protesters to \u201cleave the campus in a peaceful manner\u201d. But as protesters tried to leave the university, at 8.30am, they were stopped by \u201cround after round\u201d of tear gas, lasting a few minutes, forcing them back inside. Protesters are now currently still inside the university campus, fearing that they will be trapped and arrested en masse by police. The Hang Seng has risen again, despite the unrest today. An hour ago, the index was up 0.56%. It\u2019s now up 1.13%, as of 11am. At least 38 people have been injured and taken to hospital since Sunday morning, according to the Hospital Authority. The oldest is an 84-year old man. 14 people received hospital treatment on Sunday, and 24 more were taken to hospital between Sunday midnight and 7.30 am on Monday. Five people are in a serious condition, and 17 people are stable but remain in hospital. Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo says medics are among those arrested at Poly U. According to Reuters, a senior US official has condemned the \u201cunjustified use of force\u201d in Hong Kong and encouraged China to \u201cprotect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom\u201d. \u201cWe condemn the unjustified use of force and urge all sides to refrain from violence and engage in constructive dialogue,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe United States expects Beijing to honour its commitments under the Sino-British joint Declaration and to protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system and democratic way of life.\u201d The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will close five of its branches today due to the unrest, the South China Morning Post reports. Estimates are that more than 100 people have been arrested in Tsim Sha Tsui. Some further footage of the dozens of protestors who were arrested in Tsim Sha Tsui at around 10am. The violent scenes in Hong Kong don\u2019t appear to have unnerved investors, who have sent the Hang Seng index up by 0.56%. The benchmark index lost more than 1,000 points last week amid the turmoil but it\u2019s looking a bit healthier today, up 115 points to 26,442. This is Naaman Zhou, taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. Two protesters at Poly U have reportedly surrendered themselves to police, according to this footage from Reuters. Chinese state media labels protesters \u2018competely hysterical terrorists\u2019 The Global Times, a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, has published its take on last night\u2019s clashes between police and demonstrators, whom the paper labelled \u201cterrorists\u201d who had turned the university into a \u201cwarzone\u201d. The paper said that protesters had \u201cgone completely hysterical and acted like terrorists as they attack police with lethal weapons, target innocent residents and turn campuses into battlefields.\u201d \u201cAt midnight, Hong Kong Police Superintendent Louis Lau Siu-pong warned rioters during a live broadcast that if they continued to attack the police with deadly weapons including Molotov cocktails and arrows, the police would respond with all possible minimum force, which would include live rounds,\u201d read the article. \u201cAround 10 pm, a rioter drove a car at police and crushed one from behind. One officer fired a live round at the vehicle. The police have condemned such terrorist-like activities. Skirmishes started since Saturday night, when black-clad rioters near the PolyU staged a confrontation with police. Rioters started fires, set up barricades, hurled Molotov cocktails, while local media reported that hazardous chemicals had been stolen from multiple campus laboratories of PolyU.\u201d The paper also noted that a police officer from the Force Media Liaison Cadre was shot with an arrow during the fighting. Hong Kong Free Press reports that dozens of civilians, not those who have been camped out in Poly U, have been arrested in the street after asking police to lift the siege on the university and let protesters leave. This follows reports of police chasing away civilians from the areas near the cordon around the university, pepper-spraying them, and threatening to shoot them. Police said they had fired three live rounds in the early hours of Monday at a protest site near the university but that no one appeared to have been hit. We believe this is in relation to the attempt of police to storm the university in the early hours of this morning and not in relation to police blocking protesters from leaving the university campus in the last hour. In the last half hour, the situation has escalated at the Poly U, where protesters have been bunkered down for two days. Police attempted to storm Hong Kong\u2019s Polytechnic University on Sunday night after a daylong battle with protesters which saw levels of violence between the two sides reach new heights on Sunday and officials threatened to use live rounds. About 200 demonstrators remained inside the building at dawn on Monday morning when police in riot gear moved in. As they advanced, protesters set fire to one of the entrances to the university and explosions could be heard. However, later on Monday morning, things seemed calmer and the university\u2019s president issued a video statement urging students to surrender to police and leave the university campus, saying he had negotiated a temporary suspension of the use of force with the police. At about 8:30am local time, large numbers of protesters tried to leave the university campus, but were stopped from moving through the streets by police who fired \u201cround after round\u201d of tear gas at protesters. Explosions and gun fire could be heard in some videos showing the protesters attempting to leave the campus, which were posted online. Protesters were forced back into the university grounds, raising fears that the police had no interest in deescalating the situation, but were aiming to trap all protesters, so they could be arrested and punished for their role in the siege. Some disturbing reports coming through of police using considerable force on civilians, journalists and first aiders who are trying to get close to the area cordoned off by police around the university. There are reports that hundreds of Poly U students are trying to leave the university, as police attempt to stop them, firing tear gas at protesters. In some videos, there is what sounds like gunfire in the background, with Reuters reporting that \u201criot police open fire\u201d. Protesters are trying to leave the university campus, but are being blocked by police who are firing round after round of tear gas at the demonstrators. Jennifer Wang, a reporter on the ground, says \u201cpolice have not stopped firing teargas in the last 10 mins.\u201d The protesters are throwing petrol bombs at the police to try and clear a path through and get out of the university. The Hong Kong Free Press has video from inside an office at the university, where protesters hid from police. They left a mess, including blood throughout the office, as well as leaving a note addressed to the person whose office it was, which apologised for the mess, saying they \u201cneeded to escape to your office because riot police are charging by surprise.\u201d There are reports that a large number of protesters are now leaving the university campus. In the English section of the video statement, which can be seen here, a spokesman said that police had denied entering the campus, but claimed this was untrue. Footage from 7am. Professor Teng Jin-guang, the president of Poly U has released a video statement saying he had negotiated a temporary suspension of the use of force with the police and urged protesters to \u201cleave the campus in a peaceful manner\u201d. However, in telling them to leave the campus, he is also suggesting they will have to turn themselves in to police, saying he would \u201cpersonally accompany you to the police station to ensure that your case will be fairly processed.\u201d Here is the full text of his statement : I have been communicating closely with the police since last evening. We have now received the assurance of police of a temporary suspension of the use of force, under the condition that if the protesters do not initiate the use of force, police will not initiate the use of force. In addition, we have received permission from the police for you to leave the campus peacefully and I will personally accompany you to the police station to ensure that your case will be fairly processed. For students from Poly U, our office of counselling and wellness will provide you with counselling and all the necessary support to help you during this difficult time. I hope that you will accept the proposed temporary suspension of force and leave the campus in a peaceful manner. Good morning, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Naaman Zhou. The mood appears tense inside the university. Protesters are live-streaming events within the university. At the moment, protesters \u2013 may of whom are wearing protective gear like helmets, gas masks and makeshift body armour, like knee guards and shin pads \u2013 are gathering and milling around. There does not seem to be any violence at present. This morning\u2019s standoff began yesterday, when police attempted to clear the university of protestors. Poly U has been occupied by pro-democracy protesters since last week, and the university has become the site of some of the tensest moments yet in six months of unrest. On Sunday, police flew a helicopter over the campus, and shot blue-dye laced with pepper spray at protesters. This came after protesters set fire to a pedestrian bridge. From the roof of the university, protesters have thrown petrol bombs and used bows and arrows to shoot at police, with one officer shot in the calf. Protests also broke out at other locations around the city, to draw police resources away from the university. On Sunday night and Monday morning, riot police moved in to Poly U. In a video statement, police officials threatened to use live rounds. Protestors established barricades and set fire to one of the entrances. Roughly 200 people are currently inside the university as of Monday morning. From Associated Press: The Education Bureau has announced that classes from kindergarten to high school would be suspended again on Monday because of safety concerns. Classes have been canceled since Thursday, after the bureau came under criticism for not doing so earlier. A fire is burning at one of the entrances to Poly U, with the smoke visible across the city. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the unfolding police operation at Hong Kong\u2019s Polytechnic University, where 200 protesters have been engaged in a standoff with police overnight. Police in riot gear entered the university at dawn, and protesters have set fire to one entrance. Here is our main story on the police raid and battles between protesters and officers on Sunday:",

This will mean families can only take one flight every five years. Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental campaigners had been alarmed on Monday by Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade, energy and climate change secretary, saying on the BBC that Labour\u2019s target was still net zero \u201cwell before 2050\u201d.</p> <p>But they were mollified by Long-Bailey\u2019s tweets saying: \u201cOurs will be the most radical manifesto ever written, especially on climate.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a constitutional democratic party with its roots in the labour movement. Energy workers are understandably fearful and distrusting about the transition because they have been abandoned through past industrial transitions.</p> <p>\u201cWe will only succeed by working with those workers and communities to develop a credible industrial strategy that ensures they will not be left behind by the transition.</p> <p>\u201cOur manifesto will set out a pathway towards net zero by 2030. I look forward to setting out these plans in more detail over this campaign.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Labour for a Green New Deal said it was \u201cgreat to see Rebecca Long-Bailey restate Labour\u2019s commitment to forging a pathway to net zero 2030\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cFrom housing to electricity to transport, Labour has laid out radical plans to decarbonise our economy by 2030 and transform it for the many.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution agenda remains one of the most ambitious climate policy platforms of any mainstream party in Europe.</p> <p>To get close to net zero by 2030 will require a huge transformation of the economy and energy supply systems \u2013 although its advocates say it would also boost the economy by hundreds of billions of pounds a year.</p> <p>The 2030 pledge is just one of many areas where party conference motions are likely to be softened for the election manifesto.

      "bodyText": "Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. The party\u2019s autumn conference had passed a motion setting 2030 as the target for net zero emissions, but trade unions raised concerns about the risk to jobs and industry. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, insisted on Monday that the party would remain on the \u201cpathway\u201d towards net zero emissions by 2030, in line with the conference motion. However, sources present at Saturday\u2019s clause V meeting finalising the party\u2019s manifesto said the GMB trade union and some other union representatives had pushed for softer wording, aiming for progress rather than completion. One source said the aim in the manifesto would be for a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of carbon emissions to be eradicated by 2030. Labour for a Green New Deal, which brought the motion, said it was happy with Long-Bailey\u2019s pledge of a pathway towards net zero by 2030 and confident that the leadership was supportive of strong action on the climate crisis. The GMB had pushed back firmly against a firm target of 2030, fearing it could lead to mass job losses. Tim Roache, GMB\u2019s general secretary, had previously warned: \u201cThe proposal to do it by 2030 threatens whole communities, threatens jobs, and frankly GMB members in communities right up and down the UK have heard it all before. \u201cThis will mean within a decade people\u2019s petrol cars being confiscated. This will mean families can only take one flight every five years. Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable.\u201d Environmental campaigners had been alarmed on Monday by Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade, energy and climate change secretary, saying on the BBC that Labour\u2019s target was still net zero \u201cwell before 2050\u201d. But they were mollified by Long-Bailey\u2019s tweets saying: \u201cOurs will be the most radical manifesto ever written, especially on climate. \u201cWe are a constitutional democratic party with its roots in the labour movement. Energy workers are understandably fearful and distrusting about the transition because they have been abandoned through past industrial transitions. \u201cWe will only succeed by working with those workers and communities to develop a credible industrial strategy that ensures they will not be left behind by the transition. \u201cOur manifesto will set out a pathway towards net zero by 2030. I look forward to setting out these plans in more detail over this campaign.\u201d A spokesman for Labour for a Green New Deal said it was \u201cgreat to see Rebecca Long-Bailey restate Labour\u2019s commitment to forging a pathway to net zero 2030\u201d. He added: \u201cFrom housing to electricity to transport, Labour has laid out radical plans to decarbonise our economy by 2030 and transform it for the many.\u201d Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution agenda remains one of the most ambitious climate policy platforms of any mainstream party in Europe. To get close to net zero by 2030 will require a huge transformation of the economy and energy supply systems \u2013 although its advocates say it would also boost the economy by hundreds of billions of pounds a year. The 2030 pledge is just one of many areas where party conference motions are likely to be softened for the election manifesto. An ambition to \u201cmaintain and expand free movement\u201d will translate into a compromise immigration policy, that acknowledges the rules could change if Brexit goes ahead. And the radical conference motion suggesting assets of private schools could be seized is more likely to take the form of saying tax loopholes should be closed for them. Teacher and campaigner Holly Rigby, who runs the Labour Against Private Schools group which led the motion, said they had met with McDonnell just two weeks ago and asked for their private school reforms to be included in the party\u2019s manifesto. She said: \u201cWe had a really positive meeting in the lead up to clause V. We were really happy with how the meeting went and we felt we were listened to and I feel reassured personally that what happened at conference will be turned into action. \u201cWe have always said that the most important thing is that private schools and inequality is wrong and we want the Labour party to take some action on this, and that it goes further than in 2017.\u201d The motion passed at conference was to include in the manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector by withdrawing charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges, including business rate exemption. It also called for the endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country\u2019s educational institutions. Rigby said no matter what the final wording of the manifesto, the issue was now at the heart of the political consciousness of the party and had cut through to voters across the country. She said: \u201cThe most important thing is we raise the issue in wider society and that this inequality is unjust and we have started that conversation in a way that hasn\u2019t existed before. \u201cIt\u2019s in people\u2019s minds now and it\u2019s up to the Labour party to decide how to move forward and make sure that inequality is challenged.\u201d",

While any project that raises money for charity is a good thing, there has to be an easier way to support worthy causes than some extremely hokey photography of you and your friends shivering in the cold. Nude calendars have always felt to me like vanity projects. They are an opportunity for women to glam up in the style of that Boots Here Comes the Girls advert, or heterosexual men in sports teams to get together and get naked \u2013 something they absolutely love doing, for reasons I cannot fathom \u2013 but with the extra endorphin kick of knowing they are doing it for a Good Cause\u2122. When they were first demoed by a group of Yorkshire Women\u2019s Institute members in 1999 \u2013 later documented in the movie and stage play Calendar Girls \u2013 they were a welcome novelty. But now they are everywhere, and I\u2019m tired of it. Nude calendars are the charitable equivalent of Rita Ora: overexposed, with minimal artistic merit. Nude calendars. It\u2019s time for an ewe turn.",

I love limestone. My dad is a civil engineer and so our family photos are just hundreds of us kids posing in front of different rock formations. Limestone is one (sandstone for me is the other) that is instantly recognisable and lovable for me. . . This book is about three different places across Europe the author lived in, about three different days, in three different seasons. It focusses on the minutia and mundaneness of being human - but being human in this one particular place bound up with all the history and culture and quirks that come with it. . . . Fiona is an extremely sensory writer - you can smell touch taste feel every sentence - each word is heavy and laden with a beautiful intensity. It is just the most gorgeous book in the world. Such a master example of exceptional writing. . . . . #fionasampson #britishwriter #poetry #writing #literature #guardianbooks #book #british #poet #english #bookshelf #naturewriting #natural #limestone #monograph #literature #literarywriting #bookstagram #booksilove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/carraszt/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Readthembooks&lt;/a&gt; (@carraszt) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-11-16T14:30:01+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 16, 2019 at 6:30am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Fiona Sampson - Limestone Country</figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/nov/11/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Some seasonal cheer from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10840870\">beerbart</a>, who has been reaching for Simenon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The darkness creeps up on you this time of year. Before you know it it\u2019s pitch black at 4pm. Anyway. It\u2019s the perfect time to reach for a Maigret. The last of my current 3 for 2\u2019s from a bookshop near Victoria: The Misty Harbour. Boy is it misty. There is also foul play in the air as a dockworker is shot, sent to Paris to recover and then poisoned on his return. 35 pages in: the flog is cloying, the morning coffee spiked with brandy and the pipe smoking is never ending. Classic Simenon then.</p> </blockquote> <p>David Peace\u2019s Red Riding Quartet finale: 1983 is also right for the time of year, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3231012\">writeronthestorm</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve waded through decades of filth and corruption to get to this point. Incredible writing. It\u2019s very bleak, leaves you feeling bleak and gives you a bleak outlook on life - it really does put me in a bit of a mood when I have a sustained reading session. Thankfully, I can acknowledge it\u2019s the book\u2019s fault and snap myself out of it - fair to say it\u2019s a perfect read for the melancholy of autumn/winter.</p> </blockquote> <p>Christabel Bielenberg\u2019s memoir The Past is Myself has scared <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16474787\">BrendaTwisse</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A terrifying account of how quickly and easily Hitler grabbed power from the ruling elite of the Weimar Republic. People weren\u2019t interested in politics and many thought Hitler was a \u201cclown\u201d \u2026 Bielenberg provides plenty of insight into what it was like to live in the Third Reich as an opponent of the regime. What particularly comes across is how exhausting it must have been to be constantly on guard against making a thoughtless comment, and the need to be wary of every new acquaintance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Malcolm Nance\u2019s The Plot to Betray America, about Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, has had an unsurprisingly similar impact on <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100002001\">Ammonium</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>About the greatest scandal to affect America, by a counterintelligence professional who has, like myself and many others, watched with horror as our democracy was undermined in plain sight with the eager and degrading collusion of 40 percent of its citizens and the Republican Party. The goal, to turn the US into a kleptocracy like Russia, is well underway \u2026 the story won\u2019t be over for many years; what is done now will never be forgotten.</p> </blockquote> <p>EM Remarque\u2019s All Quiet On The Western Front (translated by Brian Murdoch) is a keeper, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16791163\">allworthy</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I often wonder what books will be still around in 50 years time. Fairly sure this one will continue to remain with us. Such a beautiful book, exquisite prose to describe such destruction with rare glimpses of colour: butterflies and cherry blossom. This is a young man\u2019s story that captures how a generation become dislocated, live in a permanent no man\u2019s land, where they have no ties except to each other. Remarque almost slips in the horror; it becomes matter of fact. Paul B\u00e4umer becomes a hollowed shell as he loses everything matter. A wonderful novel that still feels a terrible warning - how the young can be betrayed by their elders.</p> </blockquote> <p>Time to cheer things up: David Mitchell\u2019s autobiographical Back Story made <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16555924\">euroneej </a>laugh:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is quite simply the funniest book I have read recently \u2026 I woke my wife up several times with involuntary outbursts of laughter, and it left me with the unusual desire to hope for opportunities to recommend it to anyone needing cheering up. Brilliant and absorbing, it has disarming authenticity and an endearing openness, while managing to keep the author\u2019s most private life private.</p> </blockquote> <p>Olive, Again by Elizabeth Strout has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1942463\">Larts</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The really good thing about Olive, Again is the writing. It is straight out of the top drawer, sharp, succinct and well observed. The stories have an authenticity that drew me in, the dialogue is pithy and characters well-drawn. The way Strout shows action and thought is really marvellous. An excellent collection.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, a mystery. A London Library copy of Lorna Moon\u2019s <em>Dark Star</em> has intrigued <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The library has owned the book since 1929, but when I took it off the shelf the Date of Issue slip pasted in the front showed evidence of only one previous borrower, in the late 90s. This points to one of two possibilities: 1) no one borrowed it before that time or 2) so many people borrowed it that the fully stamped slip was removed. I find both of those improbable, but the fact that the volume has been rebound and the rebinding is worn strongly suggests the second as being the case.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Some seasonal cheer from beerbart, who has been reaching for Simenon: The darkness creeps up on you this time of year. Before you know it it\u2019s pitch black at 4pm. Anyway. It\u2019s the perfect time to reach for a Maigret. The last of my current 3 for 2\u2019s from a bookshop near Victoria: The Misty Harbour. Boy is it misty. There is also foul play in the air as a dockworker is shot, sent to Paris to recover and then poisoned on his return. 35 pages in: the flog is cloying, the morning coffee spiked with brandy and the pipe smoking is never ending. Classic Simenon then. David Peace\u2019s Red Riding Quartet finale: 1983 is also right for the time of year, says writeronthestorm: I\u2019ve waded through decades of filth and corruption to get to this point. Incredible writing. It\u2019s very bleak, leaves you feeling bleak and gives you a bleak outlook on life - it really does put me in a bit of a mood when I have a sustained reading session. Thankfully, I can acknowledge it\u2019s the book\u2019s fault and snap myself out of it - fair to say it\u2019s a perfect read for the melancholy of autumn/winter. Christabel Bielenberg\u2019s memoir The Past is Myself has scared BrendaTwisse: A terrifying account of how quickly and easily Hitler grabbed power from the ruling elite of the Weimar Republic. People weren\u2019t interested in politics and many thought Hitler was a \u201cclown\u201d \u2026 Bielenberg provides plenty of insight into what it was like to live in the Third Reich as an opponent of the regime. What particularly comes across is how exhausting it must have been to be constantly on guard against making a thoughtless comment, and the need to be wary of every new acquaintance. Malcolm Nance\u2019s The Plot to Betray America, about Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, has had an unsurprisingly similar impact on Ammonium: About the greatest scandal to affect America, by a counterintelligence professional who has, like myself and many others, watched with horror as our democracy was undermined in plain sight with the eager and degrading collusion of 40 percent of its citizens and the Republican Party. The goal, to turn the US into a kleptocracy like Russia, is well underway \u2026 the story won\u2019t be over for many years; what is done now will never be forgotten. EM Remarque\u2019s All Quiet On The Western Front (translated by Brian Murdoch) is a keeper, says allworthy: I often wonder what books will be still around in 50 years time. Fairly sure this one will continue to remain with us. Such a beautiful book, exquisite prose to describe such destruction with rare glimpses of colour: butterflies and cherry blossom. This is a young man\u2019s story that captures how a generation become dislocated, live in a permanent no man\u2019s land, where they have no ties except to each other. Remarque almost slips in the horror; it becomes matter of fact. Paul B\u00e4umer becomes a hollowed shell as he loses everything matter. A wonderful novel that still feels a terrible warning - how the young can be betrayed by their elders. Time to cheer things up: David Mitchell\u2019s autobiographical Back Story made euroneej laugh: It is quite simply the funniest book I have read recently \u2026 I woke my wife up several times with involuntary outbursts of laughter, and it left me with the unusual desire to hope for opportunities to recommend it to anyone needing cheering up. Brilliant and absorbing, it has disarming authenticity and an endearing openness, while managing to keep the author\u2019s most private life private. Olive, Again by Elizabeth Strout has impressed Larts: The really good thing about Olive, Again is the writing. It is straight out of the top drawer, sharp, succinct and well observed. The stories have an authenticity that drew me in, the dialogue is pithy and characters well-drawn. The way Strout shows action and thought is really marvellous. An excellent collection. Finally, a mystery. A London Library copy of Lorna Moon\u2019s Dark Star has intrigued interwar: The library has owned the book since 1929, but when I took it off the shelf the Date of Issue slip pasted in the front showed evidence of only one previous borrower, in the late 90s. This points to one of two possibilities: 1) no one borrowed it before that time or 2) so many people borrowed it that the fully stamped slip was removed. I find both of those improbable, but the fact that the volume has been rebound and the rebinding is worn strongly suggests the second as being the case. Anyway, in September 1997 someone borrowed the book and returned it - get this - in September 1999! What on earth were they doing with this rather slight novel all that time? Furthermore, on page 71 a flower has been pressed (now fragile and flaking) and from that point to page 127 there are frequent pencil lines (only down the margins, thank god). I can\u2019t help trying to put together a story (also pretty fragile and flaky) behind the evidence, such as it is; this happens a lot with London Library books. It sounds like a story in and of itself\u2026 Interesting links about books and reading Virginia Woolf was \u201cnot averse to the occasional hatchet job.\u201d A wonderful essay on Woolf\u2019s writings for The Times Literary Supplement by Francesca Wade. Amazon are ruining holiday season for US publishers too. \u201cI still have not died\u201d: Margaret Drabble on learning German in her 70s. \u201cSadness once struck me as terminally hip\u201d: Leslie Jamison on the cult of the literary sad woman. There are treasures to be found on the Public Domain Review. The final frontier by Michael Chabon.

In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s CAC and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB are down between 0.19% and 0.69%. The FTSE 100 index in London is flat at 7,302.72. Despite Chinese state media reporting that weekend trade talks were \u201cconstructive,\u201d markets have been jittery as doubts crept in over the likelihood of a trade deal between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. CNBC reported that the mood in in Beijing is pessimistic, citing a government source. Asian markets had a better start to the week, after the People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its short-term funding rate, raising hopes of more stimulus. The pound has pushed higher against the dollar, to $1.2965, up 0.48%. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for all your comments! The opening bell has rung on Wall Street: The Dow Jones opened nearly 12 points lower \u2013 but then ticked up above 28,004.89, hitting a new record high. The Nasdaq opened 0.14% lower while the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.15% at the open. While Asian markets enjoyed a good start to the week, following China\u2019s rate cut, European markets are more mixed. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 8.77 points at 7,311.72, up 0.12% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.48% at 13,178.62 France\u2019s CAC down 0.44% at 5,913.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.55% at 23,457.12 Wall Street opens in just a few minutes and the Dow is expected to rise slightly, while the Nasdaq is seen opening flat to slightly negative. The mood in markets has been dampened by a report from CNBC that cast doubts over whether a trade deal can be struck between the US and China. A government source told the broadcaster that Chinese officials were troubled by Donald Trump\u2019s comment that there was no agreement on phasing out tariffs. Ben Chu, economics editor at Newsnight, has tweeted a chart showing estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that the planned corporation tax cut (now shelved) would cost \u00a36.8bn a year between 2020 and 2022. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King\u2019s College London, tweets about Boris Johnson\u2019s abandonment of the planned cut in corporation tax: Back to the CBI conference, where Jeremy Corbny has announced plans to create 320,000 new apprenticeships and reform the apprenticeship system. The plans would give employers more flexibility in how they spend their apprenticeship levy funds, allowing them to be used for a wider range of accredited training opportunities, says Sophie Wingfield, head of policy and public affairs at the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation. Giving employers more flexibility in how they spend their apprenticeship levy funds is the right call. The REC and many other businesses have been calling for the apprenticeship levy to be broadened for some time. The current system is too restrictive, and it also completely excludes the almost 1 million workers who are on flexible and temporary contracts. We hope that Labour\u2019s proposals will allow these workers to benefit from levy-funded training courses, and we will continue to campaign for this change. With a more flexible levy, we can improve training opportunities for flexible workers, address the country\u2019s skills shortages, and boost productivity across the UK. The pound has held on to most of its gains against the dollar, trading up 0.44% at $1.2959. The latest polls have suggested a 10- to 17-point lead for the Conservative party. Sterling has also been boosted by Boris Johnson\u2019s comments at the weekend that all Conservative candidates in the election will support his Brexit deal. Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will go head to head in tomorrow\u2019s first TV election debate, on ITV at 8pm. Thompson says: Assuming Tuesday\u2019s debate between the two leaders provides no major upset, we also believe the risk of a Labour majority is low. Equities have paused for breath today, with the FTSE 100 index now some 25 points ahead at 7,328.73, a 0.35% gain. The main markets in Europe \u2013 Germany, France and Italy are flat. What happens in the trade talks between the US and China will be key to further market moves. Rupert Thompson, head of research at investment firm Kingswood, says: Equity markets have seen little change. Investor focus remains firmly on the steady, but often conflicting, stream of sound-bites regarding the state of US-China trade negotiations. While progress remains slow, we still seem on course for a limited trade deal to be agreed eventually. Such a deal will be critical if the market rally over the last month is to be sustained. While US-China trade talks are centre-stage, a US decision on whether to impose tariffs on auto imports is also looming in coming days. This will not be unimportant, particularly for Europe. The general expectation is that Trump will delay the decision for a further six months, pending further negotiations with the EU. Beyond trade, the attention is on whether or not the economic numbers support the idea, which the market is now partially embracing, that global growth is bottoming out. As is often the case at turning points, the data is still rather ambiguous. Speaking at the CBI\u2019s annual conference earlier, Boris Johnson joked that business leaders might storm the stage in protest \u2013 but no one batted an eyelid when he announced that the planned corporation tax cut, from 19% to 17%, had been postponed. Here is some reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to \u201creduce the overall burden\u201d of business rates if the Conservative party wins the election, made at the CBI conference. Tom Leman, head of retail and consumer at the law firm Pinsent Masons, welcomed this but stressed that greater economic certainty is also needed to revive consumer spending. Business rates are one part of the puzzle when it comes to the challenges faced by the retail sector. It is encouraging that high street retailers could see a reduction in their overheads and that looking for solutions to the challenges they are facing is high up on the political agenda. However, the issues faced by our high street goes beyond business rates alone, there has been a change in the way consumers spend and the expectations they have of the service that retailers will provide. If we want to encourage consumer spending then we need to create greater economic certainty overall. Corbyn has also defended Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans. The Labour leader has sought to dispel concerns among business leaders that he is anti-business. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now \u2013 more on our politics live blog. The prime minister has just finished speaking. So aside from a package of measures designed to help businesses, Johnson sprang the news on business that the planned corporation tax cut will be abandoned. This doesn\u2019t mean the government is averse to tax cuts for businesses, Johnson adds somewhat apologetically before he starts taking questions from journalists. Johnson says the government is postponing further cuts in corporation tax, to save \u00a36bn that will go towards the NHS. Corporation tax was due to be reduced to 17% from 19% from the year starting 1 April 2020. \u201cWe need to get Brexit done,\u201d repeats Johnson, so we can get on with other things. You can watch live here. Boris Johnson has taken the podium at the CBI conference, at the InterContinental hotel near the O2 arena. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is blogging on our politics live blog. Over the weekend, Fairbairn expressed concerns about the Conservatives\u2019 immigration policy. The CBI, the UK\u2019s biggest business lobby group, has warned about a threat to businesses from both the right and the left of politics. Its director general Carolyn Fairbairn said at the group\u2019s annual conference in southeast London: I believe we are facing a danger that could get in the way of a bright future, and it takes the form of extreme ideology. And we see it on both sides of the political divide. On the right we have the threat of, even a preference, for no deal as the end point of our Brexit negotiations. She also said Labour\u2019s nationalisation programme had sent a \u201cchill through boardrooms\u201d. Several major European stock markets have turned negative. Traders are clinging to hopes of a preliminary trade agreement between the US and China, but there is precious little news. Chinese state media reported that a weekend phone call to discuss trade was \u201cconstructive\u201d. Sterling has risen through $1.2960, apparently boosted by comments from Boris Johnson. He said all 635 Conservative Party candidates in the general election on 12 December have pledged to back his Brexit deal, speaking to the Sunday Telegraph. Sterling is trading at $1.2963, up 0.49% and is 0.36% higher against the euro, at 85.35p. Some traders say that polls showing the Conservatives in the lead are also boosting the pound. The Tories lead Labour by 10 to 17 percentage points, according to four polls on Saturday, while a poll published by Good Morning Britain today showed a 14-point lead for the Conservatives. Here are the main moves in stock markets: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up nearly 6 points, or 0.08%, at 7,308.83 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.8% at 13,231.20 France\u2019s CAC down 0.25% at 5,924.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.2% at 23,538.7 A survey on UK household finances shows that people reported further strain this month. The headline index from IHS Markit remained at 44.4 in November, pointing to a negative assessment of household finances. The outlook for the year ahead also remained stuck in downbeat territory during November, although the respective index was broadly unchanged from that seen in October. UK households retained their pessimistic view towards job security during the latest survey period. Those employed in sectors such as retail and manufacturing reported a negative outlook towards job security. Nevertheless, growth of both incomes from employment and workplace activity was registered in November. More than one in five households still expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates, although the vast majority (79%) think its next move will be a rate hike, with 58% expecting this to come within the next year. The index uses survey data collected by Ipsos Mori and is the first consumer survey published each month. The prime minister is speaking at 10:40am GMT, followed by the Labour leader at 11:15am GMT at the CBI conference at the InterContinental in southeast London. Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, addresses the business group at 2:25pm GMT. She will be followed by Ivan Menezes, the chief executive of drinks maker Diageo, who will be speaking about the UK as a place to invest, from a global perspective. The CBI\u2019s annual conference is getting underway in London, where the main party leaders \u2013 Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson \u2013 are due to speak. The prime minister will announce a range of tax cuts for businesses, including tax relief for the construction and research industries, and a tax cut for small employers by raising the allowance for their national insurance bills from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. This comes on top of a previous pledge to lower business rates. Business rates are a tax based on rental values of the properties that firms occupy. European shares have opened slightly higher while US futures are pointing to a good start on Wall Street too. In currency markets, sterling is making the biggest gains, rising to a six-month high of 85.345p against the euro. Against the dollar, it is up 0.43% at $1.2958. China\u2019s yuan has fallen following a rate cut by the People\u2019s Bank of China, which triggered hopes of more stimulus. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says the pound has been boosted by news that all Tory candidates in the general election are supporting Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. All 634 Conservative candidates in the coming December 12 election have pledged to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. In the narrow context of this election, if all candidates are promising to back the deal, it makes it more believable that Boris can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. The general take in markets is that a Conservative majority offers relatively more certainty on both Brexit and on business matters than Labour. Ashik Musaddi, European insurance analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, says Aviva\u2019s decision is somewhat disappointing. Aviva, following the strategic review, has reported this morning that it has decided to retain its Singapore business and China JV, which we perceive as a small disappointment, as we were expecting a sale of the whole Asia units which could generate \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn. The UK insurer Aviva, which sells life, car, household and business insurance, has decided to hold on to its operations in Singapore and joint venture in China, despite receiving takeover offers for the Singaporean business. Both delivered double-digit growth in operating profits last year. But the company said it is still looking at possibly selling off its businesses in Vietnam, Indonesia and Hong Kong, whose status as a major financial centre in Asia has been knocked by months of pro-democratic protests. Aviva is continuing to explore strategic options for its operations in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Indonesia, with its respective partners in each country. The economic calendar is thin this week. We do have the latest monthly house price data from the UK property website Rightmove. The average asking price across Britain fell by \u00a33,900 in November, or 1%, from the previous month to \u00a3302,808. Rightmove also reported that the number of new listings dropped nearly 15%, the biggest year-on-year decline since August 2009. Miles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove, said: Elections normally dampen activity as uncertainty causes a degree of hesitation, but this one is being called to try to break the deadlock. A more certain outlook, whatever it may be, would be a welcome change for those who are contemplating moving. H&amp;T Group, the pawnbroker, said it is working closely with the Financial Conduct Authority, which is conducting a regulatory review of its \u201chigh-cost short term credit\u201d unsecured loans business. The review focuses on the assessment of the company\u2019s creditworthiness and its lending processes. The pawnbroker has stopped all HCSTC unsecured lending while it works through the review process with the City watchdog, and is reviewing its lending over the past six years, and whether it needs to pay any compensation to customers. It has had unsecured loans of \u00a33m, on average, rising to a peak of \u00a34m in December 2016, and now at \u00a33m. The firm collected total interest payments of \u00a324m over the period. However, it noted that HCSTC unsecured lending is only 4% of its overall business. The news sent H&amp;T shares down 17.5% to 305p. H&amp;T recently paid \u00a38m to buy out the loans and \u201cpledge books\u201d of Albemarle &amp; Bond, a rival pawnbroker which abruptly shut all its 116 stores in September. This means A&amp;B customers can collect their pawned items from H&amp;T outlets. Here in London, there is little corporate news this morning. There is another revenue warning from IQE, which makes semiconductor wafers for chips used in Apple products and for Asian customers in Taiwan and Singapore. The company warned on annual revenues for the second time in less than five months, sending its shares down 21% to 52.1p. IQE has experienced very challenging market conditions in 2019. Shortfalls in revenue relate predominantly to two major customers. The local economy has been hit by the protests, which have continued for months. The Hong Kong government warned on Friday that the city\u2019s economy could shrink by 1.3% this year \u2013 the first annual recession since 2009. You can follow the latest developments in Hong Kong on this live blog. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent Stephen McDonell tweeted: And we\u2019re off. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index opened some 5 points higher and is now down 0.47 points, or 0.01%, at 7302. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.11% France\u2019s CAC down 0.01% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.06% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.07% Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 up 0.17% News flash on Reuters: China\u2019s foreign ministry says no one should underestimate China\u2019s will to safeguard its sovereignty and Hong Kong\u2019s stability. On the latest clashes in Hong Kong, Erlam says: The stand-off between the protesters and the police has become increasingly violent this last couple of weeks and, worryingly, it\u2019s difficult to see how this ends without further clashes and bloodshed. At this point, the economy is the least of the concerns for both residents and observers. But a place once viewed as being stable and peaceful is looking increasingly less appealing for investors who may continue to pull cash out the longer this goes on and more fierce it becomes. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst UK and EMA at trading platform OANDA, sounded a note of scepticism on the latest trade talks over the weekend. While this is arguably a positive conversation that enables a deal to be reached, we were meant to be at the point of agreeing a date and location for it to be signed off. Trump looks to have been a little premature in his assertion that a deal is done last month with there clearly still being plenty more work to do. It always seemed a little odd how one sided the deal looked, with the Chinese clearly expected a greater commitment from the US side of tariff rollbacks, which is one issue that seems to be holding things up. This could well go on beyond the end of the year and even fall apart altogether which could be troublesome for the markets which have already invested so heavily into it. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market has bounced back with a 1.1% rise, following heavy losses last week when it lost nearly 4.8% as protests escalated. The rise comes despite news that Hong Kong police have trapped up to 800 people inside Polytechnic University, which has been occupied by protesters since last week, firing tear gas at any protesters trying to escape the campus. Other Asian stock markets also rose, after the People\u2019s Bank of China cut its repo rate by five basis points to 2.5% \u2013 the first cut in the short-term funding rate since 2015. The authorities also injected 180 billion yuan into the financial system. The move comes a fortnight after the PBOC cut the rate on its medium-term lending facility by the same margin. Both cuts raised expectations that the central bank may also reduce its new benchmark loan prime rate, on which many lenders base their mortgage rates, to prop up economic growth. China\u2019s CSI 300 index closed 0.8% higher and Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.6%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.49%. Investors are waiting for further news on the trade talks between the US and China. The two sides held \u201cconstructive talks\u201d in a high-level phone call on Saturday, according to the Chinese state media agency Xhinhua. In the call, Chinese vice premier Liu He, the US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer discussed the main concerns that stand in the way of a phase one deal being signed off. In Europe, stock markets are expected to open flat. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Trade talks between the US and China remain at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds. The positive sounds from the US side helped boosted European as well as US equity markets last week. Larry Kudlow, economic advisor to President Trump, plus Wilbur Ross, US commerce secretary, expressed optimism that a deal is in the offing. The commentary from the Trump administration helped the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 rack up fresh all-time highs on Friday. The language is driving the bullish sentiment even though President Trump doesn\u2019t appear to be keen to roll back on the tariffs. The US side would like to see more concessions being made in relation to intellectual property, while the Chinese side are balking about the size of agricultural purchases the US are calling for.

There are laser beams and pounding rock music as a pair of robotic arms mime the balletic movements of welding and spraying its bodywork. A blast of air comes from a hidden bank of fans and a dramatic rumble shakes our seats. This, a thunderous voice tells us, is the Ford F-150 pick-up, officially the best-selling vehicle in US history.</p> <p>I am watching this spectacle in the 4D cinema of <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/visit/ford-rouge-factory-tour/history-and-timeline/fords-rouge/\">Ford\u2019s River Rouge </a><a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/visit/ford-rouge-factory-tour/history-and-timeline/fords-rouge/\">factory in Detroit</a>, where the whooping audience taking the tour of the plant is being treated to a story that, unlikely as it sounds, has all the drama of a Hollywood movie. This factory changed not only mechanised production, but the world as we know it. Boasting its own docks, an electricity plant, a steel mill and a whopping 100 miles of railroad track, River Rouge was the biggest factory in the world when it opened in 1928. It even had its own fire stations, a police force and a fully staffed hospital. During the depths of the great depression, it still managed to employ 100,000 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8893fb34009d379a9dc0837f93a630bfac78c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8893fb34009d379a9dc0837f93a630bfac78c8b/0_0_4224_2875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sightseeing motorists pass the Ford River Rouge Plant in Detroit in 1941 \u2013 to look at strikers\u2019 picket lines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sightseeing motorists pass the Ford River Rouge Plant in Detroit in 1941 \u2013 to look at strikers\u2019 picket lines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But today, River Rouge is a shadow of its former self. Half of the 1,200-acre site has been sold off to other companies. <a href=\"https://www.greenroofs.com/projects/ford-motor-companys-river-rouge-truck-plant/\">The Ford plant now mostly comprises a single shed</a>, its roof is planted with sedum \u2013 flimsy eco-camouflage, given all the gas-guzzling trucks trundling off the production line within. Ford has decided to abandon sales of its smaller cars in North America, concentrating instead on SUVs and trucks \u2013 at a time when such vehicles have been found to be the second biggest contributor to the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Recent analysis found that if SUV drivers were a nation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/25/suvs-second-biggest-cause-of-emissions-rise-figures-reveal\">they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions</a>.</p> <p>This astonishing rise and fall is reflected in the city beyond the gates. Detroit\u2019s population once topped 1.8m, scattered across a freeway-threaded sprawl that could comfortably fit San Francisco, Boston and Manhattan within its boundaries. That same area now accounts for a third of that number, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/03/the-death-of-a-great-american-city-why-does-anyone-still-live-in-detroit\">scores of abandoned homes</a>. The very invention that made Detroit \u2013 and changed everything from urban planning to fashion design and the climate \u2013 has also lumbered the city, and the world, with an intractable legacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe history of the car is a history of unintended consequences,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, who made several visits to Detroit as research for a show that\u2019s about to open at the V&amp;A in London. Cars: Accelerating the Modern World represents the first time in the institution\u2019s 167-year history that it has tackled the automobile, a surprising omission for what curator Cormier calls \u201cthe single most important designed object of the 20th century\u201d.</p> <p>The lapse is partly because cars have always been seen to be more about science, technology and surface styling, making them an uncomfortable fit for the illustrious museum of craft. This exhibition, says Cormier, aims to examine their broader social and historical context, shining a full beam on the astonishing impact cars have had on everything from the formation of labour unions to <a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vam-blog/dp-content/605059c99dd47106008f74fc75848faf.jpg\">toasters</a>.

In one corner, a group of mobster-like heavies can be seen beating a stooped figure on a bridge, while another is pushed down the stairs. </p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-ford-motor-company-won-a-battle-and-lost-ground-45814533/\">The Battle of the Overpass</a>, a clash between union leaders and Ford management that took place in 1937. It became one of the most important events in labour history. Among the beaten was Walter P Reuther, leader of the United Automobile Workers union (UAW), who had organised a \u201cUnionism, Not Fordism\u201d campaign, demanding fair wages and a shorter working day.</p> <p>Ford\u2019s henchmen were lead by Harry Bennett, a caricature of a thug who kept lions in his fortified estate. When Bennett unleashed his muscle, newspaper photographers were waiting and their images, splashed across front pages the following day, caused public sentiment to turn against the company. <a href=\"https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/flint-sit-strike-1936-1937/\">A sit-down strike</a>, also depicted in the mural, had an even greater impact, leading to the full unionisation of the US auto industry.

At the General Motors Heritage Center, a great hangar full of gleaming vintage specimens on the outskirts of Detroit, we find the Firebird, a 1950s concept car that looks like a missile on wheels, with a bubble-topped cockpit bulging from its curving fuselage. The car \u2013 which will appear in the exhibition \u2013 wasn\u2019t just an exercise in going faster. It embodied <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/29/self-driving-1956-concept-car-shows-how-far-tesla-has-advanced-autonomous-driving.html\">the embryonic idea of driverless driving</a>, boasting an \u201celectronic guide system that can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see why it didn\u2019t take off: these futuristic vehicles were to be guided via radio by men in watchtowers a few hundred metres apart, mapping the best route from their bird\u2019s eye view.</p> <p>A little further down an eight-lane highway, we arrive at the GM Tech Center, designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1960s as a modernist corporate campus, complete with an enigmatic silver dome where new designs are still inspected in secret. \u201cJust as Versailles was designed to be seen from a horse-drawn carriage, this place was designed to be viewed from your moving car,\u201d says GM archivist Christo Datini, as we glide around the vast ornamental lake in his gargantuan Chevrolet Suburban. The comparison isn\u2019t so far-fetched: the centre houses treasures that have proved just as influential as a gilded Louis XIV chaise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"497e68cc2612cecf97ff6662d9286d9de485a309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/497e68cc2612cecf97ff6662d9286d9de485a309/0_0_3000_3838/782.jpg\" alt=\"Feminine touch \u2026 Harley Earl with General Motors\u2019 Damsels of Design.\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feminine touch \u2026 Harley Earl with General Motors\u2019 Damsels of Design.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: General Motors LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the archive are reams of original design drawings from GM\u2019s glory days under <a href=\"http://www.harleyjearl.com/\">Harley Earl</a>. As the first director of the company\u2019s Art and Colour Section, Earl is widely regarded as the godfather of modern car design. In an industry that had only ever been guided by the functional necessities of engineering, Earl introduced the concept of styling bodies and interiors.</p> <p>First he hired dazzle camouflage artists, who had painted ships in the second world war, to make bodies look more sculpted. Then he went on to develop such purely aesthetic features as tail fins and pointed chrome bumpers, both inspired by fighter jets.

      "bodyText": "A whoop of exhilaration surges through the audience as a pick-up truck rises on to the stage through a trapdoor, its gleaming streamlined body emerging through swirling clouds of dry ice. There are laser beams and pounding rock music as a pair of robotic arms mime the balletic movements of welding and spraying its bodywork. A blast of air comes from a hidden bank of fans and a dramatic rumble shakes our seats. This, a thunderous voice tells us, is the Ford F-150 pick-up, officially the best-selling vehicle in US history. I am watching this spectacle in the 4D cinema of Ford\u2019s River Rouge factory in Detroit, where the whooping audience taking the tour of the plant is being treated to a story that, unlikely as it sounds, has all the drama of a Hollywood movie. This factory changed not only mechanised production, but the world as we know it. Boasting its own docks, an electricity plant, a steel mill and a whopping 100 miles of railroad track, River Rouge was the biggest factory in the world when it opened in 1928. It even had its own fire stations, a police force and a fully staffed hospital. During the depths of the great depression, it still managed to employ 100,000 people. But today, River Rouge is a shadow of its former self. Half of the 1,200-acre site has been sold off to other companies. The Ford plant now mostly comprises a single shed, its roof is planted with sedum \u2013 flimsy eco-camouflage, given all the gas-guzzling trucks trundling off the production line within. Ford has decided to abandon sales of its smaller cars in North America, concentrating instead on SUVs and trucks \u2013 at a time when such vehicles have been found to be the second biggest contributor to the rise in CO2 levels. Recent analysis found that if SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions. This astonishing rise and fall is reflected in the city beyond the gates. Detroit\u2019s population once topped 1.8m, scattered across a freeway-threaded sprawl that could comfortably fit San Francisco, Boston and Manhattan within its boundaries. That same area now accounts for a third of that number, along with scores of abandoned homes. The very invention that made Detroit \u2013 and changed everything from urban planning to fashion design and the climate \u2013 has also lumbered the city, and the world, with an intractable legacy. \u201cThe history of the car is a history of unintended consequences,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, who made several visits to Detroit as research for a show that\u2019s about to open at the V&amp;A in London. Cars: Accelerating the Modern World represents the first time in the institution\u2019s 167-year history that it has tackled the automobile, a surprising omission for what curator Cormier calls \u201cthe single most important designed object of the 20th century\u201d. The lapse is partly because cars have always been seen to be more about science, technology and surface styling, making them an uncomfortable fit for the illustrious museum of craft. This exhibition, says Cormier, aims to examine their broader social and historical context, shining a full beam on the astonishing impact cars have had on everything from the formation of labour unions to toasters. (One, called the Toastalator, looks like something Jack Kerouac would have driven.) And Detroit is the best place to see all this first-hand. Driving across town from the plant, past blocks of overgrown lots, we arrive at the Walter P Reuther Library, whose reading room displays an imposing 1930s mural. Two muscular workers, one male and one female, hold hands in front of an industrial scene in which autoworkers confront scowling managers. In one corner, a group of mobster-like heavies can be seen beating a stooped figure on a bridge, while another is pushed down the stairs. This is The Battle of the Overpass, a clash between union leaders and Ford management that took place in 1937. It became one of the most important events in labour history. Among the beaten was Walter P Reuther, leader of the United Automobile Workers union (UAW), who had organised a \u201cUnionism, Not Fordism\u201d campaign, demanding fair wages and a shorter working day. Ford\u2019s henchmen were lead by Harry Bennett, a caricature of a thug who kept lions in his fortified estate. When Bennett unleashed his muscle, newspaper photographers were waiting and their images, splashed across front pages the following day, caused public sentiment to turn against the company. A sit-down strike, also depicted in the mural, had an even greater impact, leading to the full unionisation of the US auto industry. The UAW provided a model for other organisations and became the largest union in North America. \u201cThe UAW played a major role in developing the American middle class,\u201d says Cormier, who has negotiated loans from the union\u2019s archive, including graphic posters from the 1950s and 60s. One, depicting a robot pushing workers off a building, has the slogan: \u201cFight automation fallout.\u201d The same battles continue today, as workers face plant closures across the US as a result of stiff competition from Asia and a global decline in car ownership. At this critical point for the car, the show will reveal how some of our current challenges aren\u2019t as modern as we like to think. At the General Motors Heritage Center, a great hangar full of gleaming vintage specimens on the outskirts of Detroit, we find the Firebird, a 1950s concept car that looks like a missile on wheels, with a bubble-topped cockpit bulging from its curving fuselage. The car \u2013 which will appear in the exhibition \u2013 wasn\u2019t just an exercise in going faster. It embodied the embryonic idea of driverless driving, boasting an \u201celectronic guide system that can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to see why it didn\u2019t take off: these futuristic vehicles were to be guided via radio by men in watchtowers a few hundred metres apart, mapping the best route from their bird\u2019s eye view. A little further down an eight-lane highway, we arrive at the GM Tech Center, designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1960s as a modernist corporate campus, complete with an enigmatic silver dome where new designs are still inspected in secret. \u201cJust as Versailles was designed to be seen from a horse-drawn carriage, this place was designed to be viewed from your moving car,\u201d says GM archivist Christo Datini, as we glide around the vast ornamental lake in his gargantuan Chevrolet Suburban. The comparison isn\u2019t so far-fetched: the centre houses treasures that have proved just as influential as a gilded Louis XIV chaise. In the archive are reams of original design drawings from GM\u2019s glory days under Harley Earl. As the first director of the company\u2019s Art and Colour Section, Earl is widely regarded as the godfather of modern car design. In an industry that had only ever been guided by the functional necessities of engineering, Earl introduced the concept of styling bodies and interiors. First he hired dazzle camouflage artists, who had painted ships in the second world war, to make bodies look more sculpted. Then he went on to develop such purely aesthetic features as tail fins and pointed chrome bumpers, both inspired by fighter jets. He also ushered in the strategy of the annual model update, which GM liked to call \u201cdynamic obsolescence\u201d. This was a way of using design to encourage drivers to upgrade their cars more frequently \u2013 a tactic that quickly spread to practically every other product in the world. Earl looms large in the section about making the modern consumer. He is pictured with his \u201cDamsels of Design\u201d, another marketing ruse that emphasised the role of his (small) team of female designers, as a way of appealing to women buyers. As he put it in a 1958 press release: \u201cThe skilled feminine hands helping to shape our cars of tomorrow are worthy representatives of American women, who today cast the final vote in the purchase of three out of four automobiles.\u201d Less loudly trumpeted was the fact that their role was limited to seats and fabrics. The damsels may have been used as a cynical promotional tool, but elsewhere the exhibition will show how cars have been a means of empowerment, with such racing drivers as Kay Petre and Jill Scott Thomas becoming powerful symbols of the suffrage movement. Subcultures are also explored, in the form of wildly customised lowriders and souped-up muscle cars, while the future of environmentally conscious mobility, and the eventual demise of personal car ownership, will be thrown into sharp relief by attitudes from the 1960s. A shocking advert for the Humble Oil Company from 1962 proudly boasts: \u201cEach day Humble produces enough energy to melt seven million tons of glacier!\u201d Museums, you could almost say, are where cars now belong. \u2022 Cars: Accelerating the Modern World is at the V&amp;A, London, from 23 November until 19 April.",

      "bodyText": "A talk radio host said he was fired from a rightwing radio station \u2013 mid-show \u2013 for criticizing Donald Trump. Craig Silverman was hosting his eponymous show on 710 KNUS, a Denver station owned by the conservative Salem Media Group, on Saturday when the station abruptly cut to a network news report. According to Silverman, the program director entered the studio and told him: \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d Silverman had been in the middle of a segment about Roy Cohn, Trump\u2019s controversial former lawyer who died in 1986. Silverman, a rare critic of Trump on the conservative network, said he had run into problems with executives at the station due to his refusal to \u201ctoe strict Trump party line\u201d. \u201cI was frustrated that we couldn\u2019t talk about the facts of the impeachment case and it all came to a head as I was excoriating Donald Trump on my show yesterday,\u201d Silverman told CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources on Sunday. On Sunday night, however, KNUS said Silverman was not fired \u2013 despite the station removing his page from its website \u2013 but was taken off air after he discussed a planned appearance on a rival network. \u201cHe decided that it was important to work across town and so on Saturday on his program he announced that, and that\u2019s what prompted our decision to take him off the air,\u201d station general manager Brian Taylor told the Denver Post. \u201cThe notion that he was relieved from his program because he criticized President Trump is absolutely untrue. We\u2019ve never told Mr Silverman the position to take on [Trump\u2019s] impeachment.\u201d Speaking to CNN Business, Silverman outlined his position, discussing the witnesses who appeared in public hearings last week. \u201cI thought [William] Taylor and [George] Kent were great,\u201d he said, \u201cthey laid a base. I\u2019m a trial attorney, I\u2019m a former prosecutor. I know how to put on a case. \u201cAnd then Marie Yovanovitch. She inspired me. She was an outstanding witness, but if nobody on radio talks about it, how are the American people going to understand?\u201d Silverman told the Washington Post he began appearing on other networks after he stopped being invited on to other shows on KNUS. He also said his contract with KNUS was \u201cnonexclusive\u201d. As of Monday morning, he had not said whether he would return to his show. Taylor said: \u201cI look forward to Craig continuing his program.\u201d",

The action, in which one group of demonstators has occupied a lobby at the Labour party\u2019s London headquarters, is part of a wider global Extinction Rebellion protest centred on a week-long hunger strike. The organisation tweeted that hunger strikers would be outside all UK political party HQs all week \u201cdemanding leaders meet us and talk about our three demands bill\u201d. This calls for governments to \u201ctell the truth\u201d about the extent of the climate emergency; to commit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and stop biodiversity loss; and to move beyond politics and address the issue via ideas such as citizens\u2019 assemblies.

Turkey has been shocked by a recent spate of apparent familial suicide pacts which have been blamed on rising poverty. Earlier this month in Fatih, one of Istanbul\u2019s most conservative neighbourhoods, the Yeti\u015fkin family: two men and two women aged between 48 and 60, left a note on the door of a flat warning neighbours not to enter due to the presence of cyanide.

The father, who had been unemployed for a long time, left a note explaining their financial difficulties. Turkey\u2019s largely pro-government media and officials have rejected claims that the recent deaths are linked to rising poverty. The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) has a largely working-class voter base. The AKP was punished by voters across the country for Turkey\u2019s economic crisis in local elections earlier this year, the first significant check on the power of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, after 16 years in office.

Her son, Lev, had just been arrested by the authorities and the poem, published decades later, became a seminal work on Stalin\u2019s Great Terror.

A former colleague added: \u201cThe glasses of pastis, swallowed by the dozen at parties, ended up making me sick.\u201d He said he reported his concerns to bosses after finding a drunk colleague \u201cdrooling in his car\u201d and another in an \u201calcoholic coma\u201d. \u201cNobody was shocked,\u201d he told Le Parisien. Another former member of Pernod Ricard staff told the paper he was nicknamed \u201cMonsieur Ricard\u201d. \u201cWe drank so much, I was putting away 12 pastis a day \u2026 I could have caused an accident while driving; killed someone or myself.\u201d Pastis is most often drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif mixed with water. It is popular in France, particularly in the south. Emmanuel Vouin, a press spokeswoman for Pernod Ricard, which makes \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn) a year, denied the accusations, saying drinking was a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d. \u201cThere is no culture of alcohol, no order, no incitement in any form to drink,\u201d she said. Bruno Gomier, the head of communications for the group, added that staff could decide \u201cnot to drink, or drink moderately\u201d. The tribunal ruling is expected at the end of the month.",

      "body": "<p>On the day Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/boris-johnson-to-shelve-planned-cut-in-corporation-tax\">addressed the CBI</a>, it\u2019s great to get a firmer idea of what he meant when he said \u201cfuck business\u201d. And who better to give it to us than the CEO of one of the businesses he will surely end up completely fucking. Yes, it\u2019s time to hear a whole lot more from our favourite cray-cray multihyphenate, the model/entrepreneur/infosec-something Jennifer Arcuri. Finally, a proper sublebrity enters the election campaign, as Jennifer breaks six weeks of silence with an ITV special, a Good Morning Britain appearance and a mesmerising Victoria Derbyshire interview in which she declared: \u201cNo one\u2019s understood Boris Johnson better than I have for the last 10 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>So tell us about the man behind the man. He\u2019s \u201cdeep\u201d, revealed Arcuri, not \u201cshallow as a paddling pool\u201d. Right. A \u201cvery considerate person\u201d. Also, \u201ca man of his word\u201d. Go on. \u201cHe saw my arc, he saw my progression as a woman graduating and becoming a mature entrepreneur.\u201d Any more? \u201cHe liked my events. He enjoyed coming. You know, he really did like Innotech.\u201d</p> \n<p>Babe, he didn\u2019t. None of this. But you do have to feel for Arcuri, who has spent two months in the eye of a media storm for Johnson, yet whose sole successful attempt to get through to the PM to ask his advice on how to handle it saw him immediately chuck his phone to an aide, who she says began \u201cpathetically mocking\u201d her in a Chinese accent. At least, we have to assume it was an aide. Even though it doesn\u2019t take long to find a Boris Johnson Spectator column in which <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2003/01/diary-402/\">he ventriloquises</a> a flummoxed Chinese air stewardess saying \u201cVelly solly\u201d to him.</p> \n<p>Is the prime minister velly solly about what has happened to his fellow platinum blond(e), who famously gave him technology lessons and accompanied him on various trade missions like they were a pair of beta version Targaryens? Of course not! Not remotely. Fuck business. Or as Johnson was tweeting at the very moment Arcuri was describing being hung out to dry by him: \u201cWe can only invest in our great public services if we support the entrepreneurs, businesses and hardworking people who get up each day to build our strong economy.\u201d I know, right? Unless he hardworkingly shags entrepreneurs and businesswomen, you literally can\u2019t have an NHS. That\u2019s just economics.</p> \n<p>But back to Arcuri. As far as a style aesthetic goes, Jennifer may be Baby Spice refusing to retire the look. But energy-wise, she is pure Geri. Asked during ITV\u2019s Sunday night interview what she would say to Johnson, she stared straight down the camera and stated: \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive and a true confidante of yours. I have kept your secrets and I have been your friend, and I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve blocked me and ignored me as if I were some fleeting one-night stand, some girl that you picked up at a bar, because I wasn\u2019t. And you KNOW that. And I\u2019m terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside, like I am some \u2026 GREMLIN.\u201d</p> \n<p>Well now. If I had to zone in on the one thing I loved about the above quote, it would be: everything about the above quote. But particularly the way Jennifer graciously acknowledges this situation\u2019s debt to another classic entertainment franchise. With the gremlin reference, it feels as though she\u2019s explicitly placing her and Boris in the comedy horror genre. And, you know \u2026 likewise. Very much likewise. As the original Gremlins tagline ran: \u201cCute. Clever. Mischievous. Intelligent. Dangerous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Could she be dangerous to him? The investigation into his London mayoral dealings with her rumbles on, and Arcuri now says Johnson should have declared the nature of their relationship. But what was its nature? \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question,\u201d she told GMB, \u201cbut as you can tell there was a very special relationship there.\u201d Elsewhere she explained she wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing to patronise the public\u201d. Very kind. And I\u2019m sure the public could live without GMB\u2019s Lorraine Kelly having a go at Jennifer for avoiding questions. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/20/lorraine-kelly-theatrical-artist-tax-tribunal-judge-rules\">better than avoiding tax</a>, Lorraine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fb13584d-0d40-42f6-b625-feb141d7898a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tX34Igt1qE8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As for what it is Arcuri wants, she says it\u2019s simple: an apology from Johnson for ghosting her, for him to \u201cman up and to pick up the phone to me\u201d, and for him \u201cto acknowledge the fact that for a long time I was a part of his life\u201d. This feels quite relatable \u2013 and also quite unlikely to happen on the stump in Nuneaton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-investigation-to-review-affair-with-another-woman\">Johnson-Arcuri investigation to review affair with another woman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The most worrying moment for Johnson\u2019s team will have been the bit where Derbyshire told the otherwise elliptic Arcuri she could help him out by saying there was no conflict of interest. Quick as a flash she shot back: \u201cAnd he could help me out. Like, two months ago.\u201d She\u2019d sent him a text, she revealed. \u201cYou wanna read it?\u201d she asked, reaching for her phone. \u201c\u2018Is this the price of loyalty? To be hung up on, ignored and blocked? Why would I remain silent if you can\u2019t even speak to me?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>So there you have Jennifer Arcuri in all her, like, glory \u2013 this election\u2019s picaresque anti-heroine. And I\u2019m afraid we all know what happens to those. In the story of Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, who would definitely have been monstered on GMB, Thomas Hardy is clear: \u201cThe woman pays.\u201d And so with Jennifer of the Arcuris. The woman pays. The prime minister? Nah, seems unlikely. But that\u2019s business. Try not to choke on it. </p>",

      "bodyText": "On the day Boris Johnson addressed the CBI, it\u2019s great to get a firmer idea of what he meant when he said \u201cfuck business\u201d. And who better to give it to us than the CEO of one of the businesses he will surely end up completely fucking. Yes, it\u2019s time to hear a whole lot more from our favourite cray-cray multihyphenate, the model/entrepreneur/infosec-something Jennifer Arcuri. Finally, a proper sublebrity enters the election campaign, as Jennifer breaks six weeks of silence with an ITV special, a Good Morning Britain appearance and a mesmerising Victoria Derbyshire interview in which she declared: \u201cNo one\u2019s understood Boris Johnson better than I have for the last 10 years.\u201d So tell us about the man behind the man. He\u2019s \u201cdeep\u201d, revealed Arcuri, not \u201cshallow as a paddling pool\u201d. Right. A \u201cvery considerate person\u201d. Also, \u201ca man of his word\u201d. Go on. \u201cHe saw my arc, he saw my progression as a woman graduating and becoming a mature entrepreneur.\u201d Any more? \u201cHe liked my events. He enjoyed coming. You know, he really did like Innotech.\u201d Babe, he didn\u2019t. None of this. But you do have to feel for Arcuri, who has spent two months in the eye of a media storm for Johnson, yet whose sole successful attempt to get through to the PM to ask his advice on how to handle it saw him immediately chuck his phone to an aide, who she says began \u201cpathetically mocking\u201d her in a Chinese accent. At least, we have to assume it was an aide. Even though it doesn\u2019t take long to find a Boris Johnson Spectator column in which he ventriloquises a flummoxed Chinese air stewardess saying \u201cVelly solly\u201d to him. Is the prime minister velly solly about what has happened to his fellow platinum blond(e), who famously gave him technology lessons and accompanied him on various trade missions like they were a pair of beta version Targaryens? Of course not! Not remotely. Fuck business. Or as Johnson was tweeting at the very moment Arcuri was describing being hung out to dry by him: \u201cWe can only invest in our great public services if we support the entrepreneurs, businesses and hardworking people who get up each day to build our strong economy.\u201d I know, right? Unless he hardworkingly shags entrepreneurs and businesswomen, you literally can\u2019t have an NHS. That\u2019s just economics. But back to Arcuri. As far as a style aesthetic goes, Jennifer may be Baby Spice refusing to retire the look. But energy-wise, she is pure Geri. Asked during ITV\u2019s Sunday night interview what she would say to Johnson, she stared straight down the camera and stated: \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive and a true confidante of yours. I have kept your secrets and I have been your friend, and I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve blocked me and ignored me as if I were some fleeting one-night stand, some girl that you picked up at a bar, because I wasn\u2019t. And you KNOW that. And I\u2019m terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside, like I am some \u2026 GREMLIN.\u201d Well now. If I had to zone in on the one thing I loved about the above quote, it would be: everything about the above quote. But particularly the way Jennifer graciously acknowledges this situation\u2019s debt to another classic entertainment franchise. With the gremlin reference, it feels as though she\u2019s explicitly placing her and Boris in the comedy horror genre. And, you know \u2026 likewise. Very much likewise. As the original Gremlins tagline ran: \u201cCute. Clever. Mischievous. Intelligent. Dangerous.\u201d Could she be dangerous to him? The investigation into his London mayoral dealings with her rumbles on, and Arcuri now says Johnson should have declared the nature of their relationship. But what was its nature? \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question,\u201d she told GMB, \u201cbut as you can tell there was a very special relationship there.\u201d Elsewhere she explained she wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing to patronise the public\u201d. Very kind. And I\u2019m sure the public could live without GMB\u2019s Lorraine Kelly having a go at Jennifer for avoiding questions. It\u2019s better than avoiding tax, Lorraine. As for what it is Arcuri wants, she says it\u2019s simple: an apology from Johnson for ghosting her, for him to \u201cman up and to pick up the phone to me\u201d, and for him \u201cto acknowledge the fact that for a long time I was a part of his life\u201d. This feels quite relatable \u2013 and also quite unlikely to happen on the stump in Nuneaton. The most worrying moment for Johnson\u2019s team will have been the bit where Derbyshire told the otherwise elliptic Arcuri she could help him out by saying there was no conflict of interest. Quick as a flash she shot back: \u201cAnd he could help me out. Like, two months ago.\u201d She\u2019d sent him a text, she revealed. \u201cYou wanna read it?\u201d she asked, reaching for her phone. \u201c\u2018Is this the price of loyalty? To be hung up on, ignored and blocked? Why would I remain silent if you can\u2019t even speak to me?\u2019\u201d So there you have Jennifer Arcuri in all her, like, glory \u2013 this election\u2019s picaresque anti-heroine. And I\u2019m afraid we all know what happens to those. In the story of Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, who would definitely have been monstered on GMB, Thomas Hardy is clear: \u201cThe woman pays.\u201d And so with Jennifer of the Arcuris. The woman pays. The prime minister? Nah, seems unlikely. But that\u2019s business. Try not to choke on it.",

Set aside and keep warm. In a large frying pan over a medium/low flame, gently fry the onion in the olive oil and half the butter until starting to soften. Add the pumpkin and a pinch of salt, stir so every cube glistens, then add 100ml water, cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes, or until the pumpkin is soft and there is just a little liquid. Add the chestnuts to the pan, stir and cook for a few minutes, then add the rice and stir again. Taste and salt and pepper to taste. In another pan, melt the butter and fry the sage leaves for 30 seconds, then pour both over the rice, and serve immediately.",

Tensions over the issue of Catalan independence re-erupted last month after Spain\u2019s supreme court jailed nine separatist leaders for sedition for the parts they played in the failed push to secede two years ago. The sentences prompted huge marches and violent unrest on the streets of Barcelona. Torra admitted disobeying Spain\u2019s central electoral board in March when it ordered him to remove a banner reading \u201cFreedom for political prisoners and exiles\u201d from the regional government headquarters in Barcelona. He was also told to take down the yellow ribbons used to express solidarity with jailed Catalan independence leaders. The board described the ribbons as \u201ctools of political propaganda\u201d that breached campaign laws. Torra said he had always known that his refusal to follow the board\u2019s orders would result in him being put on trial. But he argued that the orders were illegal and constituted an unacceptable act of censorship. \u201cYes, I disobeyed the central electoral board because it would have been impossible to obey an illegal order,\u201d he told Catalonia\u2019s high court of justice on Monday morning. \u201cI have many duties as president, and the first is the defence of rights and liberties, and I would never order the removal of a ribbon or a [pro-independence] estelada flag. We\u2019re talking about censorship and the violation of rights.\u201d He refused to answer prosecutors\u2019 questions, replying only to those of his lawyers. If convicted, Torra could be barred from holding public office and handed a heavy fine. Public prosecutors are seeking a 20-month ban and a fine of \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000). The far-right Vox party, which has brought its own \u201cpopular proceedings\u201d under Spanish law, wants a two-year ban and a fine of \u20ac72,000. Torra became Catalan president in May 2018 after his predecessor, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium to avoid arrest over his role in the illegal independence referendum and the regional parliament\u2019s subsequent, unilateral declaration of independence from Spain. Although he has asked for new talks with Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Torra has also threatened to hold another unilateral independence referendum. In December last year, Torra urged Catalans to emulate Slovenia\u2019s path to independence. Slovenia\u2019s declaration of independence in 1991 led to a 10-day war against the Yugoslav army in which dozens of people were killed. The Spanish government has accused Torra\u2019s administration of \u201clying\u201d to the Catalan people by suggesting that independence is possible, and of ignoring the majority of Catalans who want to remain part of Spain. Pro-independence parties have never managed to take 50% of the vote in regional elections.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil corporation has scaled back preparations for its public listing by scrapping plans to market shares in the company to investors outside the Middle East. Saudi Aramco has reportedly ruled out a formal investor roadshow across Asia, the US and Europe just weeks ahead of a planned initial public offering on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange. Aramco\u2019s executives were expected to meet with major institutional investors across the world\u2019s financial centres over the coming weeks to promote the world\u2019s most profitable company in the run-up to its listing early next month. The decision to focus on investors in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf is the latest blow to Aramco\u2019s long-awaited market debut, which was once expected to be the largest in history. Aramco hoped to raise more than $30bn (\u00a323bn) for the government by selling a stake in its vast oil wealth to help modernise the Saudi economy and gain a foothold in the international investment community. The early plans prompted a fevered interest among many international banks and stock exchanges eager to lay claim to a piece of the company. The once secretive oil producer revealed profits of $46.9bn for the first six months of this year, down from $53.2bn in the same period last year but still well ahead of the world\u2019s six biggest listed oil companies combined. Aramco said it produced an average of 13.2m barrels of oil a day in the first half of the year, more than four times the rate of production of rivals such as ExxonMobil, and at the lowest cost in the world. Despite Aramco\u2019s eye-watering profits, interest from global investors has cooled in recent months because of concerns over the company\u2019s ties to the Saudi state and its position at the centre of flaring conflicts in the Gulf region. Major international investors have expressed scepticism over the $2tn valuation set by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, instead estimating its value at between $1.2tn and $1.5tn, according to a poll by Bloomberg. International banks have also come under fire from green groups for undermining global efforts to tackle the climate crisis by supporting the listing of the world\u2019s biggest oil producer. In a letter to bank chief executives, including the bosses of HSBC and Goldman Sachs, 10 environmental groups warned that the listing would lead to \u201cthe biggest single infusion of capital into the fossil fuel industry\u201d in the period since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. A Guardian investigation revealed this year that Aramco was the world\u2019s most polluting company because its oil output had produced about 4.4% of the world\u2019s total carbon dioxide and methane emissions since 1965. The company is also expected to lead the growth in fossil fuel production between 2018 and 2030, the period in which experts have warned that climate action is crucial to prevent runaway global heating. The letter also raised concern over the banks\u2019 eagerness to help raise billions of dollars for Saudi Arabia, \u201cgiven the horrendous human rights record of the Saudi regime\u201d. The latest IPO plans, released on Sunday, confirmed that it would sell up to 1.5% of the company at between 30 and 32 riyal a share, which would value it at between $1.6tn and $1.7tn. At this price the IPO would raise raise $24bn-$25.6bn to help reform the Saudi economy, on a par with the record $25bn raised by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba in 2014.

Gui was one of the five Hong Kong-based publishers and booksellers who disappeared in 2015 having printed books critical of the Chinese government. He reappeared in 2016 in custody, saying on Chinese state television that he had surrendered after fleeing a fatal drink-driving incident 11 years before. Released in 2017 but prevented from leaving China, Gui was seized by plainclothes police while travelling to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats in January 2018. Since being filmed making what supporters believe was a confession under duress, he has been imprisoned. Earlier this month, Swedish PEN announced that it would be giving Gui the Tucholsky prize, named after the German writer Kurt Tucholsky who fled Nazi Germany for Sweden.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To that end, John Lewis suggests a Southampton itinerary that starts with a visit to the upmarket rooftop farm shop, followed by a \u201c15-minute fashion fix and learn[ing] to bake bread in the cookery school\u201d.</p> \n<p>The department store chain\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, said last month it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/01/john-lewis-waitrose-rob-collins-jobs-cut\">merging its management team with Waitrose</a> in a bid to cut costs and boost sales by getting both brands to collaborate more.</p> \n<p>This year\u2019s festive TV commercial, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/14/john-lewis-christmas-ad-excitable-dragon-edgar-waitrose\">which features an excitable baby dragon called Edgar, </a>is its first joint ad with Waitrose.</p> \n<p>The Southampton store is the first to incorporate one of Waitrose\u2019s cookery schools, where courses range from making Japanese street food to \u201cceviche and margaritas\u201d and cost from \u00a310 to \u00a3110.</p> \n<p>To heighten the revamped store\u2019s appeal to foodies, a farm shop and cafe experience courtesy of the Partnership-owned Leckford Estate has been built on the roof.

Friedrich was an IM under the codename \u201cPeter Bernstein\u201d, as documents from the Stasi archives revealed after an investigation.</p> <p>In a joint editorial, Jochen Arntz and Elmar Jehn, the editors of the Berliner Zeitung and the Berliner Kurier, its sister tabloid, said they would be drawing on the advice of experts and talking to witnesses.

      "bodyText": "A German newspaper has been forced to launch an investigation into its new owner after it was revealed he had been an informer for the East German secret police, the Stasi. The Berliner Zeitung, a centre-left daily founded in 1945, said that Holger Friedrich, who bought the ailing publication with his wife, Silke, this year, had promised the journalists his \u201cfull support and cooperation\u201d in their efforts to investigate how involved Friedrich was with the Ministry for State Security, the intelligence arm of the communist East German regime. The Stasi employed more than 90,000 regular workers and 174,000 informal ones, or IMs, whose role was to spy on friends, family and work colleagues and report information to designated handlers. Friedrich was an IM under the codename \u201cPeter Bernstein\u201d, as documents from the Stasi archives revealed after an investigation. In a joint editorial, Jochen Arntz and Elmar Jehn, the editors of the Berliner Zeitung and the Berliner Kurier, its sister tabloid, said they would be drawing on the advice of experts and talking to witnesses. They said they also wanted to know why their new owner had not made known to them his contact with the Stasi when he was in the process of buying the papers. Friedrich has not denied the claims but has urged his critics to view them in context. He said that like many thousands of East German citizens he had been forced to cooperate with the Stasi after a failed attempt to escape the country. Friedrich said he was told he could forgo years in a Stasi prison if he took on the role of an IM. According to documents uncovered by Welt am Sonntag, Friedrich reported on fellow soldiers with whom he worked during military service in the armed forces, the NVA. The paper said documents showed he had delivered a number of heavily incriminating reports on his colleagues. Friedrich has said he was \u201cnot active\u201d in his role as IM and took every opportunity to avoid working for the Stasi. Journalists at the Berliner Zeitung, which has been plunged into crisis by the revelations, are said to be distraught, having initially viewed the millionaire Friedrichs as a saviour after the paper almost collapsed under the ownership of Cologne publishing house M DuMont Schauberg, which has heavy debts and was forced to sell it in September after 10 years. While most newspapers from East Germany ceased publishing after the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago, the Berliner Zeitung secured a prominent position in the highly competitive German media landscape, becoming the only East German daily to do so. But it has had a rocky path, being first bought jointly by Gruner + Jahr along with the late British media mogul Robert Maxwell. Gruner + Jahr later became the sole owners and relaunched it, then sold it on a few years later. In 2005 it was bought by the British Mecon Group and a US concern, despite fierce employee opposition over fears its boss, David Montgomery, was focused on profit, not on journalistic quality. In a comment piece after becoming the latest owner, Friedrich said his vision was to use the newspaper to inject new interest into politics and society and act as a counterweight to \u201cstructural ennui\u201d in Germany as a whole.",

Taken by Blue Note label co-founder Francis Wolff, it shows Hancock in black and white, fresh-faced, sleeves rolled to the elbow and sitting at the piano. One hand is delicately placed on the keys in waiting, while his head is turned over his shoulder looking expectantly for direction. His face tilts into a shaft of light and his skin radiates its glow back to us in its youthful, untroubled smoothness.</p> <p>Here in 1963, Hancock was already recording his third studio album, Inventions &amp; Dimensions, a Latin-fuelled departure from the modal sound that saw the young pianist labelled a prodigy. In his ensuing 56-year career, Hancock has lost none of the calm, learned focus that marks out that early photograph. With his headline performance at London Jazz festival, he continues in the tradition of bringing up younger musicians \u2013 as Davis did with him \u2013 now featuring 24-year-old flautist Elena Pinderhughes.</p> <p>If there is one thing that marks out Hancock\u2019s musical style, it is the genre-eating openness of it, fingering through balladic Bill Evans lines to Joni Mitchell-inspired introspection, George Clinton synth-funk and then back to a hard swing in one passage. This makes the Hancock live experience unpredictable and sometimes frustrating. With Hancock sitting amid his grand piano, synthesisers and keytar, the music changes direction seemingly at will.</p> <p>Opening with a cascading flurry of synths, Hancock switches into an air-tight groove with guitarist Lionel Loueke, both playing percussively, before revealing glimpses of the melody to Butterfly above drummer Justin Tyson\u2019s screaming fills. Longtime Hancock bassist James Genus provides a consistent metronomic grounding no matter how slippery Hancock\u2019s changes get, while Pinderhughes glides through a kaleidoscope of chromatics in her solo breaks. The packed crowd nods along faithfully.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s ultimate strength comes from his sponge-like capacity to absorb the playing styles of his band members into his renditions. Where he was last in London playing with hip-hop producer Terrace Martin to create a swaggering post-bop fusion, here he hits hard and heavy with open-voiced chords, mirroring Tyson\u2019s gospel chops on his Headhunters classic Actual Proof, while softening into a vocoder ballad with Pinderhughes\u2019 honeyed singing on Come Running to Me. Crucially, Hancock gives his band ample space to play, with Genus delivering a beautifully looped harmonic solo and Loueke his signature vocal polyphony during the two-hour set.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/30/herbie-hancock-i-felt-like-i-stood-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-and-now-its-my-turn\">Herbie Hancock: 'I felt like I stood on the shoulders of giants and now it's my turn'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bringing out his keytar and pottering around the stage like a kindly patriarch for crowd-pleasers Cantaloupe Island and Chameleon, Hancock shows that it is possible to play the same songs for over 40 years and still find meaning within the notes, stretching and bending them into new shapes. And therein lies the special appeal of his music: the capacity to always dig deep to find the differing narratives produced by those 88 keys. It is a gentle yet persistent questioning, one heralded by that expectant gaze in 1963 and one that still glints through his glasses now, anticipating the next generation of players sitting with him.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"https://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk/\">London jazz festival </a>continues until 24 November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a well-known photograph of Herbie Hancock aged 23, when he had just joined the Miles Davis Quintet. Taken by Blue Note label co-founder Francis Wolff, it shows Hancock in black and white, fresh-faced, sleeves rolled to the elbow and sitting at the piano. One hand is delicately placed on the keys in waiting, while his head is turned over his shoulder looking expectantly for direction. His face tilts into a shaft of light and his skin radiates its glow back to us in its youthful, untroubled smoothness. Here in 1963, Hancock was already recording his third studio album, Inventions &amp; Dimensions, a Latin-fuelled departure from the modal sound that saw the young pianist labelled a prodigy. In his ensuing 56-year career, Hancock has lost none of the calm, learned focus that marks out that early photograph. With his headline performance at London Jazz festival, he continues in the tradition of bringing up younger musicians \u2013 as Davis did with him \u2013 now featuring 24-year-old flautist Elena Pinderhughes. If there is one thing that marks out Hancock\u2019s musical style, it is the genre-eating openness of it, fingering through balladic Bill Evans lines to Joni Mitchell-inspired introspection, George Clinton synth-funk and then back to a hard swing in one passage. This makes the Hancock live experience unpredictable and sometimes frustrating. With Hancock sitting amid his grand piano, synthesisers and keytar, the music changes direction seemingly at will. Opening with a cascading flurry of synths, Hancock switches into an air-tight groove with guitarist Lionel Loueke, both playing percussively, before revealing glimpses of the melody to Butterfly above drummer Justin Tyson\u2019s screaming fills. Longtime Hancock bassist James Genus provides a consistent metronomic grounding no matter how slippery Hancock\u2019s changes get, while Pinderhughes glides through a kaleidoscope of chromatics in her solo breaks. The packed crowd nods along faithfully. Hancock\u2019s ultimate strength comes from his sponge-like capacity to absorb the playing styles of his band members into his renditions. Where he was last in London playing with hip-hop producer Terrace Martin to create a swaggering post-bop fusion, here he hits hard and heavy with open-voiced chords, mirroring Tyson\u2019s gospel chops on his Headhunters classic Actual Proof, while softening into a vocoder ballad with Pinderhughes\u2019 honeyed singing on Come Running to Me. Crucially, Hancock gives his band ample space to play, with Genus delivering a beautifully looped harmonic solo and Loueke his signature vocal polyphony during the two-hour set. Bringing out his keytar and pottering around the stage like a kindly patriarch for crowd-pleasers Cantaloupe Island and Chameleon, Hancock shows that it is possible to play the same songs for over 40 years and still find meaning within the notes, stretching and bending them into new shapes. And therein lies the special appeal of his music: the capacity to always dig deep to find the differing narratives produced by those 88 keys. It is a gentle yet persistent questioning, one heralded by that expectant gaze in 1963 and one that still glints through his glasses now, anticipating the next generation of players sitting with him. \u2022 The London jazz festival continues until 24 November.",

I\u2019ve got it on my phone.\u201d</p> <p>There is a long pause while the New Zealander, who has just completed 12 years as the coach of Wales and took them to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/27/wales-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">second World Cup semi-final under him last month in Japan</a>, flicks through his emails. The 56-year-old Gatland is a principled man and so, out of respect for Mike Anthony, New Zealand Rugby\u2019s high performance manager, he requests I do not use verbatim quotes from his emailed reply in which he explains his reasons for not putting his name forward as the next All Black coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/01/it-would-break-my-heart-if-wales-went-back-to-doldrums-warren-gatland-says\">Warren Gatland departs Wales warning of backward slide after World Cup defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been such a desire in influential circles in New Zealand rugby for Gatland to get the job that Anthony asked if he would be willing to be considered. As Gatland reads the positive email exchange it becomes obvious that, despite wanting to honour his commitment to coach the Chiefs in Super Rugby and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/10/warren-gatland-to-take-charge-of-lions-for-2021-south-africa-tour-rugby-union\" title=\"\">lead the Lions on their 2021 tour of South Africa</a>, he would like to take charge of the All Blacks eventually. It is also clear the New Zealand hierarchy respect Gatland\u2019s integrity in meeting his existing obligations. The big black door remains ajar until the time is right.</p> <p>Until then, with Wales and the All Blacks having contested the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/01/new-zealand-wales-rugby-world-cup-bronze-final-report-all-blacks-hansen-gatland\" title=\"\">third-place play-off game between the losing semi-finalists</a> earlier this month, the amiable Gatland will prepare for his return home to Waikato. But, in his amiable way, he conveys with a wry wince that he has still not got over thinking what might have been if Wales had reached the final \u2013 having been locked at 16-16 with South Africa after 76 minutes. The Springboks scored a late penalty and went on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">beat England in the final</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI thought if we beat South Africa, even with injuries, I would\u2019ve gone into the game against England feeling we could win the World Cup. There wasn\u2019t that fear factor against England. It would have been different if the All Blacks had won their semi-final. For some of the Welsh players the All Blacks are still on a pedestal because New Zealand\u2019s the one team we haven\u2019t beaten. But against England, psychologically, we would have been confident because the guys have had success and we had an effective gameplan. The results have been 50-50 and knowing you\u2019re capable of beating them makes a massive difference.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of an abrasive semi-final, Gatland believed Wales would win. \u201cAfter 65 minutes I thought there was a shift in momentum. We\u2019d stayed in the fight and our boys have shown they never give up. We were 16-9 down and we showed courage in taking the scrum instead of the penalty. It led to the try that made it 16-all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f568fa4d243dde9d515a063e707ed01eca3e4c41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f568fa4d243dde9d515a063e707ed01eca3e4c41/0_0_4565_3011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales head coach Warren Gatland after Wales\u2019s exit in the semi-final at Yokohama International Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales head coach Warren Gatland after Wales\u2019s exit in the semi-final at Yokohama International Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his excellent <a href=\"https://www.headline.co.uk/titles/warren-gatland/pride-and-passion/9781472252449/\" title=\"\">autobiography</a>, Gatland reveals it was his decision to take the scrum. \u201cWe could have taken the three points,\u201d he says . \u201cBut I thought it was a period where we might get that opportunity for the try. So I got the message down to the team. It\u2019s interesting because you go back to 2015, when we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">beat England in the World Cup</a>, and they made the wrong call. If I had been in charge of England I would have got the message down there straightaway. Take the three points.\u201d</p> <p>England, captained by Chris Robshaw and coached by Stuart Lancaster, were trailing Wales by three points when they kicked a penalty into touch in pursuit of a try. It was a mistake and they were knocked out of the group stages of their home World Cup.</p> <p>\u201cIn our semi-final,\u201d Gatland says, \u201cSouth Africa kept taking three points to keep the scoreboard ticking over. But there are times when, with momentum, you\u2019re better off going for the scrum or the lineout. We got the try and it was 16-16 with six minutes to go. But then South Africa got a penalty. [Handr\u00e9] Pollard kicked it and it wasn\u2019t to be. But I can\u2019t question the effort of our players. I likened it to a sponge. We squeezed every last drop out of Wales.\u201d</p> <p>England also squeezed out something special <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">against New Zealand</a>. \u201cIt was one of the best performances by England I\u2019ve ever seen. They were outstanding. Controlled the game. Defended exceptionally well. Attacked well. It was pretty much the complete performance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gatland then voiced his doubt such a display could be repeated in the final. Eddie Jones, England\u2019s coach, made a sharp riposte when he said Gatland should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/oct/28/enjoy-third-place-play-off-england-eddie-jones-wales-warren-gatland-rugby-world-cup-video\" title=\"\">enjoy his third-place game</a>. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually referring to England,\u201d Gatland says. \u201cAnd Eddie wasn\u2019t being malicious in his comment. Eddie and I often laugh about this because it\u2019s a game. What I meant is that if you look at previous World Cups the only team that has beaten the All Blacks and gone on to win it is Australia. Emotion plays a massive part in big games. It\u2019s very difficult, at the highest level of sport, to be right on the edge emotionally and repeat that the following week.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year Gatland had been direct in suggesting England tend to lose the games that matter most. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it with England before,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost grand-slam games. They lost to us when I coached Ireland. They lost to Wales in a 2013 grand-slam decider. They lost to Wales at home in the World Cup. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">lost to us this year in the Six Nations</a> where I felt whoever won that game would win the championship.\u201d</p> <p>Wales won their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/wales-crush-ireland-win-grand-slam-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">third Grand Slam under Gatland this year</a>. That treble sits alongside his two World Cup semi-finals as a sign of how much he achieved with a side who were in chaos when he took over in 2007. \u201cI thought Wales couldn\u2019t get any worse,\u201d Gatland says, \u201cbut when I first arrived I went to watch the Ospreys train. One of the things that impressed me about the Welsh boys is that they could all catch and pass. They were very skilful because like a lot of southern-hemisphere boys they start playing rugby very young.\u201d</p> <p>Jones, in contrast, told me how the basic skills of England\u2019s players lagged behind the southern hemisphere when he arrived four years ago. He felt it was a consequence of many English players taking up the game later. Gatland agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought the Welsh boys are the most skilful in the northern hemisphere. Apart from the backs, the tight forwards can all catch and pass. Wales is probably the closest country to the southern hemisphere because it\u2019s not a private school game. Rugby\u2019s part of the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b21378bda850bcf78a5ac16a32de1a6e4ccd1fbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b21378bda850bcf78a5ac16a32de1a6e4ccd1fbd/0_0_3500_2509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alun Wyn Jones lifts the 2019 Six Nations Championship, the third and final grand slam of Gatland\u2019s reign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alun Wyn Jones lifts the 2019 Six Nations Championship, the third and final grand slam of Gatland\u2019s reign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is the constant bickering between the regions and the Welsh Rugby Union the most challenging aspect of the job? \u201cYes but Roger Lewis, the chief executive who offered me the position, did a brilliant job from a business perspective. He reduced the debt by identifying that support of the national team was paramount. He put resources into the squad because we were the cash cow that ran the whole game.</p> <p>\u201cIf the national team was successful and the stadium was sold out, everything flowed back into the game, but the disappointing thing was the relationship between the union and the regions. For a number of years it was really toxic. It\u2019s still probably not as good as you\u2019d like. But Wales is so tribal. If they could get harmony between the regions and the union, perhaps with the top players on central contracts, that would have a massive impact. I knew I couldn\u2019t tackle that toxic relationship, so I focused on the team \u2013 and the union helped make sure we trained at the best rugby facilities in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>And if we lost a Test out there \u2013 while England are world champions \u2013 imagine the heat from the media</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gatland has also achieved mightily with the Lions. He was Ian McGeechan\u2019s assistant in South Africa in 2009, and then led the Lions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/06/lions-australia-tour-timeline\" title=\"\">victory in Australia four years later</a> before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/08/new-zealand-british-and-irish-lions-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">the drawn series in New Zealand in 2017</a>. He will coach the Lions against the world champions in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be my fourth Lions tour and three have seen us play the world champions. That adds to the importance of this tour. I thought about the Lions after this World Cup final. It would have been great if England had won from a northern hemisphere point of view. But, looking at it selfishly, would it have been good for the Lions? I think it would have added to the pressure.</p> <p>\u201cYou would have had these questions of: \u2018Why don\u2019t you just pick the whole England squad?\u2019 And if we lost a Test out there \u2013 while England are world champions \u2013 imagine the heat from the media. I\u2019m looking at it now and thinking, actually it\u2019s not the worst outcome, from a Lions perspective, that England didn\u2019t win. It helps that we are playing the world champions.\u201d</p> <p>There is no anti-English bias from the outgoing Wales coach. When I ask Gatland about his potential Lions captain he wonders if Alun Wyn Jones, who is 34, will still be in the frame before stressing the credentials of England\u2019s brilliant 25-year-old lock Maro Itoje. He also suggests Mako Vunipola and Jamie George could do the job. It will be fascinating to see how the next 18 months unfold and Gatland\u2019s enthusiasm is palpable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a07a162e475aeb588ef58e73ff9d98bcee7a8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a07a162e475aeb588ef58e73ff9d98bcee7a8ed/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warren Gatland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gatland says if Wales had reached the World Cup final against England \u2018psychologically, we would have been confident\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love the concept of the Lions. It\u2019s absolutely brilliant and South Africa will embrace it. There\u2019s lots of positive cooperation between the South African Rugby Union and the Lions. I\u2019m still hopeful PRL [Premiership Rugby] will move the date of the [2021] Premiership final to the same day as the Pro 14 final.</p> <p>\u201cThat would give us the best possible preparation but at the moment I\u2019ve got no indication that will happen. We talk about the Lions being the best of the best. Why not give them a reasonable preparation? Surely the clubs can see that if their players go away on a Lions tour, they can come home as superstars. The massive spin-offs for the clubs are obvious.\u201d</p> <p>Gatland smiles when I say he can take a break from northern-hemisphere rugby politics for the next year while he coaches the Chiefs. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming backwards and forwards between New Zealand and the northern hemisphere for a very long time. If you\u2019d told me as a young man I\u2019d spend around 20-odd years in the UK and Ireland, I would never have believed it.\u201d</p> <p>He might yearn to coach the All Blacks one day but Gatland\u2019s love of rugby on this side of the world is obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant, I\u2019ve loved the rugby and I\u2019ve loved the whole experience. It\u2019s been fantastic for my family. The people we\u2019ve met and the friends we\u2019ve made are part of our lives now. That\u2019s the bigger picture and I look on that with maybe even greater satisfaction than all I achieved in rugby over here. It\u2019s been special.\u201d</p> <p><em>Warren Gatland\u2019s Pride and Passion is published by Headline</em></p>",

There has been such a desire in influential circles in New Zealand rugby for Gatland to get the job that Anthony asked if he would be willing to be considered. As Gatland reads the positive email exchange it becomes obvious that, despite wanting to honour his commitment to coach the Chiefs in Super Rugby and then lead the Lions on their 2021 tour of South Africa, he would like to take charge of the All Blacks eventually. It is also clear the New Zealand hierarchy respect Gatland\u2019s integrity in meeting his existing obligations. The big black door remains ajar until the time is right. Until then, with Wales and the All Blacks having contested the third-place play-off game between the losing semi-finalists earlier this month, the amiable Gatland will prepare for his return home to Waikato. But, in his amiable way, he conveys with a wry wince that he has still not got over thinking what might have been if Wales had reached the final \u2013 having been locked at 16-16 with South Africa after 76 minutes. The Springboks scored a late penalty and went on to beat England in the final. \u201cI thought if we beat South Africa, even with injuries, I would\u2019ve gone into the game against England feeling we could win the World Cup. There wasn\u2019t that fear factor against England. It would have been different if the All Blacks had won their semi-final. For some of the Welsh players the All Blacks are still on a pedestal because New Zealand\u2019s the one team we haven\u2019t beaten. But against England, psychologically, we would have been confident because the guys have had success and we had an effective gameplan. The results have been 50-50 and knowing you\u2019re capable of beating them makes a massive difference.\u201d Towards the end of an abrasive semi-final, Gatland believed Wales would win. \u201cAfter 65 minutes I thought there was a shift in momentum. We\u2019d stayed in the fight and our boys have shown they never give up. We were 16-9 down and we showed courage in taking the scrum instead of the penalty. It led to the try that made it 16-all.\u201d In his excellent autobiography, Gatland reveals it was his decision to take the scrum. \u201cWe could have taken the three points,\u201d he says . \u201cBut I thought it was a period where we might get that opportunity for the try. So I got the message down to the team. It\u2019s interesting because you go back to 2015, when we beat England in the World Cup, and they made the wrong call. If I had been in charge of England I would have got the message down there straightaway. Take the three points.\u201d England, captained by Chris Robshaw and coached by Stuart Lancaster, were trailing Wales by three points when they kicked a penalty into touch in pursuit of a try. It was a mistake and they were knocked out of the group stages of their home World Cup. \u201cIn our semi-final,\u201d Gatland says, \u201cSouth Africa kept taking three points to keep the scoreboard ticking over. But there are times when, with momentum, you\u2019re better off going for the scrum or the lineout. We got the try and it was 16-16 with six minutes to go. But then South Africa got a penalty. [Handr\u00e9] Pollard kicked it and it wasn\u2019t to be. But I can\u2019t question the effort of our players. I likened it to a sponge. We squeezed every last drop out of Wales.\u201d England also squeezed out something special against New Zealand. \u201cIt was one of the best performances by England I\u2019ve ever seen. They were outstanding. Controlled the game. Defended exceptionally well. Attacked well. It was pretty much the complete performance.\u201d Gatland then voiced his doubt such a display could be repeated in the final. Eddie Jones, England\u2019s coach, made a sharp riposte when he said Gatland should enjoy his third-place game. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually referring to England,\u201d Gatland says. \u201cAnd Eddie wasn\u2019t being malicious in his comment. Eddie and I often laugh about this because it\u2019s a game. What I meant is that if you look at previous World Cups the only team that has beaten the All Blacks and gone on to win it is Australia. Emotion plays a massive part in big games. It\u2019s very difficult, at the highest level of sport, to be right on the edge emotionally and repeat that the following week.\u201d Earlier this year Gatland had been direct in suggesting England tend to lose the games that matter most. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it with England before,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost grand-slam games. They lost to us when I coached Ireland. They lost to Wales in a 2013 grand-slam decider. They lost to Wales at home in the World Cup. They lost to us this year in the Six Nations where I felt whoever won that game would win the championship.\u201d Wales won their third Grand Slam under Gatland this year. That treble sits alongside his two World Cup semi-finals as a sign of how much he achieved with a side who were in chaos when he took over in 2007. \u201cI thought Wales couldn\u2019t get any worse,\u201d Gatland says, \u201cbut when I first arrived I went to watch the Ospreys train. One of the things that impressed me about the Welsh boys is that they could all catch and pass. They were very skilful because like a lot of southern-hemisphere boys they start playing rugby very young.\u201d Jones, in contrast, told me how the basic skills of England\u2019s players lagged behind the southern hemisphere when he arrived four years ago. He felt it was a consequence of many English players taking up the game later. Gatland agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought the Welsh boys are the most skilful in the northern hemisphere. Apart from the backs, the tight forwards can all catch and pass. Wales is probably the closest country to the southern hemisphere because it\u2019s not a private school game. Rugby\u2019s part of the community.\u201d Is the constant bickering between the regions and the Welsh Rugby Union the most challenging aspect of the job? \u201cYes but Roger Lewis, the chief executive who offered me the position, did a brilliant job from a business perspective. He reduced the debt by identifying that support of the national team was paramount. He put resources into the squad because we were the cash cow that ran the whole game. \u201cIf the national team was successful and the stadium was sold out, everything flowed back into the game, but the disappointing thing was the relationship between the union and the regions. For a number of years it was really toxic. It\u2019s still probably not as good as you\u2019d like. But Wales is so tribal. If they could get harmony between the regions and the union, perhaps with the top players on central contracts, that would have a massive impact. I knew I couldn\u2019t tackle that toxic relationship, so I focused on the team \u2013 and the union helped make sure we trained at the best rugby facilities in the world.\u201d Gatland has also achieved mightily with the Lions. He was Ian McGeechan\u2019s assistant in South Africa in 2009, and then led the Lions to victory in Australia four years later before the drawn series in New Zealand in 2017. He will coach the Lions against the world champions in 2021. \u201cThis will be my fourth Lions tour and three have seen us play the world champions. That adds to the importance of this tour. I thought about the Lions after this World Cup final. It would have been great if England had won from a northern hemisphere point of view. But, looking at it selfishly, would it have been good for the Lions? I think it would have added to the pressure. \u201cYou would have had these questions of: \u2018Why don\u2019t you just pick the whole England squad?\u2019 And if we lost a Test out there \u2013 while England are world champions \u2013 imagine the heat from the media. I\u2019m looking at it now and thinking, actually it\u2019s not the worst outcome, from a Lions perspective, that England didn\u2019t win. It helps that we are playing the world champions.\u201d There is no anti-English bias from the outgoing Wales coach. When I ask Gatland about his potential Lions captain he wonders if Alun Wyn Jones, who is 34, will still be in the frame before stressing the credentials of England\u2019s brilliant 25-year-old lock Maro Itoje. He also suggests Mako Vunipola and Jamie George could do the job. It will be fascinating to see how the next 18 months unfold and Gatland\u2019s enthusiasm is palpable. \u201cI love the concept of the Lions. It\u2019s absolutely brilliant and South Africa will embrace it. There\u2019s lots of positive cooperation between the South African Rugby Union and the Lions. I\u2019m still hopeful PRL [Premiership Rugby] will move the date of the [2021] Premiership final to the same day as the Pro 14 final. \u201cThat would give us the best possible preparation but at the moment I\u2019ve got no indication that will happen. We talk about the Lions being the best of the best. Why not give them a reasonable preparation? Surely the clubs can see that if their players go away on a Lions tour, they can come home as superstars. The massive spin-offs for the clubs are obvious.\u201d Gatland smiles when I say he can take a break from northern-hemisphere rugby politics for the next year while he coaches the Chiefs. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming backwards and forwards between New Zealand and the northern hemisphere for a very long time. If you\u2019d told me as a young man I\u2019d spend around 20-odd years in the UK and Ireland, I would never have believed it.\u201d He might yearn to coach the All Blacks one day but Gatland\u2019s love of rugby on this side of the world is obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant, I\u2019ve loved the rugby and I\u2019ve loved the whole experience. It\u2019s been fantastic for my family. The people we\u2019ve met and the friends we\u2019ve made are part of our lives now. That\u2019s the bigger picture and I look on that with maybe even greater satisfaction than all I achieved in rugby over here. It\u2019s been special.\u201d Warren Gatland\u2019s Pride and Passion is published by Headline",

The decision to offer a \u201cgolden share\u201d to the newly formed Public Interest Foundation (PIF) to \u201cdefend the country\u2019s interests\u201d is likely to increase Kremlin oversight of Yandex, Russia\u2019s largest internet company. Other provisions of the proposal would allow the PIF to temporarily remove Yandex\u2019s management, block a potential acquisition of the company, and nominate two permanent board members. In an email to employees, Yandex\u2019s chief executive, Arkady Volozh, offered assurances that the company would maintain control over its daily operations but said it needed to consider the public importance of its products, which range from maps and traffic data to food delivery and car sharing, adding that \u201cthe public interest now runs through us\u201d. Eight seats on the 11-person board of the PIF will belong to representatives of Russian universities and NGOs, such as the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Most have close ties to the government. Citing many months of discussions, Volozh said the company sought an \u201coptimal solution\u201d for three concerns: \u201cLeaving control of the company in our hands, maintaining the confidence of our international investors in the prospects for Yandex\u2019s business and defending the country\u2019s interests.\u201d Yandex in a statement said the board was not a government body. The proposal would need to be confirmed at a shareholder meeting in December. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has previously tasked government agencies and the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, with preventing the private data of Russian citizens from falling into foreign hands. Russia has also demanded that social media companies such as Facebook place servers in Russia to prevent personal data from being sent outside the country. A \u201cgolden share\u201d in Yandex was previously held by Sberbank, a Russian state bank, and was designed in 2009 just to prevent a foreign takeover of Yandex. \u201cThe \u2018golden share\u2019 did not affect the development of new services then, and it won\u2019t have an effect now,\u201d Volozh wrote. John Boynton, the chairman of the board of of Yandex NV, said the company needed to consider an \u201cevolving regulatory environment\u201d. Yandex\u2019s shares plunged more than 18% in October after the government briefly said it was considering a law to limit foreign ownership in strategic tech firms at 20%.",

The plantations, deep in the pine forests near Ag\u00fcero and Murillo de G\u00e1llego in Arag\u00f3n, could be reached only after a 30-minute drive in a 4x4 vehicle and a further 30 minutes on foot along difficult paths. \u201cThe gang had cut down large areas of pine trees to maximise the amount of space for growing marijuana,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cThey had also adapted gullies to store water, which was then fed to the plantations using pumps, hoses and electrical generators.\u201d Officers found the sites were guarded day and night. \u201cTo do so, the gang had established camps that had everything needed for lengthy stays, including a large supply of non-perishable goods and even a stone oven,\u201d added the statement. \u201cTheir permanent vigils, together with a perfect knowledge of the forests in which they lived, made the investigation on the ground enormously difficult.\u201d The plantations were raided in September. The force said the difficult terrain had meant that 70 officers had been needed to carry the plants to the nearest point reachable by 4x4s. \u201cThe operation has seen the complete dismantling of the six-person gang and the seizure of 16,000 plants weighing a total of 3.5 tonnes,\u201d said the statement. \u201cIt is the biggest seizure to date of marijuana in Arag\u00f3n.\u201d",

The billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has publicly apologised for his past support for the \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d police strategy and its disproportionate impact on people of colour, as he prepares a possible run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. A 55-year-old man in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region has been diagnosed with bubonic plague after eating wild rabbit, the third recorded case of the deadly disease in the country this month.

So prevalent is Iran in Iraq\u2019s affairs that Iranian officers effectively have free rein across key institutions of state and are central to much of the country\u2019s decision-making, according to the cables, which were passed to the Intercept and jointly published with the New York Times. The intelligence haul largely reaffirms the widely known dominant role that Tehran has played inside the borders of its neighbour, but casts new light on how its agents operate and the extent to which each prime minister and cabinet member has been vetted to ensure they are serving the Islamic Republic\u2019s interests. The cables, contained in 700 pages that both news organisations say have been verified, offer a snapshot of political life in Iraq in 2014-15, during the height of the Islamic State insurgency, when Iran stepped up its involvement in Iraq. They reveal that Iran\u2019s ministry of information and security, along with the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, were the two main vehicles for Iran\u2019s influence, identifying and running sources at the most senior levels of government, which kept the country pliant and aligned to Iran\u2019s objectives. Though more than four years old, the cables give a contemporary insight into Iraq\u2019s current political fissures and a protest movement that is threatening the seat of power \u2013 in part inspired by resentment towards Iran\u2019s role in the country. Demonstrators have taken to the streets of Baghdad and southern towns for almost five weeks, railing at systemic corruption and the government\u2019s deference to its neighbour. A violent crackdown over the past fortnight has been led by the Quds Force\u2019s Gen Qassem Suleimani, who has been a prominent figure in Iraqi affairs for at least the past decade and features heavily in the cables. A rivalry between the ministry of information and security and the Quds Force is spelled out with Suleimani seen in one dispatch as potentially using his uniquely powerful role in Iraq to prepare for a political career back home. Suleimani\u2019s presence and influence is peppered throughout the documents, helping lead a battle against Isis, coercing a then transport minister to allow Iranian planes to overfly Iraq with weapons bound for Syria, and spending regular time with government officials.

Today a computer-generated analysis \u2013 \u201cmachine learning\u201d that produces predictive analytics \u2013 can help social workers assess the probability of a child coming on to the at-risk register. It can also help show how they might prevent that happening.</p> <p>But with technological advances come dilemmas unimaginable back in 1989. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/16/child-abuse-algorithms-from-science-fiction-to-cost-cutting-reality\" title=\"\">Is it right for social workers to use computers</a> to help promote the welfare of children in need? If it is right, what data should they draw on to do that? </p> <p>Maris Stratulis, national director of the British Association of Social Workers England, first voiced concerns last year. She remains worried. \u201cMachine learning in social care still raises significant issues about how we want to engage with children and families,\u201d she says. \u201cReports on its use in other countries have shown mixed results including potential unethical profiling of groups of people.\u201d</p> <p>Stratulis is also concerned at the role of profit-making companies in the new techniques. \u201cRather than focusing on learning from machines and algorithms, let\u2019s focus on good, relationship-based social work practice,\u201d she says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/30/the-benefits-of-ai-and-machine-learning\" title=\"\">Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Computer systems enable councils to number-crunch vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, such as police records, housing benefit files, social services, education or \u2013 where it is made available \u2013 the NHS. In children\u2019s services, a council may ask for analysis of specific risk factors which social workers would otherwise not know, such as a family getting behind on the rent, which can then be triangulated with other data such as school attendance.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t decide what databases to trawl \u2013 the client does,\u201d says Wajid Shafiq, chief executive officer at Xantura, a company he set up 11 years ago which has recently been working with Thurrock council and Barking and Dagenham council in east London. \u201cAnd the public sector is very aware of the ethical issues.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/witchcraft-and-black-magic-contribute-to-increase-in-child-abuse\">Witchcraft and black magic contribute to increase in child abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most councils trialling predictive analysis are using commercial organisations to set up and run the analyses. Only one, Essex, is known to be using its own purpose-built database collection. Thurrock is working with Xantura in using data analytics to help, in the words of a council spokesperson, \u201cbetter identify those most in need of help and support, and to reduce the need for statutory interventions\u201d.</p> <p>Such is the sensitivity of the issue, however, that all councils dipping their toes into the machine-learning water are at pains to stress the caution they are adopting. \u201cIt is important to emphasise that data analytics systems are only part of the process,\u201d says the Thurrock spokesperson. \u201cFurther verification and checks are carried out in line with statutory requirements prior to any intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Shafiq says the Thurrock system should be live in the next few months.

      "bodyText": "Technology has advanced enormously in the 30 years since the introduction of the first Children Act, which shaped the UK\u2019s system of child safeguarding. Today a computer-generated analysis \u2013 \u201cmachine learning\u201d that produces predictive analytics \u2013 can help social workers assess the probability of a child coming on to the at-risk register. It can also help show how they might prevent that happening. But with technological advances come dilemmas unimaginable back in 1989. Is it right for social workers to use computers to help promote the welfare of children in need? If it is right, what data should they draw on to do that? Maris Stratulis, national director of the British Association of Social Workers England, first voiced concerns last year. She remains worried. \u201cMachine learning in social care still raises significant issues about how we want to engage with children and families,\u201d she says. \u201cReports on its use in other countries have shown mixed results including potential unethical profiling of groups of people.\u201d Stratulis is also concerned at the role of profit-making companies in the new techniques. \u201cRather than focusing on learning from machines and algorithms, let\u2019s focus on good, relationship-based social work practice,\u201d she says. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI). Computer systems enable councils to number-crunch vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, such as police records, housing benefit files, social services, education or \u2013 where it is made available \u2013 the NHS. In children\u2019s services, a council may ask for analysis of specific risk factors which social workers would otherwise not know, such as a family getting behind on the rent, which can then be triangulated with other data such as school attendance. \u201cWe don\u2019t decide what databases to trawl \u2013 the client does,\u201d says Wajid Shafiq, chief executive officer at Xantura, a company he set up 11 years ago which has recently been working with Thurrock council and Barking and Dagenham council in east London. \u201cAnd the public sector is very aware of the ethical issues.\u201d Most councils trialling predictive analysis are using commercial organisations to set up and run the analyses. Only one, Essex, is known to be using its own purpose-built database collection. Thurrock is working with Xantura in using data analytics to help, in the words of a council spokesperson, \u201cbetter identify those most in need of help and support, and to reduce the need for statutory interventions\u201d. Such is the sensitivity of the issue, however, that all councils dipping their toes into the machine-learning water are at pains to stress the caution they are adopting. \u201cIt is important to emphasise that data analytics systems are only part of the process,\u201d says the Thurrock spokesperson. \u201cFurther verification and checks are carried out in line with statutory requirements prior to any intervention.\u201d Shafiq says the Thurrock system should be live in the next few months. He, too, emphasises that the analyses don\u2019t tell the social workers what to do, but are merely another piece of the toolkit to aid decision-making. Independent social worker Steve Liddicott has advised Xantura on various projects, including Thurrock. He explains that the analysis can help social workers see where a child not already on their radar might be at risk. They can then take steps \u2013 perhaps alerting the child\u2019s school or health visitor \u2013 to prevent matters escalating. Where a child is already known to them, the social worker can use data analysis to consider the intervention most likely to be effective for that child, based on the child\u2019s previous behaviour. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation to say: \u2018Doesn\u2019t the social worker know that anyway?\u2019\u201d says Liddicott. \u201cThey may do, but it\u2019s also helpful to step back and look objectively at what the picture is for this child.\u201d One of Essex\u2019s projects, using in-house predictive analysis, has looked at school readiness.

Ireland have become the Ned Ryerson to his increasingly world weary weatherman; old \u201cNeedle Nose Ned the Head\u201d being the relentlessly cheerful former schoolmate of Connors in Groundhog Day, whose overbearing small-town insurance salesman shtick eventually earns him a haymaker in the chops by way of a greeting. While Ireland have brought most of the familiarity, Denmark have provided the contempt. \u201cIt was a lot of defending on their side and we were trying to attack against 11 players in their own half,\u201d said Eriksen in a withering post-match analysis following one particularly soul-sapping stalemate in Copenhagen, during which Ireland failed to score for their fourth consecutive game. \u201cThey played like this in every game we\u2019ve played. In the second game in Ireland they wanted to go forward but they knew what happened when they went forward so that\u2019s why they were too scared to go forward.\u201d His teammate Thomas Delaney likened Denmark\u2019s attempts to break down the Ireland rearguard to trying to open a tin of baked beans with one\u2019s bare hands. In Groundhog Day, the main protagonist whiled away his time in his supernatural purgatory by becoming fluent at French, mastering jazz piano and becoming an expert ice sculptor. Since Ireland foolishly gave Eriksen the time and space to put in a virtuoso performance in the second leg of a World Cup qualifier won 5-1 by Denmark in Dublin, the one game in five in which Ireland were foolish enough to take the game to their opponents, Martin O\u2019Neill and subsequently Mick McCarthy have conspired to obstruct and frustrate his every attempt at an encore by sabotaging his Rosetta Stone tapes, keyboard and ice pick. Denmark\u2019s Dublin win in 2017 notwithstanding, there have been no discernible signs of either team attempting to better themselves as they became resigned to their respective places in this unlikely circle of footballing hell, their other four encounters having been a series of unbroken deadlocks, just one of one of which featured anything so exciting as a couple of goals. As recently as Friday, Ireland somehow found themselves top of Group E, despite having scored just six goals in seven matches, two of which were against what is to all intents and purposes a 426-metre high limestone ridge on the south coast of Spain. Interim wins for Denmark and Switzerland have rendered their latest encounter with their Scandinavian adversaries in the dangerous realms of the \u201cmust-win\u201d, whereas Denmark rock up in Dublin knowing they need only avoid defeat. \u201cIt would be nice if we\u2019d qualified already but it was unlikely right at the very start,\u201d said Mick McCarthy, who can at least claim to be tainted by association with only one of Ireland\u2019s five recent failures to beat Denmark. \u201cBut needing a draw \u2026 ooh, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d go about that one. Would you just sit back and think: \u2018Well, we\u2019ll soak it up?\u2019 No, not really. Do you go gung-ho and get it done? At least we know what we\u2019ve got to do \u2013 we\u2019ve got to win. There is no other result that\u2019s going to count for us.\u201d The portents are not good. Denmark are unbeaten in their past 23 competitive games (their elimination on penalties at the hands of Croatia at the last World Cup doesn\u2019t count as a defeat in this context), while Ireland have not beaten anyone ranked higher than them by Fifa since seeing off Bosnia and Herzegovina in a Euro play-off win four years ago. \u201cThis is a different team under a different manager; it will not be an easy game,\u201d said Denmark\u2019s manager, \u00c5ge Hareide, who says his team are in Dublin looking for a win. They rarely are easy, either on the eye or for two sides who have come to know each other so well they could sing each other\u2019s national anthems. Once more with feeling, it\u2019s deja vu all over again.",

      "bodyText": "Muslim voters could affect the outcome in more than 30 marginal constituencies in next month\u2019s general election, according to research published as mosques prepare for a nationwide registration drive. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) released a list on Monday of 31 marginal seats in which Muslim voters could have \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmedium\u201d impact. Top of the list is Kensington in west London, where the Labour candidate, Emma Dent Coad, is defending a majority of 20. The Conservatives came second at the last election, but this time there is a strong challenge from the Liberal Democrat candidate, Sam Gyimah. Nine per cent of the constituency\u2019s voting age population is Muslim \u2013 estimated at 5,431, or 271 times Dent Coad\u2019s majority. Also on the list of seats where Muslim votes could have high impact is Dudley North, where the former Labour party member Ian Austin, who has a majority of 22, has called on voters to back Boris Johnson; and Richmond Park, where the Conservative Zac Goldsmith is defending a majority of 45. In both constituencies, 4% of the voting age population is Muslim, or more than 70 times the majority of the sitting MP. Fourteen of the 31 seats are held by Labour, 14 by the Conservatives and three by the SNP. The MCB, the main representative body for Muslims in the UK, is non-partisan. Among the seats is Finchley and Golders Green, where the Conservative Mike Freer is being challenged by the Lib Dem Luciana Berger, who left the Labour party earlier this year over antisemitism. Much of the focus of candidates\u2019 campaigns has been on the local Jewish population \u2013 20% of the total \u2013 but according to the MCB data, 8% of voters are Muslim, translating to 3.5 times Freer\u2019s majority. Harun Khan, the MCB\u2019s secretary general, said: \u201cAs active participants in our society, Muslims \u2013 in all their diversity \u2013 can play a significant role in what may become a close election, and we hope that the parties listen and reach out to Muslim communities across the country to engage on issues of concern.\u201d The MCB said it was focusing on increasing Muslim voter participation and encouraging communities to engage with the election debate. On Friday, mosques and Muslim community organisations will take part in the first national Muslim voter registration day. Zara Mohammed, the MCB\u2019s assistant secretary general, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we all \u2013 young and old \u2013 realise our potential to make change through political participation. Our votes matter. Be it the mosque, community organisation, student society or women\u2019s group, each of us can make a difference.

The Manchester City manager is is just the right kind of studious nerd to be able to grab his tools and bolt the Leipzig centre-back on to his broken defence in time for a renewed tilt at defending their Premier League title in January. The 21-year-old was a target for Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur in the summer and would cost around \u00a350m, which is about the the standard rate when City come calling for a defender. And could City be the club who have had a \u00a313m bid rejected by Barcelona for Ivan Rakitic? Probably not, but reports in Catalonia suggest the Spanish champions want \u00a317m more from the Premier League club who threw a cheeky bid in for the Croatia international recently. Manchester United have had a firm interest in Rakitic this season \u2013 and Arsenal need someone to play in midfield if Granit Xhaka won\u2019t, don\u2019t they? Mind you, they have the hots for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Denis Zakaria, who they plan to bring to the Emirates by offering Xhaka as a sweetener in a deal for the 22-year-old. Xhaka just needs a big hug and he would surely get it if he returned to the club where he once made his name. In other Arsenal news, it says here that Unai Emery has been given a month to save his job. They have Southampton, Norwich, Brighton and West Ham up next, so disgruntled Gunners fans might not get their wish just yet. Manchester United and Arsenal quite literally want a Young goalkeeper, so they will go mano a mano for Hartlepool\u2019s 17-year-old stopper Brad Young. Another 17-year-old who may be on the move is whizzy Wigan forward Joe Gelhardt, who is a target for Chelsea, but Frank Lampard\u2019s finishing school will face competition from Manchester City, Manchester United, Spurs, Everton and Liverpool, who the twinkle-toed scouser grew up supporting. Barcelona have realised that Luis Su\u00e1rez can\u2019t go on playing like the Tasmanian Devil for ever and sporting director Eric Abidal is of the opinion that Lauturo Martin\u00e9z might be able to do a passable impression of the aggressive antipodean marsupial and replace Su\u00e1rez in the team. \u201cHe is a complete player, I think he is performing at a great level,\u201d gushed Abidal, when asked if the 22-year-old Inter striker was a target. Inter may also want to hide Milan Skriniar. The 24-year-old central defender has caught the eye of Real Madrid and Manchester United, who both have cash to burn. Roy Hodgson has \u00a320m in his back pocket and he is determined to spend it in Glasgow. It\u2019s already known that Rangers hot shot Alfredo Morelos is a target for Crystal Palace but Celtic\u2019s Odsonne Edouard has also come bleeping into view on the club\u2019s radar.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I was 23, playing under an Arab moon, by the sea,\u201d says Mike Howlett, recalling a high point of his time with Gong, when the cosmic rockers played a Tunisian festival, in June 1973. That sounds magical \u2013 but then the acid they\u2019d taken triggered flashbacks to a trip Gong had jointly experienced weeks earlier involving the hallucinogen datura.</p> <p>Among the plant\u2019s deranging effects are making things appear that aren\u2019t there \u2013 such as the dead \u2013 and making things that are there disappear. When frontman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/13/daevid-allen\">Daevid Allen</a>\u2019s guitar vanished out of his hands, he took this as a sign that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be on stage and wandered off, leaving the rest of Gong to improvise a singer-less set. \u201cAbout 45 minutes in, though, Daevid rematerialises at the front of the audience \u2013 he\u2019s leaning on the stage right in front of me, still in his crazy makeup and Gong-symbol headpiece, and he\u2019s making all these weird wincing expressions, like he\u2019s analysing and judging each note I\u2019m playing. That freaked me out \u2013 I felt I was hanging by my bass strings over an infinite abyss, and if I got a single note wrong I\u2019d be plunging down.\u201d</p> <p>Gong have been through many incarnations since Allen founded the band 50 years ago, an anniversary marked by a 13-disc box set, Love from Planet Gong, which focuses on their early-70s prime when they were signed to Virgin. Before Gong, Allen was a central figure in <a href=\"https://www.softmachine.org/\">Soft Machine</a>, who were second only to Pink Floyd in the London psychedelic underground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiy5K81qvbg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iiy5K81qvbg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Allen left his native Australia in 1960, a precociously long-haired beatnik and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/22/jazz\">Sun Ra</a> fan. After a stint in bohemian Paris, he arrived in England and became a lodger in a free-and-easy Canterbury house owned by the journalist Honor Wyatt. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/robert-wyatt\">Her 16-year-old son, Robert</a>, fell under Allen\u2019s influence, as did young Wyatt\u2019s friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/20/kevin-ayers\">Kevin Ayers</a>. \u201cI was seen as the beat poet from Australia who scandalised the neighbourhood and led the schoolboys astray,\u201d is how Allen remembered it.</p> <p>He and the schoolboys formed Soft Machine. But Allen\u2019s involvement was cut short when, following a 1967 tour of Europe, he was refused re-entry to the UK. So he returned to Paris, living in a barge on the Seine owned by girlfriend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/gilli-smyth-obituary\">Gilli Smyth</a> and getting caught up in the May 1968 riots. His contribution was antic rather than insurrectionary. Prancing between the students on one side and police on the other, he sang absurdist ditties in a crazy costume, and rather than hurl paving stones at the gendarmes, he handed out teddy bears.</p> <p>The classic Gong sound assembled itself bit by bit as recruits joined the amorphous, ever-shifting ensemble. On the 1969 debut, Magick Brother, and Camembert Electrique (1971), there are echo-laden \u201cspace whispers\u201d from Smyth and flute and sax from <a href=\"http://www.didiermalherbe.com/indexe.html\">Didier Malherbe</a>, a French jazzman Allen discovered playing in a goat herder\u2019s cave behind the poet Robert Graves\u2019s Mallorca home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"537b023ab51b0a8ae54c41f627cb6516fdb775ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537b023ab51b0a8ae54c41f627cb6516fdb775ed/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daevid Allen in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daevid Allen in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simone Cecchetti/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1973\u2019s Flying Teapot \u2013 the first instalment of a Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy recorded for Virgin \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hillage\">Steve Hillage</a>\u2019s spectacular Hendrix-influenced guitar entered the fray along with synth swoops from Tim Blake. Then for Angel\u2019s Egg (1974) \u2013 after his astrologer girlfriend calculated that Gong\u2019s star sign lineup required a Taurean bassist \u2013 Motown fan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Howlett\">Mike Howlett</a> arrived to push the sound in a groovier direction, meshing with the precision hyper-syncopations of new drummer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Moerlen\">Pierre Moerlen</a>.</p> <p>In addition to contributing lead vocals, Allen developed a unique style of \u201cglissando guitar\u201d using a metal bow. But in many ways, says Hillage, \u201cmythology was the main instrument Daevid played. Didier played sax, Daevid played mythology.\u201d The Gong mythos was a fantastical sci-fi narrative involving the peaceful Planet Gong, its small green inhabitants, the Pothead Pixies, and their healing gurus the Octave Doctors. The Pixies had propellers on their heads that doubled as aerials tuned into the telepathic transmissions of Radio Gnome Invisible (an interstellar pirate radio station) and they travelled by \u201cglidding\u201d in flying teapots (a stoner-friendly joke on flying saucers).</p> <p>Allen extended this whimsical fantasy not just through lyrics but line-drawings daubed over the record sleeves. \u201cGong originally grew out of experiments that Daevid and Gilli did in Paris around 1967 or 68, and at that time in France there was a huge boom for <em>bandes dessin\u00e9es</em> \u2013 what we call graphic novels,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cDaevid\u2019s drawings really came out of that comic-book style.\u201d They also parallel the artwork done by Pedro Bell for Parliament-Funkadelic and by Barney Bubbles for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/27/hawkwind-dave-brock\">Hawkwind</a> \u2013 contemporaries who similarly wrapped an allegory of cosmic liberation around their music.</p> <p>Gong were visually potent as a live experience, too. Capering in his wispy, gingery beard and pointy hat, the singer resembled Catweazle (from the children\u2019s TV series about an 11th-century wizard). Hillage\u2019s arrival as lead guitarist allowed Allen to concentrate on what he called \u201caudience connection and ritual theatrics\u201d. Another focal figure on stage was Smyth, who, recalls Howlett, \u201cwore fantastic costumes and projected this earth-mother-slash-witch trip. She couldn\u2019t really sing, but with the \u2018space whispers\u2019 she developed this whole new style of vocal that didn\u2019t exist before. She\u2019d incant poetry and spin out certain words with long echo, using a special switch on her microphone.\u201d</p> <p>For much of the early 70s, Gong lived communally in a run-down hunting lodge in the middle of a French forest. \u201cThere was this fantastic large room we called <em>le grand salle</em> that became our permanent practice place,\u201d recalls Hillage. Angel\u2019s Egg was recorded there, with some members of the group playing out in the surrounding woods, experimenting with \u201ctree echo\u201d. Much of the time the group were writing and recording in altered states.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c32252b68dd771658084e8ce9dda93a6fb10a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c32252b68dd771658084e8ce9dda93a6fb10a62/106_97_2804_1859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ritual theatrics ...

Gong in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virgin Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the locals tolerated the hairy oddball visitors, the druggy escapades indirectly led to Gong losing the house. \u201cWe had a raid, but it wasn\u2019t the police, it was the customs, looking for <em>carnet</em> infringements, equipment we\u2019d shipped over,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cBut they found some drug paraphernalia. It all got a bit difficult.\u201d So Gong moved to another communal setup in Oxfordshire, near Virgin\u2019s Manor studio, where they recorded You, the final instalment of the Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy.</p> <p>Released in October 1974, that album sold more than 100,000 copies. Gong were on the verge of becoming the Grateful Dead of Europe, a trip band who could play sell-out concerts and appear high on the bill of commercial and free festivals alike, catering to a surprisingly large constituency of \u201cfreeks\u201d who \u2013 even on the eve of punk \u2013 were carrying on like 1967 never ended. But then things fell apart.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all very strong personalities, with very different ideas, and when it worked we made a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cBut it was a combustible mix.\u201d A schism formed between the \u201clyrics\u201d faction and those who wanted to pursue an instrumental, jazz-rock direction. The latter, led by the classically-trained percussionist Moerlen, wanted to jettison what they deemed to be the distracting frivolousness of Allen\u2019s mythology. Allen and Smyth left abruptly in April 1975, retreating to their cottage in Deya, Mallorca. Hillage didn\u2019t stick around much longer.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I was 23, playing under an Arab moon, by the sea,\u201d says Mike Howlett, recalling a high point of his time with Gong, when the cosmic rockers played a Tunisian festival, in June 1973. That sounds magical \u2013 but then the acid they\u2019d taken triggered flashbacks to a trip Gong had jointly experienced weeks earlier involving the hallucinogen datura. Among the plant\u2019s deranging effects are making things appear that aren\u2019t there \u2013 such as the dead \u2013 and making things that are there disappear. When frontman Daevid Allen\u2019s guitar vanished out of his hands, he took this as a sign that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be on stage and wandered off, leaving the rest of Gong to improvise a singer-less set. \u201cAbout 45 minutes in, though, Daevid rematerialises at the front of the audience \u2013 he\u2019s leaning on the stage right in front of me, still in his crazy makeup and Gong-symbol headpiece, and he\u2019s making all these weird wincing expressions, like he\u2019s analysing and judging each note I\u2019m playing. That freaked me out \u2013 I felt I was hanging by my bass strings over an infinite abyss, and if I got a single note wrong I\u2019d be plunging down.\u201d Gong have been through many incarnations since Allen founded the band 50 years ago, an anniversary marked by a 13-disc box set, Love from Planet Gong, which focuses on their early-70s prime when they were signed to Virgin. Before Gong, Allen was a central figure in Soft Machine, who were second only to Pink Floyd in the London psychedelic underground. Allen left his native Australia in 1960, a precociously long-haired beatnik and Sun Ra fan. After a stint in bohemian Paris, he arrived in England and became a lodger in a free-and-easy Canterbury house owned by the journalist Honor Wyatt. Her 16-year-old son, Robert, fell under Allen\u2019s influence, as did young Wyatt\u2019s friend, Kevin Ayers. \u201cI was seen as the beat poet from Australia who scandalised the neighbourhood and led the schoolboys astray,\u201d is how Allen remembered it. He and the schoolboys formed Soft Machine. But Allen\u2019s involvement was cut short when, following a 1967 tour of Europe, he was refused re-entry to the UK. So he returned to Paris, living in a barge on the Seine owned by girlfriend Gilli Smyth and getting caught up in the May 1968 riots. His contribution was antic rather than insurrectionary. Prancing between the students on one side and police on the other, he sang absurdist ditties in a crazy costume, and rather than hurl paving stones at the gendarmes, he handed out teddy bears. The classic Gong sound assembled itself bit by bit as recruits joined the amorphous, ever-shifting ensemble. On the 1969 debut, Magick Brother, and Camembert Electrique (1971), there are echo-laden \u201cspace whispers\u201d from Smyth and flute and sax from Didier Malherbe, a French jazzman Allen discovered playing in a goat herder\u2019s cave behind the poet Robert Graves\u2019s Mallorca home. By 1973\u2019s Flying Teapot \u2013 the first instalment of a Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy recorded for Virgin \u2013 Steve Hillage\u2019s spectacular Hendrix-influenced guitar entered the fray along with synth swoops from Tim Blake. Then for Angel\u2019s Egg (1974) \u2013 after his astrologer girlfriend calculated that Gong\u2019s star sign lineup required a Taurean bassist \u2013 Motown fan Mike Howlett arrived to push the sound in a groovier direction, meshing with the precision hyper-syncopations of new drummer Pierre Moerlen. In addition to contributing lead vocals, Allen developed a unique style of \u201cglissando guitar\u201d using a metal bow. But in many ways, says Hillage, \u201cmythology was the main instrument Daevid played. Didier played sax, Daevid played mythology.\u201d The Gong mythos was a fantastical sci-fi narrative involving the peaceful Planet Gong, its small green inhabitants, the Pothead Pixies, and their healing gurus the Octave Doctors. The Pixies had propellers on their heads that doubled as aerials tuned into the telepathic transmissions of Radio Gnome Invisible (an interstellar pirate radio station) and they travelled by \u201cglidding\u201d in flying teapots (a stoner-friendly joke on flying saucers). Allen extended this whimsical fantasy not just through lyrics but line-drawings daubed over the record sleeves. \u201cGong originally grew out of experiments that Daevid and Gilli did in Paris around 1967 or 68, and at that time in France there was a huge boom for bandes dessin\u00e9es \u2013 what we call graphic novels,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cDaevid\u2019s drawings really came out of that comic-book style.\u201d They also parallel the artwork done by Pedro Bell for Parliament-Funkadelic and by Barney Bubbles for Hawkwind \u2013 contemporaries who similarly wrapped an allegory of cosmic liberation around their music. Gong were visually potent as a live experience, too. Capering in his wispy, gingery beard and pointy hat, the singer resembled Catweazle (from the children\u2019s TV series about an 11th-century wizard). Hillage\u2019s arrival as lead guitarist allowed Allen to concentrate on what he called \u201caudience connection and ritual theatrics\u201d. Another focal figure on stage was Smyth, who, recalls Howlett, \u201cwore fantastic costumes and projected this earth-mother-slash-witch trip. She couldn\u2019t really sing, but with the \u2018space whispers\u2019 she developed this whole new style of vocal that didn\u2019t exist before. She\u2019d incant poetry and spin out certain words with long echo, using a special switch on her microphone.\u201d For much of the early 70s, Gong lived communally in a run-down hunting lodge in the middle of a French forest. \u201cThere was this fantastic large room we called le grand salle that became our permanent practice place,\u201d recalls Hillage. Angel\u2019s Egg was recorded there, with some members of the group playing out in the surrounding woods, experimenting with \u201ctree echo\u201d. Much of the time the group were writing and recording in altered states. Although the locals tolerated the hairy oddball visitors, the druggy escapades indirectly led to Gong losing the house. \u201cWe had a raid, but it wasn\u2019t the police, it was the customs, looking for carnet infringements, equipment we\u2019d shipped over,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cBut they found some drug paraphernalia. It all got a bit difficult.\u201d So Gong moved to another communal setup in Oxfordshire, near Virgin\u2019s Manor studio, where they recorded You, the final instalment of the Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy. Released in October 1974, that album sold more than 100,000 copies. Gong were on the verge of becoming the Grateful Dead of Europe, a trip band who could play sell-out concerts and appear high on the bill of commercial and free festivals alike, catering to a surprisingly large constituency of \u201cfreeks\u201d who \u2013 even on the eve of punk \u2013 were carrying on like 1967 never ended. But then things fell apart. \u201cWe were all very strong personalities, with very different ideas, and when it worked we made a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts,\u201d says Hillage. \u201cBut it was a combustible mix.\u201d A schism formed between the \u201clyrics\u201d faction and those who wanted to pursue an instrumental, jazz-rock direction. The latter, led by the classically-trained percussionist Moerlen, wanted to jettison what they deemed to be the distracting frivolousness of Allen\u2019s mythology. Allen and Smyth left abruptly in April 1975, retreating to their cottage in Deya, Mallorca. Hillage didn\u2019t stick around much longer. Howlett stayed for the slick fusion of Shamal, supplying vocals and lyrics in a vain attempt to preserve some of the old Gong, before bailing out. \u201cI missed Daevid greatly when he left. It was a big shock for me,\u201d recalls Hillage. \u201cI had great admiration for the way he blended quirky humour with philosophy and spiritual seriousness.\u201d Hillage carried on flying the freak flag in his solo career, then produced Simple Minds, and in the 90s immersed himself in rave culture, collaborating with the Orb and forming his own techno outfit, System 7. Howlett reinvented himself as a leading new wave producer, working with OMD and A Flock of Seagulls among others. Gong reconfigured and reunited many times over the ensuing decades. Allen was still fronting a version of the group when he died in 2015. That incarnation, which contains no original members, continues to release records and tour. \u201cIt was Daevid\u2019s absolute adamant dying wish that the band he\u2019d been playing with carry on,\u201d says Hillage. According to Howlett, \u201cDaevid saw Gong as an institution, not dependent on any person. People could join, contribute, move on \u2013 but the institution would abide.\u201d \u201cInstitution\u201d is an odd word to describe anything to do with an instinctive anarchist like Allen \u2013 someone whom Howlett remembers setting fire to a \u00a320 note to make a point. \u201cHe was the founder of Gong, but not the leader - none of us liked the concept of leaders, and especially not Daevid,\u201d says Hillage, who describes Allen \u2013 15 years his senior \u2013 as more like an older brother than a father figure.

Something good happens when the anxiety to impress is removed, and an architect or builder can just get on with solving a practical problem with a degree of grace. So it is with most of the structures in Slacklands 2 in which the architectural curator and teacher Corinna Dean follows up her 2014 book Slacklands with further images of what she calls \u201crural contemporary architecture of the 20th century\u201d.

      "body": "<p>\u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d The phrase certainly has a powerful ring to it. More than that, it fulfils two obvious electoral purposes. It avoids political discussion of what \u201cdoing Brexit\u201d might actually involve. And, more practically, it provides a phrase that can be memorised and repeated ad nauseum on rainy doorsteps and in online advertisements. After three years of Brexit debate, as the UK has tried and failed to leave the European Union, why wouldn\u2019t it strike a chord?</p> <p>What, then, is the problem? The simple answer is that it\u2019s profoundly misleading. Let\u2019s assume \u2013 and it\u2019s quite an assumption \u2013 that things go smoothly for the government. Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-general-election-gamble\" title=\"\">electoral gamble</a> pays off. He comes back on 13 December at the head of a majority government. At that point, he may still struggle to \u201cbang Brexit through\u201d by Christmas because parliament resumes sitting only on 17 December, and then there is the small matter of swearing in 650 MPs, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/queens-speech\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s speech</a> and subsequent debate. However, with a majority, he should be able to pass his withdrawal agreement bill in order that the UK finally leaves the European Union on 31 January.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from \u201cdone\u201d. Exit will represent the end of stage one, the point at which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state of the European Union. It then goes into an 11-month holding pattern known as transition, which expires on 31 December 2020.</p> <p>And now for some semantics. This government and its predecessor have insisted on using the phrase \u201cimplementation period\u201d to describe transition and that is the wording which appears in the bill. The reference to implementation is, to say the least, profoundly misleading. Why? Because we have absolutely nothing to implement. Instead, this period will be used for trying to sort out the future relationship between the UK and the EU.</p> <p>Researchers at the Institute for Government have provided a good guide as to how long these negotiations typically take (about four years). To summarise, when you look at recent free-trade agreements signed by the European Union, it becomes clear that an 11-month transition period is simply too short to allow for negotiation.</p> <p>It is true that the time it takes to negotiate a deal will hinge on what kind of deal the parties want. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has accepted that a \u201cbasic free-trade deal\u201d could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers\u2019 rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d trade deal. One can only wonder what kind of class it has in mind.</p> <p>And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combatting international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time \u2013 maybe years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cbd8e66caa217e77079f8fa60fa73ef71ba4132\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cbd8e66caa217e77079f8fa60fa73ef71ba4132/0_262_4848_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorries queue up at the port of Dover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards.\u2019 Lorries queue up at the port of Dover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This brings us back to the reality that 11 months of transition will simply not be enough.

      "body": "<p><br>Let\u2019s get this out of the way first: there\u2019s no way a non-call ended up costing the Houston Texans the game on Sunday. The Texans ended up losing to the Baltimore Ravens 41-7 for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that Lamar Jackson <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/17/20969548/baltimore-ravens-defense-houston-texans-lamar-jackson\">threw for four touchdowns</a>. Still though, there\u2019s every reason for the Texans to be upset that NFL officials refused to make a clear pass interference call despite the benefit of reviewing the play.</p> <p>The play in question came when Baltimore cornerback Marlon Humphrey grabbed Houston wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in the end zone to break up a pass. Although the ruling on the field was an incomplete pass, Texans head coach Bill O\u2019Brien challenged the call. Despite being about as clear cut of an example of defensive pass interference as one will find, the officials \u2013 as has been the norm since the NFL gave coaches the ability to challenge PI \u2013 declined to penalize the Ravens. If O\u2019Brien had successfully challenged, the Texans would have had a first down on the Baltimore one-yard line, pretty much the ideal situation for them to pick up seven points. Instead, the team lost a time out and they failed to score.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/byDavidGardner/status/1196133566473740288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Replay Officials: That doesn\u2019t look like anything to me <a href=\"https://t.co/P6DQISI2u4\">pic.twitter.com/P6DQISI2u4</a></p>&mdash; David Gardner (@byDavidGardner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/byDavidGardner/status/1196133566473740288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI have no idea what pass interference is anymore,\u201d O\u2019Brien <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/17/20969548/baltimore-ravens-defense-houston-texans-lamar-jackson\">said after the game</a>, with the very clear implication that he wasn\u2019t the one who was confused about the definition.</p> <p>It was not the best day for the officials, as the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 27-23 comeback win over the Denver Broncos was also marred by a no-call, this time on the final play of the game. Broncos fans were quick to jump online to <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/11/vikings-broncos-no-pass-interference-call-on-final-play\">express their outrage</a>, but at least, in this case, they didn\u2019t have to see officials miss the call twice.</p> <p>It\u2019s the failure of the challenge system, however, that seems to be a larger source of frustration. Hopkins went out of his way <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/texans/2019/11/17/nfl-pass-interference-deande-hopkins-houston-texans/4225076002/\">to call out</a> NFL vice president of officiating Al Riveron. \u201cAs a leader in the NFL,\u201d Hopkins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeAndreHopkins/status/1196181477488246790\">tweeted out</a>, \u201cwe need someone new in New York deciding calls.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/upset-at-nfl-colin-kaepernick-moves-scheduled-tryout\">'Stop running from the truth' Colin Kaepernick calls out NFL after tryout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This could all sound like sour grapes from a team that were pretty much demolished on the field after the call. Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28103490/texans-deandre-hopkins-need-new-deciding-pi-calls\"> remarks</a> that \u201cit could have been a changing point of the game. A momentum switch,\u201d ignored the fact that this was a one-sided game and it\u2019s hard to imagine an early touchdown making that much of a difference. That shouldn\u2019t distract from the reality that Hopkins is 100% right. Before Sunday night, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28101432/stop-challenging-pass-interference-nfl-coaches-why-just-wasting-outs\">coaches lost 32 of their last 33 challenges</a> of pass interference calls. Now, as with all challenges in the NFL, a healthy percentage of those flags were doomed to begin with, so it\u2019s understandable if a majority of the calls stand.</p> <p>However, the overwhelming numbers make it clear that the referees simply are not going to overturn pass interference calls or non-calls that meet the criteria of \u201cclear and obvious visual evidence\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/nfl-new-pass-interference-review-rule-explained\">The rule change</a> was supposed to at least give officials an out, a way to prevent game-changing mistakes like the missed call that occurred in the fourth quarter of the NFC Championship Game last season. Instead, it appears that officials are more concerned about preserving the illusion of their own infallibility.</p> <p>If this continues to be the case, it\u2019s hard to see the NFL keeping the pass interference challenge rule around as is. At some point, coaches are going to just hang on and use their flags for situations where they stand a decent chance of coming out ahead. The discontent around the league could be enough for the NFL to scrap the experiment after a single season.</p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2> <p><strong>49,383</strong>. That\u2019s the number of yards thrown by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan in his career after a 311-yard performance in Sunday\u2019s 29-3 victory over the Carolina Panthers. It vaulted him over <a href=\"https://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/matt-ryan-passes-warren-moon-moves-into-top-10-for-all-time-passing-yards\">Warren Moon\u2019s 49,325 passing yards</a>, and into 10th on the NFL\u2019s all-time list. It\u2019s a reminder of how great the 2016 MVP has been despite the fact that he\u2019s often been overshadowed by the era\u2019s other brilliant quarterbacks.</p> <h2>MVP of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d4f374c0e94a04b4cf222e6d8e6d4870e539677\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4f374c0e94a04b4cf222e6d8e6d4870e539677/0_49_2609_1566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamal Adams celebrates one of his three sacks on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamal Adams celebrates one of his three sacks on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jamal Adams, safety, New York Jets</strong>.

In fact, he posted a three-minute video alleging that Kaepernick changing his workout venue to a high school stadium was evidence that the long-exiled quarterback has no interest in returning to football. That conclusion led to a response from Kaepernick\u2019s close friend Eric Reid, <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/11/stephen-a-smith-eric-reid-colin-kaepernick-workout-nfl-response\">who accused Smith</a> of \u201ctap dancing for the NFL.\u201d</p> <p>An interesting sidenote: Smith\u2019s thoughts are apparently echoed by Jay-Z, who reportedly pressured the NFL to hold the initial tryout. A source <a href=\"https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/jay-z-disappointed-colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-publicity-stunt/\">has told XXL</a> that the rapper, who officially partnered with the league during the offseason, believes that \u201cKaepernick turned a \u2018legitimate workout\u2019 into a publicity stunt.\u201d Of course, if you ask those whose interests aren\u2019t in-line with the league\u2019s, the legitimacy of the whole affair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-sham\">felt highly questionable</a> from the start.</p> <h2>Video of the week<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Cowboys_Videos/status/1196166937497264138\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Zeke TD and the Dak celebration! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DALvsDET?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DALvsDET</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CszFeVGKSc\">pic.twitter.com/CszFeVGKSc</a></p>&mdash; Cowboys Videos (@Cowboys_Videos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cowboys_Videos/status/1196166937497264138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot does quite a bit in this touchdown.

Prescott himself had a great day, throwing for 444 yards during the 35-27 win over the Detroit Lions.</p> <h2>Elsewhere around the league</h2> <p>-- A couple of great comebacks that could prove crucial later in the season. The San Francisco 49ers spurned more than a few chances to beat the Seattle Seahawks last week. On Sunday they found themselves 16-0 down to the Arizona Cardinals and it would have been easy for them to crumble after the events of the Seahawks game, but this time they came back to win 36-26. The Minnesota Vikings had an even better rally \u2013 they overcame a 20-point deficit against the Denver Broncos, and stayed in the race in the NFC North.</p> <p>-- The Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 bid for a Completely Defeated Season continues thanks to a 17-10 loss to the Oakland Raiders. At 0-10 they are now \u201cahead\u201d of 1-9 Washington for the worst record in the league, and very well may end up going completely winless. In either case, the top pick in the 2020 draft is theirs to lose.</p> <p>-- Nick Foles returned to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars against the Indianapolis Colts, but the change from Gardner Minshew didn\u2019t end up helping the Jags offense: they lost 33-13. With the win, and the Texans\u2019 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the 6-4 Colts managed to secure first place in the AFC South thanks to owning the tiebreaker, but they did lose running back Marlon Mack to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28101819/source-colts-rb-marlon-mack-suffers-fractured-hand\">a fractured hand</a> in the process.</p> <p>-- Thanks to their 37-20 win over the Miami Dolphins, the Buffalo Bills have very quietly built themselves a 7-3 record, which would make them the fifth seed in the AFC if the postseason began today. It would be easy to dismiss their record as partly the result of sharing the AFC East with the 2-8 Dolphins (who they have beaten twice) and the 3-7 New York Jets (who they have beaten once and will see again), but then again one could say that about the New England Patriots.</p> <p>-- Speaking of those Patriots, maybe Julian Edelman should have been in as quarterback on Sunday. The Patriots managed only one touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl LII rematch and it didn\u2019t come from Tom Brady. Instead, Brady pitched a lateral to Edelman \u2013 who played QB during college \u2013 and the receiver promptly threw to Phillip Dorset in the end zone to put New England up 17-10. It turns out that would be the last scoring play as the Patriots defense took over the game in the second half. The 9-1 Patriots remain tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the best record in the league.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1196207070544044032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Julian Edelman threw a rope on this TD pass \ud83d\udd25<br><br>(via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFL</a>)<a href=\"https://t.co/jpropN8VTn\">pic.twitter.com/jpropN8VTn</a></p>&mdash; SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1196207070544044032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s get this out of the way first: there\u2019s no way a non-call ended up costing the Houston Texans the game on Sunday. The Texans ended up losing to the Baltimore Ravens 41-7 for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that Lamar Jackson threw for four touchdowns. Still though, there\u2019s every reason for the Texans to be upset that NFL officials refused to make a clear pass interference call despite the benefit of reviewing the play. The play in question came when Baltimore cornerback Marlon Humphrey grabbed Houston wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in the end zone to break up a pass. Although the ruling on the field was an incomplete pass, Texans head coach Bill O\u2019Brien challenged the call. Despite being about as clear cut of an example of defensive pass interference as one will find, the officials \u2013 as has been the norm since the NFL gave coaches the ability to challenge PI \u2013 declined to penalize the Ravens. If O\u2019Brien had successfully challenged, the Texans would have had a first down on the Baltimore one-yard line, pretty much the ideal situation for them to pick up seven points. Instead, the team lost a time out and they failed to score. \u201cI have no idea what pass interference is anymore,\u201d O\u2019Brien said after the game, with the very clear implication that he wasn\u2019t the one who was confused about the definition. It was not the best day for the officials, as the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 27-23 comeback win over the Denver Broncos was also marred by a no-call, this time on the final play of the game. Broncos fans were quick to jump online to express their outrage, but at least, in this case, they didn\u2019t have to see officials miss the call twice. It\u2019s the failure of the challenge system, however, that seems to be a larger source of frustration. Hopkins went out of his way to call out NFL vice president of officiating Al Riveron. \u201cAs a leader in the NFL,\u201d Hopkins tweeted out, \u201cwe need someone new in New York deciding calls.\u201d This could all sound like sour grapes from a team that were pretty much demolished on the field after the call. Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson\u2019s remarks that \u201cit could have been a changing point of the game. A momentum switch,\u201d ignored the fact that this was a one-sided game and it\u2019s hard to imagine an early touchdown making that much of a difference. That shouldn\u2019t distract from the reality that Hopkins is 100% right. Before Sunday night, coaches lost 32 of their last 33 challenges of pass interference calls. Now, as with all challenges in the NFL, a healthy percentage of those flags were doomed to begin with, so it\u2019s understandable if a majority of the calls stand. However, the overwhelming numbers make it clear that the referees simply are not going to overturn pass interference calls or non-calls that meet the criteria of \u201cclear and obvious visual evidence\u201d. The rule change was supposed to at least give officials an out, a way to prevent game-changing mistakes like the missed call that occurred in the fourth quarter of the NFC Championship Game last season. Instead, it appears that officials are more concerned about preserving the illusion of their own infallibility. If this continues to be the case, it\u2019s hard to see the NFL keeping the pass interference challenge rule around as is. At some point, coaches are going to just hang on and use their flags for situations where they stand a decent chance of coming out ahead. The discontent around the league could be enough for the NFL to scrap the experiment after a single season. Stat of the week 49,383. That\u2019s the number of yards thrown by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan in his career after a 311-yard performance in Sunday\u2019s 29-3 victory over the Carolina Panthers. It vaulted him over Warren Moon\u2019s 49,325 passing yards, and into 10th on the NFL\u2019s all-time list. It\u2019s a reminder of how great the 2016 MVP has been despite the fact that he\u2019s often been overshadowed by the era\u2019s other brilliant quarterbacks. MVP of the week Jamal Adams, safety, New York Jets. The 24-year-old picked up three sacks during the Jets\u2019 34-17 win over Washington. Adrian Wilson set the record for sacks by a safety in a season when he managed eight in 2005. Adams has five in the last two games. Quote of the week \u201cHe don\u2019t want to play\u201d \u2013 ESPN talking head Stephen A Smith on Colin Kaepernick\u2019s last-minute decision to change the location of his NFL workouts on Saturday. As usual, Smith had quite a bit more to say than that. In fact, he posted a three-minute video alleging that Kaepernick changing his workout venue to a high school stadium was evidence that the long-exiled quarterback has no interest in returning to football. That conclusion led to a response from Kaepernick\u2019s close friend Eric Reid, who accused Smith of \u201ctap dancing for the NFL.\u201d An interesting sidenote: Smith\u2019s thoughts are apparently echoed by Jay-Z, who reportedly pressured the NFL to hold the initial tryout. A source has told XXL that the rapper, who officially partnered with the league during the offseason, believes that \u201cKaepernick turned a \u2018legitimate workout\u2019 into a publicity stunt.\u201d Of course, if you ask those whose interests aren\u2019t in-line with the league\u2019s, the legitimacy of the whole affair felt highly questionable from the start. Video of the week Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot does quite a bit in this touchdown. First, there\u2019s the catch itself where Elliott scoops up a low throw from Dak Prescott before taking off. Then there\u2019s the celebration, in which he imitates Prescott\u2019s pregame dance that went viral last week.

      "body": "<p>We know we\u2019re living through a period of crisis, but it\u2019s sometimes hard to know of what kind. The financial crash of 2007-8 seemed to mark the beginning of the most recent crisis of capitalism; 2016 brought news of a crisis of democracy, and the political and constitutional crisis created by Brexit marks its second act. Every day the climate crisis heats up. Crisis has become the new normal.</p> <p>It\u2019s often said that we are also witnessing a crisis of liberalism: liberal norms are being eroded, institutions are under threat, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe\" title=\"\">across Europe, parties of the centre are haemorrhaging votes</a>. Meanwhile, the critics of centrism are louder than they have been for years. Even many in the mainstream of British politics have begun to acknowledge that in the past decade centrists have been neoliberalism\u2019s willing bedfellows, supporting policies to shrink the welfare state and crush unions. Liberal centrism has \u201cleft people behind\u201d, and in its support for free markets and globalisation, created new forms of exclusion. More damning critiques are also gaining currency: that the \u201cliberal\u201d way of running politics was always bound up with imperialism and colonialism, sceptical of democracy and workers and a cover for capitalist exploitation. Even the Financial Times \u2013 the pinnacle of economic liberalism \u2013 recently argued that the capitalist model needs to be \u201creset \u201d.</p> <p>So liberal centrists aren\u2019t wrong that their institutions, parties and ideas are being challenged. But the problem may be a deeper one: that the categories of mainstream politics as we know it can no longer explain the world.</p> <p>As an ideology, liberalism can be hard to pin down. It\u2019s capacious and it has adapted throughout history. From John Locke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/john-maynard-keynes-a-great-economist-but-poor-currency-trader\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, liberals have prioritised the values of liberty and equality (though they\u2019ve disagreed about how much the latter matters to the former and what those values mean in everyday politics). They have supported the rule of law, rights and representation, as well as private property, markets and, for the most part, capitalism against socialism. During the cold war, liberals often defended the status quo, seeing a slide into totalitarianism behind every scheme for political change. There is a long liberal tradition of attacking the left to defend the centre. In the 1980s, a faction of Labour MPs left the party to found the SDP. In the 90s, as New Labour disciplined the party\u2019s left wing, liberalism took the form of the Third Way. Today, many liberal centrists paint Jeremy Corbyn as an extremist on a par with Boris Johnson, and draw false equivalence between left and right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet in many countries, Britain included, liberals also helped to build the welfare state and have used the machinery of central government to enact progressive reforms and benefit the poor \u2013 defending the NHS, civil and human rights, social equality, migration. Often, they aimed not to liberate workers but compromise with them, in order to minimise the risks individuals face. Social liberals have sometimes opposed economic liberals: the concern to limit inequality has trumped the defence of laissez-faire and capital markets. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown enshrined minimum wage laws but encouraged the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/29/short-history-of-privatisation\" title=\"\">privatisation of public services</a>; they founded Sure Start but helped sell off the NHS.</p> <p>At the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history and about the fate of liberalism. Famously many agreed that history had ended, following the end of the cold war. All that was needed was steady incremental reform of the status quo. These 90s assumptions survived well into the new century. We now know that such declarations were hugely complacent. The biggest mistake of liberalism was thinking it was all over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c6da1375f4ab54bb26a272c56d3a19d883afc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c6da1375f4ab54bb26a272c56d3a19d883afc4/0_165_4447_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The end of history?

Vladimir Putin inspects the Russian fleet in Kaliningrad,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, few have properly come to terms with that mistake. Many are on the back foot, insisting that any move away from their ideas marks a step backwards into a far nastier history. Such defensiveness is not novel: liberalism has often been a negative sort of politics \u2013 a politics of second best that protects against worse scenarios. Liberals have been the first to prophesy new end times \u2013 the demise of democracy and the Pax Americana \u2013 and see in Brexit and Trump a slippery slope to war and fascism. Where conservatives look to restore a lost past, liberals defend the gradual reform of an established order and respond aggressively to any threat to it, whether real or imagined.</p> <p>All this worry about values and norms makes it possible to miss the fact that liberalism as an ideology still dominates how we see the world. It does not just occupy a place between left and right; it cuts across both.</p> <p>The liberal worldview frames politics as something that happens mostly in Westminster, and about which most voters care little, so it downplays the politics of everyday life in the home and workplace. On this view, the political realm is inhabited by powerful individuals whose decisions make a difference, and who operate in institutions that are neutral. Values conflict, but compromise is the aim \u2013 except where liberal values are deemed to be threatened; it can sometimes seem that liberals believe in the possibility of consensus, but only if the other side accept the basic facts that liberals hold as true. This can mean touting virtues in principle but refusing them in practice: the Liberal Democrats demanding compromise and cooperation while they reject a Corbyn-led coalition is a case in point.</p> <p>For liberal remainers, Brexit is either a giant misunderstanding or a mistake: it has been brought about by voters\u2019 lack of knowledge, or by party misjudgments and the rightwing media; it has been prolonged by Rasputin-like advisers (whether Dominic Cummings or Seumas Milne). Undoubtedly, centrist thinkers, with their focus on institutions and those who control them, can provide answers to important questions: how the common law relates to the constitution; how EU regulations and the referendum dilute parliamentary sovereignty. At a time when we are meant to have had enough of experts, it is ironic that expert knowledge is in extremely high demand in public institutions \u2013 in the civil service, parliament, the courts, and the press. But it\u2019s easy to mistake symptoms for causes. Though Brexit will surely have disastrous consequences \u2013 hurtling us towards a neoliberal, deregulated and depressed Britain with an empowered right on the rise \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean the liberal diagnosis tells the full story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2678baaaf1ddabb830b6c3e6f11b286db714c9ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2678baaaf1ddabb830b6c3e6f11b286db714c9ef/0_138_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) staff vote to go on strike in a dispute over pay, October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) staff vote to go on strike in a dispute over pay, October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hampered by the need to defend the EU as a site of cosmopolitanism in the name of stopping Brexit, many remainers have framed any opposition as a threat to a political order that has no need for change. The rightward drift of the Lib Dems as they look to rebuild their vote by becoming the party of remain illustrates this bias to the status quo. For all its references to history (particularly to the totalitarian threats of the 1930s), the current liberal vision is often quite ahistorical: we don\u2019t hear much about Britain before the referendum. Even the most radical version of liberal centrism has only a partial diagnosis: it points to rising inequality and a growing generational and educational gap. Liberals may focus on defending norms, but norms themselves are only how particular political settlements are made legitimate. They don\u2019t tell us much about the limits of the settlement itself.</p> <p>The view of Brexit and Trump as a crisis of institutions, norms or civility, and the focus on the narcissism or hubris of political personalities, is too limited. The alternative is not merely to accept the narratives of the right \u2013 that Brexit is about a defence of sovereignty or kicking it to liberal elites. Both of these inhabit the conventional terms of debate. By slipping into a kneejerk defence of the status quo, we risk not understanding where the threats come from and how they can be fought. By focusing on individuals, we ignore how classes are changing. By looking to reason and forgetting ideology, we miss the pleasures of resentment and commitment, and how new political forces have developed to capitalise on those pleasures \u2013 in particular how the Conservative party has reinvigorated itself by building new class alliances and using a heady mix of Thatcherite, nationalist and colonial tropes (a strategy that is haphazard but may well prove successful).</p> <p>If we define politics too narrowly and dwell on historical parallels, we miss our own history and the social and economic changes that have paved the way to where we are now \u2013 a situation where the institutions and infrastructure of British public life are dysfunctional, where productivity, investment and wages are low, where the public sector has been hollowed out and the steady job all but disappeared. If we worry only about the breakdown of parliamentary checks-and-balances, we miss that this gives the lie to the liberal dream that certain institutions are neutral and beyond politics. When we see the rise of the right in terms of a crisis of civility, we fail to ask what resentments the veneer of civility masks, as well as who it benefits and harms. When we focus on constitutional crisis, we risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability \u2013 and that the coming election is also about our prospects for fixing these.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These alternative diagnoses have major implications. The end of the liberal dream of neutrality opens up a view of the world where politics is found in new places \u2013 the courts, the market, the workplace, the home \u2013 and where political analysts take seriously arguments that have long been made by those outside mainstream politics, who have been marginalised by class, race, gender, geography, immigration status and age. This may be unsettling, but it can point us away from the old divisions of parliament versus the people, so easily deployed by the right and point to new battle lines: not between norms and their violation, or Brexit and its reversal, but to what we want for the future of the UK.</p> <p>Crucially, these diagnoses can also show us where the deeper political crisis lies. The lasting damage to Britain may not be caused only by the constitutional chaos, but by the long-term collapse, defunding and decay of our public institutions \u2013 the NHS, legal aid, our underfunded schools. Paradoxically, it was the stability of such institutions that made liberal centrism make sense as a way of thinking about politics. With public institutions dysfunctional and liberal democracy hollowed out, liberalism no longer looks like an ideology that can explain the world: its basis falls away. Liberal political thinking is stuck. It can no longer give a convincing account of politics, except to describe what\u2019s happening as an assault on itself. What would help liberalism make sense again is the rebuilding of those public institutions. It is an irony for liberals that this is precisely what the Labour party today is proposing.</p> <p>What is needed is a longer and wider view than the liberal vision of politics allows \u2013 one that enables us to see how social, economic and ideological changes intersect with and shape personality and procedure. This is why elements in the press have started to listen to the left once again, discussing \u201cresetting\u201d capitalism in the context of inequality and climate crisis, and engaging with talk of interests, class and ideology that has for so long been labelled as irrelevant. Now liberals also have to choose: to stay where they are and try to squeeze new developments into old paradigms, or to recognise these limits. Instead of a revival of liberalism, we might need a reckoning with it.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Katrina Forrester\u2019s In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy is published by Princeton.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "We know we\u2019re living through a period of crisis, but it\u2019s sometimes hard to know of what kind. The financial crash of 2007-8 seemed to mark the beginning of the most recent crisis of capitalism; 2016 brought news of a crisis of democracy, and the political and constitutional crisis created by Brexit marks its second act. Every day the climate crisis heats up. Crisis has become the new normal. It\u2019s often said that we are also witnessing a crisis of liberalism: liberal norms are being eroded, institutions are under threat, and across Europe, parties of the centre are haemorrhaging votes. Meanwhile, the critics of centrism are louder than they have been for years. Even many in the mainstream of British politics have begun to acknowledge that in the past decade centrists have been neoliberalism\u2019s willing bedfellows, supporting policies to shrink the welfare state and crush unions. Liberal centrism has \u201cleft people behind\u201d, and in its support for free markets and globalisation, created new forms of exclusion. More damning critiques are also gaining currency: that the \u201cliberal\u201d way of running politics was always bound up with imperialism and colonialism, sceptical of democracy and workers and a cover for capitalist exploitation. Even the Financial Times \u2013 the pinnacle of economic liberalism \u2013 recently argued that the capitalist model needs to be \u201creset \u201d. So liberal centrists aren\u2019t wrong that their institutions, parties and ideas are being challenged. But the problem may be a deeper one: that the categories of mainstream politics as we know it can no longer explain the world. As an ideology, liberalism can be hard to pin down. It\u2019s capacious and it has adapted throughout history. From John Locke to John Maynard Keynes, liberals have prioritised the values of liberty and equality (though they\u2019ve disagreed about how much the latter matters to the former and what those values mean in everyday politics). They have supported the rule of law, rights and representation, as well as private property, markets and, for the most part, capitalism against socialism. During the cold war, liberals often defended the status quo, seeing a slide into totalitarianism behind every scheme for political change. There is a long liberal tradition of attacking the left to defend the centre. In the 1980s, a faction of Labour MPs left the party to found the SDP. In the 90s, as New Labour disciplined the party\u2019s left wing, liberalism took the form of the Third Way. Today, many liberal centrists paint Jeremy Corbyn as an extremist on a par with Boris Johnson, and draw false equivalence between left and right. Yet in many countries, Britain included, liberals also helped to build the welfare state and have used the machinery of central government to enact progressive reforms and benefit the poor \u2013 defending the NHS, civil and human rights, social equality, migration. Often, they aimed not to liberate workers but compromise with them, in order to minimise the risks individuals face. Social liberals have sometimes opposed economic liberals: the concern to limit inequality has trumped the defence of laissez-faire and capital markets. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown enshrined minimum wage laws but encouraged the privatisation of public services; they founded Sure Start but helped sell off the NHS. At the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history and about the fate of liberalism. Famously many agreed that history had ended, following the end of the cold war. All that was needed was steady incremental reform of the status quo. These 90s assumptions survived well into the new century. We now know that such declarations were hugely complacent. The biggest mistake of liberalism was thinking it was all over. Today, few have properly come to terms with that mistake. Many are on the back foot, insisting that any move away from their ideas marks a step backwards into a far nastier history. Such defensiveness is not novel: liberalism has often been a negative sort of politics \u2013 a politics of second best that protects against worse scenarios. Liberals have been the first to prophesy new end times \u2013 the demise of democracy and the Pax Americana \u2013 and see in Brexit and Trump a slippery slope to war and fascism. Where conservatives look to restore a lost past, liberals defend the gradual reform of an established order and respond aggressively to any threat to it, whether real or imagined. All this worry about values and norms makes it possible to miss the fact that liberalism as an ideology still dominates how we see the world. It does not just occupy a place between left and right; it cuts across both. The liberal worldview frames politics as something that happens mostly in Westminster, and about which most voters care little, so it downplays the politics of everyday life in the home and workplace. On this view, the political realm is inhabited by powerful individuals whose decisions make a difference, and who operate in institutions that are neutral. Values conflict, but compromise is the aim \u2013 except where liberal values are deemed to be threatened; it can sometimes seem that liberals believe in the possibility of consensus, but only if the other side accept the basic facts that liberals hold as true. This can mean touting virtues in principle but refusing them in practice: the Liberal Democrats demanding compromise and cooperation while they reject a Corbyn-led coalition is a case in point. For liberal remainers, Brexit is either a giant misunderstanding or a mistake: it has been brought about by voters\u2019 lack of knowledge, or by party misjudgments and the rightwing media; it has been prolonged by Rasputin-like advisers (whether Dominic Cummings or Seumas Milne). Undoubtedly, centrist thinkers, with their focus on institutions and those who control them, can provide answers to important questions: how the common law relates to the constitution; how EU regulations and the referendum dilute parliamentary sovereignty. At a time when we are meant to have had enough of experts, it is ironic that expert knowledge is in extremely high demand in public institutions \u2013 in the civil service, parliament, the courts, and the press. But it\u2019s easy to mistake symptoms for causes. Though Brexit will surely have disastrous consequences \u2013 hurtling us towards a neoliberal, deregulated and depressed Britain with an empowered right on the rise \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean the liberal diagnosis tells the full story. Hampered by the need to defend the EU as a site of cosmopolitanism in the name of stopping Brexit, many remainers have framed any opposition as a threat to a political order that has no need for change. The rightward drift of the Lib Dems as they look to rebuild their vote by becoming the party of remain illustrates this bias to the status quo. For all its references to history (particularly to the totalitarian threats of the 1930s), the current liberal vision is often quite ahistorical: we don\u2019t hear much about Britain before the referendum. Even the most radical version of liberal centrism has only a partial diagnosis: it points to rising inequality and a growing generational and educational gap. Liberals may focus on defending norms, but norms themselves are only how particular political settlements are made legitimate. They don\u2019t tell us much about the limits of the settlement itself. The view of Brexit and Trump as a crisis of institutions, norms or civility, and the focus on the narcissism or hubris of political personalities, is too limited. The alternative is not merely to accept the narratives of the right \u2013 that Brexit is about a defence of sovereignty or kicking it to liberal elites. Both of these inhabit the conventional terms of debate. By slipping into a kneejerk defence of the status quo, we risk not understanding where the threats come from and how they can be fought. By focusing on individuals, we ignore how classes are changing. By looking to reason and forgetting ideology, we miss the pleasures of resentment and commitment, and how new political forces have developed to capitalise on those pleasures \u2013 in particular how the Conservative party has reinvigorated itself by building new class alliances and using a heady mix of Thatcherite, nationalist and colonial tropes (a strategy that is haphazard but may well prove successful). If we define politics too narrowly and dwell on historical parallels, we miss our own history and the social and economic changes that have paved the way to where we are now \u2013 a situation where the institutions and infrastructure of British public life are dysfunctional, where productivity, investment and wages are low, where the public sector has been hollowed out and the steady job all but disappeared. If we worry only about the breakdown of parliamentary checks-and-balances, we miss that this gives the lie to the liberal dream that certain institutions are neutral and beyond politics. When we see the rise of the right in terms of a crisis of civility, we fail to ask what resentments the veneer of civility masks, as well as who it benefits and harms. When we focus on constitutional crisis, we risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability \u2013 and that the coming election is also about our prospects for fixing these. These alternative diagnoses have major implications. The end of the liberal dream of neutrality opens up a view of the world where politics is found in new places \u2013 the courts, the market, the workplace, the home \u2013 and where political analysts take seriously arguments that have long been made by those outside mainstream politics, who have been marginalised by class, race, gender, geography, immigration status and age. This may be unsettling, but it can point us away from the old divisions of parliament versus the people, so easily deployed by the right and point to new battle lines: not between norms and their violation, or Brexit and its reversal, but to what we want for the future of the UK. Crucially, these diagnoses can also show us where the deeper political crisis lies. The lasting damage to Britain may not be caused only by the constitutional chaos, but by the long-term collapse, defunding and decay of our public institutions \u2013 the NHS, legal aid, our underfunded schools. Paradoxically, it was the stability of such institutions that made liberal centrism make sense as a way of thinking about politics. With public institutions dysfunctional and liberal democracy hollowed out, liberalism no longer looks like an ideology that can explain the world: its basis falls away. Liberal political thinking is stuck. It can no longer give a convincing account of politics, except to describe what\u2019s happening as an assault on itself. What would help liberalism make sense again is the rebuilding of those public institutions. It is an irony for liberals that this is precisely what the Labour party today is proposing. What is needed is a longer and wider view than the liberal vision of politics allows \u2013 one that enables us to see how social, economic and ideological changes intersect with and shape personality and procedure. This is why elements in the press have started to listen to the left once again, discussing \u201cresetting\u201d capitalism in the context of inequality and climate crisis, and engaging with talk of interests, class and ideology that has for so long been labelled as irrelevant. Now liberals also have to choose: to stay where they are and try to squeeze new developments into old paradigms, or to recognise these limits. Instead of a revival of liberalism, we might need a reckoning with it. \u2022 Katrina Forrester\u2019s In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy is published by Princeton.",

They\u2019re held up as evidence that pop music is having a potentially fatal existential crisis: when did pop cease to suggest a life more glamorous or exciting than your own? When did it cease to be aspirational, strange and intriguing? Never mind David Bowie pointing down the lens at Top of the Pops \u2013 how did we go from Lady Gaga wearing the contents of a butcher\u2019s counter to the 2010 MTV awards to nondescript artists who are only distinguished from their audience because they\u2019re the ones on stage? When did pop become so boring?</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to overestimate the dominance of normality in modern pop, particularly if you\u2019re a music hack writing a piece that suggests it has been in irreversible decline since your teens. If you want pop music that looks spectacular, glamorous and aspirational, or suggests an intriguing world outside the experience of its audience, or that terrifies parents, there\u2019s plenty of it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/death-lil-peep-us-prescription-drugs-epidemic-hip-hop-rapper\">Drugged-out face-tattooed rappers</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/12/bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-review\">DayGlo K-pop bands</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/30/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell-review\">Lana Del Rey\u2019s LA femme-fatale s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/30/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell-review\">htick</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-the-pop-icon-who-defines-21st-century-teenage-angst\">Billie Eilish</a>\u2019s gothic sci-fi imagery; the Afro-futuristic fantasias of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/16/janelle-monae-review-roundhouse-london-michaela-coel\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/07/fka-twigs-magdalene-review\">FKA twigs</a>.</p> <p>Equally, you would struggle to describe it as anything other than a phenomenon. Between them, Sheeran and Adele have sold almost 300m records in the last decade; Glynne has had seven No 1 singles in the last five years; Capaldi is the biggest British artist of 2019, author of both the year\u2019s bestselling single and its bestselling album. This sound\u2019s appeal shows no signs of waning. You might have thought the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours reached critical mass a few years ago, when the charts were packed with Sheeran-alikes and Mike Posner had a hit with I Took a Pill in Ibiza \u2013 a folky ballad that seemed like an Onion parody of self-obsessed millennial angst, Posner whining about, of all things, being given free drugs in a nightclub.

Just as people have a tendency to overplay the recent dominance of \u201cordinary\u201d pop, so they have a tendency to overstate how spectacular pop was in the past. Watch any old episode of Top of the Pops, even from the two eras proclaimed as the show\u2019s golden ages of eye-popping sensation \u2013 the glam-dominated early 70s and the post-punk new romantic explosion of the early 80s \u2013 and in between the glitter and platform boots, or the rouged-up, sexually ambiguous synth-prodders, you\u2019ll see umpteen artists who look utterly normal and playing incredibly prosaic music. The difference may be that those artists were generally a reaction against the pop mainstream: MOR acts catering to an older audience unlikely to be taken with T Rex or Suzi Quatro; \u201cserious\u201d rock bands distinguishing themselves from the supposedly shallow image-consciousness of whoever was on the cover of Smash Hits that week. Now, they <em>are </em>the pop mainstream, or at least an important and influential part of it.</p> <p>The roots of the current wave of ordinary pop date to the early 2000s, when most of the artists \u2013 and a vast tranche of their audience \u2013 were children. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/02/have-we-fallen-out-of-love-with-tv-talent-show-simon-cowell-x-factor\">succession of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/02/have-we-fallen-out-of-love-with-tv-talent-show-simon-cowell-x-factor\"> talent shows</a> appeared and quickly dominated the TV schedules: Popstars and Pop Idol launched in 2001, the BBC\u2019s forgotten rival Fame Academy in 2002, The X Factor in 2004. Their stars largely had very brief careers \u2013 Hear\u2019Say, Leon Jackson, Michelle McManus \u2013 but one idea the shows propagated proved far more enduring. Their format was dependent on the notion that pop stars weren\u2019t remote, otherworldly figures, but rather everyday people. You didn\u2019t need such things as alluring charisma, originality, a striking image, feral sexual magnetism, or a willingness to shock to be a pop star. Indeed, those were drawbacks that would get you classified as \u201cweird\u201d \u2013 a term the judges used as if it was abusive \u2013 and booted out early on. All you needed was a decent voice, a backstory that connected with the public \u2013 to make you <em>relatable</em> \u2013 and the right break. While that represents a hopelessly reductive view of what a pop star is, it\u2019s nevertheless extremely pervasive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Talent shows ensured that it was no longer a good thing to be remote or aloof or mysterious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay\">Coldplay</a> \u2013 a band then devoid of any identifiable image, whose live show culminated with the dizzying spectacle of Chris Martin turning off an illuminated globe that sat on the lid of his piano \u2013 commercially leapfrogged their post-Britpop peers and the image-heavy wave of new indie bands, and became arguably the biggest rock band in the world. Critics occasionally pit them against the TV talent show winners, \u201cauthentic\u201d rock artists v the puppets of manufactured pop: in 2002, Coldplay\u2019s In My Place battled Colourblind by Pop Idol runner-up Darius Danesh for No 1, a state of affairs excitedly reported on by Radio 1. In truth, they had more in common than the adversarial narrative suggested. The success of the TV talent-show winners was predicated on their fans knowing they were normal. Whether by default or design, Coldplay wore their \u201cauthenticity\u201d on their sleeve. You could tell by looking at them they weren\u2019t a record company confection, honed by stylists and media trainers, nor were they a style-over-substance NME hype band. The message was essentially the same: here was ordinariness, not as a sniffy reaction to pop\u2019s excesses but as a saleable commodity in itself.</p> <p>This was underlined a few years later when Adele commercially outstripped Amy Winehouse. Initially, this seemed unlikely. Adele\u2019s output was too obviously created in Winehouse\u2019s shadow: big-voiced, London-accented retro-soul styling; Mark Ronson production credit; even a Scouse indie cover in the repertoire, the Coral\u2019s Dreaming of You standing in for the Zutons\u2019 Valerie. As it turned out, predictability was among Adele\u2019s greatest assets. She flourished in the void created when it became apparent that Winehouse was incapable of meeting public demand for more of the same by following up the 16m-selling Back to Black. Adele was a talented artist offering something similar to Winehouse, but one less likely to blow out gigs, or to punch someone in the front row, or to be photographed staggering wild-eyed around London. She cut a more relatable figure: a bright, gobby, unstyled north London girl, her brand of heartbreak dealt in moist-eyed stoicism and passive aggression rather than howling disconsolately on the bathroom floor and revealing you could only climax if you thought of your ex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef243edb39631d0ae07a22e50da617288032299\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef243edb39631d0ae07a22e50da617288032299/0_239_4442_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A hybrid of pop artist and social media star\u2019 ...

Six months later, Sheeran broke through, touting an even more austere version of Coldplay\u2019s dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal. He released his major-label debut to widespread critical opprobrium, yet became not just one of the most successful artists of the decade but one of the most influential, writing for everyone from Justin Bieber to One Direction to Eminem, and spawning endless imitators.</p> <p>The most prosaic reason for Adele and Sheeran\u2019s success is that their songs connected with people: even Sheeran\u2019s most implacable critic would have a hard time arguing that Thinking Out Loud doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of song that\u2019s going to soundtrack first dances for the rest of eternity. But the time was also right for artists like them. An audience who\u2019d grown up on TV talent shows and Coldplay, with their intrinsic messages about normality and authenticity, had reached maturity. Social media had brought a new set of ideas about pop artists\u2019 proximity to their fans. It was no longer held to be a good thing to be remote or aloof or mysterious; what people apparently wanted was availability and dialogue. Moreover, it didn\u2019t do to be too outrageous or excessive because someone would record you and post the footage online, where it would live for ever.</p> <p>Social media also supplied a new set of stars: influencers, YouTubers, vloggers. Their appeal is invariably baffling to anyone over the age of 25, but the general takeaway is that kids want to watch people who look a bit like nice older siblings doing everyday things, being a little wacky and sharing makeup tips. Their appeal is not dissimilar, then, to that of Sheeran, who \u2013 150m record sales, an estimated \u00a3170m fortune and an MBE later \u2013 still gives off the air of a mate\u2019s brother just back from a gap year with tales of how sick Goa is. Or, indeed, of Jess Glynne, who\u2019s more glamorous \u2013 no record label has yet allowed a female pop artist to take the stage in quite such a dressed-down state as Sheeran or Lewis Capaldi \u2013 but still gives off a resolutely ordinary air.

      "bodyText": "Of all the controversies generated by rock and pop music over the last decade, the weirdest may be those by artists who aren\u2019t weird or controversial at all. Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, Adele, George Ezra, Jess Glynne have all sold a phenomenal number of records and earned an equal amount of opprobrium. The collective terms for them are usually pejorative: the new boring, the ordinary boys, a beige pop wasteland. They\u2019re held up as evidence that pop music is having a potentially fatal existential crisis: when did pop cease to suggest a life more glamorous or exciting than your own? When did it cease to be aspirational, strange and intriguing? Never mind David Bowie pointing down the lens at Top of the Pops \u2013 how did we go from Lady Gaga wearing the contents of a butcher\u2019s counter to the 2010 MTV awards to nondescript artists who are only distinguished from their audience because they\u2019re the ones on stage? When did pop become so boring? It\u2019s easy to overestimate the dominance of normality in modern pop, particularly if you\u2019re a music hack writing a piece that suggests it has been in irreversible decline since your teens. If you want pop music that looks spectacular, glamorous and aspirational, or suggests an intriguing world outside the experience of its audience, or that terrifies parents, there\u2019s plenty of it. Drugged-out face-tattooed rappers; DayGlo K-pop bands; Lana Del Rey\u2019s LA femme-fatale shtick; Billie Eilish\u2019s gothic sci-fi imagery; the Afro-futuristic fantasias of Janelle Mon\u00e1e and FKA twigs. Equally, you would struggle to describe it as anything other than a phenomenon. Between them, Sheeran and Adele have sold almost 300m records in the last decade; Glynne has had seven No 1 singles in the last five years; Capaldi is the biggest British artist of 2019, author of both the year\u2019s bestselling single and its bestselling album. This sound\u2019s appeal shows no signs of waning. You might have thought the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours reached critical mass a few years ago, when the charts were packed with Sheeran-alikes and Mike Posner had a hit with I Took a Pill in Ibiza \u2013 a folky ballad that seemed like an Onion parody of self-obsessed millennial angst, Posner whining about, of all things, being given free drugs in a nightclub. But the success of Capaldi\u2019s Divinely Inspired to a Hellish Extent (and George Ezra\u2019s triple-platinum Staying at Tamara\u2019s, the biggest-selling album of 2018) shows you couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The question of whether it\u2019s a new phenomenon is interesting. Just as people have a tendency to overplay the recent dominance of \u201cordinary\u201d pop, so they have a tendency to overstate how spectacular pop was in the past. Watch any old episode of Top of the Pops, even from the two eras proclaimed as the show\u2019s golden ages of eye-popping sensation \u2013 the glam-dominated early 70s and the post-punk new romantic explosion of the early 80s \u2013 and in between the glitter and platform boots, or the rouged-up, sexually ambiguous synth-prodders, you\u2019ll see umpteen artists who look utterly normal and playing incredibly prosaic music. The difference may be that those artists were generally a reaction against the pop mainstream: MOR acts catering to an older audience unlikely to be taken with T Rex or Suzi Quatro; \u201cserious\u201d rock bands distinguishing themselves from the supposedly shallow image-consciousness of whoever was on the cover of Smash Hits that week. Now, they are the pop mainstream, or at least an important and influential part of it. The roots of the current wave of ordinary pop date to the early 2000s, when most of the artists \u2013 and a vast tranche of their audience \u2013 were children. A succession of talent shows appeared and quickly dominated the TV schedules: Popstars and Pop Idol launched in 2001, the BBC\u2019s forgotten rival Fame Academy in 2002, The X Factor in 2004. Their stars largely had very brief careers \u2013 Hear\u2019Say, Leon Jackson, Michelle McManus \u2013 but one idea the shows propagated proved far more enduring. Their format was dependent on the notion that pop stars weren\u2019t remote, otherworldly figures, but rather everyday people. You didn\u2019t need such things as alluring charisma, originality, a striking image, feral sexual magnetism, or a willingness to shock to be a pop star. Indeed, those were drawbacks that would get you classified as \u201cweird\u201d \u2013 a term the judges used as if it was abusive \u2013 and booted out early on. All you needed was a decent voice, a backstory that connected with the public \u2013 to make you relatable \u2013 and the right break. While that represents a hopelessly reductive view of what a pop star is, it\u2019s nevertheless extremely pervasive. At the same time, Coldplay \u2013 a band then devoid of any identifiable image, whose live show culminated with the dizzying spectacle of Chris Martin turning off an illuminated globe that sat on the lid of his piano \u2013 commercially leapfrogged their post-Britpop peers and the image-heavy wave of new indie bands, and became arguably the biggest rock band in the world. Critics occasionally pit them against the TV talent show winners, \u201cauthentic\u201d rock artists v the puppets of manufactured pop: in 2002, Coldplay\u2019s In My Place battled Colourblind by Pop Idol runner-up Darius Danesh for No 1, a state of affairs excitedly reported on by Radio 1. In truth, they had more in common than the adversarial narrative suggested. The success of the TV talent-show winners was predicated on their fans knowing they were normal. Whether by default or design, Coldplay wore their \u201cauthenticity\u201d on their sleeve. You could tell by looking at them they weren\u2019t a record company confection, honed by stylists and media trainers, nor were they a style-over-substance NME hype band. The message was essentially the same: here was ordinariness, not as a sniffy reaction to pop\u2019s excesses but as a saleable commodity in itself. This was underlined a few years later when Adele commercially outstripped Amy Winehouse. Initially, this seemed unlikely. Adele\u2019s output was too obviously created in Winehouse\u2019s shadow: big-voiced, London-accented retro-soul styling; Mark Ronson production credit; even a Scouse indie cover in the repertoire, the Coral\u2019s Dreaming of You standing in for the Zutons\u2019 Valerie. As it turned out, predictability was among Adele\u2019s greatest assets. She flourished in the void created when it became apparent that Winehouse was incapable of meeting public demand for more of the same by following up the 16m-selling Back to Black. Adele was a talented artist offering something similar to Winehouse, but one less likely to blow out gigs, or to punch someone in the front row, or to be photographed staggering wild-eyed around London. She cut a more relatable figure: a bright, gobby, unstyled north London girl, her brand of heartbreak dealt in moist-eyed stoicism and passive aggression rather than howling disconsolately on the bathroom floor and revealing you could only climax if you thought of your ex. Journalist Peter Robinson suggested that the eureka moment of what he called \u201cthe new boring\u201d came when Adele performed Someone Like You at the 2011 Brit awards, an event otherwise packed with explosive spectacle. \u201cWow,\u201d host James Corden nodded approvingly at its conclusion, \u201cyou can have all the dancers, pyrotechnics, laser shows you want, but if you sound like that all you need is a piano.\u201d As if to prove Corden\u2019s point, Adele\u2019s 21 became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century. Six months later, Sheeran broke through, touting an even more austere version of Coldplay\u2019s dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal. He released his major-label debut to widespread critical opprobrium, yet became not just one of the most successful artists of the decade but one of the most influential, writing for everyone from Justin Bieber to One Direction to Eminem, and spawning endless imitators. The most prosaic reason for Adele and Sheeran\u2019s success is that their songs connected with people: even Sheeran\u2019s most implacable critic would have a hard time arguing that Thinking Out Loud doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of song that\u2019s going to soundtrack first dances for the rest of eternity. But the time was also right for artists like them. An audience who\u2019d grown up on TV talent shows and Coldplay, with their intrinsic messages about normality and authenticity, had reached maturity. Social media had brought a new set of ideas about pop artists\u2019 proximity to their fans. It was no longer held to be a good thing to be remote or aloof or mysterious; what people apparently wanted was availability and dialogue. Moreover, it didn\u2019t do to be too outrageous or excessive because someone would record you and post the footage online, where it would live for ever. Social media also supplied a new set of stars: influencers, YouTubers, vloggers. Their appeal is invariably baffling to anyone over the age of 25, but the general takeaway is that kids want to watch people who look a bit like nice older siblings doing everyday things, being a little wacky and sharing makeup tips. Their appeal is not dissimilar, then, to that of Sheeran, who \u2013 150m record sales, an estimated \u00a3170m fortune and an MBE later \u2013 still gives off the air of a mate\u2019s brother just back from a gap year with tales of how sick Goa is. Or, indeed, of Jess Glynne, who\u2019s more glamorous \u2013 no record label has yet allowed a female pop artist to take the stage in quite such a dressed-down state as Sheeran or Lewis Capaldi \u2013 but still gives off a resolutely ordinary air. At 23, Capaldi is too young to remember a world before social media, and seems like a hybrid of pop artist and social media star: nearly as famous for his extremely funny videos as he is for his music. Whenever the why-oh-why-ing starts about these artists\u2019 success, it\u2019s usually accompanied by a side-order of hand-wringing about the decline of youth rebellion, citing figures about the rise in youth teetotalism, drawing attention to the disappearance of visually-arresting subcultural youth tribes. A cartoon emerges of parents who grew up in the hedonistic 80s and 90s raising a generation of prissily self-obsessed conformists, interested only in seeing their own lives reflected back at them. Another way of looking at it would be to note that the last decade has been one of uncertainty and disorder: financial chaos, austerity, political upheaval, division. The future looks less certain still. Perhaps what people want from pop culture isn\u2019t the thrill of the unknown but reassurance and stability. It\u2019s telling that 25, Adele\u2019s multimillion-selling followup to 21, offered more of the same \u2013 raking over the relationship that had inspired its predecessor, her collaborators having rejected an album full of songs about her life as a new mother.

      "bodyText": "Animal activist group Aussie Farms \u2013 the organisation that published farm details for vegan protesters and consumers \u2013 has had its charity status revoked. The charity regulator, Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, announced on Monday that it had revoked the organisation\u2019s charity status following an investigation sparked by federal government complaints. The website was based on members and users uploading photographs and information about farm practices, and also had an interactive map that listed the locations of farms, abattoirs and dairies. The Coalition accused the organisation of encouraging vigilantism and trespassing, and had urged the charities commissioner to investigate whether its charity status should be revoked for encouraging illegal behaviour. Following widespread vegan protests earlier this year, the Coalition was able to win support for its so-called \u201cvegan terrorist\u201d laws that were aimed at the group, which made it an offence for anyone to encourage or promote trespassing. The regulator\u2019s decision to revoke the charity status takes away the organisation\u2019s commonwealth charity tax concessions, including income tax exemption, fringe benefits tax rebates and goods and services tax concessions. Gary Johns, the ACNC commissioner who has been a critic of the charity sector, said revocation of charity status was the \u201cmost serious action\u201d the regulator could take against a registered organisation. \u201cCharities must stick to their purpose, and maintain their obligations under the ACNC Act, Charities Act and adhere to Governance Standards.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIn taking compliance and enforcement action, the ACNC follows its Regulatory Approach Statement to ensure that matters are investigated properly, the appropriate compliance action is taken, and our regulatory action is proportionate to the problems we seek to address.\u201d In a statement released on Monday, ACNC said it could not release the findings from its investigation into Aussie Farms and could not comment on the nature of its concerns due to secrecy provisions in the ACNC Act.

The \u00a373 standard weekly allowance for universal credit, the government\u2019s flagship benefit claimed by 2.3 million people, is now equivalent to 12.5% of median earnings. By contrast, when unemployment benefit was introduced in 1948 it was worth 20%. As a result, millions are being \u201cexcluded from mainstream society, with the basic goods and amenities needed to survive let alone thrive increasingly out of their grip\u201d, the study by the IPPR thinktank said. The figures come as a senior government adviser said economic insecurity had become \u201cthe new normal\u201d and polling showed a third of middle-class voters feared a slump in living standards in the next decade. Ahead of the election the IPPR is calling on parties to pump an emergency \u00a38.4bn into the system, which has been made tougher than previous regimes by making debt deductions from payments, increasingly underpaying and applying strict sanctions. A third of universal credit claimants are in work. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has already pledged to scrap universal credit, which he branded \u201cinhumane\u201d, and promised a \u00a33bn emergency bailout of the system in the short term. The Conservative government responded earlier this month by announcing an end to the benefits freeze next April, increasing universal credit payments by 1.7%, in line with inflation, and the state pension by 3.9%. More than half of people in all social groups think the government should do more \u201cto people to help them become more financially secure\u201d, according to separate polling published on Monday by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA). Forty per cent of UK adults \u2013 equivalent to 21 million people \u2013 are not confident of having a decent standard of living in 10 years\u2019 time, compared with 43% who are confident, it found.

Last week, the Trussell Trust said it had distributed a record 823,145 food parcels between April and September, a 23% increase on the previous year and the steepest rise the charity has witnessed since its network of food banks was fully established. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the RSA, who advised the Conservative government on the future of work, will on Monday say that economic insecurity is a new \u201csocial evil\u201d that must be tackled and that \u201clies behind much pessimism and anger as the public prepares to elect a new government\u201d.

Familiar advances in miniaturisation and cost mean they are now used for all kinds of purposes \u2013 for recreation, filming, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/18/drones-and-big-data-the-next-frontier-in-the-fight-against-wildlife-extinction\">monitoring conservation</a> or to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/25/medical-delivery-drones-cleared-for-takeoff-in-ghana-zipline\">deliver vital medicines in remote areas</a>.</p> <p>Military technology has also advanced, albeit more slowly, and the principal drones used now are evolutions of the technology first deployed to spot hidden Serbian positions during the 1999 Kosovo war.

Israel develops its own technology.</p> <p>Drones rapidly proliferated in a second wave over the past five years, with Pakistan and Turkey developing their own programmes. Since 2016, Turkey has used drones heavily, against the separatist Kurdish PKK in its own country, in northern Iraq and more recently against Kurdish groups in Syria.</p> <p>China, meanwhile, has begun supplying a range of countries with its Wing Loong and CH series drones, including to the UAE \u2013 where they have been used in a string of deadly strikes in Libya \u2013 as well as Egypt Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, although not every country has been able to deploy what it has bought.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/saudi-arabia-oil-attacks-everything-you-need-to-know\">Iran was blamed for an attack on Saudi oil</a> installations in September believed to have involved drones as well as missiles.

Critics say the Authorisation for Use of Military Force permits \u201cperpetual war\u201d but despite Democrat opposition, a Republican majority in the US senate help prevent its repeal.

In Trump\u2019s first year and 11 months in office 238 drone strikes were launched.</p> <h2>How accurate are the strikes?</h2> <p>The reality is that civilians have been hit in strike after strike as targets are misidentified. Precise figures, however, are hard to establish as much of the information is classified.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF\">a rare piece of disclosure</a>, the US said 473 air strikes (from both drones and planes, the figures are not separated out) had been made against targets outside Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria between January 2009 and December 2015. It acknowledged there had been as many as 116 civilian deaths as a result of those strikes, 4% of the reported casualties.</p> <p>But Jennifer Gibson at human rights group Reprieve says the organisation has tracked a high rate of errors. Research conducted by Reprieve in 2014 \u201cfound that in attempts to kill 41 individuals, the US killed as many as 1,147 other people and that on average the high value targets died three times\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ad82a601715aff925784bef98e7483a2d8079a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad82a601715aff925784bef98e7483a2d8079a0/0_0_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 12-year-old boy in Jalalabad Hospital after he survived a US drone strike that killed his father.

      "bodyText": "What is a drone? Drones \u2013 remotely piloted craft \u2013 first appeared in the 1990s when they were used for military surveillance by the US. Familiar advances in miniaturisation and cost mean they are now used for all kinds of purposes \u2013 for recreation, filming, monitoring conservation or to deliver vital medicines in remote areas. Military technology has also advanced, albeit more slowly, and the principal drones used now are evolutions of the technology first deployed to spot hidden Serbian positions during the 1999 Kosovo war. Weapons on drones were first deployed almost immediately after 9/11, their usage since has been bound up with the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d. How many military drones are out there? The vast majority of the many thousands of military drones are used for surveillance, and defence experts predict that will continue. Analysts at information group Jane\u2019s estimate that more than 80,000 surveillance drones and almost 2,000 attack drones will be purchased around the world in the next 10 years. Weaponised drones are not cheap: experts say the starting price for the technology is about $15m (\u00a312m) per unit, with more for add-ons, on top of the training and the crews needed to pilot them. It is a world in which the UK is a relatively small but still influential power. The RAF operates nine missile-bearing Reaper drones, one of which is in repair; it plans to buy 16 next-generation Protector drones by 2023 at an initial cost of \u00a3415m. In 2019 alone, Jane\u2019s experts expect the world\u2019s 10 biggest drone powers to spend some $8bn on units. \u201cThe wide variety in types of UAV [unmanned aerial vehicles] makes them suitable for both surveillance and combat missions, with low-cost models able to conduct surveillance operations, opening up the capability for militaries with a smaller budget,\u201d says Greg Murray, a senior analyst at Jane\u2019s. Which countries are the main users of drones? The first phase of drone warfare was dominated by three countries: the US, the UK and Israel. The US and UK rely on Predator and latterly Reaper drones made by General Atomics, a Californian company owned by billionaire brothers Neal and Linden Blue. Israel develops its own technology. Drones rapidly proliferated in a second wave over the past five years, with Pakistan and Turkey developing their own programmes. Since 2016, Turkey has used drones heavily, against the separatist Kurdish PKK in its own country, in northern Iraq and more recently against Kurdish groups in Syria. China, meanwhile, has begun supplying a range of countries with its Wing Loong and CH series drones, including to the UAE \u2013 where they have been used in a string of deadly strikes in Libya \u2013 as well as Egypt Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, although not every country has been able to deploy what it has bought. Iran was blamed for an attack on Saudi oil installations in September believed to have involved drones as well as missiles. Proliferation is expected to continue, not least because Russia and India are running behind. When did drones turn into weapons? Weaponisation came almost immediately after 9/11. Predator drones had already observed Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader, from the skies. But the first strike, in October 2001, missed its intended target, Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Some of his bodyguards were killed in a vehicle outside the leader\u2019s compound instead. But this failure did not deter the US. Predator and Reaper drones have since been deployed by the US in Afghanistan and the northern, tribal areas of Pakistan in various iterations of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, as well as in Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. British statistics give some idea of the frequency of contemporary drone strikes (the US does not release equivalent data). In four years of war against Isis in Iraq and Syria from 2014-2018, Reaper drones were deployed on more than 2,400 missions \u2013 almost two a day. Drones account for 42% all UK aerial missions against Isis, and 23% of weapon strikes, according to statistics collected by UK website Drone Wars via freedom of information requests. Who pilots them? RAF Reaper drones are piloted from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire and by UK personnel from Creech air force base in Nevada, where crews operate in three-hour shifts, although the drones themselves are based in the Middle East, almost certainly at an air base in Kuwait. Pilots on rotation control devices that are able to loiter in a conflict zone for about 16 to 20 hours \u2013 and able in theory to hit a target the size of a household pane of glass. Justin Bronk, from military thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, says \u201cdrones are five to six times more efficient than conventional air missions\u201d. But Professor Peter Lee, a drones expert at Portsmouth University, says \u201cdrones are a lot more analogue than people think. Reapers still need human piloting to take off and land\u201d. Is drone use legal? Ethical? Drone usage consistently tests legal norms. They have been deployed by Washington in countries with which the US is not technically at war, using the broad justification that such strikes are part of a \u201cwar on terror\u201d. That relies on a controversial law passed a week after 9/11. Critics say the Authorisation for Use of Military Force permits \u201cperpetual war\u201d but despite Democrat opposition, a Republican majority in the US senate help prevent its repeal. For the US, such drone strikes have become commonplace. The practice began under George W Bush, was expanded under Barack Obama and appears to have increased further still under Donald Trump, although in March he made analysis harder by signing an executive order banning reporting of drone casualty details. In Obama\u2019s first two years in office, 2009 and 2010, 186 drone strikes were launched in Pakistan, Syria and Yemen, according figures supplied to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In Trump\u2019s first year and 11 months in office 238 drone strikes were launched. How accurate are the strikes? The reality is that civilians have been hit in strike after strike as targets are misidentified. Precise figures, however, are hard to establish as much of the information is classified. In a rare piece of disclosure, the US said 473 air strikes (from both drones and planes, the figures are not separated out) had been made against targets outside Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria between January 2009 and December 2015. It acknowledged there had been as many as 116 civilian deaths as a result of those strikes, 4% of the reported casualties. But Jennifer Gibson at human rights group Reprieve says the organisation has tracked a high rate of errors. Research conducted by Reprieve in 2014 \u201cfound that in attempts to kill 41 individuals, the US killed as many as 1,147 other people and that on average the high value targets died three times\u201d. Some disclosures stretch credibility to the limit. The UK says only one civilian was killed or injured from British drone and air raids in Syria and Iraq, between September 2014 and January 2019. In the those same raids, Britain said 4,315 fighters were killed. Press reports tell a different story. Over the past 12 months, a US drone strike was believed to have killed 30 farm workers in Afghanistan; up to 11 civilians were killed in a US drone strike in the south of Libya. What were the most egregious uses of drones? The US operates a policy of signature or pattern targeting, in which strikes are launched at places where targets are believed to gather, although this can easily lead to mistakes. Leaked documents revealed that a secret US programme, Skynet, had used \u201cmetadata\u201d to identify suspicious individuals in Pakistan: top of its list was in fact a journalist \u2013 al-Jazeera\u2019s Pakistani bureau chief, Ahmad Zaidan. It has also used \u201cdouble tap\u201d targeting, where a site is hit twice or even three times to target first responders considered connected with those already attacked. That idea appears to be spreading: the UAE is accused of operating a double tap strike in Libya this August, which killed 45 people including guests from a nearby wedding who had come over to help. Politicians, militaries and intelligence agencies in drone-using countries have drawn up \u201ckill lists\u201d on which named individuals are intended to be, in effect, assassinated by drone or in other air strikes, a policy only occasionally publicly acknowledged. Reyaad Khan, a British Isis fighter from Cardiff, was killed in Syria aged 21, in an RAF drone strike. The UK was not at war in Syria at the time, but then-prime minister David Cameron asserted he had the power to make the decision to target him. \u201cI am not going to contract out our counterterrorism policy to someone else,\u201d he said. How will drones change war? Drones have already changed warfare, providing a more efficient \u2013 from the military\u2019s point of view \u2013 alternative to conventional aerial missions. But analysts worry that they make it easier for countries to embark on wars and undeclared \u201cshadow wars\u201d, and put non-combatants at greater risk. \u201cSimply put, they transfer risk from combatants to civilians,\u201d says Chris Cole, director of Drone Wars. The long term question is whether humans will be removed from the loop \u2013 the science fiction nightmare where AI-powered drones will select and lock on to targets with no human oversight. There is no shortage of speculation about the topic and concern about the idea, but as yet little evidence of the use of drones, particularly lethal drones, being governed solely by computer. Nevertheless, the medium-term risk remains, and there is a campaign \u2013 Stop Killer Robots \u2013 hoping to halt their development with a global treaty, that is opposed by the US, Russia and China. Experts now hope to introduce rules for autonomous warfare, but as with drone technology itself, there is no serious attempt to halt development \u2013 or proliferation. \u2022 Browse the full range of in-depth Guardian briefings.",

Following a NSW coroner\u2019s recommendation that police limit the use of strip-search powers at music festivals to cases of suspected drug supply, Fuller claimed in an interview with the Sydney tabloid newspaper the Daily Telegraph on Monday that a reduction in the use of the controversial power could lead to increased knife crime. Comparing NSW to London, where the use of stop and search powers and knife crime is a major law and order issue, Fuller told the Telegraph young people should have \u201ca little bit of fear\u201d of police and said questioning \u201cthe legitimacy of policing\u201d had \u201ca negative impact on public safety\u201d.

Research by the Boston College Center for Work &amp; Family, which surveyed new parents at four large US companies who were eligible for at least six weeks paid parental leave, found that 81% of the 1,240 employees surveyed said the notion of fathers taking leave has become more acceptable. Of those surveyed, 62% of fathers took the maximum amount of time off and 93% of mothers, and around three-quarters of workers said their employer was equally supportive of mothers and fathers taking parental leave and over half said leave policies had made workplace culture better. The US is one of only three countries in the world not to offer statutory paid leave, but increasingly states and companies are starting to take up the issue. So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have their own paid family leave laws. Brad Harrington, executive director of the center and lead author of the study, estimates only 20% to 30% of companies in the US offers paid parental leave. He said it reflects a pronounced change in corporate attitudes to new fathers taking time off. \u201cHaving done the study on paternity leave five years ago, these numbers were shocking to me. I did not expect 80% of people to say the organisation finds dads taking this leave acceptable and three-quarters to say it\u2019s equally supportive of women and men,\u201d he said.

But on opportunity for promotion, more than double the number of women, 30% compared to 15% of men, believed their chances to be lower after becoming a parent.

Alistair Nicholas, the chief executive of China Matters, told Guardian Australia that Andrew Hastie and James Paterson\u2019s \u201cengagement with the media had made it difficult for China to let them in at this time\u201d after news of the planned December trip leaked to the West Australian. Both Scott Morrison and the deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, backed the Liberal MPs, labelling China\u2019s decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d on Monday. The December trip has now been called off but the China Matters chief executive insists that it can resume trips centred around off-the-record conversations to help policymakers learn about sensitive topics including alleged human rights abuses, with a trip by March or April 2020 already in the works. \u201cThe Chinese embassy said that Hastie and Paterson were not welcome on the China Matters tour at this time,\u201d Nicholas said, noting it did not say they were \u201cnever welcome in China\u201d. After news of the trip leaked on Friday, China responded by calling on the pair to \u201cgenuinely repent and redress their mistakes\u201d \u2013 which they have refused to do \u2013 and warning that it \u201cwill never yield to colonisation of ideas and values\u201d. Nicholas acknowledged the Chinese embassy statement was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and the language was \u201cover the top\u201d. \u201cWe need to stop and think \u2013 both sides need to dial back some of the rhetoric \u2026 Australia needs to get the relationship with China back on an even keel.\u201d Hastie, the chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, has compared the west\u2019s complacency about the rise of China to France\u2019s inadequate defences against Nazi Germany. Nicholas said that intervention was \u201cperhaps itself excessive\u201d. Given the fact China spent seven years fighting Japanese fascism in the second world war \u201cthe comparison with Nazi Germany was always going to be taken badly\u201d, he said. The comments also demonstrated \u201ca bit of a lack of understanding\u201d that the Chinese Communist party is \u201cnot expansionist\u201d in outlook, he claimed, adding \u201cthat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t things for China to be brought to brook on\u201d \u2013 including the mass internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Nicholas said that China\u2019s decision did not mean that Australian politicians could not raise human rights concerns, but it\u2019s \u201ca matter of when, and how and the tone of language\u201d used to do so. \u201cLet\u2019s dial back the rhetoric and speak up for our values in a proper, respectful manner.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He noted China Matters had never been told it couldn\u2019t bring anyone because of criticism of China, and past trips had asked \u201ctough questions\u201d about protests in Hong Kong, the treatment of Uighurs and the detention of the writer Yang Hengjun. \u201cI anticipate the study tours can continue \u2013 I have no reason to think they are no longer viable.\u201d On Monday Paterson said he and Hastie had been giving voice to \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d about the Uighurs, China\u2019s activities in the South China Sea and attempts to influence Australian politics \u2013 rejecting the view this constituted \u201ccolonisation\u201d. \u201cAndrew [Hastie] and I were both invited by China Matters to visit China and they did so knowing full well that we were critics of the Chinese Communist party,\u201d he told Radio National. \u201cBut we accepted in good faith, hoping that we would have a respectful dialogue with our counterparts.\u201d Paterson also defended Hastie\u2019s claim that the west\u2019s belief that economic liberalisation would naturally lead to democratisation in China was its \u201cMaginot Line\u201d. \u201cI think we do also have to be measured and respectful, but we can\u2019t use that as an excuse not to be clear,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cAnd to be fair to Andrew, what he was talking about was the complacency of the western powers in the 20th century in response to a rising power that wanted to change the existing global order. \u201cWell, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re dealing with now. That\u2019s not an attempt to equate China to Nazi Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s just saying we have a rising power that doesn\u2019t accept the global order that wants to change it and the west has to know how to respond to that. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can ignore the lessons of history just because some of those comparisons can be sensitive at times.\u201d Paterson said that the \u201cbest-case scenario, if we take the Chinese Communist party at their word, [is that] there are a million people of a minority faith who are forcibly detained in re-education camps\u201d labelling it a \u201cvery disturbing crackdown on the individual liberties and religious freedoms of a minority faith\u201d. \u201cThe worst-case scenario doesn\u2019t even bear thinking about.\u201d On Monday Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, labelled new details of China\u2019s mass internment of Uighurs \u201cdisturbing\u201d and reiterated demands for China to end arbitrary detention. The former Australian prime minister Paul Keating warned Australia\u2019s approach to China had been supplanted by the phobias of security agencies and the hysteria of \u201cpious\u201d and \u201cdo-gooder\u201d journalists.",

      "body": "<p>Stress has become a defining feature of the 21st century, contributing to the mental-health crisis, fuelling a boom in mindfulness apps and even, science has suggested, affecting unborn children. But it is not always the villain it is made out to be. Psychologists are keen to arm us with the knowledge that some stress can be good, healthy and productive. This type is known as \u201ceustress\u201d and without it, they say, our lives would be dull and meaningless.</p> <p>\u201cStress has got such a bad rap,\u201d says Daniela Kaufer, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that stress is always bad for the brain, but that\u2019s not true. Your stress response is crucial to your survival. It elevates your performance, is super-important for alertness and prepares you to adapt to the next thing that comes along.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/28/five-ways-to-have-a-stress-free-morning\">Five ways to have a stress-free morning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The notion of eustress (the \u201ceu\u201d prefix is from the ancient Greek for \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d) makes intuitive sense. \u201cPeople can tell when they feel a little bit stressed,\u201d says Kaufer, \u201cthe feelings associated with adrenaline, it gets them going.\u201d This could even be accompanied by a frisson, exams being a good example. Stressful situations, she says, \u201cactually tend to push our performance\u201d.</p> <p>Kaufer has found physiological evidence of the power of eustress. Her team compared activity in the hippocampuses \u2013 \u201can area that is involved in learning and memory\u201d \u2013 of rats exposed to prolonged stress versus a moderate stressor comparable to eustress in humans. The latter triggered the growth of new neurons. \u201cThose neurons, we were able to show, are then activated selectively and help in learning for the next situation that is stressful. So you\u2019re performing better in that moment, and then you are better equipped for future stressors.\u201d</p> <p>This effect is something that <a href=\"http://www.client-matters.co.uk\" title=\"\">Alexandra Lichtenfeld</a>, a business relationship mentor, is well acquainted with. \u201cIf you take yourself out of your comfort zone, it stretches you and pushes you. It improves not only your performance, but everything about you.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Lichtenfeld followed her own advice and, aged 56, joined Samaritans, which involved weekly training sessions. \u201cI had two consecutive weeks,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to be rubbish. I\u2019m not going to be able to do this.\u2019\u201d In the run-up to role-playing sessions with seasoned Samaritans, \u201call of my group felt sick\u201d.</p> <p>When pushing yourself through a eustress situation, she says, \u201cyou have to focus in a way that you\u2019ve not before\u201d. Not only has her Samaritans training helped her to become more empathetic in everyday life, it has also emboldened her to embrace another new skill and start writing.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean we should overdo things. If the balance tips from eustress to distress, the positive effects are inhibited. Returning to Kaufer\u2019s exam analogy, you then \u201cdon\u2019t remember things that you really know\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/13/the-link-between-stress-and-depression-and-the-10-simple-words-that-could-help\">The link between stress and depression \u2026 and the 10 simple words that could help</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So embracing more situations that are scary but don\u2019t pose any serious threat \u2013 riding rollercoasters, public speaking, job interviews \u2013 is strongly encouraged. But another key reason why we all need to know about eustress, says Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, is that it is possible to convert distress into eustress by reframing stressful situations as positive challenges \u2013 and reaping the benefits.</p> <p>When it comes to the effects of stress, perspective is king. Kaufer references a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534658/\" title=\"\">2004 study</a> in which researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who reported the highest levels of stress had markers in their DNA showing the equivalent of ageing by at least an extra decade. This result was consistent across their cohort of women caring for chronically ill children, and a control group of mothers of healthy children. And yet it wasn\u2019t the duration of caring for a sick child that predicted the cellular aging. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the level of stress hormone in their blood,\u201d says Kaufer. \u201cIt was their subjective report of how stressed they were. So how stressed you feel dictates the physiology of the stress response.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201616\" title=\"\">Her own study</a> with rats has shown that a situation of eustress rather than distress led to boosts in levels of the hormone oxytocin and its receptors \u2013 a response that saw the rats seek more social support. \u201cThe animals start snuggling together and they share resources,\u201d says Kaufer. Whereas when a more threatening stress is perceived, \u201cyou see a decrease in the oxytocin receptor for weeks after. In those types of situation, you need the social support, but you withdraw. So it\u2019s really important to perceive your stress the right way.\u201d</p> <p>This is where we end up talking about \u201cemotion regulation, which is the idea that, rather than being at the beck and call of our emotions, we apply different strategies to experience favourable outcomes,\u201d says Stephens. \u201cThings like mindfulness, or reframing or just avoiding certain situations.\u201d Anything else that helps elevate mood is helpful here, too \u2013 exercise, a healthy diet, getting enough rest.</p> <p>As well as reframing the situation itself, he says, you can look at your response and use what he calls \u201cemotional acceptance: don\u2019t try to modify emotions; leave them alone, they\u2019re there for a reason. And that\u2019s getting on to mindfulness: be in the moment, have those experiences. That\u2019s the way to become more resilient. Get used to your emotions and learn to live with them and be more accepting of them rather than trying to over-manage them,\u201d he says. Of course, you get used to challenging situations, too. As a lecturer, he says: \u201cI can certainly vouch that what initially is terrifying, getting up in front of numerous people, becomes second nature. We habituate to frequently experienced stimuli. And then, when you\u2019re used to it, you don\u2019t have that same physiological response.\u201d</p> <p>Some people\u2019s stress thresholds are higher than others, depending on, says Kaufer, \u201cgenes, life history, what happened when you were in the womb, the circuitry in your brain\u201d. Many of these things are beyond our control. \u201cSo it\u2019s important not to make anybody feel responsible for having certain responses to stress,\u201d she says. We have to know and respect what is right for us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/23/six-ways-to-stay-healthy-when-youre-stressed\">Six ways to stay healthy when you're stressed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Memes about all successful people having failed at some point are two-a-penny, but Stephens says they still have value. \u201cIf you can view something as, \u2018Well, if I do this I might fail, but I realise that this is a necessary step to getting up to where I want to be,\u2019 that\u2019s a way of reframing what could be perceived as quite a negative thing into something more positive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo experience eustress when you have a stressful job,\u201d says Jennifer Ragsdale, associate professor of psychology at the University of Tulsa, \u201clook at deadlines and workload as a challenge to be met or a growth opportunity rather than something that is impossible to cope with. Reflect on the positive sides of your work. What brings meaning or a sense of purpose to your work? What is worth investing your energy in and what isn\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>Her research has found that the energy and arousal associated with eustress can combat fatigue. She says people with \u201cindicators of eustress \u2013 feeling happy or experiencing more meaningfulness during the workday \u2013 generally experienced lower levels of fatigue overall.\u201d</p> <p>If you are struggling to see the positives in a situation that is giving you knots in your stomach, remember \u201csome stress is desirable and even necessary, because that\u2019s how we demonstrate agency, that we are active in the world\u201d, says Stephens. \u201cWithout challenge comes boredom. A life with zero stress is not a life worth living.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stress has become a defining feature of the 21st century, contributing to the mental-health crisis, fuelling a boom in mindfulness apps and even, science has suggested, affecting unborn children. But it is not always the villain it is made out to be. Psychologists are keen to arm us with the knowledge that some stress can be good, healthy and productive. This type is known as \u201ceustress\u201d and without it, they say, our lives would be dull and meaningless. \u201cStress has got such a bad rap,\u201d says Daniela Kaufer, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that stress is always bad for the brain, but that\u2019s not true. Your stress response is crucial to your survival. It elevates your performance, is super-important for alertness and prepares you to adapt to the next thing that comes along.\u201d The notion of eustress (the \u201ceu\u201d prefix is from the ancient Greek for \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d) makes intuitive sense. \u201cPeople can tell when they feel a little bit stressed,\u201d says Kaufer, \u201cthe feelings associated with adrenaline, it gets them going.\u201d This could even be accompanied by a frisson, exams being a good example. Stressful situations, she says, \u201cactually tend to push our performance\u201d. Kaufer has found physiological evidence of the power of eustress. Her team compared activity in the hippocampuses \u2013 \u201can area that is involved in learning and memory\u201d \u2013 of rats exposed to prolonged stress versus a moderate stressor comparable to eustress in humans. The latter triggered the growth of new neurons. \u201cThose neurons, we were able to show, are then activated selectively and help in learning for the next situation that is stressful. So you\u2019re performing better in that moment, and then you are better equipped for future stressors.\u201d This effect is something that Alexandra Lichtenfeld, a business relationship mentor, is well acquainted with. \u201cIf you take yourself out of your comfort zone, it stretches you and pushes you. It improves not only your performance, but everything about you.\u201d Last year, Lichtenfeld followed her own advice and, aged 56, joined Samaritans, which involved weekly training sessions. \u201cI had two consecutive weeks,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to be rubbish. I\u2019m not going to be able to do this.\u2019\u201d In the run-up to role-playing sessions with seasoned Samaritans, \u201call of my group felt sick\u201d. When pushing yourself through a eustress situation, she says, \u201cyou have to focus in a way that you\u2019ve not before\u201d. Not only has her Samaritans training helped her to become more empathetic in everyday life, it has also emboldened her to embrace another new skill and start writing. This doesn\u2019t mean we should overdo things. If the balance tips from eustress to distress, the positive effects are inhibited. Returning to Kaufer\u2019s exam analogy, you then \u201cdon\u2019t remember things that you really know\u201d. So embracing more situations that are scary but don\u2019t pose any serious threat \u2013 riding rollercoasters, public speaking, job interviews \u2013 is strongly encouraged. But another key reason why we all need to know about eustress, says Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, is that it is possible to convert distress into eustress by reframing stressful situations as positive challenges \u2013 and reaping the benefits. When it comes to the effects of stress, perspective is king. Kaufer references a 2004 study in which researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who reported the highest levels of stress had markers in their DNA showing the equivalent of ageing by at least an extra decade. This result was consistent across their cohort of women caring for chronically ill children, and a control group of mothers of healthy children. And yet it wasn\u2019t the duration of caring for a sick child that predicted the cellular aging. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the level of stress hormone in their blood,\u201d says Kaufer. \u201cIt was their subjective report of how stressed they were. So how stressed you feel dictates the physiology of the stress response.\u201d Her own study with rats has shown that a situation of eustress rather than distress led to boosts in levels of the hormone oxytocin and its receptors \u2013 a response that saw the rats seek more social support. \u201cThe animals start snuggling together and they share resources,\u201d says Kaufer. Whereas when a more threatening stress is perceived, \u201cyou see a decrease in the oxytocin receptor for weeks after. In those types of situation, you need the social support, but you withdraw. So it\u2019s really important to perceive your stress the right way.\u201d This is where we end up talking about \u201cemotion regulation, which is the idea that, rather than being at the beck and call of our emotions, we apply different strategies to experience favourable outcomes,\u201d says Stephens. \u201cThings like mindfulness, or reframing or just avoiding certain situations.\u201d Anything else that helps elevate mood is helpful here, too \u2013 exercise, a healthy diet, getting enough rest. As well as reframing the situation itself, he says, you can look at your response and use what he calls \u201cemotional acceptance: don\u2019t try to modify emotions; leave them alone, they\u2019re there for a reason. And that\u2019s getting on to mindfulness: be in the moment, have those experiences. That\u2019s the way to become more resilient. Get used to your emotions and learn to live with them and be more accepting of them rather than trying to over-manage them,\u201d he says. Of course, you get used to challenging situations, too. As a lecturer, he says: \u201cI can certainly vouch that what initially is terrifying, getting up in front of numerous people, becomes second nature. We habituate to frequently experienced stimuli. And then, when you\u2019re used to it, you don\u2019t have that same physiological response.\u201d Some people\u2019s stress thresholds are higher than others, depending on, says Kaufer, \u201cgenes, life history, what happened when you were in the womb, the circuitry in your brain\u201d. Many of these things are beyond our control. \u201cSo it\u2019s important not to make anybody feel responsible for having certain responses to stress,\u201d she says. We have to know and respect what is right for us. Memes about all successful people having failed at some point are two-a-penny, but Stephens says they still have value. \u201cIf you can view something as, \u2018Well, if I do this I might fail, but I realise that this is a necessary step to getting up to where I want to be,\u2019 that\u2019s a way of reframing what could be perceived as quite a negative thing into something more positive.\u201d \u201cTo experience eustress when you have a stressful job,\u201d says Jennifer Ragsdale, associate professor of psychology at the University of Tulsa, \u201clook at deadlines and workload as a challenge to be met or a growth opportunity rather than something that is impossible to cope with. Reflect on the positive sides of your work. What brings meaning or a sense of purpose to your work? What is worth investing your energy in and what isn\u2019t?\u201d Her research has found that the energy and arousal associated with eustress can combat fatigue. She says people with \u201cindicators of eustress \u2013 feeling happy or experiencing more meaningfulness during the workday \u2013 generally experienced lower levels of fatigue overall.\u201d If you are struggling to see the positives in a situation that is giving you knots in your stomach, remember \u201csome stress is desirable and even necessary, because that\u2019s how we demonstrate agency, that we are active in the world\u201d, says Stephens. \u201cWithout challenge comes boredom. A life with zero stress is not a life worth living.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Do the ultra-wealthy know something we don\u2019t? US consumers in general are still spending, but the 1%? Not so much.</p> <p>A UBS report released last week found wealthy investors around the world are holding a relatively high level of cash in anticipation of global turmoil in 2020. That report added to a growing body of evidence that suggests the wealthy see trouble on the horizon.</p> <p>UBS\u2019s global wealth management surveyed more than 3,400 \u201chigh-net worth\u201d individuals split across 13 markets to take the temperature of their overall economic sentiments.</p> <p>More than half predicted recession next year, while nearly all respondents felt the US-China trade war will have major implications for the year ahead. Sixty per cent said they were preparing for a recession next year by increasing their cash reserves to 25% of their total, a couple of percentage points higher than normal.</p> <p>\u201cGiven where we sit in the geopolitical uncertainty, people are looking to put cash to work,\u201d said Sameer Aurora, executive director in UBS Wealth Management\u2019s client strategy office.</p> <p>Nearly four-fifths of respondents say volatility will probably increase, and 55% think there will be a significant market sell-off before the end of 2020.

      "bodyText": "Do the ultra-wealthy know something we don\u2019t? US consumers in general are still spending, but the 1%? Not so much. A UBS report released last week found wealthy investors around the world are holding a relatively high level of cash in anticipation of global turmoil in 2020. That report added to a growing body of evidence that suggests the wealthy see trouble on the horizon. UBS\u2019s global wealth management surveyed more than 3,400 \u201chigh-net worth\u201d individuals split across 13 markets to take the temperature of their overall economic sentiments. More than half predicted recession next year, while nearly all respondents felt the US-China trade war will have major implications for the year ahead. Sixty per cent said they were preparing for a recession next year by increasing their cash reserves to 25% of their total, a couple of percentage points higher than normal. \u201cGiven where we sit in the geopolitical uncertainty, people are looking to put cash to work,\u201d said Sameer Aurora, executive director in UBS Wealth Management\u2019s client strategy office. Nearly four-fifths of respondents say volatility will probably increase, and 55% think there will be a significant market sell-off before the end of 2020. Sixty per cent are considering increasing their cash levels further. \u201cPeople are looking to diversify their portfolios, which is a natural response to the environment we\u2019re in, and they\u2019re looking for advice as we stand at the doorstep of what might be a watershed year with Brexit and a US election looming. Putting money into cash is a reflection of that,\u201d said Aurora. The move to cash is another signal of a pervasive anxiety about the direction of the global economy at the end of 2019. \u201cThe rapidly changing geopolitical environment is the biggest concern for investors around the world,\u201d said UBS\u2019s Paula Polito, who noted that investors are more concerned about significant global changes than they are about natural economic cycles. This move to cash comes after the billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway investment conglomerate indicated a record $128bn in cash, up more than $100bn since 2009, when it was reportedly holding about $23bn in cash. While that could signal that the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d can\u2019t find anywhere to invest or is saving up for a big purchase, Berkshire recently noted that \u201cprices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects\u201d. But there are other signs that the wealthy are keep cash under their well-feathered mattresses rather than splashing out on something fittingly luxurious, artistic or expansive. Last week\u2019s biannual art sales in New York were notably lacking in big-ticket items with no painting or sculpture estimated to sell for more than $45m. By contrast, the spring sales in May raised $2bn in purchases, including a $91m Jeff Koons stainless steel Rabbit sculpture. A report by the French database Artprice that global auction sales were down 17.4% in the first half of 2019. Chinese shoppers, who kept the marked bubbling for the last few seasons, have vanished. In July, one the business\u2019s heavy-hitting private galleries, Pace, closed up shop in Beijing. After the $90.3m sale of David Hockney\u2019s 1972 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) last November, the market assumed a rediscovered canvas , Sur la Terrasse of the painter\u2019s boyfriend at the Hotel La Mamounia in Marrakech in 1971 would sell over its $25m to $45m estimate.

      "body": "<p>The executive editor of the New York Times has accused Donald Trump of putting his reporters\u2019 lives at risk by subjecting them to personal abuse and describing them as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d.</p> <p>Dean Baquet, who has led the news outlet during one of the most tumultuous periods in its history, said the US president\u2019s history of verbal attacks on journalists such as the New York Times\u2019s political reporter Maggie Haberman was \u201cappalling\u201d and risked having serious consequences.</p> <p>\u201cI think his personal attacks on reporters, including Maggie, are pretty awful and pretty unpresidential,\u201d he said. \u201cI think personal attacks on journalists, when he calls them names, I think he puts their lives at risk.</p> <p>\u201cI think that when he actually calls reporters names, says they\u2019re un-American, says they\u2019re enemies of the people ... that phrase has a deep history. I think when he says that, it is an appalling attack on the press.\u201d</p> <p>Baquet\u2019s comments in an interview with the Guardian reflect Trump\u2019s lengthy history of abuse towards journalists in general and the New York Times in particular. They echo comments from the newspaper\u2019s publisher, AG Sulzberger, who has also clashed with Trump over his treatment of the media. Last year Sulzberger said he had told Trump in a meeting that \u201cthis inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence\u201d.</p> <p>The newspaper\u2019s difficult relationship with the president has been among the defining features of Baquet\u2019s editorship. During his tenure the New York Times has also faced criticism from the left for refusing to call Trump racist or sexist, a decision that Baquet defended on the grounds that he was \u201cnot in a position to know whether he [makes comments] because he is a racist\u201d.</p> <p>Baquet said his job was \u201cto cover the world with tremendous curiosity\u201d rather than act as the opposition to the president \u2013 despite calls from many readers and some of his own staff to take a more directly critical approach to Trump.</p> <p>Asked whether Trump was a racist, Baquet said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that\u2019s a little bit different. I\u2019m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base.\u201d</p> <p>Baquet, the first black American to have edited the newspaper, said he was reluctant to allow his reporters to ascribe value judgments to the president, despite his string of outbursts. \u201cI will tell you the most powerful writing I\u2019ve ever seen about race, as a black man who grew up in the south, did not use the word \u2018racist\u2019. It quoted people saying what they had to say, and described the world they live in. And you made your own judgment. And the judgment was pretty clear. And I think that\u2019s the way to write about Donald Trump and everybody else. It\u2019s just to let them talk.\u201d</p> <p>Many outlets, including the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/16/were-trumps-racist-tweets-racist-some-news-outlets-wont-say\">have branded</a> comments by the US president this summer as racist, while the New York Times stuck with ascribing the judgment to members of the Republican party. Baquet, who does not have responsibility for the outlet\u2019s comment section, also said there was \u201cno question Donald Trump has trouble with women\u201d but declined to brand him a sexist.</p> <p>Speaking at his organisation\u2019s London bureau while on a short trip to Europe, Baquet said he recognised the \u201cTrump-like\u201d qualities of Boris Johnson, and he raised fears for the future of a media industry where major news stories are still broken largely by a handful of traditional news outlets.</p> <p>Baquet, 63, took over the New York Times in 2014 when the newspaper was struggling financially and journalistically with the transition from a print to a digital-focused product. Under his tenure and that of the chief executive, Mark Thompson, the publication\u2019s subscriber base has risen to almost 5 million, aided by the switch to reading articles on smartphones and the rise of Trump. \u201cHe yanked us back to a world where our role was to cover aggressively, and write very powerfully about, powerful people.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged making mistakes in the 2016 election, having failed to grasp the anger in the US that led to the election of Trump, but said he was constantly fighting against pressure to \u201ctake a full-bodied side\u201d against the president. \u201cThe way I see it is, our job is to cover the world with tremendous curiosity. And with a desire to understand the people who voted for Donald Trump and why they voted for Donald Trump. I think some of our readers want us to dismiss some of those people. I think that\u2019s not empathetic coverage.\u201d</p> <p>Some of these rows have now affected the newsroom, which has seen an influx of younger reporters from more diverse backgrounds, prompting what Baquet believes is the biggest change in newsrooms since the Vietnam war in the 1960s. \u201cWe have a new generation that grew up in a different world that have not only different demands of their news, they want a different relationship with their readers.\u201d </p> <p>He warned junior staff and readers against pushing to embrace leftwing Democratic candidates such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, saying the outlet would lose its status if it openly sided with particular politicians.</p> <p>\u201cThey probably want a more political New York Times than I\u2019m willing to give them. I hope they will learn over time that a New York Times that plays it straight has much more power and much more longevity.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he insisted the organisation\u2019s lengthy investigation into the president\u2019s taxes had more impact, because of the division between reporting and comment. \u201cThe way I look at it, that story would not have been believed had it been written by a news organisation that had spent two years advocating against Donald Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Baquet, who will step down in two years\u2019 time, has also overseen an expansion of the outlet\u2019s European operation, despite some <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44123786\">cultural missteps</a> such as when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/23/porridge-boiled-mutton-london-new-york-restaurant-critics\">it suggested</a> that the London food scene had until recently consisted of \u201cporridge and boiled mutton\u201d. </p> <p>He said there were clear similarities between Trump and Brexit, and noted the failure of the media to understand what drove voters towards both. \u201cEvery thoughtful person says you shouldn\u2019t, and yet you are. And I think it\u2019s the same thing, the same error. It really is.\u201d</p> <p>As both old and new media outlets struggle to be profitable, Baquet said it was easy to romanticise traditional print-only newspapers, but many \u201cweren\u2019t that great\u201d and wider choice was a good thing. At the same time, he warned about a failure of journalism on the horizon as outlets close. </p> <p>\u201cSomething\u2019s got to happen in the time between the the inevitable dying off of some of the traditional media and the rise of the new players, and I don\u2019t know what it is yet. Something\u2019s got to happen, because the picture now doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d</p> <p>He said that with the exception of BuzzFeed there were few online startup news organisations that had had a substantial journalistic impact. \u201cIt\u2019s the Guardian, it\u2019s the New York Times, the Washington Post. It\u2019s the papers that were supposed to be the dinosaurs that are breaking the big stories.\u201d</p>",

I hope they will learn over time that a New York Times that plays it straight has much more power and much more longevity.\u201d Instead, he insisted the organisation\u2019s lengthy investigation into the president\u2019s taxes had more impact, because of the division between reporting and comment. \u201cThe way I look at it, that story would not have been believed had it been written by a news organisation that had spent two years advocating against Donald Trump.\u201d Baquet, who will step down in two years\u2019 time, has also overseen an expansion of the outlet\u2019s European operation, despite some cultural missteps such as when it suggested that the London food scene had until recently consisted of \u201cporridge and boiled mutton\u201d. He said there were clear similarities between Trump and Brexit, and noted the failure of the media to understand what drove voters towards both. \u201cEvery thoughtful person says you shouldn\u2019t, and yet you are. And I think it\u2019s the same thing, the same error. It really is.\u201d As both old and new media outlets struggle to be profitable, Baquet said it was easy to romanticise traditional print-only newspapers, but many \u201cweren\u2019t that great\u201d and wider choice was a good thing. At the same time, he warned about a failure of journalism on the horizon as outlets close. \u201cSomething\u2019s got to happen in the time between the the inevitable dying off of some of the traditional media and the rise of the new players, and I don\u2019t know what it is yet. Something\u2019s got to happen, because the picture now doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d He said that with the exception of BuzzFeed there were few online startup news organisations that had had a substantial journalistic impact. \u201cIt\u2019s the Guardian, it\u2019s the New York Times, the Washington Post. It\u2019s the papers that were supposed to be the dinosaurs that are breaking the big stories.\u201d",

But when lightning struck again in the 2018 midterms and the Democratic candidates for state governor and the US Senate were edged out after close recounts, it was time for some profound introspection. Weary of being perpetual runners-up in state and national races (Barack Obama\u2019s two Florida victories aside), the state\u2019s Democratic leaders convened a top-level war council to plot strategy for the 2020 presidential election, now just 12 months away. From aiming to register hundreds of thousands of new voters to earlier and better on-the-ground canvassing, and from investing millions of dollars in recruiting local organizers to more finely focused outreach efforts on a sizable Hispanic and African American communities, Democrats are going all out to reverse the notion that Florida is unassailable Trump country. \u201cIn a lot of ways, 2016 was kind of self-inflicted,\u201d said Gary Farmer, a state senator and leader-designate of the Democratic caucus in Tallahassee who has the reins of the Florida party\u2019s campaign fundraising committee. \u201cThere was a great sense of dissatisfaction amongst a lot of Democratic voters after the primary.

The party that engages and recruits more supporters will carry off the state\u2019s 29 electoral college votes, and with them probably the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019re working harder, and earlier, than ever before,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cThey used to call us the one per cent state. Now we\u2019re the half per cent state.\u201d",

We all get around the historic centre on two wheels: it\u2019s a good way to avoid traffic jams, and tourists have to get used to bikes weaving between them in what look like pedestrianised streets. The surrounding region is perfect for both serious 70 to 80km routes \u2013 around picturesque hilltop Asolo and the climb up 1,775-metre Monte Grappa \u2013 or a lazy ride and picnic on the banks of the Sile.

From Tuesday to Sunday mornings, seafood stalls on the <strong>Pescheria</strong> island in the Cagnan River and the adjoining fruit and vegetable market are filled with zero-km seasonal products, from <em>chiodini</em> mushrooms in autumn to late-harvest <em>radicchio</em> from November. An organic farmers\u2019 market is held three times a week in <strong>Piazza Giustinian</strong>, but most <em>trevigiani</em> do their shopping on Saturday morning at the sprawling street market outside the <strong>San Tomaso</strong> city gate. Stalls are loaded with \u20ac10 cashmere jumpers (bargain factory rejects from nearby Benetton, Sisley, Geox and Diesel) and a brilliant stand selling vintage linen and leather Tyrolean outfits. Check the food stalls for local specialities such as <em>ubriaco</em>, cheese aged in grappa, or tasty <em>sopressa</em> salami.</p> <h2><strong>Explore prosecco land</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f68ea8597097138cc8373b9e2dc44a888856666\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f68ea8597097138cc8373b9e2dc44a888856666/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of vineyard country around Valdobbiadene\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Immediately north of Treviso are the rolling hills that produce prosecco, recently given Unesco world heritage status.

It\u2019s at its most picturesque around the <strong>Canale dei Buranelli</strong>, in the historic centre, with red-brick renaissance palaces, shady arcades and wrought-iron bridges. I love walking here after lunch when no one is around. As dusk falls waterside bars such as <strong><a href=\"http://www.odeonlacolonna.it/en\" title=\"\">Odeon alla Colonna</a></strong> on Vicolo Rinaldi and <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MalvasiaTrevisoRistoBrunch/\" title=\"\">La Malvasia</a></strong>, round the corner on Vicolo Trevisi, are packed with locals enjoying a sunset spritz or prosecco. In previous centuries fishermen from the Venetian island of Burano came here to sell their catch: hence the name Buranelli. The 19th-century Pescheria market, on its little island, is surrounded by traditional <em>osterie</em>.

For a really authentic experience, I tell all visitors that nothing can compare with joining the crowds of green-jerseyed fans at <strong>Stadio Monigo</strong>, home of <a href=\"https://benettonrugby.it/\" title=\"\">Benetton Rugby</a> , who compete with top teams from Britain, Ireland and France in the Guinness Pro-14 and Heineken Champions Cup. Tickets start at \u20ac15 and the stadium is a 10-minute bus ride from the centre. The atmosphere can be even more intense inside the <strong>Palaverde Arena</strong>, home of <a href=\"https://www.trevisobasket.it/\" title=\"\">Treviso Basket</a>, who are sponsored by another of city\u2019s global brands, De\u2019Longhi electrical appliances.

The 150-year-old <strong><a href=\"https://www.osteriaarman.it/\" title=\"\">Osteria Arman</a></strong>, a noisy bar with locals playing cards at rough wooden tables while talking politics and sport, gets packed out for lunch and dinner.

I love walking here after lunch when no one is around. As dusk falls waterside bars such as Odeon alla Colonna on Vicolo Rinaldi and La Malvasia, round the corner on Vicolo Trevisi, are packed with locals enjoying a sunset spritz or prosecco. In previous centuries fishermen from the Venetian island of Burano came here to sell their catch: hence the name Buranelli. The 19th-century Pescheria market, on its little island, is surrounded by traditional osterie. One of the best is Muscoli, which serves surprising natural wines and local craft beers. High and low fashion Some of the biggest names in Italian moda are based near Treviso, but apart from Benetton fashionistas should not expect to discover too many Milan-style boutiques here.

His speciality is pairing cocktails with creamy cakes (dolci) baked by Silvana, his girlfriend. Even here, a spritz is \u20ac3, and a vesper martini or manhattan \u20ac7. Sport \u2013 but not football Trevigani are serious sports fans, but unlike most Italians we are not calcio-crazy, as this part of the country is more famous for rugby and basketball. For a really authentic experience, I tell all visitors that nothing can compare with joining the crowds of green-jerseyed fans at Stadio Monigo, home of Benetton Rugby , who compete with top teams from Britain, Ireland and France in the Guinness Pro-14 and Heineken Champions Cup. Tickets start at \u20ac15 and the stadium is a 10-minute bus ride from the centre. The atmosphere can be even more intense inside the Palaverde Arena, home of Treviso Basket, who are sponsored by another of city\u2019s global brands, De\u2019Longhi electrical appliances. Again, tickets cost from \u20ac15, and the area is a 15-minute bus trip away. Lunch with noisy locals Eating out is one of Treviso\u2019s top attractions. Rather than chic Michelin-starred food, what we do well is rustic Veneto cuisine, in large helpings and at affordable prices in our many historic wood-beamed osterie and no-frills trattorie. The 150-year-old Osteria Arman, a noisy bar with locals playing cards at rough wooden tables while talking politics and sport, gets packed out for lunch and dinner. There is no service charge, no tourist menu, just a tempting daily list of ever-changing seasonal dishes: ravioli stuffed with locally grown radicchio and smoked ricotta (\u20ac9), plump gnocchi with rich duck rag\u00f9 (\u20ac9), porcini risotto (\u20ac10) or sopa coada (pigeon soup with bread, \u20ac10), followed by tiramisu \u2013 a dessert created 50 years ago by a chef right here in Treviso. \u2022 27 Via Manzoni, on Facebook Getting there Trains run to Treviso from London St Pancras via Paris, Milan (or Brussels, Munich) and Venice, taking from 14 hours, from about \u00a3250 return with trainline.com. Where to stay Il Focolare (doubles from \u20ac88 B&amp;B, ) is a small, centrally located family-run hotel, with 14 individually styled rooms that balance retro with modern design. When to visit April-June or September-October. Treviso gets more rain than London but has fewer rainy days. Museo Santa Caterina\u2019s major Natura in Posa exhibition of still-life works, from Jan Breughel to Robert Mapplethorpe, opens on 29 November and runs until 31 May 2020 (visittreviso.it).

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to the briefing. We\u2019re going to start with developments in Hong Kong overnight and then take a look at what we expect to see on the campaign trail today. The parties have rolled out some eye-catching election pledges. Our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news is up and running. Hundreds of protesters are believed to be trapped inside a university in Hong Kong this morning after the campus building they have been occupying since last week was besieged by police. In a dramatic escalation of the unrest that has gripped the city for the past five months, activists threw petrol bombs and bricks at police and set fire to a pedestrian bridge in violent overnight clashes. Protesters also fired arrows at police and officers used live rounds. When morning dawned, a group of protesters tried to escape the campus but were forced back by a volley of tear gas fired by police at various exits. Three people were treated for eye injuries and 40 suffered hypothermia after being doused with water cannon. In the courts, a ban on face masks implemented by the government was this morning ruled unconstitutional. The drama comes after elite Chinese troops filed into the streets of the city to help clean up debris from protests on Saturday. Although dressed in shorts and T-shirts rather than combat gear, the presence of the soldiers is seen as a sign that Beijing is preparing to exert more authority in the troubled territory. What\u2019s going on? Back in Britain Boris Johnson starts the week still dogged by questions about his personal life and fitness for office after it emerged that London Assembly\u2019s standards committee, which is looking into the Tory leader\u2019s relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, will also review an affair that he failed to declare when he was mayor of London. On the campaign trail, Johnson is preparing to woo business owners, announcing a range of tax cuts for businesses at the Confederation of British Industry conference. He will promise tax relief for the construction and research industries, plus a tax cut for small employers by raising the allowance for their national insurance bills from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. However, it will be an uphill battle for the prime minister, who has a reputation as a politician who has prioritised leaving the EU over business concerns, after he was previously reported to have said \u201cfuck business\u201d in relation to worries about Brexit. The CBI\u2019s director general has also warned his plans to reduce immigration risked a skills shortage. But Johnson will tell the business lobby group\u2019s conference on Monday that while \u201cbig business didn\u2019t want Brexit\u201d, what they wanted now was \u201ccertainty\u201d, which Johnson said he could deliver. Labour will unveil a compromise position on immigration that would not commit fully to free movement after Brexit but would expand the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK. Ahead of the manifesto launch on Thursday, Jeremy Corbyn said he would want his government to allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people, but stopped short of saying free movement in its current form would continue. The Tories have tried to make immigration a battleground issue, arguing that a Labour conference motion, which argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement, would mean open borders and immigration of 840,000 people a year to the UK. At a glance Lots of accusations of lying in today\u2019s news. Nigel Farage has accused the Tories of lying to cover up their \u201ccorruption\u201d after the Conservatives denied having offered his Brexit party candidates inducements to stand down so as to give Boris Johnson\u2019s party a clearer run at marginal target seats. Michael Gove has been accused of deliberately \u201clying\u201d to the public about EU citizens\u2019 rights to access to the NHS as a cynical ploy to win votes in Labour leave marginals. The Conservative party\u2019s record on tackling the climate crisis was condemned by leading scientists and former government advisers on Sunday, as Corbyn warned that the forthcoming election was the last chance to halt the escalating emergency. And if you want to know how the parties intend to tackle the climate crisis, the Guardian\u2019s environment reporters have unpacked their promises. Conservative donor Alexander Temerko has called for the publication of a parliamentary report on Russian influence in British politics, suppressed by Boris Johnson. The Observer ran a fantastic profile of six candidates out to topple the big names of UK politics, from Faiza Shaheen challenging Iain Duncan Smith, to Ali Milani taking on Boris Johnson. It\u2019s worth a read. And Mark Townsend writes about young campaigners stepping up efforts to oust the prime minister. The day ahead Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking at the CBI conference this morning. Jo Swinson will be in Hertfordshire this morning. There will be a high court action this morning over election debates. The Liberal Democrats are challenging ITV over the broadcaster\u2019s exclusion of Swinson from its televised debate. Two judges in London will also hear a similar action by the SNP after being excluded from a general election leaders\u2019 debate. Best of the rest &gt; Prince Andrew is facing a backlash on both sides of the Atlantic over his television interview in which he attempted to defend his friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Critics called him \u201carrogant\u201d and demanded he speak to the FBI. &gt; The NHS is running out of vital medicines including treatments for heart disease, cancer and epilepsy, according to an internal document seen by the Guardian. Today in Focus podcast: French mothers taking on the mafia Angelique Chrisafis discusses meeting a group of mothers who are fighting to plough money confiscated from organised crime into small associations on impoverished housing estates. Plus: Jamie Grierson on factchecking the Conservatives\u2019 immigration claims. Lunchtime read: Reboot of Kevin Smith, the slacker king A quarter of a century after the unlikely success of Clerks, director Kevin Smith talks about his reboot of the film\u2019s slacker characters in which Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Hemsworth, among others, have cameo roles. He also tells Amy Nicholson about having a heart attack (\u201cI\u2019m insanely lucky\u201d), going vegan (\u201cTreats galore!\u201d) and the producer who gave him his big break, Harvey Weinstein. Sport Gareth Southgate believes England are more advanced at this point of their Euro 2020 campaign than they were for the World Cup in 2018, after a late flurry of goals put a gloss on a 4-0 win over Kosovo. Stefanos Tsitsipas\u2019s 2019 began on the wrong end of a thrashing from Rafael Nadal but ended with a landmark victory at the ATP Finals, where the Greek became the youngest winner of the event since 2001. What might have been a sedate win for Max Verstappen and Red Bull at the Brazilian Grand Prix was a hard fought, brilliantly executed victory, while around him high drama played out at Interlagos. Goals from Kim Little and Vivianne Miedema earned victory for Arsenal in the first Women\u2019s Super League north London derby that attracted a league-record attendance of 38,262. Everton\u2019s encouraging start to the WSL season continued with a victory over their neighbours at Anfield \u2013 something their male counterparts have been unable to manage so far this millennium. And a man has been arrested after the Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper, Ryan Allsop, alleged homophobic abuse was aimed at him during Sunday\u2019s League One game at Tranmere. Business The number of houses coming up for sale in the UK has fallen at its fastest rate for 10 years, with a 15% drop in November, according to Rightmove. Average prices fell 1% amid concern about the election and Brexit. Asian shares moved higher, thanks partly to a surprise decision by Beijing to cut a key interest rate, setting off speculation that more stimulus will follow for China\u2019s slowing economy. The FTSE100 is set to start flat while the pound edged higher to $1.293 and \u20ac1.168. The papers The fallout from Prince Andrew\u2019s TV interview dominates the front pages this morning. \u201cAndrew under fire from the Palace\u201d, says the Telegraph, above a story saying that the Queen did not give her blessing for Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview, contrary to some reports. The Guardian\u2019s main story says \u201cApologise to Epstein\u2019s victims now, prince told\u201d, while the i says \u201cPrince is pressured to meet FBI\u201d. The Times leads with \u201cDefiant duke stands by \u2018car crash\u2019 TV interview\u201d and the Mail also focuses on the prince\u2019s side with \u201cAndrew: my regret over TV interview\u201d. The Mirror has \u201cCop: Andrew\u2019s sex alibi beggars belief\u201d. Only the Express leads with an election story \u2013 \u201cBoris to trigger a Brexit boom\u201d. The big story for the FT is the ongoing saga of the Saudi Aramco float: \u201cAramco pares back fundraising goal to $25bn in latest IPO hitch\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Vienna Blood 9pm, BBC Two Cafes, opera and philosophy: it\u2019s Vienna at the in turn-of-the-20th-century and young British doctor Max Liebermann (Matthew Beard) is studying under Sigmund Freud when he is enlisted by detective Oskar Rheinhardt (a gruff J\u00fcrgen Maurer) to help solve murder cases in the city. Based on Frank Tallis\u2019s Liebermann novels, this adaptation runs at an overstuffed 90 minutes for this first part, but it\u2019s a bearable watch if you can keep up with the story\u2019s wordy theorising and seance-themed turn of events. Ammar Kalia Dispatches: Born Homeless 8pm, Channel 4 As homelessness rises sharply across the UK, Dispatches examines the tough choices facing pregnant women in precarious living situations. Cameras follow soon-to-be mums as they try to cope with overcrowded temporary housing or face the looming threat of eviction. Graeme Virtue 24 Hours in A&amp;E 9pm, Channel 4 The return of the stupendous NHS fly-on-the-wall series that shows us exactly what we\u2019ll miss if this great social project is ever dismembered by our government.

Ali Catterall Cold Call 9pm, Channel 5 It\u2019s that rarest of things: a Channel 5 original drama. Spread across the week, Cold Call taps into a modern fear, the threat of bank fraud. Sally Lindsay is June, a harassed single mother who goes on the counter attack against scammers who have relieved her of the receipts of a house sale. A topical drama worth sticking with. Phil Harrison Storyville: One Child Nation 9pm, BBC Four Forty years on from China\u2019s brutal implementation of the one-child policy, film-makers Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang document its effect on the nation\u2019s women and its communities, told through the prism of Wang\u2019s own recent motherhood. A sensitive portrait of parenthood and politics. AK Home Free 10pm, Channel 4 An uplifting two-parter following a group of young people with learning disabilities who are moving out of home for the first time.

      "body": "<p>In February last year, Kevin Smith performed 90 minutes of standup for a TV special, padded back to the green room and started to worry that the joint he had smoked before the show was too strong. He was sweaty and nauseous, which was not entirely out of the ordinary. But after he lay down on the tile floor and vomited, he was rushed to hospital, where a doctor broke the news that Smith was having a massive heart attack.</p> <p>Smith stayed calm. Honestly, he tells me, as we talk at his Hollywood Hills home, he was still stoned. On learning that he might die, he says: \u201cI was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to make peace with this right away.\u2019 You did way more than you ever set out to do, you got to do some cool shit, and if it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>For 25 years, Smith, a director and actor as well as a comedian, has grappled with his own dumb luck. In 1994, his debut film, Clerks, a raunchy comedy about the convenience store where he worked, was a hit with Sundance audiences charmed by Smith\u2019s on-screen appearance, as a slacker known as Silent Bob, and his behind-the-scenes stories of selling cigarettes during the day and shooting the movie at night. Made for just $25,575, Clerks was funded by credit cards and favours from friends, some of whom even had parts in the film: Brian O\u2019Halloran, for instance, plays Dante Hicks and delivers the catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be here today!\u201d and Smith\u2019s middle-school chum Jason Mewes, who agreed to play Jay, the talkative half of Jay and Silent Bob (Smith), two friendly morons with flashes of brilliance. Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Miramax bought Clerks and, as its publicists had done with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, turned the filthy-mouthed former altar boy, the 24-year-old son of a New Jersey postal worker, into a star.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been living on that one trick for a long time,\u201d admits Smith. \u201cLike, come on, that movie was cute \u2013 but 25 years on the back of one black-and-white movie?\u201d Lighting a branded Jay &amp; Silent Bob joint with his face on the packaging, he describes that Sundance wunderkind as if he were someone else.</p> <p>\u201cI love that guy. I don\u2019t understand why he had the confidence. I think he was undereducated. I was never ambitious. I think that was a fluke.\u201d</p> <p>A fluke that became the cornerstone of his future, of his gorgeous three-story house decorated with memories: a table-top football game inspired by the roof hockey in Clerks, iron fireplace statues of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/nov/13/world.news\" title=\"\">Dogma</a>, a walrus ceramic that nods to his screwball gothic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/tusk-review-kevin-smith-toronto-film-festival-horror-walrus\" title=\"\">Tusk</a>, crayon sketches, movie posters and souvenirs from the live stage monologues in which Smith extemporises on everything from phone chats with Bruce Willis to his dog\u2019s genitalia. (He has sold out Carnegie Hall.) The upstairs living room is dominated by a collage celebrating his 20-year marriage to Jennifer Schwalbach. Squint, and you can find his first email to his future bride: \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many Schwalbachs there are in the phonebook \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe house is a <em>me</em>-seum that highlights the accomplishments of Kevin Smith,\u201d he jokes. When he looks around, he is reminded of everything he did that he never expected to do. \u201cThat\u2019s why, when I almost dropped dead, I was OK with it,\u201d he says. \u201cMost days I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh, I probably <em>did</em> die on the table and this is heaven.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c29478a6de4800ce9d0c47e90ffbc5f84815db1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c29478a6de4800ce9d0c47e90ffbc5f84815db1/0_0_1650_2344/704.jpg\" alt=\"Brian O\u2019Halloran and Jeff Anderson in Kevin Smith\u2019s 1994 film Clerks.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian O\u2019Halloran and Jeff Anderson in Kevin Smith\u2019s 1994 film Clerks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Miramax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back to that operating room. The doctor asked if the Smiths had a history of heart disease? No, replied Smith. Only that his father died of a massive heart attack \u2013 and that his mother, who is still alive, had stents inserted in her arteries after her heart stopped for a full minute, during which she claims to have seen his deceased dad and grandmother. \u201cShe was probably pumped on fentanyl when she saw heaven,\u201d Smith chuckles, \u201cso I don\u2019t know if I want to invest in that.</p> <p><em> </em>\u201cI was a fat kid,\u201d he continues. At 14, he joined Weight Watchers, but felt awkward being the only teenage boy and left after a month. As the third child of parents who were strapped for money and time, the only health food he saw was tinned spinach. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>When he earned money to buy his own snacks, he devoured \u201clow-fat\u201d cookies not realising they were packed with sugar. \u201cOh, I fell for it all,\u201d he says. The biggest hurdle, however, was mental. Over the years, he had embraced his weight, turning fat jokes from a problem to a comedic purpose. \u201cThe key early on was realising if I make fun of myself for this, then somebody else can\u2019t. One day you think: \u2018I could be funny for a living.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He marketed himself as a character \u2013 the happy schlub in a hockey jersey \u2013 and literally became a cartoon, as Clerks went from indie movie to comic book to sequels to animated series. Success, Smith notes, gave him an extra padding of protection.</p> <p>\u201cFor years, people were just like: \u2018Hey, big guy!\u2019 And I was like, I am the big guy, aren\u2019t I?\u201d says Smith. \u201cNobody ever says: <em>\u2018Hey, fat-ass!\u2019</em>\u201d</p> <p>At his heaviest, Smith, who is 5ft 9in, weighed 23st 8lb (150kg). About a decade ago he was escorted off a plane for being unable to squeeze into one seat. The story made headlines around the world, and internet trolls were merciless. For the first time, Smith felt naked. \u201cSuddenly, I was like: \u2018They know I\u2019m fat\u2019 \u2013 I thought I was hiding it!\u201d</p> <p>For a while, he swaggered through his insecurities, titling that year\u2019s live show Too Fat for 40, then launching the podcast Fat Man on Batman and publishing a memoir called Tough Sh*t: Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good. But he also quit sugar, an experience he likens to withdrawing from heroin. </p> <p>Finally, the craving for desserts stopped and 5st melted away. An hour before his heart attack, Smith had been boasting on stage about dropping five underwear sizes from 5XL to XL.</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought I was in pretty decent shape that night,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s weird to look at me and go: \u2018Jesus, did I know I was that unhealthy? Or did I just not care?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since then, he has lost almost another 6st by going vegan, at the insistence of his 20-year-old daughter, Harley Quinn. Most days, he fasts until noon, then grabs vegan nachos from his favourite fast food joint. He has stocked a two-foot-wide snack bowl with crunchy chickpeas and vegetable puffs in case he gets the munchies. \u201cTreats galore!\u201d he grins.</p> <p>Now his wedding ring wobbles when Smith waves his hands.. The first time he realised he was too skinny for the Big and Tall clothing store, he nearly cried. His purple sports coat droops on his shoulders, but he worries that if he has it taken in to fit his new frame, he will jinx himself and regain the weight he has lost. Part of him still can\u2019t help crediting luck over effort. He did, however, give away all his signature hockey jerseys. \u201cI started looking weird in them,\u201d says Smith. Although, he adds: \u201cPeople were like: \u2018You looked weird the whole time.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53e7041d7341f84d8efed350d4adb2a85c3d2ace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53e7041d7341f84d8efed350d4adb2a85c3d2ace/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Lee, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith in the 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Lee, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith in the 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/View Askew Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year has been surreal. Smith posed for a photo shoot for Men\u2019s Health magazine. \u201cSomebody told me online: \u2018You\u2019re like a Walmart Robert Downey Jr,\u2019\u201d says Smith. \u201cI\u2019ll take that!\u201d A website stole his picture to hawk diet pills. </p> <p>Last month, he and Mewes were invited to put their handprints in the cement outside the legendary Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith brought his father\u2019s ashes to the ceremony. Four decades ago, on a family vacation, his dad had offhandedly told him he might be here some day. Now he was. Smith ground an urn print into the wet pavement.</p> <p>In his new film, Jay &amp; Silent Bob Reboot, Jay and Silent Bob are still where he left them in 2006\u2019s Clerks 2, loitering outside the Quick Stop, although the video rental shop next to the Quick Stop has been supplanted by a Redbox kiosk. \u201cThe world has moved on,\u201d says Smith. As for Jay and Silent Bob, now visibly in their 40s, they are out-of-touch apolitical white males. \u201cWe needed to introduce them to \u2018this is woke culture\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Smith chose the one-year anniversary of his heart attack for his first day of filming. \u201cIt\u2019s not macabre,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to death!\u201d The movie finds the pair trekking, again, from New Jersey to California to fight for the film rights for their fictional likenesses Bluntman and Chronic, as they did in 2001\u2019s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.</p> <p>The script is a greatest hits of inside jokes. Smith settled on calling it a reboot, which one character explains, is when \u201cthey take a flick you loved as a kid and add youth and diversity to it\u201d. That is exactly what Smith has done, recasting the film with a pro-LGBTQ anti-Nazi and hiring Harley Quinn to play the leader of a pack of rebellious vegan girls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49ec7b7e0b141360f3d11e867ed6eeda73338c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ec7b7e0b141360f3d11e867ed6eeda73338c3f/0_0_3823_5138/744.jpg\" alt=\"Smith at home in Los Angeles\" width=\"744\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith at home in Los Angeles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is the most bloated and self-indulgent movie anyone\u2019s ever made, and I might get away with it because of the heart attack,\u201d he laughs. As for his star-studded cast, which includes Damon and Affleck, plus Chris Hemsworth, Rosario Dawson, Fred Armisen, Craig Robinson, Val Kilmer, Tommy Chong and rappers Method Man and Redman, he jokes that, apart from Affleck, most of them probably showed up out of guilt. \u201cAffleck was like: \u2018I didn\u2019t even know about the heart attack.\u2019\u201d Smith pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about that.\u201d</p> <p>Smith doesn\u2019t agree with the Joker director Todd Phillips\u2019 insistence that woke culture has destroyed comedy. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way because I always punch in,\u201d he says. Jokes that punch down are \u201cjust boring\u201d. But as he is punching in, the tenderest bruise is why he has not tried harder to direct serious comic book movies when he is famous for taking comic books seriously. The other film-makers in his indie clique \u2013 Tarantino, Rodriguez and Richard Linklater \u2013 made good-looking movies when they won bigger budgets. \u201cWhereas me, I could do cheap, and then people gave me real money and they\u2019re like: \u2018It looks cheap.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cEvery once in a while, I wonder if I should have done better?\u201d he says. \u201cIf you just concentrated on the thing that brought you into the conversation, directing, would you be better now?\u201d</p> <p>The indie wave he helped to inspire has become a tsunami. \u201cIf I started my career now, you might not hear about me,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t break through this noise.\u201d To sell tickets to Jay &amp; Silent Bob Reboot, Smith will tour with the film for five months offering audiences a post-screening chat that tends to climax to an inspirational sermon about how if he made it, anyone can. His biography \u2013 not his films \u2013 is becoming his legacy.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just become one with the art where Kevin Smith is no longer an individual, he\u2019s just a concept of these series of movies. Until people are like, \u2018Who is Kevin Smith?\u2019 because they don\u2019t watch movies any more \u2013 but that\u2019s what the handprints are about.\u201d</p> <p>The weed he has been smoking during the interview has definitely kicked in. Yet he sees his career with clarity.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a film-maker,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI think I\u2019m a salesman. I could sell you Kevin Smith all day. Not a lot of people are buying any more, but enough are where I still get to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, he got a call from the man who launched his fame: Weinstein. They hadn\u2019t spoken for about 10 years, after falling out over the marketing for their final film together, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/14/zack-and-miri-make-a-porno-review\" title=\"\">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a>. Weinstein suggested they partner on a sequel to Dogma. Smith was thrilled. \u201cHopefully people understand, but getting that call meant the world. I felt like: \u2018Oh, he remembered me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A week later, the first article about Weinstein\u2019s sexual assaults broke. \u201cAll I knew was that he was a philanderer, he cheated on his wife,\u201d says Smith. Of course, he realised that Weinstein didn\u2019t care about Dogma, or him.</p> <p>\u201cHe was circling his wagons,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI am not a victim here. But I felt used a little bit.\u201d Days later, to help the real victims \u2013 the women whose dreams Weinstein crushed \u2013 Smith pledged his future residuals from the films Weinstein produced to the non-profit Women in Film.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d gone back in time and told that kid: \u2018This is all you\u2019ll do, but it will be connected to a person who does all of this to all these people,\u2019 I definitely wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI was way too Christian.\u201d Smith is no longer religious (Dogma, he claims, revoked his invitation to heaven), but he still seems guided by guilt, obligation and gratitude. \u201cCareer-wise, I always felt like I was playing on house money,\u201d says Smith. \u201cNow life-wise, this is just a bonus because it was supposed to end in that emergency room.\u201d</p> <p>To him, his own Clerks catchphrase \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be here today\u201d \u2013 now echoes even louder. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe\u2019re all insanely lucky to be here.

      "bodyText": "In February last year, Kevin Smith performed 90 minutes of standup for a TV special, padded back to the green room and started to worry that the joint he had smoked before the show was too strong. He was sweaty and nauseous, which was not entirely out of the ordinary. But after he lay down on the tile floor and vomited, he was rushed to hospital, where a doctor broke the news that Smith was having a massive heart attack. Smith stayed calm. Honestly, he tells me, as we talk at his Hollywood Hills home, he was still stoned. On learning that he might die, he says: \u201cI was like: \u2018I\u2019m going to make peace with this right away.\u2019 You did way more than you ever set out to do, you got to do some cool shit, and if it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done.\u201d For 25 years, Smith, a director and actor as well as a comedian, has grappled with his own dumb luck. In 1994, his debut film, Clerks, a raunchy comedy about the convenience store where he worked, was a hit with Sundance audiences charmed by Smith\u2019s on-screen appearance, as a slacker known as Silent Bob, and his behind-the-scenes stories of selling cigarettes during the day and shooting the movie at night. Made for just $25,575, Clerks was funded by credit cards and favours from friends, some of whom even had parts in the film: Brian O\u2019Halloran, for instance, plays Dante Hicks and delivers the catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be here today!\u201d and Smith\u2019s middle-school chum Jason Mewes, who agreed to play Jay, the talkative half of Jay and Silent Bob (Smith), two friendly morons with flashes of brilliance. Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Miramax bought Clerks and, as its publicists had done with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, turned the filthy-mouthed former altar boy, the 24-year-old son of a New Jersey postal worker, into a star. \u201cI\u2019ve been living on that one trick for a long time,\u201d admits Smith. \u201cLike, come on, that movie was cute \u2013 but 25 years on the back of one black-and-white movie?\u201d Lighting a branded Jay &amp; Silent Bob joint with his face on the packaging, he describes that Sundance wunderkind as if he were someone else. \u201cI love that guy. I don\u2019t understand why he had the confidence. I think he was undereducated. I was never ambitious. I think that was a fluke.\u201d A fluke that became the cornerstone of his future, of his gorgeous three-story house decorated with memories: a table-top football game inspired by the roof hockey in Clerks, iron fireplace statues of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Dogma, a walrus ceramic that nods to his screwball gothic Tusk, crayon sketches, movie posters and souvenirs from the live stage monologues in which Smith extemporises on everything from phone chats with Bruce Willis to his dog\u2019s genitalia. (He has sold out Carnegie Hall.) The upstairs living room is dominated by a collage celebrating his 20-year marriage to Jennifer Schwalbach. Squint, and you can find his first email to his future bride: \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many Schwalbachs there are in the phonebook \u2026\u201d \u201cThe house is a me-seum that highlights the accomplishments of Kevin Smith,\u201d he jokes. When he looks around, he is reminded of everything he did that he never expected to do. \u201cThat\u2019s why, when I almost dropped dead, I was OK with it,\u201d he says. \u201cMost days I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh, I probably did die on the table and this is heaven.\u2019\u201d Back to that operating room. The doctor asked if the Smiths had a history of heart disease? No, replied Smith. Only that his father died of a massive heart attack \u2013 and that his mother, who is still alive, had stents inserted in her arteries after her heart stopped for a full minute, during which she claims to have seen his deceased dad and grandmother. \u201cShe was probably pumped on fentanyl when she saw heaven,\u201d Smith chuckles, \u201cso I don\u2019t know if I want to invest in that. \u201cI was a fat kid,\u201d he continues. At 14, he joined Weight Watchers, but felt awkward being the only teenage boy and left after a month. As the third child of parents who were strapped for money and time, the only health food he saw was tinned spinach. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like vegetables.\u201d When he earned money to buy his own snacks, he devoured \u201clow-fat\u201d cookies not realising they were packed with sugar. \u201cOh, I fell for it all,\u201d he says. The biggest hurdle, however, was mental. Over the years, he had embraced his weight, turning fat jokes from a problem to a comedic purpose. \u201cThe key early on was realising if I make fun of myself for this, then somebody else can\u2019t. One day you think: \u2018I could be funny for a living.\u2019\u201d He marketed himself as a character \u2013 the happy schlub in a hockey jersey \u2013 and literally became a cartoon, as Clerks went from indie movie to comic book to sequels to animated series. Success, Smith notes, gave him an extra padding of protection. \u201cFor years, people were just like: \u2018Hey, big guy!\u2019 And I was like, I am the big guy, aren\u2019t I?\u201d says Smith. \u201cNobody ever says: \u2018Hey, fat-ass!\u2019\u201d At his heaviest, Smith, who is 5ft 9in, weighed 23st 8lb (150kg). About a decade ago he was escorted off a plane for being unable to squeeze into one seat. The story made headlines around the world, and internet trolls were merciless. For the first time, Smith felt naked. \u201cSuddenly, I was like: \u2018They know I\u2019m fat\u2019 \u2013 I thought I was hiding it!\u201d For a while, he swaggered through his insecurities, titling that year\u2019s live show Too Fat for 40, then launching the podcast Fat Man on Batman and publishing a memoir called Tough Sh*t: Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good. But he also quit sugar, an experience he likens to withdrawing from heroin. Finally, the craving for desserts stopped and 5st melted away. An hour before his heart attack, Smith had been boasting on stage about dropping five underwear sizes from 5XL to XL. \u201cI would have thought I was in pretty decent shape that night,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s weird to look at me and go: \u2018Jesus, did I know I was that unhealthy? Or did I just not care?\u2019\u201d Since then, he has lost almost another 6st by going vegan, at the insistence of his 20-year-old daughter, Harley Quinn. Most days, he fasts until noon, then grabs vegan nachos from his favourite fast food joint. He has stocked a two-foot-wide snack bowl with crunchy chickpeas and vegetable puffs in case he gets the munchies. \u201cTreats galore!\u201d he grins. Now his wedding ring wobbles when Smith waves his hands.. The first time he realised he was too skinny for the Big and Tall clothing store, he nearly cried. His purple sports coat droops on his shoulders, but he worries that if he has it taken in to fit his new frame, he will jinx himself and regain the weight he has lost. Part of him still can\u2019t help crediting luck over effort. He did, however, give away all his signature hockey jerseys. \u201cI started looking weird in them,\u201d says Smith. Although, he adds: \u201cPeople were like: \u2018You looked weird the whole time.\u2019\u201d This year has been surreal. Smith posed for a photo shoot for Men\u2019s Health magazine. \u201cSomebody told me online: \u2018You\u2019re like a Walmart Robert Downey Jr,\u2019\u201d says Smith. \u201cI\u2019ll take that!\u201d A website stole his picture to hawk diet pills. Last month, he and Mewes were invited to put their handprints in the cement outside the legendary Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith brought his father\u2019s ashes to the ceremony. Four decades ago, on a family vacation, his dad had offhandedly told him he might be here some day. Now he was. Smith ground an urn print into the wet pavement. In his new film, Jay &amp; Silent Bob Reboot, Jay and Silent Bob are still where he left them in 2006\u2019s Clerks 2, loitering outside the Quick Stop, although the video rental shop next to the Quick Stop has been supplanted by a Redbox kiosk. \u201cThe world has moved on,\u201d says Smith. As for Jay and Silent Bob, now visibly in their 40s, they are out-of-touch apolitical white males. \u201cWe needed to introduce them to \u2018this is woke culture\u2019.\u201d Smith chose the one-year anniversary of his heart attack for his first day of filming. \u201cIt\u2019s not macabre,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to death!\u201d The movie finds the pair trekking, again, from New Jersey to California to fight for the film rights for their fictional likenesses Bluntman and Chronic, as they did in 2001\u2019s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The script is a greatest hits of inside jokes. Smith settled on calling it a reboot, which one character explains, is when \u201cthey take a flick you loved as a kid and add youth and diversity to it\u201d. That is exactly what Smith has done, recasting the film with a pro-LGBTQ anti-Nazi and hiring Harley Quinn to play the leader of a pack of rebellious vegan girls. \u201cThis is the most bloated and self-indulgent movie anyone\u2019s ever made, and I might get away with it because of the heart attack,\u201d he laughs. As for his star-studded cast, which includes Damon and Affleck, plus Chris Hemsworth, Rosario Dawson, Fred Armisen, Craig Robinson, Val Kilmer, Tommy Chong and rappers Method Man and Redman, he jokes that, apart from Affleck, most of them probably showed up out of guilt. \u201cAffleck was like: \u2018I didn\u2019t even know about the heart attack.\u2019\u201d Smith pauses. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about that.\u201d Smith doesn\u2019t agree with the Joker director Todd Phillips\u2019 insistence that woke culture has destroyed comedy. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way because I always punch in,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s always been easy for liberals to mock Nigel Farage: for his posturing against the \u201cestablishment\u201d, despite being a privately educated City trader; for his affected tweeds and boozy bonhomie; for his endless failure to win a seat in parliament. And now, for his latest bumbling retreat. After loudly proclaiming that his Brexit party would stand general election candidates across the country, he was forced to make an awkward U-turn last week, announcing that they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\" title=\"\">withdraw from Conservative-held seats</a> in a bid to ensure a leave majority in the next House of Commons.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy, but pointless. This looks like a personal humiliation for Farage, and it has clearly angered many of his own party activists. But it may be a sign of his ultimate triumph. What helps make Farage one of the most skilled campaigners of this century is precisely his willingness to let himself look ridiculous, or to make and break alliances without concern for appearances, in the service of his greater project.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Farage cannot withdraw from Labour marginals without surrendering his one bit of leverage to pressure the Tories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This project \u2013 splitting the UK from the European Union and forcing the realignment of the British right on nationalist and reactionary grounds \u2013 is now closer to being achieved than at any point in his career. And it is not Farage who has moved but the Conservative party. His \u201cunilateral\u201d election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/wednesday-briefing-johnson-farage-pact-threatens-nasty-government\" title=\"\">pact with the Tories</a> was, in reality, the result of behind-the-scenes begging from Boris Johnson\u2019s camp and enormous public pressure from rightwing tabloids. It was made possible because the Conservatives have been pulled squarely on to his territory, with rightwing populists in the ascendant and the more liberal-minded MPs jumping ship.</p> <p>Yet Farage was unwilling to go the whole way and stand down Brexit party candidates in Labour-held marginal seats \u2013 which, according to most analysts, would have been a much bigger help to Johnson. This is because Farage is not ready to concede what has always been his most powerful weapon: his reputed appeal to \u201cleft behind\u201d voters.</p> <p>The coalition of support he has mobilised in his various campaigns \u2013 first with Ukip, then in the 2016 referendum, and now in the Brexit party \u2013 has always been rooted in the right-leaning English middle classes. But what has always attracted the most attention is the appeal of Faragism to a minority of working-class voters in former industrial towns of England and Wales. This is the secret of his success: it sparks panic among Labour politicians that their \u201ctraditional\u201d voters might desert them, and sparks hope among Tories that they can hoover up the rest. Farage, who does not trust Johnson to keep his promises, cannot withdraw from Labour marginals without surrendering his one bit of leverage to press the Tories and get the Brexit he wants.</p> <p>The real currency of Faragism is hype.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s always been easy for liberals to mock Nigel Farage: for his posturing against the \u201cestablishment\u201d, despite being a privately educated City trader; for his affected tweeds and boozy bonhomie; for his endless failure to win a seat in parliament. And now, for his latest bumbling retreat. After loudly proclaiming that his Brexit party would stand general election candidates across the country, he was forced to make an awkward U-turn last week, announcing that they would withdraw from Conservative-held seats in a bid to ensure a leave majority in the next House of Commons. It\u2019s easy, but pointless. This looks like a personal humiliation for Farage, and it has clearly angered many of his own party activists. But it may be a sign of his ultimate triumph. What helps make Farage one of the most skilled campaigners of this century is precisely his willingness to let himself look ridiculous, or to make and break alliances without concern for appearances, in the service of his greater project. This project \u2013 splitting the UK from the European Union and forcing the realignment of the British right on nationalist and reactionary grounds \u2013 is now closer to being achieved than at any point in his career. And it is not Farage who has moved but the Conservative party. His \u201cunilateral\u201d election pact with the Tories was, in reality, the result of behind-the-scenes begging from Boris Johnson\u2019s camp and enormous public pressure from rightwing tabloids. It was made possible because the Conservatives have been pulled squarely on to his territory, with rightwing populists in the ascendant and the more liberal-minded MPs jumping ship. Yet Farage was unwilling to go the whole way and stand down Brexit party candidates in Labour-held marginal seats \u2013 which, according to most analysts, would have been a much bigger help to Johnson. This is because Farage is not ready to concede what has always been his most powerful weapon: his reputed appeal to \u201cleft behind\u201d voters. The coalition of support he has mobilised in his various campaigns \u2013 first with Ukip, then in the 2016 referendum, and now in the Brexit party \u2013 has always been rooted in the right-leaning English middle classes. But what has always attracted the most attention is the appeal of Faragism to a minority of working-class voters in former industrial towns of England and Wales. This is the secret of his success: it sparks panic among Labour politicians that their \u201ctraditional\u201d voters might desert them, and sparks hope among Tories that they can hoover up the rest. Farage, who does not trust Johnson to keep his promises, cannot withdraw from Labour marginals without surrendering his one bit of leverage to press the Tories and get the Brexit he wants. The real currency of Faragism is hype. For all that he\u2019s recently been touring the country and addressing Brexit party rallies away from London, Farage\u2019s key political battleground has always been the media. In this, he makes the most of an uneven playing field. An insurgent rightwing politician has advantages the left does not: from a rightwing press that provides sympathetic framing, to a broadcast media with a penchant for adversarial debates and controversial talking points so long as they come mainly from the right. Farage has capitalised on this imbalance to push at the boundaries of what is politically acceptable, making rightwing populist appeals \u2013 to a sense of betrayal by elites, to English nationalist resentment, or to the kind of nudge-and-a-wink racism that suits British sensibilities \u2013 while carefully avoiding any direct association with fascists, which would be poison to his wider ambitions. He was burned early on in his political career by a photograph of him talking to two BNP activists, one of whom was a senior party member with convictions for explosives offences and an assault on a Jewish schoolteacher. Since then Farage has been careful to keep people with direct involvement in fascist politics away from his campaigns. But none of this success would be possible without the enduring stereotype of the \u201cwhite working class\u201d. It exploits the blind spot of a London-based media dominated by journalists from elite backgrounds \u2013 and plays on liberals\u2019 guilt that they don\u2019t really know the country they are supposed to be representing. Farage isn\u2019t the only politician to have used it to his advantage.

And yet its activist base continues to overlap with the racist and conspiracy theorist scenes, online and offline, that make up today\u2019s far right. Whether or not this election marks the end of the Brexit party, Farage\u2019s way of doing politics has already colonised the mainstream. Too often in the past, leftists and liberals have tried to dismiss it \u2013 or make a bargain with the xenophobic nationalism on which it rests.

      "bodyText": "The NHS is running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines including treatments for cancer, heart conditions and epilepsy, the Guardian has learned. An internal 24-page document circulated to some doctors last Friday from the medicine supply team at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), headed \u201ccommercial-sensitive\u201d, listed many drugs currently hit by shortages at the NHS. The document warned: \u201cThis information is confidential to the NHS, please do not upload to websites in the public domain.\u201d The document listed 17 new drug shortages identified last week including drugs for cancer, Parkinson\u2019s, mental health problems and some eye conditions. It also identified ongoing issues with 69 different types and doses of medication including antibiotics for tuberculosis, diamorphine, various cancer drugs, heart condition drugs, Hepatitis vaccines and anti-epilepsy drugs. Eight drugs have been discontinued and supply issues with over 20 drugs, where there were previous shortages, have now been resolved. The document said that because there are shortages of many licensed medicines, in some cases unlicensed versions may be imported although \u201clead times vary\u201d. While shortages of some drugs have been reported previously, doctors have said that the breadth of conditions identified in the list obtained by the Guardian was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The document told doctors that some patients would have to be prioritised over others for some lifesaving drugs, a form of drug rationing. In some cases the document recommended breaking tablets in half, in others finding a way to share dwindling supplies. While some drugs for which there are shortages have alternatives which could be prescribed, others did not. Switching patients from one drug to another is not always straightforward or safe. The document stated that in some cases switching drugs would require increased clinical supervision, something which adds to the workload of already hard-pressed doctors.

For a type of eye drops that are currently unavailable the document stated that the Royal College of Opthalmologists \u201chas provided clinical guidance to support local prioritisation of remaining supplies\u201d. In the case of Relpax, a migraine drug, which is in short supply, there was a recommendation to break the higher dose tablets in half although the document admitted \u201cthere are no data on halving or crushing them to deliver a 20mg dose\u201d.

Unlike Josh Campbell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/21/crossfire-hurricane-review-josh-campbell-trump-fbi\">Crossfire Hurricane</a>, A Warning does not brim with righteous fury.</p> <p>Rather, A Warning reads like something written by someone with knowledge of what sometimes transpired within the Oval Office but without box seats. While the book records Trump\u2019s profanity and chaos, it does not convey a meaningful firsthand story.</p> <p>As the work of a supposed insider, A Warning illuminates too little. Nonetheless, the book is racking up <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/media/a-warning-anti-trump-preorder-sales/\">record</a> pre-sales. More than 100,000 copies have been ordered in advance, the publisher has printed 500,000. While Trump may have zero interest in reading, he can be great for other people\u2019s sales.</p> <p>Think of the pending battle on the bestsellers\u2019 list between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/03/triggered-review-donald-trump-jr\">Donald Trump Jr\u2019s Triggered</a> and A Warning as a proxy for the scrum between red and blue Americas. Triggered has hit No 1; A Warning will probably follow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Think of Trump as godfather of birtherism. Think of Stephen Miller as a lab experiment by Pat Buchanan and Sarah Palin</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In large measure, A Warning treads on well-worn ground. Stories of members of Trump\u2019s administration considering jettisoning their boss with the 25th amendment are not new. Rod Rosenstein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/21/crossfire-hurricane-review-josh-campbell-trump-fbi\">the Janus-faced ex-attorney general</a>, was outed for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">having raised that prospect</a> in the aftermath of Trump firing James Comey.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s disdain for the judiciary and the rule of law is not news either. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-reportedly-considered-rescinding-gorsuchs-nomination/2017/12/18/ad2b3b68-e1c7-11e7-9eb6-e3c7ecfb4638_story.html\">published reports</a>, he talked of rescinding Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the supreme court on account of a perceived lack of gratitude. Appointees to the federal bench are now expected to kiss the president\u2019s ring.</p> <p>With the president\u2019s tax returns on the line and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/trump-tax-returns-supreme-court-subpoena\">the supreme court asked to weigh in</a>, the public may get to witness another Trump-era civics lesson. Think of the recent census litigation as prelude, with Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh falling into line.</p> <p>Ditto Trump\u2019s attorneys general. Until Bill Barr emerged as the president\u2019s hatchet man, Trump bemoaned the absence of the late Roy Cohn, his disbarred personal lawyer from whom he walked away as Cohn lay dying of Aids. As consigliere, Cohn helped Trump and his father battle charges of housing discrimination in the Nixon years. Cohn <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/10/opinions/stone-trump-comey-firing-opinion-dantonio/index.html\">introduced</a> Trump to Roger Stone, back in the day.</p> <p>In Anonymous\u2019s telling, it took Trump\u2019s reaction to the death of John McCain to make the author realize this presidency was qualitatively different. It is as if Trump\u2019s campaign rallies weren\u2019t harbingers of what would come next.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take a walk down memory lane. There were those moments where Trump mocked McCain, a disabled reporter and a gold star family. In February 2016, hours before the New Hampshire primary, he repeated a cry from the crowd that Ted Cruz was a \u201cpussy\u201d on account of his position on waterboarding. That was eight months before the Access Hollywood tape.</p> <p>And who can forget the chant of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/24/jeff-sessions-lock-her-up-chant-trump-clinton\">lock her up</a>\u201d, a call to battle whose echo marred Trump\u2019s outing to watch the World Series last month. As for the press, Trump painted a bullseye on their backs, much to the delectation of his supporters. Unlike <a href=\"Appointees%20to%20the%20federal%20bench%20are%20now%20expected%20to%20kiss%20the%20president\u2019s%20ring.\">George HW Bush</a>, Trump never drew a distinction between campaigning and governing. Constitutionally, he is incapable.</p> <p>A Warning also lacks a serious examination of how America reached this point or how \u201cnever Trump\u201d lost its place within the Republican party. From that perspective, A Warning shares much with Max Boot\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/03/the-corrosion-of-conservatism-review-max-boot-republicans-trump\">The Corrosion of Conservatism</a>, which also misses the fact the GOP has become less the party of suburbia and upward arc, more an amalgam of class and racial resentments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3deee2369c7028062fb63c2d4a9e91852e2b8a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deee2369c7028062fb63c2d4a9e91852e2b8a34/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Miller listens during a roundtable discussion on border security at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Miller listens during a roundtable discussion on border security at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Think of Trump as the godfather of birtherism.

Trump purportedly proposed classifying all undocumented immigrants as \u201cenemy combatants\u201d, placing them on the same footing as captured members of al-Qaida and consigning them to the US prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.</p> <p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? This is completely batshit,\u201d an administration official tells Anonymous, who writes: \u201cBefore the president could make a public case for the concept, officials quashed it.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Trump is depicted as telling staff: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children \u2026 They are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d</p> <p>Disturbing, however, is not the same as surprising.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/12/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-white-nationalist-agenda-breitbart\">Trump adviser Stephen Miller injected white nationalist agenda into Breitbart, investigation reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke\">had a difficult time distancing himself from David Duke</a> during the presidential race. Then there was Charlottesville, where \u201cgood people, both sides\u201d became the operative mantra. His take on immigrants was not an isolated one.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/12/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-white-nationalist-agenda-breitbart\">As a cache of emails</a> between Miller and the former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh reveals, Miller, too, had a weak spot for white nationalism. According to McHugh, Miller suggested she promote an analysis of race and crime from American Renaissance, a white nationalist organization. Apparently, FBI data wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>Synchronously, A Warning lands amid public impeachment hearings. Although the author does not favor impeachment, the book stands to add fuel to the fire. Central tenets of the Republican defense of Trump are his own ineptitude and that his subordinates saved him from himself on Ukraine. In a sense, A Warning bolsters that case.</p> <p>Beyond that, however, Anonymous is no Bill Taylor, George Kent or Marie Yovanovitch. As the names and faces of impeachment witnesses fill our TV screens, an aide with no name will be quickly forgotten.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Warning fails to live up to the hype. Its author, \u201ca senior official in the Trump administration\u201d, offers few new revelations about the tempest-in-chief. Three years into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the public is well aware he is neither stable nor a genius. Unlike Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury, A Warning does not entertain. Unlike Devil\u2019s Bargain by Joshua Green, Anonymous does not present Trump World in a broader context. Unlike Josh Campbell\u2019s Crossfire Hurricane, A Warning does not brim with righteous fury. Rather, A Warning reads like something written by someone with knowledge of what sometimes transpired within the Oval Office but without box seats. While the book records Trump\u2019s profanity and chaos, it does not convey a meaningful firsthand story. As the work of a supposed insider, A Warning illuminates too little. Nonetheless, the book is racking up record pre-sales. More than 100,000 copies have been ordered in advance, the publisher has printed 500,000. While Trump may have zero interest in reading, he can be great for other people\u2019s sales. Think of the pending battle on the bestsellers\u2019 list between Donald Trump Jr\u2019s Triggered and A Warning as a proxy for the scrum between red and blue Americas. Triggered has hit No 1; A Warning will probably follow. In large measure, A Warning treads on well-worn ground. Stories of members of Trump\u2019s administration considering jettisoning their boss with the 25th amendment are not new. Rod Rosenstein, the Janus-faced ex-attorney general, was outed for having raised that prospect in the aftermath of Trump firing James Comey. Trump\u2019s disdain for the judiciary and the rule of law is not news either. According to published reports, he talked of rescinding Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the supreme court on account of a perceived lack of gratitude. Appointees to the federal bench are now expected to kiss the president\u2019s ring. With the president\u2019s tax returns on the line and the supreme court asked to weigh in, the public may get to witness another Trump-era civics lesson. Think of the recent census litigation as prelude, with Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh falling into line. Ditto Trump\u2019s attorneys general. Until Bill Barr emerged as the president\u2019s hatchet man, Trump bemoaned the absence of the late Roy Cohn, his disbarred personal lawyer from whom he walked away as Cohn lay dying of Aids. As consigliere, Cohn helped Trump and his father battle charges of housing discrimination in the Nixon years. Cohn introduced Trump to Roger Stone, back in the day. In Anonymous\u2019s telling, it took Trump\u2019s reaction to the death of John McCain to make the author realize this presidency was qualitatively different. It is as if Trump\u2019s campaign rallies weren\u2019t harbingers of what would come next. Let\u2019s take a walk down memory lane. There were those moments where Trump mocked McCain, a disabled reporter and a gold star family. In February 2016, hours before the New Hampshire primary, he repeated a cry from the crowd that Ted Cruz was a \u201cpussy\u201d on account of his position on waterboarding. That was eight months before the Access Hollywood tape. And who can forget the chant of \u201clock her up\u201d, a call to battle whose echo marred Trump\u2019s outing to watch the World Series last month. As for the press, Trump painted a bullseye on their backs, much to the delectation of his supporters. Unlike George HW Bush, Trump never drew a distinction between campaigning and governing. Constitutionally, he is incapable. A Warning also lacks a serious examination of how America reached this point or how \u201cnever Trump\u201d lost its place within the Republican party. From that perspective, A Warning shares much with Max Boot\u2019s The Corrosion of Conservatism, which also misses the fact the GOP has become less the party of suburbia and upward arc, more an amalgam of class and racial resentments. Think of Trump as the godfather of birtherism. Think of Stephen Miller, his nativist adviser, as the byproduct of a lab experiment conducted by Pat Buchanan and Sarah Palin. Still, Anonymous has tales to tell, and on immigration the writer does deliver. Trump purportedly proposed classifying all undocumented immigrants as \u201cenemy combatants\u201d, placing them on the same footing as captured members of al-Qaida and consigning them to the US prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? This is completely batshit,\u201d an administration official tells Anonymous, who writes: \u201cBefore the president could make a public case for the concept, officials quashed it.\u201d Elsewhere, Trump is depicted as telling staff: \u201cWe get these women coming in with like seven children \u2026 They are saying, \u2018Oh, please help! My husband left me!\u2019 They are useless. They don\u2019t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something.\u201d Disturbing, however, is not the same as surprising. Trump had a difficult time distancing himself from David Duke during the presidential race. Then there was Charlottesville, where \u201cgood people, both sides\u201d became the operative mantra. His take on immigrants was not an isolated one. As a cache of emails between Miller and the former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh reveals, Miller, too, had a weak spot for white nationalism. According to McHugh, Miller suggested she promote an analysis of race and crime from American Renaissance, a white nationalist organization. Apparently, FBI data wasn\u2019t enough. Synchronously, A Warning lands amid public impeachment hearings. Although the author does not favor impeachment, the book stands to add fuel to the fire. Central tenets of the Republican defense of Trump are his own ineptitude and that his subordinates saved him from himself on Ukraine. In a sense, A Warning bolsters that case. Beyond that, however, Anonymous is no Bill Taylor, George Kent or Marie Yovanovitch. As the names and faces of impeachment witnesses fill our TV screens, an aide with no name will be quickly forgotten.",

      "body": "<p>In April 1965, Life magazine put a photograph called Foetus 18 Weeks on its cover and caused a sensation. The issue was a spectacular success, the fastest-selling copy in Life\u2019s entire history. In full colour and crystal clear detail, the picture showed a foetus in its amniotic sac, with its umbilical cord winding off to the placenta. The unborn child, floating in a seemingly cosmic backdrop, appears vulnerable yet serene. Its eyes are closed and its tiny, perfectly formed fists are clutched to its chest.</p> <p>Capturing that most universal of subjects, our own creation, Foetus 18 Weeks was one of the 20th century\u2019s great photographs, as emotive as it was technically impressive, even by today\u2019s standards. And its impact was enormous, growing into something its creator struggled to control, as the image was hijacked by the fledgling anti-abortion movement.</p> <p>Foetus 18 Weeks was taken by Lennart Nilsson, part of an astonishing series of prenatal pictures by this visionary Swedish photojournalist. His groundbreaking pictures have now reached a whole new generation, having just been shown at the Paris Photo art fair, the first time they have ever been exhibited outside Sweden.

They were published in Life as an iconic photo essay, entitled Drama of Life Before Birth.</p> <p>Ultrasound technology was first introduced for clinical purposes in Glasgow in 1956. But charting an unborn child\u2019s development through such images was not common in hospitals until the 1970s, and even today the quality is poor.

This picture was included in Life and is distinct from the others \u2013 being taken inside the uterus means it can\u2019t capture the foetus in its entirety.

Whenever the hospital had access to a foetus (or embryo) Nilsson could photograph, they would call him immediately \u2013 it was essential to photograph them within a few hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53db6d391ee81fe5d894dacbb58a06f508d949bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53db6d391ee81fe5d894dacbb58a06f508d949bd/0_0_3222_4377/736.jpg\" alt=\"Nilsson in surgical scrubs with his endoscopic camera equipment.\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nilsson in surgical scrubs with his endoscopic camera equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Life Magazine/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nilsson had set up a studio at the hospital where his subjects would be placed in an aquarium-like environment, which is why they appear to float in space.

Anne Fjellstr\u00f6m, his stepdaughter, worked as an assistant on a 1990 edition of A Child is Born and became enthralled by his work. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 20 years trying to understand it,\u201d says Fjellstr\u00f6m, who is now in charge of his estate.</p> <p>As the women\u2019s liberation movement grew, and debate over reproductive rights raged, Nilsson\u2019s pictures became intensely politicised, especially in the US in the 1970s. But Nilsson was working in Sweden and wasn\u2019t aware of the strong reactions his images were causing abroad. It was only on a trip to London in the 1980s, when Nilsson saw his plagiarised pictures printed on posters at an anti-abortion protest, that he became aware of how they were being used.

      "body": "<p>Ruben and Maria Martinez are having a honeymoon this week \u2013 12 years after their wedding day.</p> <p>Ruben was arrested in 2007, just five months after they tied the knot, accused of a string of armed robberies in Los Angeles he did not commit. He was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 2008, and for more than a decade Ruben and his wife fought to prove his innocence, with appeals that repeatedly failed.</p> <p>On Tuesday, however, the couple\u2019s prayers were answered. The LA district attorney\u2019s office agreed that Ruben was wrongfully convicted, a judge formally deemed him innocent, and for the first time in more than 4,500 days, Ruben walked free.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a divine miracle,\u201d Ruben, now 49, told the Guardian on Thursday, as he sat inside the food pantry in El Monte, just outside of LA, where Maria works. \u201cAll of this time crying in my cell, it\u2019s like I was in a dark tunnel \u2026 and finally God has brought the light to the darkness.\u201d</p> <p>Ruben and Maria, 59, were giggly and joyful as they discussed his freedom, saying they felt like newlyweds spending their first week together. While exonerations are exceptionally rare, the couple said they never wavered in their belief that this day would come.</p> <p>They had faith to keep them hopeful \u2013 as well as a binder of evidence.</p> <h2><strong>A marriage shattered by arrest: \u2018They just stereotyped him\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The two grew up in LA county and met in 2003 at the Victory Outreach church in East LA. They were friends for years and got married on 9 December 2006; Maria carries around a framed photo of them lighting a candle on their wedding day.</p> <p>At the time, Ruben was making ends meet as a day laborer, and on the morning of 1 June 2007, he woke up at 4.30am looking for a gig, leaving the house with only $5 in his wallet. He completed a job moving some furniture and was walking down the street to a liquor store near his home in Boyle Heights when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/los-angeles-police-stop-search-black-latino\">Los Angeles </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/los-angeles-police-stop-search-black-latino\">police </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/08/los-angeles-police-stop-search-black-latino\">department</a> officers approached \u2013 and arrested him.</p> <p>\u201cI thought something bad had happened to my family,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat in the back of that cop car thinking, what could it be?\u201d</p> <p>The officers took him to a station for questioning, and a detective asked him if he knew why he was arrested.

      "bodyText": "Ruben and Maria Martinez are having a honeymoon this week \u2013 12 years after their wedding day. Ruben was arrested in 2007, just five months after they tied the knot, accused of a string of armed robberies in Los Angeles he did not commit. He was sentenced to 47 years in prison in 2008, and for more than a decade Ruben and his wife fought to prove his innocence, with appeals that repeatedly failed. On Tuesday, however, the couple\u2019s prayers were answered. The LA district attorney\u2019s office agreed that Ruben was wrongfully convicted, a judge formally deemed him innocent, and for the first time in more than 4,500 days, Ruben walked free. \u201cThis is a divine miracle,\u201d Ruben, now 49, told the Guardian on Thursday, as he sat inside the food pantry in El Monte, just outside of LA, where Maria works. \u201cAll of this time crying in my cell, it\u2019s like I was in a dark tunnel \u2026 and finally God has brought the light to the darkness.\u201d Ruben and Maria, 59, were giggly and joyful as they discussed his freedom, saying they felt like newlyweds spending their first week together. While exonerations are exceptionally rare, the couple said they never wavered in their belief that this day would come. They had faith to keep them hopeful \u2013 as well as a binder of evidence. A marriage shattered by arrest: \u2018They just stereotyped him\u2019 The two grew up in LA county and met in 2003 at the Victory Outreach church in East LA. They were friends for years and got married on 9 December 2006; Maria carries around a framed photo of them lighting a candle on their wedding day. At the time, Ruben was making ends meet as a day laborer, and on the morning of 1 June 2007, he woke up at 4.30am looking for a gig, leaving the house with only $5 in his wallet. He completed a job moving some furniture and was walking down the street to a liquor store near his home in Boyle Heights when Los Angeles police department officers approached \u2013 and arrested him. \u201cI thought something bad had happened to my family,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat in the back of that cop car thinking, what could it be?\u201d The officers took him to a station for questioning, and a detective asked him if he knew why he was arrested. When he said no, the detective asked him to try on a painter\u2019s mask, which Ruben refused to do. Police then asked him if he had tattoos, and when he said he did not, they made him take his shirt off to prove it, he said. \u201c\u2018Who do you hang around with?\u2019\u201d police continued, according to Ruben. He said it became clear that officers were trying to establish some sort of gang affiliation based on his neighborhood. \u201cThey just stereotyped him as a Boyle Heights, East LA Mexican gangbanger,\u201d said Maria. Eventually police told him he was being charged with \u201csecond-degree robbery while personally armed with a firearm\u201d. He told the officers he knew nothing about any robberies, and the questioning quickly ended. Maria came home to find police had put up yellow tape and turned her home into a crime scene, executing a search warrant for robbery. \u201cThe house was in shambles,\u201d she said. Ruben, who was jailed while awaiting trial, later learned he was being charged with nine felony counts stemming from five robberies between December 2005 and May 2007 at the same Boyle Heights auto body shop \u2013 a business he had never patronized. He matched some parts of the victim\u2019s description of the suspect, though the suspect was a bit taller and had been wearing a mask for most of the robberies.

Bristol had higher levels of PM2.5 pollution than Liverpool and Greater Manchester, the study found, but a lower death rate \u2013 partly because it is less densely populated. The research, commissioned by UK 100, revealed that a child born in 2011 could die up to six months early if exposed over their lifetime to air pollution in the city. The study was published as the Bristol mayor hosts an air pollution summit on Monday. This month the city announced radical plans to address air pollution, including a proposal to ban diesel cars from central areas between 7am and 3pm from 2021. The plans are subject to government approval and consultation with residents and businesses. The study found the annual cost of the health impact of air pollution in Bristol was up to \u00a3170m a year. Public Health England assessed in a 2018 report that the total national cost to the NHS and social care budgets of air pollution could be up to \u00a35.56bn for PM2.5 and NO2 combined. Marvin Rees, the Bristol mayor, said: \u201cWe have a moral, ecological and legal duty to clean up the air we breathe. This research emphasises how vital it is that we act quickly to improve health and save lives in Bristol.\u201d David Dajnak, the principal air-quality scientist in the environmental research group at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThis report shows that more needs to be done to address the level of threat air pollution poses to health in Bristol. \u201cIt highlights that the highest level of air pollution in Bristol coincides with zones of exceptional population growth and areas having the highest black and minority ethnic population.\u201d Bristol is one of several areas in the UK with illegal levels of air pollution. The most recent government data submitted to the EU revealed that 83% of reporting zones in the UK had illegal levels.",

Two academic experts, Glenn Kefford and Duncan McDonnell, have warned the inquiry that Australia may have avoided outbreaks of populism only because of poor leadership on the extreme right. Major universities have called for transparent and independent decision-making in government as a cure for voter disillusionment. The inquiry \u2013 spearheaded by Labor\u2019s Kim Carr and Liberal Amanda Stoker \u2013 was criticised by the Greens for its \u201cbizarre grab-bag of issues\u201d after it solicited submissions on all forms of extremism \u2013 from ecofundamentalism and postmodernism on the left to conservative nationalism on the right. But despite initial misgivings that it could be hijacked by those with extremist views, the submissions published so far canvas a range of mainstream reforms including an Indigenous voice to parliament, allowing dual citizens to run for parliament and democratic reforms including term limits. Kefford and McDonnell submitted that \u201cradical right populism\u201d had been a \u201cmarginal force\u201d in Australia \u2013 with One Nation absent from the commonwealth parliament between 2000 and 2016 \u2013 while radical left and rightwing parties had increasingly become parties of government in countries such as Austria, Finland, Greece and Italy. The pair noted that \u201cthe degree of dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and the functioning of democracy is similar in both Australia and major Western European nations\u201d. They argued that poor electoral results for the far right in Australia were therefore more likely to be explained by \u201cleadership problems\u201d such as the \u201cturmoil that has plagued a party such as One Nation\u201d rather than a lack of demand for extremist politics. \u201cIn this sense, Australia may be like countries such as Finland and Sweden where, once an effective populist leader of a well-organised party emerged, radical right populism quickly flourished in societies where experts had previously thought it would not.\u201d Kefford and McDonnell urged major parties to defend and advance multiculturalism, grow their bases and commit to place populist parties last on their how-to-vote cards at every election \u201cas happened, until recently, with One Nation\u201d. \u201cDoing short-term deals for the sake of a single election is not only bad politics, but legitimises the positions of parties and movements that seek to further weaken the guardrails of Australian democracy.\u201d In the 2019 election the Liberals did a preference deal with Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party while the Nationals did deals with One Nation.

For every day of the year, the graphic design student, then aged 20, decided to design an emoji that reflected the culture of his home country, Ivory Coast, and the wider region of West Africa.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to create a project to promote African cultures to change the image the Western media have of Africa: hunger, poverty and wars,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show a different and positive side.\u201d</p> <p>Adopting a different theme each week, he shared his daily designs on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/creativorian/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. He started with food and drink \u2013 a topic that everyone identifies with. \u201cPeople love to eat,\u201d he said. He began sharing designs of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdaxpv7gc8M/\">foutou</a>, (a bowl of mashed plantain and cassava) and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd0p0R8Az6F/\">gbofloto</a> (fried dough balls) online. One of his favourite images, showing a plastic bag bursting with purple liquid, represents <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BdilfhFg5vX/\">bissap</a> (dried hibiscus flower juice). \u201cI have memories related to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen sell it in little plastic bags outside of schools, and I bought it from kindergarten to high school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"instagram picture\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

People began sending requests for new designs \u2013 anything from hairstyles to forms of transport. \u201cI received congratulations and encouraging comments from many people across Africa and the diaspora, telling me my work is important and I should not stop,\u201d he said.</p> <p>An advertising agency sent Grebet an Apple Mac so that he could create designs for iOS as well as Android phones. This year he launched a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.oplerou.zouzoukwa&amp;hl=en_GB\">compilation of the images</a>, which have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times.</p> <p>Grebet\u2019s designs aren\u2019t official emojis, because they have not been approved by the Unicode Consortium, a California-based organisation that reviews requests for new designs and sets standards for characters across different programmes and platforms. Grebet is working on a submission to the body. For now, images from his app, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.oplerou.zouzoukwa&amp;hl=en_GB\">Zouzoukwa</a> \u2013 which means \u201cpicture\u201d in B\u00e9t\u00e9, the language of the B\u00e9t\u00e9 people from the south-western Ivory Coast \u2013 can be used as stickers or standalone images.</p> <p>The number of official emojis has increased rapidly over recent years \u2013 a greater range of skin tones are now available, as well as icons that represent different types of disability, such as canes or wheelchairs, and symbols that are gender neutral. But vast areas of life remain unrepresented.</p> <p>\u201cI think [Zouzoukwa designs] became popular because they fill a gap in digital communication for Africans. My work helps us to communicate more clearly, using emojis that represent how we live and what we want to say,\u201d Grebet said.</p> <p>One of his favourite designs is \u201cYou saw that?\u201d, a facial expression that he says is used in Ivory Coast and means something similar to \u201cI told you so\u201d. After posting it online, people elsewhere in West Africa began sharing the meaning of the expression in their home country. \u201cMy [Instagram] followers from Cameroon commented that they also use this gesture, but as a warning sign, like, \u2018If you do that, you will see what I will do,\u2019\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"instagram post\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "In January 2018, O\u2019Pl\u00e9rou Grebet set himself a challenge. For every day of the year, the graphic design student, then aged 20, decided to design an emoji that reflected the culture of his home country, Ivory Coast, and the wider region of West Africa. \u201cI wanted to create a project to promote African cultures to change the image the Western media have of Africa: hunger, poverty and wars,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show a different and positive side.\u201d Adopting a different theme each week, he shared his daily designs on Instagram. He started with food and drink \u2013 a topic that everyone identifies with. \u201cPeople love to eat,\u201d he said. He began sharing designs of foutou, (a bowl of mashed plantain and cassava) and gbofloto (fried dough balls) online. One of his favourite images, showing a plastic bag bursting with purple liquid, represents bissap (dried hibiscus flower juice). \u201cI have memories related to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen sell it in little plastic bags outside of schools, and I bought it from kindergarten to high school.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell his teachers or classmates at Abidjan\u2019s Institute of Sciences and Communication Techniques about the project \u2013 but people soon noticed as it grew in popularity online. People began sending requests for new designs \u2013 anything from hairstyles to forms of transport. \u201cI received congratulations and encouraging comments from many people across Africa and the diaspora, telling me my work is important and I should not stop,\u201d he said. An advertising agency sent Grebet an Apple Mac so that he could create designs for iOS as well as Android phones. This year he launched a compilation of the images, which have since been downloaded more than 100,000 times. Grebet\u2019s designs aren\u2019t official emojis, because they have not been approved by the Unicode Consortium, a California-based organisation that reviews requests for new designs and sets standards for characters across different programmes and platforms. Grebet is working on a submission to the body. For now, images from his app, Zouzoukwa \u2013 which means \u201cpicture\u201d in B\u00e9t\u00e9, the language of the B\u00e9t\u00e9 people from the south-western Ivory Coast \u2013 can be used as stickers or standalone images. The number of official emojis has increased rapidly over recent years \u2013 a greater range of skin tones are now available, as well as icons that represent different types of disability, such as canes or wheelchairs, and symbols that are gender neutral. But vast areas of life remain unrepresented. \u201cI think [Zouzoukwa designs] became popular because they fill a gap in digital communication for Africans. My work helps us to communicate more clearly, using emojis that represent how we live and what we want to say,\u201d Grebet said. One of his favourite designs is \u201cYou saw that?\u201d, a facial expression that he says is used in Ivory Coast and means something similar to \u201cI told you so\u201d. After posting it online, people elsewhere in West Africa began sharing the meaning of the expression in their home country. \u201cMy [Instagram] followers from Cameroon commented that they also use this gesture, but as a warning sign, like, \u2018If you do that, you will see what I will do,\u2019\u201d he said. Another of his favourites is the Zaouli emoji design, a mask and dance from the Gouro people of Ivory Coast. \u201cI love [the Zaouli design] because it\u2019s a mix of many arts: painting, sculpting, music, dancing \u2013 and because I like its appearance too,\u201d he said. Tech companies should do more to make sure their products are representative, said Grebet, but he added: \u201cAt the same time, I think it\u2019s not really their role, but today with social media we have tools to make our voices heard and impact [what] these companies create. He cited the example of the campaign group Emojination, which pushes for greater representation among the official set of emojis and helped Rayouf Alhumedhi, then a Saudi student in Germany, get approval for the the hijab emoji. Grebet has now created 376 different designs, and he hopes to keep going by creating images for countries across Africa. \u201cMy biggest dream right now is to travel to more African countries, discover their cultures, turn their popular and traditional cultural elements into emojis,\u201d he said.",

Photograph: Kyler Zeleny/The Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The patchwork of farms across the vast landscape of Canada\u2019s western prairie provinces has long been the source of much of the world\u2019s supply of canola seed and wheat.

      "bodyText": "On an autumn afternoon in the Canadian prairies, golden wheat chaff blows from a rumbling grain dryer, shimmering in the sun like a snowfall. Clarence Zeleny stands beside the machine, irritation straining his face. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me trouble today,\u201d says the 83-year-old farmer as he studies the snaking tubes and wiring. Dryers like this, which blast freshly harvested wheat and canola with warm air, are essential for farmers in the region as they attempt to salvage another poor harvest: weeks of rain and snow have left crops too wet to cut or sell otherwise. \u201cToo many more years like this and farmers here might not survive,\u201d he says. The patchwork of farms across the vast landscape of Canada\u2019s western prairie provinces has long been the source of much of the world\u2019s supply of canola seed and wheat. But farmers across the region are increasingly feeling pushed to the brink by an unfolding crisis that shows little sign of easing. This year\u2019s dismal harvest marks the fourth poor season in a row \u2013 the worst run of bad luck in memory \u2013 and comes against a grim background of plummeting incomes and a trade war with China. \u201cA farmer always says next year will be better,\u201d says Norma Zeleny as she and Clarence lunch on cheese and crackers. Norma has helped run the family grain farm for nearly six decades. But the changes she\u2019s witnessed over the years have made her question such received wisdom. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because a lot of young people really do want to do farming.

A similar-sized plot now sells for more than six times the amount. The price of machinery has outpaced incomes: a combine harvester can cost nearly three-quarters of a million dollars, more than twice the cost of a house in town, and many farmers find themselves plunging ever deeper into debt. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for farmers to have millions of dollars in debt or to be very asset-rich, but cash-poor,\u201d says Andria Jones-Bitton, an epidemiologist at the University of Guelph who studies farmers\u2019 mental health. \u201cOne family I know have a $5m (\u00a33m) loan over their head.\u201d To make matters worse, Canadian farmers have spent nearly a year hostage to a diplomat dispute with China; Beijing halted all imports of canola from the country following the arrest of Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US arrest warrant. The cold realities of modern farming in a globalised world have concentrated unprecedented pressures on individual farmers. Nearly half of all farmers in Canada feel immense stress from their job, according to research by Jones-Bitton.

      "bodyText": "UK Labour\u2019s proposed full-fibre broadband policy is drawing a lot of comparisons to Australia\u2019s national broadband network, but the differences are important and will decide whether the policy is viable. Last week, Labour announced a policy to give full-fibre broadband across 29m homes in the UK by 2030 at a cost of \u00a320bn. As part of the plan, Labour has proposed re-nationalising the infrastructure part of BT \u2013 Openreach \u2013 to create a nationwide government-owned broadband network that would provide free broadband to every home. The party has said construction will be paid from its Green Transformation Fund, while ongoing costs will be met by taxes on internet giants. Critics of the proposal have pointed to Australia\u2019s national broadband network \u2013 which Bloomberg dubbed the \u201cblunder down under\u201d \u2013 as a reason governments should not get involved in broadband, but the two proposals are radically different. That\u2019s even without factoring in Australia is 32 times the size of the UK, with slightly more than one-third of the population. When the NBN was launched by the Australian Labor government in 2009, it was supposed to be a full-fibre network to 93% of the approximately 12m homes across Australia. The cost was set to be A$49bn. Unlike the UK proposal, Australia didn\u2019t re-nationalise its BT equivalent, Telstra \u2013 it just made a deal for the company to shut down its networks, and to lease the ducts and pipes. At the time, most households in Australia were on ADSL connections, with only urban areas having access to cable via Foxtel or Optus, and newer flats having access to fibre. When the Coalition government was elected in 2013, modelled somewhat on what BT had done a few years earlier, the government then tasked the NBN to stop rolling out fibre-to-the-premises to the majority of homes, and instead switch to fibre-to-the-node, or fibre-to-the-cabinet as it is called in the UK. The justification being that it would be finished sooner (in 2016) and would be cheaper to build ($29.5bn), neither of which eventuated. A new deal was negotiated with Telstra to get access to the copper lines for the scaled back NBN. It is this version of the NBN \u2013 now nearing completion next year \u2013 that people have been comparing Labour\u2019s proposal to, even though the network is closer to what the UK has already: mostly a mix of fibre-to-the-cabinet and cable. According to Ofcom\u2019s latest report, 94% of UK households have access to broadband speeds over 30 megabits per second, and a total of 1.8m homes already have full-fibre broadband. It means the starting point for the project is nowhere near the same as the NBN. It\u2019s almost starting where the NBN is ending. The other important difference is the announcement that people would get broadband free. The NBN has been built on the premise that it will pay for itself, the government making back money over time by the wholesale prices charged to retail companies providing internet services. But this has caused significant issues for the company, for retailers and for the public. The pricing model splits how much people pay into tiers from 12 megabits per second up to 100 megabits per second, with people expected to pay more for the higher speeds. On top of that, there is also a capacity charge for internet providers, so the more bandwidth users need (how much they\u2019re using the service for streaming videos and so on) the more they\u2019ll pay. There has been a constant battle between NBN Co and internet service providers over this fee, with some retailers warning that the margins are so high, retailers will have to pass the cost onto customers, making broadband unaffordable for some. At the same time, due to the technology choice to scale back from full fibre, and if retailers skimp out on paying for more bandwidth, some people may find they\u2019re ultimately paying more money for speeds that can\u2019t be achieved on the NBN. In removing the need for the network to make a return, the biggest bottleneck the NBN has is removed from the UK Labour proposal. While there might be legal issues and other hurdles facing Labour\u2019s policy should it win government, it will be nothing like Australia\u2019s NBN policy.",

      "bodyText": "The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Prof Philip Alston, has criticised the Australian government\u2019s robodebt fiasco in a paper examining the worrying global emergence of the digital welfare state. This is characterised by increasing levels of surveillance, punishment and control over the lives of people who have been left out or pushed out, with the added feature of outsourcing and privatising these functions so that you get real neoliberal bang for the erstwhile public buck: punishment and profit! In Alston\u2019s words: The world is stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia, where the real motives are all too often to slash welfare spending, set up intrusive government surveillance systems and generate profits for private corporate interests. The cashless welfare card, cheerfully championed by a mining magnate and rolled out by a private company with ties to the Liberal party, is another example of what Alston condemned as being \u201cunduly punitive and unduly harsh\u201d. Apart from being punitive, disempowering, profiteering and perplexing, policies including robodebt, cashless welfare cards and mandatory drug-testing all meet another really important neoliberal need. Instead of doing anything to address the grinding inequality experienced by the people they are imposed on, they exacerbate it. Apparently, in these cases, it is more than OK to do unto others as you would never cop them doing unto you. So how would we go about building a path out of the neoliberal way of doing policy? Here are a few suggested principles: 1. Begin with the bleeding obvious Be wary when you are told that a problem is too complex to fix. Or that by focusing on the bleeding obvious you won\u2019t fix everything. This is usually accompanied by: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just throw money at the problem. We have to think smarter.\u201d (Code for: let\u2019s cut spending on ordinary people so we can give tax cuts to wealthy people.) The 2015 reform of the federation white paper consultation on housing began with the burning question of commonwealth/state relations rather than the obvious need for an urgent increase in the quantum of social housing. Similarly, the 2017 McClure review of welfare was keen on system simplification and income quarantining. Astonishingly, we were told that an increase to Newstart was not within the review panel\u2019s purview. It was as if every effort was being made to erase the bleeding obvious question of income adequacy. It was a stunning exemplar of the old joke about the person asking directions and being told by their interlocutor, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t start from here!\u201d The here is always the concrete situation people are in, not some secondary question or deliberate distraction. Which leads to the second principle \u2026 2. Lay bare the destination Always question the stated purpose. It is sometimes a lie. Look for the context. When a government says it wants to lift people out of poverty, alongside the assertion that \u201cwelfare dependence\u201d is the primary cause of poverty, it isn\u2019t hard to work out that, pious platitudes aside, the real aim is to reduce social expenditure. When, in 2016, Christian Porter, announced an overhaul of the welfare system, he began with the cost of our social security system (instead of the human, social and economic cost of poverty and inequality). 3. Do not artificially sever the connections Everything is connected to everything else. There\u2019s usually another destination that multiple connected policy roads lead to. This does not mean that you have to address everything in one go but it does mean that if you look at a problem in isolation from the connected issues you are asking for trouble. Trouble, that is, for the people impacted. To analyse the social security system it helps to consider what is happening in the labour market and industrial relations. Stagnant wages, increased casualisation, the standardisation of precarity, wage theft and a systematic war on the legitimacy of the union movement should all be seen alongside the attacks on unemployed workers and other people who exercise their right to use the social security system, people who are made to live not only in poverty but in the misery of deliberate disempowerment and neopaternalistic control. Forcing people to jump through hoops in the social security system is of a piece with the attempted de-collectivisation of people in paid work. The fear of being unemployed is a constant disciplinary reminder to the low-paid, underpaid, precariously employed and casually contracted. What emerges are two policy roads, one neoliberal destination. As long as you do not artificially sever the connections. As the poet and theorist Audre Lorde reminds us: There\u2019s no such thing as a single-issue struggle for we do not lead single-issue lives. 4. The best policy comes from collective struggles by ordinary people I cannot think of a single instance in which a progressive social change did not originate collectively with the people on the ground, sometimes literally taking to the streets. From women\u2019s reproductive rights to First Nations people\u2019s rights, from workers\u2019 rights to tenants\u2019 rights; from marriage equality to the climate emergency; from the struggle against patriarchy to the struggle against continuing colonisation; the policies that best address the problems are those that arise from the collective analysis and agitation of the people affected by them, in other words \u2026 the actual policy experts! When policy, no matter how well-meaning, is developed apart from, instead of by, the people affected, it will not hit the mark. The presumption that people are incapable of analysing their own situation is inherently disrespectful and disempowering. Progressive social change does not come from above.

For starters, the informality we take for granted mixes poorly with North America\u2019s demanding service culture.

Australia might not be a workers\u2019 paradise, but many Australians make a living wage in hospitality. That economic fact changes the relationship between customer and server.

Relief because I\u2019m guaranteed to enjoy my breakfast. Shame for the same reason; I don\u2019t want to be the sort of traveller who can\u2019t do without the comforts of home, like the Brits who eat baked beans each morning in Benidorm. The clientele always makes me feel even more uncomfortable; they\u2019re more interested in photographing their food than eating it. (Mostly this is intolerable because I have to pretend like I didn\u2019t plan on posting pictures of my own meal \u2013 #homesick.) But what interests me most about these outposts is that they present Australia in a particular light, as a place a lot like the homogeneous Byron Bay of the Gram, where everyone knows your name, the lighting is ever-perfect and the avocados always ripe. This doesn\u2019t line up with the real Australia, of course. It doesn\u2019t reflect our diversity, our complexity or our other big new export \u2013 a shamelessly cruel system that aims to return people in need of protection to persecution and terror. But you don\u2019t expect that in a venture capital-funded coffee shop. They\u2019re selling a fantasy. It\u2019s just that the fantasy strikes me as empty. And not even particularly Australian. We didn\u2019t invent muted tones, natural light and latte art, and we sure as hell don\u2019t have a monopoly on them. Worse is the fact that, aside from the food and coffee, these outlets have stripped away the very things that make going to a cafe in Australia enjoyable. For starters, the informality we take for granted mixes poorly with North America\u2019s demanding service culture. If you\u2019ve ever tried to seat yourself at an American restaurant and experienced the smiling, barely contained fury of a \u201chostess\u201d you\u2019ll know exactly what I mean. More obviously, the laid-back Australian cafe was never going to survive contact with the North American workplace. Australia might not be a workers\u2019 paradise, but many Australians make a living wage in hospitality. That economic fact changes the relationship between customer and server. It\u2019s a lot harder to pretend the barista is your mate when she earns barely enough to keep her head above the poverty line and could be fired at any moment for the most trivial infraction. What\u2019s left? Good coffee and a canvas for Instagram. Not a place to relax, but a place to anxiously project your relaxation to others. Not a place that helps to create a community, but a place that helps to create your personal brand. Overseas Australian cafes are hardly the only places that embody this ethos \u2013 see: the whole world now \u2013 but their uniformity surely speaks to the way we\u2019re viewed and the way some of us want to be seen. I\u2019ll pass on that vision, but it is nice to find a decent flat white.",
