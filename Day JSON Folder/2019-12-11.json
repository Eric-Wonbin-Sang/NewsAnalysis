In a final attempt to get the vote out for Labour the group released another video with actor Steve Coogan, Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie and comedian Josie Long with a soundtrack provided by Brian Eno. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cThe Tories may have a handful of billionaire press barons on their side, but we have tens of thousands of people across the country sharing our videos to millions. They\u2019re allowing our message to cut through the unprecedented levels of media bias we\u2019ve seen this election.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has played a key role in organising Labour\u2019s campaign, used an article in the Guardian to warn that if Johnson wins a majority, it would usher in a \u201cpolitical dark age, dominated by extreme rightwing populism\u201d. \u201cWe will face a Johnson government \u2013 with its establishment allies owning most of our print newspapers, with a proven ability to bully and dominate broadcast media, and a capacity to buy up dark ads across social media \u2013 that is able to manipulate our politics on a scale we have never seen in this country,\u201d he wrote.",

Foyth: he didn\u2019t play one minute with me until today and he has done more in these 90 minutes than in two or three weeks of work without playing.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding Sessegnon, he says he took his goal very well - \u201che has that quality\u201d - but points to a couple of areas the youngster can improve (\u201che needs to learn to use his body\u201d): \u201cHe has a lot to develop but the potential is there.\u201d <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df164998f08f521712b4874\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T21:53:12.696Z\">9.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Bayern 3-1 Spurs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That was a mostly desultory performance from Spurs, who were outplayed by a Bayern team at half-speed.

This is one of those matches that existentialist philosophers love. You are free to give it your own meaning. In competition terms, it is absurd: Bayern have already qualified for the next stage as group winners, and Spurs have already got there as runners-up. But the teams are here and so are we, so let\u2019s make it matter. Express yourselves, players! Express yourself, reader! </p> <p> Actually, the game does carry at least a little jeopardy, especially for Bayern. They come into it on the back of two domestic defeats and they are not the kind of club who can tolerate a third straight loss, especially not to a side whom they whupped 7-2 a couple of months ago. That was a different Tottenham, though, one led by a Mauricio Pochettino nearing the end of his tether. Now Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has the reins and it will be a matter of pride to him to show some improvement. You might think improving on a 7-2 defeat will be a doddle, but canny Mourinho has introduced an extra element of intrigue by leaving a load of first-teamers in London, including Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Jan Vertonghen and Serge Aurier, along with the injured Hugo Lloris, Tanguy Ndombele, Harry Winks and Erik Lamela. So expect some lesser-spotted faces to get a look-in today. It\u2019s a pity for Spurs\u2019 U-19s that they had to play Bayern\u2019s U-19s earlier today (result: 3-0 to Bayern), otherwise they might have got a run-out against the senior side here. It\u2019s on! </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 8pm GMT, 9pm in Munich.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T17:41:26.982Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is David Hytner\u2019s report from Munich. There\u2019s a lovely moment when delight is written all over Sessgnon\u2019s face after he\u2019s told that he\u2019s the youngest player ever to score in the Champions League for Spurs. Then he reverts to being a composed and articulate talker. Asked what the biggest thing he learned today was he replies: \u201cIf you don\u2019t take your chances against the big teams you\u2019ll get punished. We knew they would have lots of the ball and it\u2019s hard when you chase the ball but we did get into good positions on transitions and if we had taken those chances ... Mourinho: [It was] a good match for me. I don\u2019t want to speak about conclusions because its too strong a word. But I would say [I got] important information. I\u2019ll give you the positive examples because that\u2019s easier. Foyth: he didn\u2019t play one minute with me until today and he has done more in these 90 minutes than in two or three weeks of work without playing.\u201d Regarding Sessegnon, he says he took his goal very well - \u201che has that quality\u201d - but points to a couple of areas the youngster can improve (\u201che needs to learn to use his body\u201d): \u201cHe has a lot to develop but the potential is there.\u201d That was a mostly desultory performance from Spurs, who were outplayed by a Bayern team at half-speed. Sessegnon scored a lovely goal and Gazzaniga did fine, but that was about the extent of the positives from Spurs. Bayern are very nifty going forward but alarmingly open at the back. This meaningless game was not one from which big conclusions should be drawn ... but neither of these teams is going to win the Champions League this year. 90+1 min: Son is sent racing clear, bearing down on goal, a little to the left of centre. Neuer comes to meet him ... and sticks out a leg to save the forward\u2019s low shot. 90 min: There will be at least three more minutes. 89 min: Walker-Peters stops Coutinho from taking the ball on to his right foot. So the Brazilian shifts it on to his left and fires off a shot from 12 yards. Gazzaniga touches it over. 89 min: Skipp and Rose throw themselves in front of a shot by Gnabry to prevent Bayern from plundering a fourth. 88 min: \u201cI\u2019m not watching the game but just read your description of Coutinho\u2019s goal,\u201d announces Matt Dony. \u201cSpurs players stood off him near the corner of the area? Have they never seen him play?\u201d Apparently not. But I hope they - in particular, Eriksen - have been paying attention today because he\u2019s put on an exhibition of canny play between the lines. Bayern substitutions: Zirkzee and Goretska on, Perisic and Martinez off 84 min: Bayern sweep forward. Pavard\u2019s cross hits Rose on the arm but the ref is not interested in the penalty appeals. Fair enough, as there was no way for Rose to avoid it. 82 min: Sissoko releases Walker-Peters down the right. The fullback chugs into a crossing position ... but then overhits his delivery. Spurs substitution: Wanyama on, Dier off. 80 min: Martinez fouls Son near half-way, giving Spurs a chance to get into opposing territory after a few minutes of Bayern domination. 78 min: Bayern to walk the ball into Spurs\u2019 net. Rose eventually puts an end to their conniving. 76 min: Eriksen curls his shot around the wall. Neuer pushes it out for a corner, with a lot of difficulty. It was a wobbly shot. 75 min: Eriksen pounces on a second ball just outside the Bayern box and then knocks it past Martinez, who fouls him. Freekick in a useful position for Spurs. 72 min: A dinky counter-attack by Spurs. Eriksen, in fairness, was heavily involved and teed up Son for a finish ... until Davies hurtled back to make a superb tackle on the forward, who was about to unload a shot from 12 yards. 70 min: Gazzniga positions himself well to save an 18-yard daisy-cutter from Gnabry. 69 min: Bayern could score seven again here if they wanted to. But they\u2019re not particularly bothered. Having said that, they could still score seven again. Spurs substitutions: Skipp and Son on, Moura and Lo Celso off. What is the point of bringing on Son? I was going to ask what the point is of leaving on Eriksen, but I assume it\u2019s a punishment. That was inevitable and all too easy. Davies jinked down the left and then offloaded to Coutinho near the corner of the area. Sissoko and Eriksen stood off him as he shifted the ball on to his right foot and curled a fine shot into the far corner of the net. 64 min: Spurs can\u2019t get the ball. 62 min: You know the way people who can\u2019t dance always make sure they have a drink in their hands at parties? And then they tap a foot and sort of sway as if to suggest they would bust some amazing moves on the dance floor if only they didn\u2019t have a drink in their hands? Can\u2019t put my finger on it, but something about the way Eriksen is playing here brings those people to mind. 59 min: Coutinho turns and runs at Spurs defence 20 yards out. Foyth is bamboozled and takes him down. He didn\u2019t know what he as doing. 60 min: Coutinho\u2019s freekick flies a yard over the bar. 57 min: Thiago skips away from Dier and then knocks the ball past Rose and runs straight into the defender, forearm-first. Rose cops it in the face. It\u2019s been a harrowing couple of minutes for Spurs\u2019 fullbacks. 55 min: Eriksen fails to control a simple pass in midfield. I believe the polite phrase is \u201che has struggled to make an impact so far\u201d. 53 min: Walker-Peters is receiving treatment for a bloodied nose. Think he was caught in the face by the ball. He\u2019s had trouble keeping up with Bayern\u2019s runners for a lot of this match, but there\u2019s no doubting his bravery. 51 min: Coutinho lets fly with another mystifying shot from over 20 yards. Gazzaniga somehow reads the fluctuating trajectory and makes the save look straightforward. 49 min: Gnabry takes down a diagonal pass near the right-hand corner of the box. He sets up M\u00fcller for a shot from 20 yards. But M\u00fcller is falling as he hits it and skews the shot well wide. 48 min: Bayern in charge in the second half so far. Most of their attacks are coming down the left, through Davies and Perisic. Walker-Peters is not getting much support. 46 min: Spurs start the second half. No personnel changes during the break. Mourinho would surely have put on the real Christian Eriksen if only he could find him. Walker-Peters has found the going tough so far. Which may have got some Spurs fans pining for Kieran Trippier. He\u2019s in action for Atletico Madrid at the moment, and has missed a penalty. \u201cYou would suppose Mourinho would want another striker in this team other than Kane,\u201d squawks Alexander Scrutton. \u201cAs wonderfully a gifted winger as Lucas is, he looks like a Year 5 vs Year 11s match-up against that centreback pairing.\u201d Release the Parrott! It\u2019s been an engaging enough game despite the relative lack of intensity. Bayern deserve their lead because they\u2019ve had most of the ball and created more chances. But they have are very fragile in defence - as have Spurs - so theres plenty of scope for a Spurs\u2019 comeback. They\u2019ve already scored the best goal of the game thanks to Sessegnon\u2019s beautiful strike. 45+1 min: What a shot! Coutinho sends a beautiful swirler from over 20 yards against the underside of the bar. It bounces down and at least part of the ball is over the line - but not all of it, so Spurs can exhale! Bayern are back in front just before the break. Gnabry plays a snappy one-two in the box with Thiago and then pops the ball across the six-yard box. Davies, who started the move, tries to slot it into the net from a difficult angle but hits the post. M\u00fcller pounces on the rebound from close range. 44 min: Classy run by Moura down the right. He then ties to pick out Lo Celso near the penalty spot, but Thiago was wise to that and makes an important interception. 42 min: Bayern pop the ball about a bit, trying to shift Spurs out of their defensive shape. But as soon as they try to break through the lines, they\u2019re caught offside. \u201cThe greatest Canadian footballer is Neil Young, who scored the winning goal for Manchester City in the 1969 Cup Final, and who, of course, recorded a dozen achingly beautiful albums, often documenting his experiences in Canada, but, curiously, never his Wembley thunderbolt,\u201d croons Paul Griffin. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s on one of his bootlegs.\u201d 40 min: Silky stuff from Davies down the left. Then Bayern work it to the are side of the area, from where Gnabry curls a delicious shot against the inside of the post ... and Thiago somehow fails to connect with the rebound from close range! What an escape for Spurs! 38 min: Lo Celso is down at the half-way line, holding his face after being bodychecked in an off-the-ball encounter with Kimmich. If he\u2019s genuinely hurt, he\u2019s made of matchsticks. Kimmich cops a booking. And, oh look, Lo Celso is back on his feet now. According to the TV man, he got a booking too, though I didn\u2019t see the ref show him the card. 36 min: Rose hurls himself in front of a shot by Muller to make a good block. Corner to Bayern. 34 min: This is a strong spell from Spurs and a bizarre one from Bayern\u2019s defence, whose high line is being continually exposed. Sissoko should have set up another goal for the visitors but misdirected his attempted pass when in acres of space at the edge of the area. 32 min: Kimmich is more alert than Eriksen so is able to clear a clever cut-back from Sessegnon. \u201cI\u2019m a Canadian who has followed our national team since the mid 80s,\u201d reveals Doug Green, who, therefore, could probably tell you all about Jean-Pierre Papin\u2019s performance against his team at the 1986 World Cup (if you think Mohamed Salah has an amazing capacity to score after missing sitters, you need to check out that match). \u201cI think that if Davies continues to develop, he will be Canada\u2019s best player, full stop.\u201d 29 min: Gnabry\u2019s shot from 20 yards is deflected wide by Foyth. 27 min: Perisic skins Walker-Peters down the left and fires a vicious cross into the six-yard box. Muller tries to turn it into the net but kicks it against his arm and it ricochets wide. 25 min: Spurs catch Bayern overplaying in their own box. Sessegnon knocks the ball back to Lo Celso, who tries to pass it into the top corner from the edge of the area. Instead he lifts it over the bar. 23 min: Coman runs to retrieve a slightly overhit pass and then goes down in visible pain just after leaping to control the bouncing ball. His knee seemed to jar as he landed, and the fear is he\u2019s damaged ligaments. It\u2019s a relief that he\u2019s able to limp away - which suggests it might be a medial ligament damage rather than the cruciate - but he\u2019s not going to be able to continue. Bayern are preparing a substitute. 21 min: Pavard tries a cross from the left but it\u2019s put behind by Rose for a corner. Kimmich delivers an outswinger. Perisic butts a header wide from si yards after outjumping Alderweireld. \u201cGiven our (not so) proud history of producing decent players here , we\u2019re left to compare Davies with all the good players who could have played for Canada but didn\u2019t,\u201d reckons Matthias Hoenisch. \u201cThink Owen Hargreaves, Asmir Begovic, and Jonathan de Guzman. If things go according to plan, Phonzie (as he\u2019s affectionately known) should be better than all of them.\u201d Bang! How about that! Sessegnon almost bursts the net on his first start for Tottenham! Dier fed Lo Celso, who spun at the edge of the area and slipped the ball out to Sessegnon, who took a touch to tee himself up perfectly for a stupendous half-volley past Neuer, no less, from 12 yards! 16 min: Without getting anywhere near top gear, Bayern are dominating here. Spurs have been disjointed. Your nomination s for great Canadian footballers has arrived. A reminder that at this stage in the 7-2 match, it was 1-1. \u201cPaul Stalteri!\u201d yelps Pally Walnuts. \u201cA legend for his last minute winner against West Ham.\u201d That as easy. A calm sidefooted finish from eight yards by Coman, who was found free coming into the left-hand side by Gnabry. 12 min: Perisic chips a cross from the byline beyond the back post. Pavard meets it with a fine volley. Gazzaniga makes a good block and then, with the help of Alderweireld, tidies up to prevent any foe snaffling the rebound! 9 min: A strong burst by Davies, who again feeds Comna. This time the Frenchman elects to play it infield to Thiago Alcantara, who tries to nip a pass through to Gnabry. But it\u2019s another mislaid ball. 7 min: Coman shanks a cross from the left way out of play. He was provided with the ball by Alphonso Davies, a 19-year-old who, if he\u2019s half as good as suggested by people who\u2019ve seen a lot more of him than me, is set to become the best Canadian footballer since .... since ... I\u2019ll get back to you on that. 5 min: It\u2019s scrappy so far, with both sides giving away possession like dope dealers fearing a bust. 3 min: Kimmich drops a pass over the top of the Spurs defence and suddenly Gnabry is clean through! He scuffs his shot wide from eight yards ... but it doesn\u2019t matter because it turns out he was offside. 1 min: We have kickoff! Bayern do the necessary. Those of you who wear clothes might like to know that Bayern are clad in an all red kit while Spurs are sporting deep ocean blue. The players are on the pitch. The stadium looks to be full. It\u2019s quite a setting for young Ryan Sessegnon\u2019s first start for Spurs. The atmosphere in the stadium must be absolutely rocking.

But the teams are here and so are we, so let\u2019s make it matter. Express yourselves, players! Express yourself, reader! Actually, the game does carry at least a little jeopardy, especially for Bayern. They come into it on the back of two domestic defeats and they are not the kind of club who can tolerate a third straight loss, especially not to a side whom they whupped 7-2 a couple of months ago. That was a different Tottenham, though, one led by a Mauricio Pochettino nearing the end of his tether. Now Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has the reins and it will be a matter of pride to him to show some improvement. You might think improving on a 7-2 defeat will be a doddle, but canny Mourinho has introduced an extra element of intrigue by leaving a load of first-teamers in London, including Dele Alli, Harry Kane, Jan Vertonghen and Serge Aurier, along with the injured Hugo Lloris, Tanguy Ndombele, Harry Winks and Erik Lamela. So expect some lesser-spotted faces to get a look-in today. It\u2019s a pity for Spurs\u2019 U-19s that they had to play Bayern\u2019s U-19s earlier today (result: 3-0 to Bayern), otherwise they might have got a run-out against the senior side here. It\u2019s on! Kick-off: 8pm GMT, 9pm in Munich.",

The LA region has made little progress toward reducing pollution from stormwater, which is the single greatest source of pollutants in local rivers, lakes and the ocean, according to researchers with Heal the Bay, a not-for-profit environmental organization. The report was released this week following days of much-needed rain in southern California. While winter rains in LA are critical to reducing wildfire risks and supporting the state\u2019s water supply, the runoff can cause serious public and environmental health problems. LA\u2019s storm drainage is separate from its sewer system, meaning that while sewage is cleaned before it is discharged, stormwater flows over streets, through storm drains and into bodies of water, Heal the Bay explained. Water quality is significantly worse for 72 hours after a major rain event in LA county. The recent storms, for example, sent debris to LA beaches, prompting county officials to issue a health warning against swimming, surfing and playing in ocean waters around discharging storm drains, creeks and rivers. Heal the Bay analyzed watershed management data from 2012 to 2018, finding that local municipalities were only about 9% of the way toward completing their stormwater pollution reduction goals. At the current rate, the LA area won\u2019t meet its collective reduction objectives until 2082, many local municipalities will miss their own established deadlines, and some cities and counties will be in violation of federal clean water regulations, the group said. Meanwhile, environmental contamination and health hazards will continue to escalate. \u201cOur beaches are a destination for people from all over the world,\u201d said Annelisa Moe, a Heal the Bay water quality scientist and lead author of the stormwater report. \u201cWhile we\u2019re allowing contaminated water to flow to these beaches, we\u2019re endangering every person visiting.\u201d Swimmers can get stomach flus, rashes and other illnesses, and tourists may not be aware of the risks of swimming soon after heavy rains. \u201cWe need to be very careful about when and where we enter the water,\u201d said Moe. \u201cWe can have a huge storm, and then the next day it can be sunny, 85F [29C] and gorgeous.

Mourinho made the point this was more akin to an information-gathering exercise. \u201cToday was play and prepare a game when you put more emphasis on the players who rest than the players who play,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to hide that feeling but the players are intelligent guys and they understand my focus was not on today. My focus was on what next. \u201cThis team is not what I call a team. When I call a team it is when you work together and develop principles together. We organised a team so we could rest some players and have some security [in the game]. By the end of February, I understand my players better and they understand me better.\u201d Everything was fixed beforehand in terms of the group permutations, with Spurs knowing that they will be paired with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig or Valencia in the last 16. Playing the second leg away from home represents a big disadvantage in Mourinho\u2019s eyes but if Spurs could get through to the open draw for the quarter-finals he feels anything could happen. \u201cIt was important to come here and get out with a result,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cMy wish is that we can be back [here] and if we can be back it will be a quarter-final or semi-final, for a proper match.\u201d It was disappointing to see how flat Spurs were at the outset, how lacking in intensity they were and Bayern took a grip. They went close when Benjamin Pavard drew a sharp save out of Paulo Gazzaniga and Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara could not smuggle home the rebound, and the breakthrough followed shortly afterwards. Serge Gnabry\u2019s low cross deflected off Moussa Sissoko to fall kindly for Kingsley Coman, who beat Gazzaniga with a composed finish. Coman would be forced off with an injury. At 1-0, it was possible to fear for Spurs. Apart from one Sessegnon burst and shot, they had offered nothing. But they were settled by his goal, which followed a ball from Giovani Lo Celso that was deflected on its way through. The 19-year-old, whose integration after his \u00a325m summer move from Fulham has been delayed because of injury, felt a rush of emotion when his shot ripped past Neuer, although Mourinho would take a tough-love line with him. \u201cHe always arrives in dangerous positions and he is a good finisher,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can improve. He lost too many individual duels. He has a lot to develop but the potential is there.\u201d Spurs may have led on 33 minutes had Sissoko not fluffed the final ball when well placed but they always looked vulnerable at the back. They rode their luck when Alc\u00e2ntara missed an open goal after Gnabry\u2019s shot had come back off the post but they were soon behind again. Gnabry\u2019s cross deflected off Toby Alderweireld; the impressive Alphonso Davies\u2019s shot hit the post and M\u00fcller stabbed home. The half-time damage might have been worse, with Coutinho denied by the crossbar from 25 yards. One of Mourinho\u2019s laments has been the lack of time he has had with his players, how he must develop his style \u201cwhile we are running\u201d. It felt like that here, with Spurs lacking cohesion. Eric Dier and Sissoko struggled to set any kind of tone in possession from central midfield while Christian Eriksen only came into the game in the closing stages. Coutinho\u2019s goal for 3-1 was a lovely curler from the edge of the box and although the Spurs substitute, Son Heung-min, twice went close following Eriksen passes, the die had been cast.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting force has been given an $11m funding injection from the Morrison government amid growing concern about the resourcing of firefighters combating the bushfire crisis. On Thursday the federal government announced it would nearly double the commonwealth\u2019s annual contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which coordinated the 140 aircraft used to battle fires across Australia. \u201cIn response to the request from our national fire chiefs we\u2019re backing our firefighters and our water-bombing fleet with an extra $11m boost,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s on top of the $15m we already deliver each year for aerial firefighting to tackle what has already been a devastating fire season.\u201d The funding injection comes as fires continue to rage across the east coast of Australia. In New South Wales six people have been killed and more than 720 homes destroyed since last month. On Tuesday as smoke brought Sydney\u2019s air quality to more than 11 times the hazardous level, Morrison had rejected calls for more help for firefighters, saying firefighters \u201cwant to be out there\u201d. On Thursday former NSW Rural Fire Service chief Greg Mullins welcomed the funding but said a business case put forward by fire chiefs for the extra money had been \u201clanguishing\u201d in Canberra. Mullins is one of a coalition of former fire and emergency leaders to have been calling on the government to do more to address the climate crisis. In November he and other retired fire chiefs said they had tried for months to warn Prime Minister Scott Morrison that Australia needed more water-bombers. \u201cThis is what the emergency chiefs warned of, simultaneous fires because of climate change,\u201d he told the ABC on Thursday. \u201cFire seasons are overlapping and trying to share eight air craft between all the stares and territories if they\u2019re all burning at one that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d While he was glad the extra funding had been granted, Mullins accused the government of ignoring the problem in the lead up to the summer, saying a business proposal for the extra funding had \u201csat there for 18 months without any action\u201d. While he said resourcing of fire agencies was better than the past \u201cbecause we\u2019ve got better technology [and] better arrangements\u201d, it was not keeping up with the danger posed by bushfires as a result of climate change. \u201cYou just have to look out the window and say well is it working,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are far, far worse, they\u2019re going to stay worse [and] they\u2019re going to get even worse in the future.\u201d The Coalition has come under fire for its reluctance to talk about climate change in relation to the bushfire crisis, and Mullins said that as fire chief he had been \u201cadvised\u201d to alter business cases not to mention it because \u201ccert politicians don\u2019t want to talk about that and it\u2019ll lessen their ability to be approved\u201d. Also on Thursday the Sydney Morning Herald reported that NSW environment minister Matt Kean would push his government to commit to lowering greenhouse gases by 35% by 2030. Kean this week broke ranks with his Coalition colleagues by linking the bushfire crisis to climate change, saying it was \u201cnot normal\u201d. The minister for natural disasters, David Littleproud, said the additional funding would allow lease periods of firefighting aircraft to be extended. \u201cIt is clear we are facing longer and more intense seasons, and as this summer has only just begun we have already seen devastating fires tear through communities right across the country,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cSadly, bushfires are part of the Australian landscape and while we cannot always prevent them, we can prepare for them and ensure that we are responding in the most effective way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More than 70 soldiers are thought to have been killed in an ambush by suspected Islamist militants at a military post in western Niger. The strike in In-At\u00e8s near the border with Mali on Tuesday night emphasises the growing insecurity in a wide belt of poor and anarchic territory in west Africa and, if the death toll is confirmed, is the deadliest on Niger\u2019s forces in recent memory. It came just days before a summit in France where President Emmanuel Macron is expected to meet regional leaders to discuss the future of the French military\u2019s deployment in the Sahel, which stretches across Africa, south of the Sahara. The Nigerien military has not released casualty figures, but a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the provisional toll to reporters. Local media reported that the attackers, who have not yet been identified, first targeted communications equipment at the remote base before over-running its defences. A tweet sent from the account of the president, Mahamadou Issoufou, late on Wednesday said that he was returning early from an overseas trip in Egypt following the reported attack. The violence was only 30 miles (48km) from Ouallam, where four US service members died along with four Nigerien soldiers two years ago when their joint patrol came under fire in a massive ambush. Islamic extremists with links to both Islamic State and al-Qaida have long carried out attacks across the vast desert region. The French military mission and a regional Sahel force have failed to stem the violence. This year has also seen extremist groups increase their presence in neighbouring Burkina Faso. In 2015, 46 soldiers and 28 civilians were killed in an attack by Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group, on a military post on Lake Chad. Last month, gunmen in Burkina Faso killed nearly 40 civilians in an ambush on a convoy transporting workers for a Canadian goldmining company. Two hundred and fifty British troops are scheduled to be deployed in a UN peacekeeping mission in neighbouring Mali in 2020. Weapons have flooded the region in recent years, many of which were brought from Libya into Mali after the death of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, enabling various groups to pursue different agendas.",

The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t love it, but I don\u2019t know how to go after him. I don\u2019t know what I can really do,\u201d the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper.</p> <p>The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/27/harvey-weinstein-predatory-sexual-assault-charges-judge\">Weinstein\u2019s legal woes</a>. On 6 January his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court.</p> <p>The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of nonconsensual sex, criminal or civil.</p> <p>In August Weinstein was also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/08/26/harvey-weinsteins-third-indictment-could-open-door-another-accuser-take-stand/\">charged with two counts</a> of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behavior on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction.</p> <p>Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1m to $5m after the prosecution accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/06/harvey-weinstein-court-trial-metoo-movement\">tampering with his electronic ankle monitor</a>.</p> <p>Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d.</p> <p>The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html\">broke the news</a> of Weinstein\u2019s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo movement</a>. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/she-said-book-harvey-weinstein-twohey-kantor\">bestselling book on the subject, She Said</a>.</p> <p>Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12m out of a total $47m package to close the Weinstein Company\u2019s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs.</p> <p>According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it.</p> <p>In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: \u201cWe reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12m of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.\u201d</p>",

The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited. \u201cI don\u2019t love it, but I don\u2019t know how to go after him. I don\u2019t know what I can really do,\u201d the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper. The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein\u2019s legal woes. On 6 January his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court. The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of nonconsensual sex, criminal or civil. In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behavior on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction. Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1m to $5m after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor. Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d. The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of Weinstein\u2019s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said. Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12m out of a total $47m package to close the Weinstein Company\u2019s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs. According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it. In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: \u201cWe reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12m of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.\u201d He added: \u201cWe plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.\u201d",

She received a chilly reply saying deportation orders remained in place until they were revoked and that officials could not discuss her father\u2019s case with her because she was a \u201cthird party\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur lives would have been completely different if the Home Office had let my dad stay here,\u201d Leah says now. \u201cI believe with my whole heart that if they\u2019d allowed him to stay Jaden would still be alive today.\u201d</p> <p>Leah is now 19 and working two jobs to try to keep the family afloat. \u201cEverything has been a blur since the day Jaden was murdered,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cry because I\u2019ve got no tears left. Jaden has been appearing to me in nightmares. Having to sit through the murder trial has brought us right back to day one. Our family is dealing with trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma.\u201d</p> <p>After Julian\u2019s enforced departure, the family worked hard to keep Jaden safe. But they say that while living in Nottingham he was badly bullied and experienced racist abuse at school. They say he was excluded when he defended himself against the attacks.</p> <p>Fearing he could be exploited by unscrupulous adults who wanted to use him to sell drugs and pull him into gang culture once he was no longer at school, Jaden\u2019s mum begged for help from education and social services officials. No one appeared to be listening. At one point, in desperation, Jada home-schooled her son for more than a year.</p> <p> Despite the family\u2019s efforts, Jaden\u2019s problems grew. In March 2018, when he was 13, he was given a youth conditional caution after police seized an air pistol, a knife and some cannabis during an alteraction in Nottingham. In November last year he admitted appearing in a Snapchat video with an imitation firearm. Majdouline\u2019s trial heard that Jaden was the youngest member of the Beaumont Crew.</p> <p>To the family, the focus on these details is an insult to their suffering. Jaden\u2019s aunt Tesfa Green says the family has been \u201cdragged to hell and back\u201d during the trial, and that the \u201cfetishisation\u201d of gang rivalries and focus on Jaden\u2019s activities made them feel it was Jaden rather than Majdouline who was on trial.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to demonise a family, what difference does it make whether we\u2019re good or bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cA little boy is still dead. My family radiate love. We adored Jaden. I could give you a list longer than my arm of our attempts to safeguard Jaden.\u201d She lists steps the family took to try to keep him safe: the home-schooling, a summer in Jamaica with his father so that he might be out of the reach of adults who would exploit him, and his mother\u2019s pleas for help.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jaden\u2019s loved ones were also living in fear. His mother and sister were both threatened by gang members. Although Jada complained to police and social services, the family say no action was taken to protect them or Jaden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a036414865a4417a1b7848d22eb62abad650a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a036414865a4417a1b7848d22eb62abad650a8/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaden Moodie Movement T-shirt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The family have set up the Jaden Moodie Movement, working with grassroots organisations to support vulnerable children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the family\u2019s frustration is that so much is known about the gangs in Waltham Forest, the London borough where Jaden was living at the time of his death, but they say not enough has been done to stop these gangs from flourishing. Waltham Forest council commissioned a study, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/06/london-gangs-profit-drug-trade-study\">From Postcodes To Profits</a>, looking at gangs in the borough, particularly the Mali Boys. It said the gang was \u201ca violent and feared group across the borough\u201d.</p> <p>Green said: \u201cChildren\u2019s services and schools know which kids are at risk. The question is: what are they doing about it?\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Waltham Forest council said: \u201cOur hearts go out to everyone who knew and loved Jaden.\u201d She said exclusions such as Jaden\u2019s were \u201cnever taken lightly\u201d and came down to balancing \u201caddressing individual behavioural issues alongside the needs of the wider running of the school\u201d. Gang prevention funding had been increased by \u00a3800,000 over the next three years, she added.</p> <p>At the trial it emerged that the killer had been part of a grim cycle of violence himself, having fallen into drug-dealing to \u201csurvive\u201d after his father, Othamane Majdouline, was beaten to death with a hammer at his flat in King\u2019s Cross, London. Othamane Majdouline\u2019s killer had been visiting the flat to buy drugs.</p> <p>Ayoub Majdouline told the court he had been abused at the home he shared with his mother and stepfather. After his father died he went into care, and he came to be classed as a victim of modern slavery. </p> <p>After the guilty verdict, Jaden\u2019s mother again described her despair at his death and said that in her view the problems he faced were all the result of being a loyal friend. \u201cYou send your child to school and you think they\u2019re going to be safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people to blame. It\u2019s the groomers, it\u2019s the dealers. It\u2019s all sorts.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI just miss him so terribly. I just want him home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/11/modern-slave-19-convicted-of-of-jaden-moodie-14\">'Modern slave', 19, convicted of murder of Jaden Moodie, 14</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jaden\u2019s family say they will never get used to life without him.

But instead of supporting those children, they are funnelling them into the pipeline of criminalisation by excluding them from school.\u201d</p> <p>The family are calling for a public inquiry to try to break the cycle of these killings, and an immediate freeze on school exclusions as an important first step.

Jaden\u2019s aunt Tesfa Green says the family has been \u201cdragged to hell and back\u201d during the trial, and that the \u201cfetishisation\u201d of gang rivalries and focus on Jaden\u2019s activities made them feel it was Jaden rather than Majdouline who was on trial. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to demonise a family, what difference does it make whether we\u2019re good or bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cA little boy is still dead. My family radiate love. We adored Jaden. I could give you a list longer than my arm of our attempts to safeguard Jaden.\u201d She lists steps the family took to try to keep him safe: the home-schooling, a summer in Jamaica with his father so that he might be out of the reach of adults who would exploit him, and his mother\u2019s pleas for help. Meanwhile, Jaden\u2019s loved ones were also living in fear. His mother and sister were both threatened by gang members. Although Jada complained to police and social services, the family say no action was taken to protect them or Jaden. Part of the family\u2019s frustration is that so much is known about the gangs in Waltham Forest, the London borough where Jaden was living at the time of his death, but they say not enough has been done to stop these gangs from flourishing. Waltham Forest council commissioned a study, From Postcodes To Profits, looking at gangs in the borough, particularly the Mali Boys. It said the gang was \u201ca violent and feared group across the borough\u201d. Green said: \u201cChildren\u2019s services and schools know which kids are at risk. The question is: what are they doing about it?\u201d A spokeswoman for Waltham Forest council said: \u201cOur hearts go out to everyone who knew and loved Jaden.\u201d She said exclusions such as Jaden\u2019s were \u201cnever taken lightly\u201d and came down to balancing \u201caddressing individual behavioural issues alongside the needs of the wider running of the school\u201d. Gang prevention funding had been increased by \u00a3800,000 over the next three years, she added. At the trial it emerged that the killer had been part of a grim cycle of violence himself, having fallen into drug-dealing to \u201csurvive\u201d after his father, Othamane Majdouline, was beaten to death with a hammer at his flat in King\u2019s Cross, London. Othamane Majdouline\u2019s killer had been visiting the flat to buy drugs. Ayoub Majdouline told the court he had been abused at the home he shared with his mother and stepfather. After his father died he went into care, and he came to be classed as a victim of modern slavery. After the guilty verdict, Jaden\u2019s mother again described her despair at his death and said that in her view the problems he faced were all the result of being a loyal friend. \u201cYou send your child to school and you think they\u2019re going to be safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of people to blame. It\u2019s the groomers, it\u2019s the dealers. It\u2019s all sorts.\u201d She added: \u201cI just miss him so terribly. I just want him home.\u201d Jaden\u2019s family say they will never get used to life without him. Green said councils knew which children were at risk of significant harm and of recruitment to gangs. \u201cOur kids are on their books,\u201d she said. \u201cTeachers also know which of their kids are vulnerable. But instead of supporting those children, they are funnelling them into the pipeline of criminalisation by excluding them from school.\u201d The family are calling for a public inquiry to try to break the cycle of these killings, and an immediate freeze on school exclusions as an important first step. They have also set up the Jaden Moodie Movement, working with grassroots organisations to support vulnerable children. \u201cWe have become complacent and desensitised to the murder of children,\u201d said Green. \u201cNo 14-year-old deserves to be mowed down and terrorised. We have paid the highest price possible and we\u2019re committed to ensuring that no other family pays it too. That\u2019s what Jaden would have wanted.\u201d",

He may choose to assess the teenage defender Zach Medley, who is yet to play this season, while Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith-Rowe are among other fringe players likely to receive extended playing time.

Meanwhile over in Ukraine it\u2019s Atalanta who are heading through having just sealed a 3-0 win over Shakhtar It\u2019s all over and City have gone unbeaten in the group stages for the first time and Dinamo Zagreb are out 90 mins City still pushing for a fifth but Sterling is tackled just as he was about to shoot. 87 mins You have to feel for Dinamo Zagreb but they have been totally outclassed since the equaliser. I wonder how long they can hang on to someone as good as Dani Olmo now their European adventure is over? Now the \u2018Stockport Iniesta\u2019 Phil Foden finds the net from close range. Lovely finish for him to wrap up a lethal City performance. 83 mins A big moment for 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis who has cme on to make his European debut. He\u2019s known as the \u2018Stockport Beckenbauer\u2019 apparently!! 75 mins Raheem Sterling is on for City, replacing Rodri. Not much happening now, Dinamo Zagreb seem to have run out of ideas. Meanwhile Shakhtar are losing 1-0 at home to Atalanta, with the Italian side set to go through as it stands. \u201cDoes the elbow incident look worse every time it is shown because it is in fact not a replay but is being performed in an exaggerated manner by actors controlled by the FA and UEFA in an attempt to show up the absurdity of VAR decisions that have not gone the way they perhaps could have gone?\u201d That\u2019s the question from Ian Copestake. Definitely one to ponder. 66 mins Jesus is off for Zinchenko and it\u2019s been a great night for him too. Time to rest up for Arsenal on Sunday ... 64 mins The Foden-Mendy-Jesus combination down the left almost creates another goal but this time the Brazil striker heads over. Foden then strides forward on another surging run. He\u2019s been outstanding. If you want someone who can play the pass before the pass, he\u2019s your man! 62 mins Dinamo built some pressure with a few corners but City are much more secure than in the first half. Even Bravo just showed some nice skill on the ball. 60 mins A few subs warming up for the home side and here comes Dira for his European debut. Make yourself a hero son. 58 mins Joao Cancelo almost makes it four following a great pass from Mendy. He has been on fire since half-time. 55 mins That was such a great cross from Mendy, who found space round the back and picked out Jesus at the far post. It still wasn\u2019t easy to finish but the Brazilian made no mistake. Surely that\u2019s it for Dinamo Zagreb? Another flowing move ends with Jesus scoring to complete his hat-trick! 51 mins Comical defending there in spite of City\u2019s brilliance. They let Foden run rings around them and Jesus had time to pick his spot before curling into the corner. What a goal from Jesus! Some lovely one-touch exchanges between Foden and Mendy and then Foden and Jesus allows City to take the lead. 48 mins Foden launches a shot from distance but it\u2019s way over. An interesting theory here from Peter Smith via email presumably in reference to that blatant elbow by Gojak. He writes: \u201cCity fans have stopped caring about football due to VAR decisions this season, the players are fed up with it too, I think it affects their mentality and I truly believe this is why they are underperforming, notice how liverpool have had most VAR decisions in their favour, I believe there is a conspiracy against city which is governed by the FA and UEFA, .....\u201d With that many dots, who can argue? 46 mins We\u2019re back on in Zagreb and there have been no changes at half-time. Big 45 minutes for the home side coming up. No doubts over whether it was a red card for Joleon Lescott and Owen Hargreaves in the BT Sport studio. Every time you see the replay it gets worse. Gojak stays on though somehow Half-time reading: Napoli appoint Gennaro Gattuso as head coach after sacking Carlo Ancelotti An interesting half, Dinamo Zagreb will be annoyed they let the visitors back into it however. 45+2 mins Incredibly he has escaped. That looked awful on the replays, which seemed to show the Dinamo player smash his elbow straight into the cheekbone of the City player. Lucky boy 45+1 mins Rodri is down on the ground clutching his eye after a really nasty elbow in the face from Gojak. Could be a red card here ... 43 mins Disappointing effort from Foden goes way wide of the post on the half volley. Dinamo are still unhappy about the goal and now they have more to complain about after Otamendi goes in hard from behind with a raking challenge. He\u2019s lucky not to be booked for that 39 mins The home side are trying to make amends for that slip of concentration but City seem to have found some rhythm finally. A lovely touch from Mahrez kills the ball dead at his feet before moving the ball on. 37 mins A player was down injured inside the Dinamo Zagreb box but City played on, with Jesus nodding Mahrez\u2019s cross from the right into the net. Cue anger from home players and fans but the goal stands. Always play to the whistle ... Gabriel Jesus scores in controversial circumstances ... 28 mins Another decent chance goes astray for Dinamo Zagreb as Olmo fires wide of the target from outside the box. Then Orsik forces Bravo into a save after good work down the right flank. City are at sixes and sevens at the back! Here\u2019s Olmo\u2019s brilliant goal from earlier by the way: 25 mins A good atmosphere being created tonight in Zagreb, no doubt buoyed by the fact that as it stands the home team will be going through to the knockout stages. A great chance to double their lead after Gundogan loses the ball goes begging though as the through ball fails to find Orsik. Moro will be kicking himself ... 20 mins Almost a way through for Riyad Mahrez there but a last-ditch tackle denied him. Then Livakovic does well to beat away a deflected shot from Ilkay Gundogan. 17 mins This is Claudio Bravo\u2019s first game in the Champions League for a while and even if he has already conceded once, at least one person is pleased to see him tonight. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m going to watch this game (beside the fact that it\u2019s the only game on TV here) is because Claudio Bravo is playing,\u201d writes J.R in Illinois. \u201cThere\u2019s something irresistible about him. When he plays you never feel like you know what\u2019s going to happen and it seems like anything is possible. He makes the world a more exciting and unpredictable place.\u201d He certainly does. 15 mins Dinamo Zagreb are defending well despite being without most of their first-choice defence. Foden and Silva are probing but no way through just yet. 11 mins That was a brilliant improvised finish from the young Spaniard. The ball came in from the right flank and he swivelled to direct the volley past Bravo. That takes Dinamo up to second place in the group as well. Dani Olmo with a stunning volley! What a goal! 8 mins Another Mendy cross goes sailing out of play but Dinamo Zagreb are starting to look a threat in attack. So far so steady for Eric Garcia, who at least has the calming presence of Nicolas Otamendi alongside him 3 mins Olmo is furious after being brought down by Rodri but the referee wasn\u2019t interested and waved play on. City on the attack down the left and Mendy\u2019s cross is blocked by a Ademi\u2019s \u201cabdominal area\u201d as the WWF commentators used to call it. That hurt! Peep peep and we\u2019re off! Dani Olmo straight into the action - watch out for the Spain youth international in midfield. Here\u2019s an excellent article about him It\u2019s some reception for the players as they emerge onto the pitch in Zagreb. The home fans are ready for this! Pep speaks to BT Sport: \u201cPhil Foden just has to have fun and play. As managers, we have the ideas, but they are the artists and they have to play.\u201d No pressure then ... So what are City up against tonight? By all accounts a pretty decent Dinamo Zagreb team, who lead their domestic division by 12 points already having scored 32 goals in their 17 matches so far. But their real strength is at the back, having conceded only eight times in the league. Dinamo gave a pretty decent account of themselves at the Etihad in the 2-0 defeat back in October so they are not to be taken lightly. While we are waiting for kick off, Napoli have confirmed Gennaro Gattuso will succeed Carlo Ancelotti. They qualified for the last-16 last night after thrashing Genk 4-0 of course. So that\u2019s eight changes for City from the side that lost the Manchester derby ... only Rodri, Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus remain. Interested to see how teenage defender Eric Garcia fares at the back tonight. Dinamo Zagreb: Livakovic, Stojanovic, Arijan Ademi, Dilaver, Moubandje, Gojak, Moro, Olmo, Kadzior, Petkovic, Orsic. Subs: Zagorac, Hajrovic, Majer, Gavranovic, Situm, Ivanusec, Gjira. Manchester City: Bravo, Cancelo, Otamendi (C), E Garcia, Mendy, Rodrigo, Gundogan, Mahrez, Foden, Bernardo, Jesus Subs: Ederson, Walker, Sterling, Zinchenko, Angelino, De Bruyne, Harwood-Bellis. It\u2019s a big night for one team at the Stadion Maksimir, although fortunately that isn\u2019t Manchester City. Pep Guardiola\u2019s men have already assured their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League after three wins and two draws so far in the group stage, meaning they are in the hat as group winners no matter happens tonight against Dinamo Zagreb. The Croatians are vey much still in with a shout of making it through, which would be some achievement. Nenad Bjelica\u2019s side are currently third, one point behind Shakhtar Donetsk, and will require victory to stand a chance. The Ukrainians are playing Atalanta at home, who also have an outside chance of qualifying so it really is set up for a fascinating evening. City are likely to give a run out to a few of their fringe players so expect to see Phil Foden picked in midfield, although goodness knows who Pep might select in defence. Zagreb are no soft touch having already thrashed Atalanta 4-0 at home and drawn both matches against Shakhtar and will be cheered on by a packed stadium as they attempt to make history. The Croatian champions have never qualified from the group stages of the Champions League before and have a prolific striker in the form of Mislav Orsic. The 26-year-old has 17 goals this season and has recently earned a call up to the Croatian national team so may cause City a few headaches tonight. Should be interesting ... Kick-off: 5.55pm GMT, 6.55pm local.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn rallied supporters to get out to marginal seats and go \u201cflat out\u201d campaigning for the final day of action before voters go to the polls. In a 500-mile trip from Scotland to southern England on Wednesday \u2013 stopping at seats where Labour is battling the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party \u2013 the Labour leader urged supporters to fight for every vote. Following encouraging polls, which showed that he has narrowed Boris Johnson\u2019s lead, Corbyn began with an event in the morning in Scotland, before heading to the Midlands and Bedford, with a last rally in London in the evening. In a half-hour stopover in Bedford, where the Labour candidate, Mohammad Yasin, won in 2017 with a majority of 789, Corbyn urged hundreds of supporters that they could go with confidence into election day. \u201cBe of good cheer and be of good confidence. Go out tomorrow in the snow, hail, sleet and sunshine. \u201cRe-elect Mohammad, make Bedford Labour and win the general election,\u201d he said at the 84th and final constituency visit of the campaign. To a laughing crowd, he impersonated Johnson stumbling over the number of hospitals the government plans to build, and then ridiculed the prime minister for apparently hiding following a request for a television interview on Wednesday morning. \u201cOur manifesto is a serious manifesto and it is fully funded. We put ourselves out there to be questioned on this. I take questions on our manifesto, John McDonnell does as does everyone else. I don\u2019t have to go and hide in a fridge when somebody comes to ask me a question,\u201d he said. Labour is also fighting to win in nearby Luton North, where the former Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins stood down when parliament dissolved. In Luton South it is up against the former Labour MP Gavin Shuker, who is now standing as an independent. Later at a rally in Hoxton in London, Corbyn said that the choice facing the UK is a \u201ctruly historic\u201d fork in the road between a Labour government which empowers people or a Tory government which works for the wealthy. \u201cOver the last 10 years, the number of billionaires has grown exponentially. There are 150 of them. \u201cYou know what, some of these billionaires are really mean because only 50 of them contribute to the Conservatives,\u201d he said. He also criticised many in the national media for \u201crelentless\u201d criticisms of Labour. \u201cI believe in a free press. I just wish they would free themselves from the shackles of the billionaires. They are determined to stop real change. They won\u2019t win, we will, to create an inclusive and hopeful society. \u201cBecause tomorrow you can shock the establishment, by voting for hope,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, senior Labour figures from the north of England, including the party chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow minister for employment rights, Laura Pidcock, spoke to hundreds of supporters gathered in a village outside Middlesbrough. Corbyn said: \u201cI am utterly determined we go flat out between now and 10pm tomorrow evening to get everyone to vote, and hopefully vote Labour, and recognise in our manifesto there is hope, there is something positive.\u201d Teesside and County Durham are major targets for the Tories in this election, with Labour-held Stockton South, Bishop Auckland, Darlington, Sedgefield and Redcar among the seats they hope to gain. Labour want to win back Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland which went Tory in 2017. The Tories have already made inroads in the traditional Labour area after their candidate, Ben Houchen, was elected Tees Valley mayor in 2017. Corbyn told campaigners: \u201cPlease do absolutely everything you can to win in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and all the other marginal constituencies. It is our chance tomorrow to elect a government that will be for the many not the few.\u201d Pidcock, who is one of Corbyn\u2019s most senior female shadow cabinet ministers, said in her address to the crowd that the election was still to play for as there were undecided voters even at this late stage. The event held in the car park of the Sporting Lodge Inn in the village of Stainton, outside Middlesbrough and in the marginal Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland seat, was attended by hundreds of supporters including firefighters, union representatives and nurses. Corbyn also used his rally to talk of the abuse his team had had during the campaign. He said: \u201cWe now have had 51 days of this campaign and 51 days of unbelievable levels of abuse hurled at leading figures of the Labour party, unbelievable levels of character assassinations going on against our party and our movement and I simply say this: if you wish to inhabit the gutter, that\u2019s absolutely fine by me but I will not be joining you there.\u201d In the afternoon, around 200 people gathered in Dinnington, Rotherham, to see Corbyn give a 12 minute stump speech in the rain. Rother Valley has been Labour since its creation in 1918, but YouGov\u2019s MRP poll has it down as a possible Tory gain on Wednesday. The Labour leader emerged from his party\u2019s battle bus - for one of six planned campaign visits on Wednesday - to chants of \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. \u201cThe choice could not be clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe choice is, you carry on like this.

My record against them is pretty good and as a team we have happy memories of winning there four years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/dec/08/england-test-squad-south-africa-jonny-bairstow-moeen-ali\">England\u2019s contract issue central to the international future for Moeen Ali</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it just felt too soon. The past few years have been so full-on and the plan behind my break from Test cricket was to freshen up, enjoy some new environments and get my game back in good order. That is something that people perhaps don\u2019t realise is hard to do when you play all three international formats and particularly so when you are an all-rounder.</p> <p>The time away has felt quite liberating. Since my international debut in 2014 the miles on the clock have probably crept up and Test cricket is the level where the pressure and scrutiny are greatest. Combining it all had become a bit draining and rushing back now might have seen nothing change in this regard.</p> <p>The England management have been very understanding, although it has been slightly strange reading some of the reaction to this in the media, including the idea that 2019 has been tough for me on a personal level. As well as becoming a dad for the second time, I look back on the past 12 months in cricket with a huge amount of pride and satisfaction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes it can feel like my bad days get amplified more than other players, while my good ones fly under the radar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To be part of a World Cup\u2011winning squad was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. There was no resentment or sadness from missing the later games. The tournament became seamer-heavy in terms of conditions and I had full faith that Eoin Morgan was picking the right team to win. He always explained his decisions to me. So this was anything but a hard time.</p> <p>My one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/england-collapse-hands-australia-a-crushing-first-test-victory-ashes\" title=\"\">disappointing Test match against Australia</a> had a few contributing factors that get overlooked but in the 12 months leading into it I had been the leading wicket-taker in the world. I had a very good winter with the ball, one that taught me lots, and particularly when it came to bowling in the subcontinent in Sri Lanka.</p> <p>Yet in the past week I have read that I don\u2019t take wickets overseas, when I felt I was making progress in this department. Sometimes it can feel like my bad days in Test cricket get amplified or singled out more than other players, while my good ones can fly under the radar. I\u2019m not making excuses but over time this can get to you a little bit.</p> <p>Playing 60 Tests has meant so much to me, especially picking up 181 wickets and five five-wicket hauls, which for a guy who grew up thinking as a batter first is something I never thought possible. My batting is where I really want to find form again, though.

      "bodyText": "Representing England has always been a privilege and my decision to take a break from Test cricket at the end of the home summer was made to ensure that, hopefully, I can do it for a lot longer. Last week there were conversations about whether I felt ready to return for the South Africa tour and naturally part of me was keen to get back out there. My record against them is pretty good and as a team we have happy memories of winning there four years ago. But it just felt too soon. The past few years have been so full-on and the plan behind my break from Test cricket was to freshen up, enjoy some new environments and get my game back in good order. That is something that people perhaps don\u2019t realise is hard to do when you play all three international formats and particularly so when you are an all-rounder. The time away has felt quite liberating. Since my international debut in 2014 the miles on the clock have probably crept up and Test cricket is the level where the pressure and scrutiny are greatest. Combining it all had become a bit draining and rushing back now might have seen nothing change in this regard. The England management have been very understanding, although it has been slightly strange reading some of the reaction to this in the media, including the idea that 2019 has been tough for me on a personal level. As well as becoming a dad for the second time, I look back on the past 12 months in cricket with a huge amount of pride and satisfaction. To be part of a World Cup\u2011winning squad was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. There was no resentment or sadness from missing the later games. The tournament became seamer-heavy in terms of conditions and I had full faith that Eoin Morgan was picking the right team to win. He always explained his decisions to me. So this was anything but a hard time. My one disappointing Test match against Australia had a few contributing factors that get overlooked but in the 12 months leading into it I had been the leading wicket-taker in the world. I had a very good winter with the ball, one that taught me lots, and particularly when it came to bowling in the subcontinent in Sri Lanka. Yet in the past week I have read that I don\u2019t take wickets overseas, when I felt I was making progress in this department. Sometimes it can feel like my bad days in Test cricket get amplified or singled out more than other players, while my good ones can fly under the radar. I\u2019m not making excuses but over time this can get to you a little bit. Playing 60 Tests has meant so much to me, especially picking up 181 wickets and five five-wicket hauls, which for a guy who grew up thinking as a batter first is something I never thought possible. My batting is where I really want to find form again, though. Five Test centuries suggests I have it in me. I have put no timeframe on things. I just want to get that buzz back \u2013 a feeling of making my debut again \u2013 and ultimately become a better player for it. And there is no expectation of simply walking back into the Test team, far from it. I have taken a risk with this break but I\u2019m still gunning for Jack Leach, Matt Parkinson and all my England teammates to have a great series in South Africa. This time out was never going to be one just sat at home. Having lost my Test central contract aged 32, I still need to keep playing and earning for my family. Cricket is a short career. After spells in South Africa and the T10 in Abu Dhabi I have signed up to play for Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League. Playing in Pakistan is a very exciting prospect. I haven\u2019t been to the country for 14 years and going back to where my mother is from means a lot. As does top-level cricket being staged there more and more \u2013 like the Test series against Sri Lanka that started this week \u2013 after security troubles. Cricket fans in Pakistan have waited a long time. I am also hoping to be part of the England white-ball tour to South Africa before then and it is another big year for the team with the T20 World Cup in Australia next October.

      "bodyText": "Well, fancy seeing you here. For all the pep and vim, the high-energy caffeine-football combinations of Red Bull Salzburg, there was a feeling of certainty about Liverpool\u2019s progress to the last 16 of the Champions League. The ability of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team to win even when the opposition bring their A-game has been a feature of the season. A simple explanation, beyond luck and \u201cLiVARpool\u201d conspiracy theory, is that their base levels are just so high. This is a team of extreme qualities: physical strength, speed, attacking skills. They have more ways to win, more ways to wear you down, like a heavyweight champ who can dawdle through five rounds and still produce at any stage that lights-out right-hander. At the end of which victory for Liverpool on Tuesday, combined with Chelsea\u2019s defeat of Lille at Stamford Bridge, was significant in other ways. Four English teams out of four will enter the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League. It is a full house completed with a match-day to spare, making it three years in a row that no English team has failed to reach the knockout stages. Even here there is a degree of uniformity. The same four teams, with the addition of Manchester United, have occupied the Premier League spots across that three-year period. It is all part of a wider trend. Worried about the anticompetitive effects of a conference-style European super league, about the oligarchical giants seizing the means of production (sorry, Gazprom!), about the grabbing hands grabbing all they can? Don\u2019t fret. We\u2019re already there anyway. Well, almost. Eleven of the top 16 richest clubs in Europe are in that Champions League last 16. Look down the Uefa rankings and the only missing faces are Arsenal, Sevilla, Manchester United, Roma and Porto, none of whom made it to the group stages, excluded from the top table by the pesky uncertainties of sporting competition. The only real surprises in the post-Christmas lineup are the elimination of Ajax, ranked 21 in Europe, at the hands of Valencia, ranked 28; and the ousting of Benfica, ranked 20, by Zenit St Petersburg, ranked 22. RB Leipzig are the only real outsiders, ranked 43 by Uefa and a fine example of corporate \u201cdisruption\u201d, a startup team, brilliantly run and managed, but a piece of ambush marketing as much as a long-treasured sporting dream. Does any of this matter? It is 28 seasons since European football set itself on this path with the abandonment of the old format. The chief effect has been the kind of economic common market Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn preached against, a feat of uber-capitalism whereby superclub corporations are born and stronger markets allowed to dominate the small and the weak. There were 16 different flags in the last 16 of the final European Cup. That had fallen to 10 by 2015-16, to seven last season and even fewer this time. Ajax provided the perfect case study this season. Semi-finalists last year, a team built on good husbandry and good practice, but deprived instantly of their two best players by the Euro giants and demoted at a stroke to also-rans. Again, does any of this matter? Perhaps not as much as it might at first glance. For one thing the Premier League has only really found its stride in the last two seasons. These cycles come and go, based more often in details and good management. The more remarkable part of the last quarter century is how competitive European football still is at that top end, how resilient it remains. Plus of course a high-class football team is a thing of beauty however it comes into being. The transformation of Chelsea from dour oligarch\u2019s trinket to exemplar of youth, parsimony and exuberant football has been an enforced act of alchemy. But the team who beat Lille featured eight different nationalities, three academy products and have been a joy to watch this season. Similarly Tottenham have spent \u00a3120m, net, in the last four years, have been brilliantly well-managed and are shot through with homegrown players. Liverpool\u2019s ascent provides a more salutary kind of model: enlightened management crossed with unanswerable finances and a powerful, geographically rooted sense of identity. You don\u2019t have to be a financial juggernaut to dominate European club football but it helps if you\u2019re also an exceptionally well-run football machine. Of these three clubs Chelsea look the most vulnerable over two legs at this level, a team who attack with abandon and often defend the same way. The presence of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Spurs has been hailed as an elevation to instant European dark horse status, which tends to overlook the fact Mourinho has mustered one losing semi-final in the last six years. Liverpool clearly have it in them to win this competition again, although it would involve pushing the boundaries: no English club has retained the European Cup since Nottingham Forest 39 years ago.

      "body": "<p>We begin with a fact-check. This general election campaign has officially been going on since around the mid-cretaceous period. Its final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn\u2019t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by \u201cthe UK prime minister\u201d. All the party leaders embarked on a frantic cross-country campaigning dash on Wednesday, but only one of them \u2026 no, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t face it yet. Give it a minute.</p> \n<p>At dawn, Boris Johnson embarked on a sort of softcore Confessions of a Prime Minister tour, which by 10am had already seen him dress up as a milkman, then pop something in someone\u2019s oven. What next? Pool boy? Cable guy? At this rate of innuendo it seemed reasonable to assume Johnson would simply be barebacking grateful activists live on the lunchtime news. Of course, his version of all this does subvert the classic porn trope. Traditionally, it\u2019s a blue-collar guy coming to the suburban professional\u2019s house while he\u2019s out at work. In this case, it\u2019s an old Etonian milkman knocking on the door of working-class homes. Someone\u2019s certainly going to get screwed, but not in a sexual way.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, things would take a wrong turn for Johnson back at the dairy \u2013 a sentence I might once have found mildly unusual, before I realised that Johnson\u2019s workwear adviser for this election was probably going to get a CBE in the new year honours. This week alone, Johnson has dressed up as a fisherman, a digger driver, a milkman, a builder and a baker. How old is his election strategist? I assume they say basgetti instead of spaghetti, and still wear pull-up nappies at night. Yet despite the relish with which Johnson embraces cosplaying as a working man, he always seems oversized and grotesquely out of place in these scenes, as though a vast unlicensed buttock implant has just been cast in Camberwick Green.</p> \n<p>Anyway: the fridge. Back at the Modern Milkman HQ, a producer for Good Morning Britain, filming live, asked whether the programme could get a chat with the prime minister. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d said a senior Conservative source called Rob Oxley, still live on air. At which point the prime minister scuttled into a large fridge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28284f93-1782-4821-96ab-fd7e87103b16\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lp9XoiFbZcI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Time for a historical perspective, perhaps: despite having an underground bedroom as part of the war rooms complex, Boris Johnson\u2019s hero Winston Churchill declined to sleep in it any more than four or five times in the entire second world war, including during the blitz when London was under sustained nightly bombardment. Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill fleeing a lone Path\u00e9 news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson\u2019s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn\u2019t handle the consequences of their actions. This now goes: 3. Edinburgh pub \u2013 Nigel Farage. 2. Disabled loo \u2013 Ken Livingstone 1. Fridge \u2013 Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>Because the smallness of the man could not be conceded, Tory campaign staff attempted to insist the interview request and the prime minister\u2019s presence in a fridge were correlated but not causal. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/boris-johnson-hides-in-fridge-to-avoid-piers-morgan-interview\">Guardian\u2019s deadpan report on the matter</a>, Conservative sources \u2013 I don\u2019t know which ones, but \u201cfor fuck\u2019s sake\u201d let\u2019s have a guess \u2013 claimed that Johnson was \u201ccategorically not hiding\u201d in the fridge, from which he later emerged carrying a crate of milk bottles. Instead, they fucksaked, his aides were taking a moment to prep the PM for a separate, pre-agreed interview.</p> \n<p>Spellbinding. They honestly would have been better off going with something along the lines of: \u201cAs you could see from the fact he\u2019d rather steal a phone than empathise with the picture of a sick child, the prime minister is an extremely cold man. We had word from the dairy manager that one of the units was nudging over 4 degrees and the whole batch would have to be scrapped, so we whisked the prime minister in there to lower the temperature. Hey presto \u2013 milk lollies for all. The guy\u2019s like Elsa or something. Let\u2019s get Brexit done and sign an ambitious trade deal with Arendelle.\u201d</p> \n<p>For their part, for this final day, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour wanted to talk about the NHS crisis. Not sure what the costume is for that \u2013 perhaps a grim reaper\u2019s cowl, although that would make Corbyn look like he was playing Ben Kenobi in a panto version of Star Wars. Inevitably, though, the Labour leader couldn\u2019t help talking about the fridge. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to deliver milk,\u201d Corbyn informed a rally in Middlesbrough, \u201cor to hide in a fridge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet hilariously \u2013 and indeed malarially \u2013 the Labour party then issued a formal statement featuring the following sentence about Boris Johnson: \u201cHe is hiding in fridges to dodge interviews precisely because his fake Brexit slogans can\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.\u201d Oh man. Who knows whether in retrospect this will look like the moment Labour were finally defeated by Johnson\u2019s WTF-ery? But I can\u2019t help but notice Her Majesty\u2019s opposition have just immediately normalised the idea of hiding in fridges as a political act, suggesting that it\u2019s something logical a prime minister might do \u201cprecisely because\u201d of something else, as opposed to what it is: a prime minister, of an actual country, hiding in a fridge. Guys, you can\u2019t fit this into the old attack templates. You\u2019re fighting a war against a fridge-hider. There aren\u2019t any established conventions. This is frontierland \u2013 we passed the rules five fucksakes ago.</p> \n<p>And what of Britain\u2019s next prime minister, Jo Swinson? Alas, even she was unable to dodge the fridge-iverse. I kept seeing her supporters say versions of \u201cYou know what? She\u2019s turned up to every TV interview and debate. She\u2019s never hidden in a fridge.\u201d So let the record show there\u2019s a new benchmark. Here we are. This, then, is us. On the eve of polling day for the general election of 2019, the fridge is now the black hole of UK politics. None of us can escape its event horizon, so I can\u2019t say \u201csee you on the other side\u201d. In totally scientific terms, there is no other side to see you on.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We begin with a fact-check. This general election campaign has officially been going on since around the mid-cretaceous period. Its final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn\u2019t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by \u201cthe UK prime minister\u201d. All the party leaders embarked on a frantic cross-country campaigning dash on Wednesday, but only one of them \u2026 no, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t face it yet. Give it a minute. At dawn, Boris Johnson embarked on a sort of softcore Confessions of a Prime Minister tour, which by 10am had already seen him dress up as a milkman, then pop something in someone\u2019s oven. What next? Pool boy? Cable guy? At this rate of innuendo it seemed reasonable to assume Johnson would simply be barebacking grateful activists live on the lunchtime news. Of course, his version of all this does subvert the classic porn trope. Traditionally, it\u2019s a blue-collar guy coming to the suburban professional\u2019s house while he\u2019s out at work. In this case, it\u2019s an old Etonian milkman knocking on the door of working-class homes. Someone\u2019s certainly going to get screwed, but not in a sexual way. Unfortunately, things would take a wrong turn for Johnson back at the dairy \u2013 a sentence I might once have found mildly unusual, before I realised that Johnson\u2019s workwear adviser for this election was probably going to get a CBE in the new year honours. This week alone, Johnson has dressed up as a fisherman, a digger driver, a milkman, a builder and a baker. How old is his election strategist? I assume they say basgetti instead of spaghetti, and still wear pull-up nappies at night. Yet despite the relish with which Johnson embraces cosplaying as a working man, he always seems oversized and grotesquely out of place in these scenes, as though a vast unlicensed buttock implant has just been cast in Camberwick Green. Anyway: the fridge. Back at the Modern Milkman HQ, a producer for Good Morning Britain, filming live, asked whether the programme could get a chat with the prime minister. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d said a senior Conservative source called Rob Oxley, still live on air. At which point the prime minister scuttled into a large fridge. Time for a historical perspective, perhaps: despite having an underground bedroom as part of the war rooms complex, Boris Johnson\u2019s hero Winston Churchill declined to sleep in it any more than four or five times in the entire second world war, including during the blitz when London was under sustained nightly bombardment. Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill fleeing a lone Path\u00e9 news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson\u2019s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn\u2019t handle the consequences of their actions. This now goes: 3. Edinburgh pub \u2013 Nigel Farage. 2. Disabled loo \u2013 Ken Livingstone 1. Fridge \u2013 Boris Johnson. Because the smallness of the man could not be conceded, Tory campaign staff attempted to insist the interview request and the prime minister\u2019s presence in a fridge were correlated but not causal. According to the Guardian\u2019s deadpan report on the matter, Conservative sources \u2013 I don\u2019t know which ones, but \u201cfor fuck\u2019s sake\u201d let\u2019s have a guess \u2013 claimed that Johnson was \u201ccategorically not hiding\u201d in the fridge, from which he later emerged carrying a crate of milk bottles. Instead, they fucksaked, his aides were taking a moment to prep the PM for a separate, pre-agreed interview. Spellbinding. They honestly would have been better off going with something along the lines of: \u201cAs you could see from the fact he\u2019d rather steal a phone than empathise with the picture of a sick child, the prime minister is an extremely cold man. We had word from the dairy manager that one of the units was nudging over 4 degrees and the whole batch would have to be scrapped, so we whisked the prime minister in there to lower the temperature. Hey presto \u2013 milk lollies for all. The guy\u2019s like Elsa or something. Let\u2019s get Brexit done and sign an ambitious trade deal with Arendelle.\u201d For their part, for this final day, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour wanted to talk about the NHS crisis. Not sure what the costume is for that \u2013 perhaps a grim reaper\u2019s cowl, although that would make Corbyn look like he was playing Ben Kenobi in a panto version of Star Wars. Inevitably, though, the Labour leader couldn\u2019t help talking about the fridge. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to deliver milk,\u201d Corbyn informed a rally in Middlesbrough, \u201cor to hide in a fridge.\u201d Yet hilariously \u2013 and indeed malarially \u2013 the Labour party then issued a formal statement featuring the following sentence about Boris Johnson: \u201cHe is hiding in fridges to dodge interviews precisely because his fake Brexit slogans can\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.\u201d Oh man. Who knows whether in retrospect this will look like the moment Labour were finally defeated by Johnson\u2019s WTF-ery? But I can\u2019t help but notice Her Majesty\u2019s opposition have just immediately normalised the idea of hiding in fridges as a political act, suggesting that it\u2019s something logical a prime minister might do \u201cprecisely because\u201d of something else, as opposed to what it is: a prime minister, of an actual country, hiding in a fridge. Guys, you can\u2019t fit this into the old attack templates. You\u2019re fighting a war against a fridge-hider. There aren\u2019t any established conventions. This is frontierland \u2013 we passed the rules five fucksakes ago. And what of Britain\u2019s next prime minister, Jo Swinson? Alas, even she was unable to dodge the fridge-iverse. I kept seeing her supporters say versions of \u201cYou know what? She\u2019s turned up to every TV interview and debate. She\u2019s never hidden in a fridge.\u201d So let the record show there\u2019s a new benchmark. Here we are. This, then, is us. On the eve of polling day for the general election of 2019, the fridge is now the black hole of UK politics. None of us can escape its event horizon, so I can\u2019t say \u201csee you on the other side\u201d. In totally scientific terms, there is no other side to see you on.",

Quite the reverse. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/05/saudi-aramco-to-be-worlds-most-valuable-firm-after-ipo-next-week\">initial public offering</a> is really only a triumph for the investment bankers\u2019 art of making the best of a bad job.</p> <p>Remember that Aramco was originally trying to sell 5% of itself and attract <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/saudi-aramco-scales-back-preparations-initial-public-offering\">big international investors</a>. Neither has happened. Only a 1.5% sliver (albeit a big sliver in cash terms) has been sold and the buyers are overwhelmingly from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, with Abu Dhabi said to be to the fore.

It still needs to get rid of far bigger chunks of Aramco to fund a diversification of the economy, and international investors will be required eventually.</p> <p>Those investors, though, are unlikely to be impressed by a stage-managed exercise in pumping up the valuation. If they thought Aramco\u2019s real worth was $1.25tn, or thereabouts, they won\u2019t trust the inflated price. The Saudis will hope scepticism will fade over time, but it\u2019s hard to see why it should: Aramco looks plainly overvalued.</p> <h2>Wrong Saatchi won boardroom battle</h2> <p>Neither side in the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/10/saatchi-isnt-working-ad-agency-crisis-deepens-as-directors-and-co-founder-quit\">Tuesday night bust-up</a> in M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s boardroom can claim the moral high ground.</p> <p>In one corner, there are the nominal victors, led by the chief executive, David Kershaw, and the chairman, Jeremy Sinclair. They occupy the top jobs in an advertising agency founded 24 years ago by escapees from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and they\u2019ve just seen the company\u2019s value collapse by two-thirds in four months because financial controls weren\u2019t up to scratch. Other bosses at other companies have been ditched for less, even when they\u2019re co-founders.</p> <p>In the other corner stand the crew that resigned: Maurice Saatchi, a more famous co-founder, plus the entire collection of non-executives \u2013 Michael Dobbs, the author of the novel House of Cards, Sir Michael Peat, a former principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales, and Lorna Tilbian, a former media guru at Numis, the City firm that still serves as M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s adviser.</p> <p>Dobbs, Peat and Tilbian aren\u2019t blameless because they comprised M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s audit committee. Peat, in particular, should be squirming with embarrassment about the \u00a311.6m of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/04/mc-saatchi-accounting-scandal-deepens-shares-plunge-profit-warning\">\u201caccounting misstatements\u201d</a> because he\u2019s a former KPMG partner. As for Saatchi, it\u2019s his name above the door, so he had more at stake than just his shareholding. He could have insisted years ago that the non-execs weren\u2019t outnumbered in the boardroom.</p> <p>Forced to choose, though, one has to conclude that the wrong side won the showdown. Key executives should walk the plank first when things go spectacularly wrong. The non-execs were right to make that demand. It is also why the positions of Kershaw and Sinclair still look untenable in the medium term. Any self-respecting set of non-execs, old or new, would expect a clear-out.</p> <h2>CMA is right to suspect Amazon</h2> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s logic is convoluted: even though Amazon doesn\u2019t really compete with Deliveroo at the moment, an investment could still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/11/amazon-investment-in-deliveroo-could-lead-to-higher-prices-says-cma\">harm competition</a>.</p> <p>There are two arguments here. First, Amazon did experiment with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/amazon-moves-into-takeaway-food-delivery\">delivering fast food</a> and might do so again if it were not distracted by the chance to grab a slice of Deliveroo. Second, both companies already provide an \u201cultra-fast\u201d grocery convenience service and, even though the market is currently tiny, it might be big one day.</p> <p>A bit speculative? Yes, but let\u2019s not complain. Amazon has form in squashing competition and the regulator is right to be suspicious.</p>",

They occupy the top jobs in an advertising agency founded 24 years ago by escapees from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and they\u2019ve just seen the company\u2019s value collapse by two-thirds in four months because financial controls weren\u2019t up to scratch. Other bosses at other companies have been ditched for less, even when they\u2019re co-founders. In the other corner stand the crew that resigned: Maurice Saatchi, a more famous co-founder, plus the entire collection of non-executives \u2013 Michael Dobbs, the author of the novel House of Cards, Sir Michael Peat, a former principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales, and Lorna Tilbian, a former media guru at Numis, the City firm that still serves as M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s adviser. Dobbs, Peat and Tilbian aren\u2019t blameless because they comprised M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s audit committee. Peat, in particular, should be squirming with embarrassment about the \u00a311.6m of \u201caccounting misstatements\u201d because he\u2019s a former KPMG partner. As for Saatchi, it\u2019s his name above the door, so he had more at stake than just his shareholding. He could have insisted years ago that the non-execs weren\u2019t outnumbered in the boardroom. Forced to choose, though, one has to conclude that the wrong side won the showdown. Key executives should walk the plank first when things go spectacularly wrong. The non-execs were right to make that demand. It is also why the positions of Kershaw and Sinclair still look untenable in the medium term. Any self-respecting set of non-execs, old or new, would expect a clear-out. CMA is right to suspect Amazon The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s logic is convoluted: even though Amazon doesn\u2019t really compete with Deliveroo at the moment, an investment could still harm competition. There are two arguments here. First, Amazon did experiment with delivering fast food and might do so again if it were not distracted by the chance to grab a slice of Deliveroo. Second, both companies already provide an \u201cultra-fast\u201d grocery convenience service and, even though the market is currently tiny, it might be big one day. A bit speculative? Yes, but let\u2019s not complain. Amazon has form in squashing competition and the regulator is right to be suspicious.",

Local expressions for non-professional football playing, such as p\u00f6hlen in Westphalia or b\u00e4bbeln in Saxony are slowly being replaced by the generic term bolzen, in what linguists call \u201cregional levelling\u201d. Yet the old east-west border is proving an unexpected bulwark against linguistic change, especially when it comes to food. West of the former Berlin Wall, Germans call a pancake a Pfannkuchen; on the eastern side, they emphatically tuck into Eierkuchen or \u201cegg cakes\u201d. As if to deliberately spread confusion, east Germans use the word Pfannkuchen to describe a doughnut, which is called a Krapfen in the south-west, and a Berliner in the north-west. The local Saxon variant for pancake, Plinse, meanwhile, has been pushed back to its Sorbian origins as east Germans rally around the egg cake as a \u201cmarker of east German regional identity\u201d, as the researchers put it. Another staple of German cuisine shows the same trend: a beef patty or meatball is clearly a Frikadelle (from the Latin frigere, \u201cto roast\u201d) in the old west, while east Germans enjoy a dash of mustard with their Bulette (from the French boule) or their Klops, the two vernacular expressions that are crowding old local variants such as Beefsteak or Kl\u00f6sschen. \u201cIn an increasingly interconnected world, in which people are more likely to move house, to commute or to communicate with people from other regions, one might have expected that people are also more likely to speak the same way,\u201d said Leeman, a professor at the University of Bern. \u201cInstead, we found that regionalisms still matter: vernacular language is evidently also a marker of identity that people wear with pride.\u201d",

Whales as we know them today evolved over millions of years from terrestrial creatures to semi-aquatic animals to fully aquatic species, with forelimbs becoming flippers, the fluked tail developing and well-developed hind legs \u2013 once used for swimming \u2013 lost over time. Now experts say fossils of a previously unknown early whale are offering fresh hints as to how modern whales ended up propelling themselves. \u201cHow do you go from a foot-powered swimmer to a tail-powered swimmer? That is the kind of intermediacy we have been looking for,\u201d said Philip Gingerich, a co-author of the study and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe new whale is too late to be in the direct line [to modern whales], but it gives us a sense of how the transition may have taken place.\u201d Writing in the journal Plos One, the team reports that both a partial and an almost complete fossil of the new creature were unearthed in Egypt in 2007 at a site known as Wadi al-Hitan or \u201cValley of Whales\u201d \u2013 a nod to the large variety of other beasts that have previously been discovered there. The new species, called Aegicetus gehennae, was about three and a half metres long and is likely to have lived about 35m years ago, towards the end of a period known as the Eocene, and is the youngest known member of group of four-limbed, semi-aquatic animals, known as a protocetids, that were splashing about from around 49m years ago. The word Aegicetus refers to both the creature\u2019s breast bone, which resembles a shield, and the Latin for whale, while gehennae, or \u201chell\u201d, refers to the area in which it was found. While most protocetids are thought to have propelled themselves in water using their feet, the new species shows features that suggest it might also have moved by undulating its body in the water, and was likely fully aquatic. That shift in propulsion, the team say, is important as it could offer insights into how the movement of whale-like animals changed over millennia. Among the telltale features of the new species, the team say the hind limbs are slightly smaller than in other protocetids, while both the hind limbs and pelvis unusually lack a direct connection to the backbone. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have tiny hind limbs, it still has pretty good-sized ones,\u201d said Gingerich. \u201c[But] they are a little smaller than the hands, which is unusual for protocetids \u2013 usually the feet are quite a bit bigger because they swim with their feet, they push water with their feet,\u201d he said. Meanwhile the animal\u2019s backbone is larger and more elongated than those of other protocetids, giving the creature more flexibility that could have allowed it to wiggle its body to help it move. The new discovery does not directly answer the question of how modern whales came to be: the animals that eventually gave rise to modern whales branched off from protocetids long before Aegicetus gehennae swam about. But Gingerich said it did suggest similar evolutionary changes might have occurred during that branching process, changes that led to ancestors of modern whales such as basilosaurids. These creatures had big teeth but tiny hind limbs and moved through the water in an eel-like fashion by undulating their bodies. It seems the newly discovered creature would have been swimming the seas at the same time. \u201cI think basilosaurids are swimming with their bodies \u2013 not with their tails per se, because they don\u2019t have much of a fluke \u2013 and what we see in this new protocetid is that it looks like it was swimming more like basilosaurids,\u201d he said.",

We adored Jaden. I could give you a list longer than my arm of our attempts to safeguard Jaden. Like when my sister painstakingly home schooled him after he was excluded from school in Nottingham, when he went to Jamaica to spend the summer with his dad so he could be a safe distance away from exploitative adults, when my sister was begging for support from children\u2019s services.\u201d</p> <p>Dorset police said after arresting Jaden they returned him to London and made a \u201csafeguarding referral\u201d to Waltham Forest council.</p> <p>The local authority in Waltham Forest, where Jaden lived towards the end of his short life, is producing a serious case review, due for release in February, which will consider if there were failings.</p> <p>Jaden\u2019s father, Julian Moodie, 51, said: \u201cSometimes my son appears in front of me and stares into my eyes.

In November 2018, police came across a video on Snapchat of Jaden with an imitation firearm with the wording: \u201clooool don\u2019t fuck wid us please were here again.\u201d He pleaded guilty to possession of the imitation firearm. After he moved to east London, Jaden was excluded from a school there. It is understood he was previously excluded from school in Nottingham. Jaden\u2019s aunt Tesfa Green said her family had battled to keep the teenager safe: \u201cMy family radiate love. We adored Jaden. I could give you a list longer than my arm of our attempts to safeguard Jaden. Like when my sister painstakingly home schooled him after he was excluded from school in Nottingham, when he went to Jamaica to spend the summer with his dad so he could be a safe distance away from exploitative adults, when my sister was begging for support from children\u2019s services.\u201d Dorset police said after arresting Jaden they returned him to London and made a \u201csafeguarding referral\u201d to Waltham Forest council. The local authority in Waltham Forest, where Jaden lived towards the end of his short life, is producing a serious case review, due for release in February, which will consider if there were failings. Jaden\u2019s father, Julian Moodie, 51, said: \u201cSometimes my son appears in front of me and stares into my eyes. He died brutally at such a young age. It was supposed to be him burying me, not the other way round.\u201d Police are still looking for the four people in the car with Majdouline. He has refused to name them. After the verdicts, Det Insp Dave Hillier said: \u201cOur work is not over yet. We know that there were five people in that black Mercedes. Rest assured, our investigation is continuing around the clock and will continue to do so until all those responsible for Jaden\u2019s murder are brought to justice.\u201d Majdouline had drug and knife-carrying convictions from 2016 and had come to the attention of the police and local authorities six documented times before the murder. The 19-year-old, who lived in Wembley, north-west London, told the court he went back to drug dealing in 2018 after he failed to get benefits because it was \u201cthe only way I knew how to make money\u201d. Asked by his defence counsel, James Scobie QC, why he dealt drugs, Majdouline said: \u201cSomewhere to stay, a little payment and, like, I didn\u2019t have to spend money on food and stuff \u2026 I could buy weed and stuff.\u201d He said he carried a knife for his own protection. Majdouline was officially designated as a modern slave in 2018 after he was seen in Hampshire with a known drug dealer. The NCA was concerned Majdouline was \u201cbeing groomed by more sophisticated adult offenders\u201d, according to a document produced for the trial containing facts agreed by the prosecution and defence. One of the agreed facts was that he had been removed from his mother\u2019s care because his stepfather abused him. Majdouline was abused in his next home and later went missing after being placed in various foster care placements. In January 2015 Majdouline\u2019s father, Othamane, died after being struck around the head and stabbed by a man who had gone to buy class A drugs from his flat in King\u2019s Cross, London, which was then set on fire. The dynamics of gangs, criminality and desperation that played out in Jaden\u2019s murder were foretold in a 2018 report by Waltham Forest council. It said gangs were motivated by the drugs business, with recruitment starting at as young as 10, and fuelled by greed, poverty and other social factors, and control was enforced by violence. Majdouline will be sentenced on Wednesday. The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment. He was also convicted of possessing a knife and had denied both charges.",

      "body": "<p>In a speech last year, the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n gave his definition of what some late 20th-century Marxists used to call hegemony. \u201cAn era,\u201d said Mr Orb\u00e1n, \u201cis a spiritual order, a kind of prevailing mood, perhaps even taste \u2026 determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is the task we are now faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era.\u201d</p> <p>Soon afterwards, the Fidesz government, which Mr Orb\u00e1n leads, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/gender-studies-and-kahlo-under-fire-as-orban-eyes-new-cultural-era-1.3597474\" title=\"\">cancelled state funding</a> for gender studies in the country\u2019s universities. This was part of a drive to minimise the influence of liberal ideas in Hungarian life and promote an alternative worldview \u2013 one which the prime minister used to call \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d and now likes to refer to as \u201cChristian liberty\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2010, Mr Orb\u00e1n and his allies have aggressively extended their reach and influence into multiple areas of civil life. His hegemonic activities continue apace. This week new legislation was introduced to restrict the power of municipal authorities, after recent local elections saw opposition gains. The government also moved to restrict the freedom to form opposition alliances in parliament. Most strikingly, it was announced that the country\u2019s theatres are also to be subjected to the constraints and demands of the new \u201cera\u201d. A government bill has proposed that <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/hungarians-rally-against-government-s-bid-to-tighten-cultural-control-1.4109875\" title=\"\">the state should have a role in the appointment of directors</a> in theatres which it subsidises. The proposed law also notes that the \u201cbasic expectation\u201d of the arts is that they \u201cactively protect the interests of the nation\u2019s survival, wellbeing and growth\u201d. The news was enough to bring <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/budapest-protests-thousands-of-demonstrators-march-through-capital-for-fourth-day-of-antigovernment-a4018836.html\" title=\"\">thousands of protesters</a> on to the streets of Budapest on Monday evening. A former director of the Hungarian National Theatre said the theatre legislation could eventually mean \u201ceveryone who gets a chance to make culture and create work would have to be a loyal servant of the regime\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Orb\u00e1n rose to prominence in the anti-communist demonstrations of 1989, so it is ironic that the domineering politics practised by Fidesz is being experienced by its opponents as a throwback to the late communist era. In the 1980s, careers prospered only with the approval and patronage of the party, which held the purse strings and prized loyalty. Today, those lawyers, artists or lecturers who find themselves at odds with the prime minister\u2019s version of \u201cspiritual order\u201d increasingly risk finding themselves out in the cold.</p> <p>The proposed new law does not bode well for the Hungarian arts. In his 1984 novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, the Czech author Milan Kundera famously explored the idea of \u201ctotalitarian kitsch\u201d. This, he wrote, became aesthetically dominant when a single political movement gained a monopoly on power. Obsessed with the inculcation and celebration of collective virtue, kitsch art could not countenance the messy, challenging nature of real life and individual nonconformity. In a possible sign of things to come, the Hungarian State Opera House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/billy-elliot-musical-cuts-dates-hungary-claims-turn-children-gay\" title=\"\">cancelled 15 performances of Billy Elliot</a> last year, following a media campaign against its alleged promotion of homosexuality. Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s new theatre law is not only bad in principle. It will also produce bad art.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a speech last year, the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n gave his definition of what some late 20th-century Marxists used to call hegemony. \u201cAn era,\u201d said Mr Orb\u00e1n, \u201cis a spiritual order, a kind of prevailing mood, perhaps even taste \u2026 determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is the task we are now faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era.\u201d Soon afterwards, the Fidesz government, which Mr Orb\u00e1n leads, cancelled state funding for gender studies in the country\u2019s universities. This was part of a drive to minimise the influence of liberal ideas in Hungarian life and promote an alternative worldview \u2013 one which the prime minister used to call \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d and now likes to refer to as \u201cChristian liberty\u201d. Since 2010, Mr Orb\u00e1n and his allies have aggressively extended their reach and influence into multiple areas of civil life. His hegemonic activities continue apace. This week new legislation was introduced to restrict the power of municipal authorities, after recent local elections saw opposition gains. The government also moved to restrict the freedom to form opposition alliances in parliament. Most strikingly, it was announced that the country\u2019s theatres are also to be subjected to the constraints and demands of the new \u201cera\u201d. A government bill has proposed that the state should have a role in the appointment of directors in theatres which it subsidises. The proposed law also notes that the \u201cbasic expectation\u201d of the arts is that they \u201cactively protect the interests of the nation\u2019s survival, wellbeing and growth\u201d. The news was enough to bring thousands of protesters on to the streets of Budapest on Monday evening. A former director of the Hungarian National Theatre said the theatre legislation could eventually mean \u201ceveryone who gets a chance to make culture and create work would have to be a loyal servant of the regime\u201d. Mr Orb\u00e1n rose to prominence in the anti-communist demonstrations of 1989, so it is ironic that the domineering politics practised by Fidesz is being experienced by its opponents as a throwback to the late communist era. In the 1980s, careers prospered only with the approval and patronage of the party, which held the purse strings and prized loyalty. Today, those lawyers, artists or lecturers who find themselves at odds with the prime minister\u2019s version of \u201cspiritual order\u201d increasingly risk finding themselves out in the cold. The proposed new law does not bode well for the Hungarian arts. In his 1984 novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, the Czech author Milan Kundera famously explored the idea of \u201ctotalitarian kitsch\u201d. This, he wrote, became aesthetically dominant when a single political movement gained a monopoly on power. Obsessed with the inculcation and celebration of collective virtue, kitsch art could not countenance the messy, challenging nature of real life and individual nonconformity. In a possible sign of things to come, the Hungarian State Opera House cancelled 15 performances of Billy Elliot last year, following a media campaign against its alleged promotion of homosexuality. Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s new theatre law is not only bad in principle. It will also produce bad art.",

The subpoenas are expected for Los Angeles and San Francisco and the dioceses of Sacramento, Fresno, San Jose and Orange \u2013 six dioceses that have already been voluntarily providing documents since May, a church spokesman, Kevin Eckery, said on Tuesday. The subpoenas come as a new law taking effect on 1 January is expected to bring many more lawsuits when it temporarily lifts age limits on filing abuse claims that may be decades old. The office of the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, sent letters to all 12 California dioceses in May asking them to voluntarily retain documents related to abuse allegations that have forced the church to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to victims. But only six were asked to produce documents, and it is those six that have been told to expect subpoenas, Eckery said.

Bishop Jaime Soto of Sacramento said in a statement that the church \u201cis committed to a full accounting of the past sins of clergy sexual abuse, and to doing all we can to ensure it never happens again\u201d. Last year Becerra asked victims of clerical sex abuse to submit complaints to his office. The law to temporarily lift age limits was proposed in the wake of the scandal involving Larry Nassar, the former US Olympic gymnastics teams doctor convicted of sexually abusing young athletes, and is expected to affect institutions such as the Roman Catholic church and the Boy Scouts of America, along with school districts, hospitals, youth sports groups and other entities.

      "bodyText": "Napoli have appointed Gennaro Gattuso as their new head coach, after Carlo Ancelotti was sacked on Tuesday evening despite leading the club to the Champions League last 16. The 41-year-old led Milan to fifth place in Serie A last season, but departed in the summer with two years still to run on his contract. Gattuso spent 13 seasons with Milan as a player \u2013 several of them under Ancelotti. \u201c[Carlo] is like a father to me. He\u2019s always been close to me and supported me,\u201d Gattuso said at his unveiling. \u201cHe\u2019s won it all and I still have a lot to prove.\u201d Turning to the task at hand, Gattuso said Napoli\u2019s current position \u2013 seventh in the league, and eight points off fourth place, is \u201cembarrassing.\u201d This team has what it takes to finish in the top four. We need to work hard, win back points and come through this tricky period,\u201d Gattuso added. \u201cI\u2019m at a big club with a great president \u2026 I fear nothing. I\u2019m going to be working with experienced people. I hope to get results.\u201d The Napoli owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, also offered words of support for Ancelotti. \u201cI remain his friend, I was before and I still am now. I am sorry that things have gone like this. We have cultivated a dream but suddenly awakened. It was better that everyone went their own way.\u201d Napoli\u2019s 4-0 win over Genk secured second place in Group E and ended a nine-game winless run in all competitions, but it was not enough to save Ancelotti\u2019s job.

As editor of the Spectator he chose to publish articles in which the notorious racist Taki Theodoracopulos boasted of being \u201can antisemite\u201d, argued black people \u201chave lower IQs than whites\u201d and praised Enoch Powell as a \u201cgreat man\u201d. Johnson defended Theodoracopulos, calling him a \u201cdistinguished columnist\u201d. Even now Johnson continues to cosy up to Donald Trump, despite his rhetoric about Jewish disloyalty and support for neo-Nazis. Johnson\u2019s contempt for minorities, women, LGBT+ and working-class people is well known, so it\u2019s not surprising this extends to Jews. We share the pain that many feel about antisemitism on the left and we will continue to hold the Labour party to account. But we wholly reject Boris Johnson\u2019s cynical attempts to exploit our community\u2019s legitimate concerns to distract from his own disgraceful bigotry. A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for a far-right government that poses an existential threat to all minorities. As Jews, we understand that our fate is bound up with that of other minorities. We will only find safety through solidarity. We call on allies of the Jewish community to reject hate and vote the Tories out.

We know him well enough to know that there is no foundation to the accusation that Corbyn is antisemitic. In a party with 500,000 members there will be antisemites and they must be dealt with. But we can assure Jewish voters that they are safe voting Labour.

      "bodyText": "Duncan Ferguson will be in charge for Everton\u2019s visit to Manchester United on Sunday as the club continues its search for a permanent successor to Marco Silva. Ferguson lifted the gloom around Goodison Park and Everton out of the relegation zone with Saturday\u2019s stirring 3-1 victory over Chelsea. He had expected to be in temporary charge for one game only but, having taken training since Tuesday, the first-team coach will remain at the helm at Old Trafford. A club statement said: \u201cFerguson will again be assisted by coaches John Ebbrell and Francis Jeffers and goalkeeper coach Alan Kelly.\u201d Farhad Moshiri, Everton\u2019s majority shareholder, and the chairman, Bill Kenwright, have held talks with several candidates to replace Silva this week although one, V\u00edtor Pereira, is out of the running having received an improved contract offer from his employers, Shanghai SIPG. The Portuguese coach is in line for a \u00a325m-a-year deal in China. David Moyes has held discussions with the Everton hierarchy over a return to the club and could be installed on an interim basis initially. Carlo Ancelotti, who is also on Everton\u2019s shortlist, is available following his surprise sacking by Napoli.",

Shares in the Saudi state-backed oil company defied Aramco\u2019s critics by climbing nearly $200bn above the $1.7tn valuation set before its market debut on Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange. The world\u2019s biggest contributor to the climate crisis had been valued at more than Apple and Facebook \u2013 previously the world\u2019s most valuable and fifth-most valuable companies respectively \u2013 combined. It is also twice the size of Amazon and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and bigger than the next five listed oil companies put together. The record market listing is expected to keep rising on its second day of trade on the Tadawul stock exchange on Thursday after Aramco\u2019s share price surge was capped at 10% under rules designed to safeguard market stability. More than 5 million investors have put aside concerns over the company\u2019s close ties to a state associated with human rights abuses, and an uncertain future for the global oil industry, to buy 3bn shares. The Saudi state has raised $25.6bn through the float, which is regarded as the biggest single injection of capital into the fossil fuel industry, despite growing concerns over the climate crisis and the need to create a sustainable global financial system. The investor clamour for a stake in Aramco marks the end of a four-year campaign by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to sell a fraction of the company to help modernise the Saudi economy. Aramco executives, including the chief executive, Amin Nasser, and the head of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund were showered with gold ticker tape during a ceremony at the Tadawul, as they signed documents on stage after an extended opening auction.

Major investors in Europe, the Americas and Asia are understood to have balked at the $2tn valuation, whereas Saudi investors and wealthy families have fallen in line with calls from Prince Mohammed to support Aramco\u2019s entry into global financial markets. Aramco is reportedly considering plans to raise more money by seeking a broader base of international institutional investors through a possible float in Asia. Jasper Lawler, the head of research at London Capital Group, warned the surging market debut may prove to be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for Aramco due to growing concerns over the climate crisis. \u201cWhether enthusiasm holds up longer term will in part rest upon the host nation\u2019s ability to stay relevant for the world\u2019s future energy needs.

      "body": "<p>While preparing to deliver milk in Leeds early on Wednesday morning, Boris Johnson was accused of \u2013 and filmed, unluckily \u2013 ducking questions from a Good Morning Britain reporter by hiding in a large fridge. (Conservative sources later said he was \u201ccategorically not hiding\u201d.) As a plan, this has its limitations, but for sheer oddity, it deserves a place among the classic ad hoc press strategies of the 21st century. Here are the top five.</p> <h2><strong>Theresa May</strong></h2> <p>On the campaign trail, May was often accused of hiding from voters, preferring set-piece speeches before carefully curated audiences. In April 2017, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-election-latest-scotland-speech-visit-crathes-village-hall-aberdeenshire-corbyn-childs-a7709921.html\" title=\"\">she appeared</a> at Crathes village hall in Aberdeenshire in what might have looked \u2013 in photos, at least \u2013 like public interaction, but the crowd was made up of local Tory activists. To prevent anyone else getting wind of the engagement ahead of time, the hall was booked that day for a \u201cchild party\u201d from 10am to 5pm.</p> <h2><strong>David Cameron</strong></h2> <p>Before politics, Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/20/david-cameron-the-pr-years\" title=\"\">worked in PR</a>, and had a knack for avoiding tricky questions. He was once so desperate not to talk to the Guardian\u2019s then-media editor, Janine Gibson, that he pretended to be his office cleaner when answering the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it was him,\u201d she said later, \u201cbut it certainly sounded a lot like him.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nigel Farage</strong></h2> <p>In 2015, when Farage was still the leader of Ukip, he was trying to leave the party\u2019s London HQ to climb into an awaiting car. Unfortunately, the prankster Jolyon Rubinstein was outside with a camera crew making a BBC show called An Idiot\u2019s Guide to Politics. Later on, Farage would learn to be patient \u2013 reportedly hiding aboard his campaign bus to avoid getting milkshaked \u2013 but on this occasion he had places to be, and tried to sneak past Rubinstein <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamieross/watch-nigel-farage-try-to-sneak-out-of-an-office-disguised-a\" title=\"\">disguised as a builder</a>, complete with hi-vis coat and hard hat.

      "bodyText": "While preparing to deliver milk in Leeds early on Wednesday morning, Boris Johnson was accused of \u2013 and filmed, unluckily \u2013 ducking questions from a Good Morning Britain reporter by hiding in a large fridge. (Conservative sources later said he was \u201ccategorically not hiding\u201d.) As a plan, this has its limitations, but for sheer oddity, it deserves a place among the classic ad hoc press strategies of the 21st century. Here are the top five. Theresa May On the campaign trail, May was often accused of hiding from voters, preferring set-piece speeches before carefully curated audiences. In April 2017, she appeared at Crathes village hall in Aberdeenshire in what might have looked \u2013 in photos, at least \u2013 like public interaction, but the crowd was made up of local Tory activists. To prevent anyone else getting wind of the engagement ahead of time, the hall was booked that day for a \u201cchild party\u201d from 10am to 5pm. David Cameron Before politics, Cameron worked in PR, and had a knack for avoiding tricky questions. He was once so desperate not to talk to the Guardian\u2019s then-media editor, Janine Gibson, that he pretended to be his office cleaner when answering the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it was him,\u201d she said later, \u201cbut it certainly sounded a lot like him.\u201d Nigel Farage In 2015, when Farage was still the leader of Ukip, he was trying to leave the party\u2019s London HQ to climb into an awaiting car. Unfortunately, the prankster Jolyon Rubinstein was outside with a camera crew making a BBC show called An Idiot\u2019s Guide to Politics. Later on, Farage would learn to be patient \u2013 reportedly hiding aboard his campaign bus to avoid getting milkshaked \u2013 but on this occasion he had places to be, and tried to sneak past Rubinstein disguised as a builder, complete with hi-vis coat and hard hat. It didn\u2019t work. Ken Livingstone Livingstone tried to defend antisemitic remarks made by a Labour MP by going on TV in 2016 and making things much, much worse. After one appearance, he was pursued by journalists through Millbank studios, where he reportedly took refuge in a disabled toilet.

companies pay the least tax in Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest results, released on Thursday, show 32% of the companies in the data set paid no tax in the 2017-18 year \u2013 down from 36% three years previously.</p> <p>About $3.8bn extra revenue was squeezed from foreign multinationals, partly as a result of the government\u2019s crackdown on tech tax dodgers such as Google and Facebook \u2013 a strategy Saint said had locked in a flow of revenue into the future.</p> <p>Tax receipts from the companies in the data sat were up $6.6bn in total, mainly due to soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Jason Ward, principal analyst at the union-backed Centre for Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said the numbers showed the ATO \u201chas made significant progress within the scope of existing law\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, what it also makes very clear is that large multinationals are still gaming the system.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government should follow the lead of other governments and tax tech giants such as Amazon on their revenue, rather than their profit.</p> <p>And he attacked resources groups Exxon, Chevron and Shell, which are developing gas projects in Australia, for paying no corporate tax or petroleum royalty despite reaping $20bn in local revenue.</p> <p>Saint said the ATO was still focused on beefing up compliance at the top end of town and in the coming year would focus on problem areas including profit shifting by the local arms of multinationals that sell goods in Australia, related party finance deals that siphon cash away to offshore associates and intellectual property rorts.</p> <p>It is the fifth year that the ATO has released data on the tax paid by big companies under legislation introduced by the former Labor government.</p> <p>Under the law, the ATO publishes the revenue, taxable income and tax paid by public and foreign-owned companies with turnover of $100m or more and Australian private companies with turnover of $200m or more.</p> <p>Australian private companies were initially to be treated in the same way as other companies but the threshold was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/03/greens-accused-of-selling-out-over-deal-with-coalition-on-tax-transparency\">increased</a> by the Liberal government in late 2015.</p>

Australia\u2019s richest man, Anthony Pratt.</p> <p>The new data shows that in 2017-18 Pratt Consolidated Holdings again paid no tax, despite a turnover of $2.8bn and a taxable income of $59.1m.</p> <p>Google Australia paid $37m on a taxable income of $188m \u2013 well shy of the headline 30% corporate tax rate \u2013 while Facebook Australia paid $12.7m on income of $42.7m.</p> <p>This is almost exactly 30%, a rate that is not paid by many companies because of the deductions available to corporates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

contribution last year did so because they were working their way through losses carried forward after a bad year or series of bad years, which is allowed under the tax law.</p> <p>This includes Qantas, which for the first time in a decade has incurred a substantial tax bill of more than $250m, according to the company\u2019s <a

five years some companies with no tax bill had moved from generating ongoing losses to eating away their accumulated losses.</p> <p>\u201cThat tends to suggest to us that these companies are transitioning to a profitable state and should become tax payable in the future,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said there were legitimate reasons why companies made losses.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is also an element here that there are some taxpayers that also may have some legitimate business reason for not paying tax but that might be put together with some tax planning arrangements that they\u2019ve entered in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the small number of taxpayers that sit in this population, we know every one of those ... we\u2019re able to get in and undertake compliance action in

the ATO was still looking at the marketing hubs in Singapore used by big miners, with legal action on foot against Glencore, and would shortly issue guidance on dealings with intellectual property.</p> <p>The ATO is concerned about deals in which Australian companies sell intellectual property, such as patents, to an offshore affiliate for less than the IP cost to develop and then

About $3.8bn extra revenue was squeezed from foreign multinationals, partly as a result of the government\u2019s crackdown on tech tax dodgers such as Google and Facebook \u2013 a strategy Saint said had locked in a flow of revenue into the future. Tax receipts from the companies in the data sat were up $6.6bn in total, mainly due to soaring commodity prices. Jason Ward, principal analyst at the union-backed Centre for Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said the numbers showed the ATO \u201chas made significant progress within the scope of existing law\u201d. \u201cHowever, what it also makes very clear is that large multinationals are still gaming the system.\u201d He said the government should follow the lead of other governments and tax tech giants such as Amazon on their revenue, rather than their profit. And he attacked resources groups Exxon, Chevron and Shell, which are developing gas projects in Australia, for paying no corporate tax or petroleum royalty despite reaping $20bn in local revenue. Saint said the ATO was still focused on beefing up compliance at the top end of town and in the coming year would focus on problem areas including profit shifting by the local arms of multinationals that sell goods in Australia, related party finance deals that siphon cash away to offshore associates and intellectual property rorts. It is the fifth year that the ATO has released data on the tax paid by big companies under legislation introduced by the former Labor government. Under the law, the ATO publishes the revenue, taxable income and tax paid by public and foreign-owned companies with turnover of $100m or more and Australian private companies with turnover of $200m or more. Australian private companies were initially to be treated in the same way as other companies but the threshold was increased by the Liberal government in late 2015. Notable zero tax payers in the past have included Qantas and Pratt Consolidated Holdings, which is controlled by Australia\u2019s richest man, Anthony Pratt. The new data shows that in 2017-18 Pratt Consolidated Holdings again paid no tax, despite a turnover of $2.8bn and a taxable income of $59.1m. Google Australia paid $37m on a taxable income of $188m \u2013 well shy of the headline 30% corporate tax rate \u2013 while Facebook Australia paid $12.7m on income of $42.7m. This is almost exactly 30%, a rate that is not paid by many companies because of the deductions available to corporates. About 12% of companies that made no contribution last year did so because they were working their way through losses carried forward after a bad year or series of bad years, which is allowed under the tax law. This includes Qantas, which for the first time in a decade has incurred a substantial tax bill of more than $250m, according to the company\u2019s tax transparency report for 2019. Saint said that over the past five years some companies with no tax bill had moved from generating ongoing losses to eating away their accumulated losses. \u201cThat tends to suggest to us that these companies are transitioning to a profitable state and should become tax payable in the future,\u201d she said. She said there were legitimate reasons why companies made losses. \u201cBut there is also an element here that there are some taxpayers that also may have some legitimate business reason for not paying tax but that might be put together with some tax planning arrangements that they\u2019ve entered in,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the small number of taxpayers that sit in this population, we know every one of those ... we\u2019re able to get in and undertake compliance action in terms of that tax planning position. \u201cWe have seen that we\u2019ve been able to bring those entities to a tax payable position much earlier than had the ATO not intervened.\u201d She said that the ATO had the largest 100 companies in Australia under continuous review and expected to finish working its way through reviews of the top 1,000 next year. \u201cProfit shifting continues to be a key significant area of concern for us,\u201d she said. She said this included inbound supply chain rorts where local subsidiaries of multinational companies are charged over the odds for goods they sell in Australia, locking the profit away offshore. The ATO is also continuing its focus on related party finance deals under which offshore companies in a multinational loan their Australian associates money at usurious rates, making sure little or no profit is made locally. Enforcement action has focused on companies building billions of dollars worth of oil and gas projects \u2013 last year, Chevron paid the ATO $866m to settle an ATO lawsuit and in August the agency launched a $755m case against Shell. Saint said the ATO was still looking at the marketing hubs in Singapore used by big miners, with legal action on foot against Glencore, and would shortly issue guidance on dealings with intellectual property. The ATO is concerned about deals in which Australian companies sell intellectual property, such as patents, to an offshore affiliate for less than the IP cost to develop and then lease it back. \u201cWhat we find really concerning in these circumstances is where taxpayers are building up and investing in intangible generation in Australia and then transferring it to their related parties offshore for insufficient consideration,\u201d Saint said.",

Now those interested can see everything straight away.</p> <p>This has created problems for fashion brands. <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/fashion-shows-consumers-designer-reaction-10298422/\">Some labels fear</a> the lag between runway and retail means consumers are already sick of the clothes by the time they go on sale, while others have found the trends they showcase on the racks of fast fashion retailers such as Zara <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/09/172257/fashion-week-trends-spring-2018-fast-fashion\">well before</a> their own collections are available.</p> <p>For the last five years, after the trade shows have concluded, MBFWA has hosted a series of consumer-facing events, called MBFWA Weekend Edition, giving the public a taste of the week\u2019s collections. But, Xenita says, \u201cconsumers are wanting a more authentic experience. It\u2019s no longer enough that they get to preview the collections.\u201d She says opening fashion week up to ticket buyers is the next step in delivering that authenticity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"683517fd0d54fd7b80fd7482050216f871f3ac36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/683517fd0d54fd7b80fd7482050216f871f3ac36/0_0_3240_2463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Aje show at The Rocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Aje show at The Rocks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Xenita says the shows will still be primarily trade-facing events, distinct from see-now, buy-now runway shows like those offered by Melbourne fashion festival, and other Australian fashion events. \u201cThe trade event still needs to function well for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/australia-fashion\">the industry</a>. A big part of the strategy around it means that it meets the industry needs.\u201d</p> <p>Another key difference will be the ticket price. Approximately a quarter of the seats at MBFWA\u2019s evening presentations will be available for purchase, and prices will start at $120. That\u2019s more than double the cost of a seat at Melbourne fashion festival. \u201cIt\u2019s comparing apples to oranges,\u201d Xenita says of the difference. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of money can\u2019t buy ... to attend the trade event.\u201d</p> <p>MBFWA tickets will be a relative bargain compared with the costs of shows internationally. In London a ticket to one of two public-facing fashion week presentations next February will cost upwards of \u00a3135, while in New York fashion week tickets started at US$550 in September.</p> <p>\u201cIt is expensive for sure,\u201d says a fashion blogger, Debasree Das, who attended MBFWA\u2019s Weekend Edition two years ago on a mixture of paid-for and gifted tickets.

      "bodyText": "Your average trade event conjures images of daggy convention centres, plastic name tags and inappropriate after-hours liaisons. What happens at a conference might be the subject of water cooler gossip but it hardly captures the public imagination. With their celebrity-heavy front rows, throngs of street-style photographers and, of course, the collections themselves, fashion weeks are an exception to this rule \u2013 though the name tags and after-party shenanigans still apply. This year in New York and London the fashion week organisers IMG and the British Fashion Council (respectively) took that interest to the bank, allowing the public to purchase tickets to a handful of runway shows. Previously, the events had been invitation-only affairs. In May of 2020, Mercedes-Benz fashion week Australia (MBFWA \u2013 colloquially known as Australian fashion week, or Sydney fashion week) will take the unprecedented step of allowing all the designers on its schedule to sell tickets to the public. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this trend towards the runway show as entertainment develop out over years. Not only in Australia but globally,\u201d says Natalie Xenita, the Asia-Pacific region executive director of IMG\u2019s fashion events group, which runs MBFWA. MBFWA, like the twice-yearly \u201cbig four\u201d fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan and Paris, debuts collections six months before the clothes will hit retailers\u2019 racks. In Australia these collections fit with the international cruise season, and tend to start retailing in November. Typically, consumer-facing fashion shows feature garments that are already, or will soon be, available for purchase. At London fashion week this year\u2019s public-facing runway shows were see-now, buy-now. While fashion brands\u2019 best customers have always had a seat at their runway shows, the walls between fashion week presentations and the eyes of the general public have grown increasingly translucent as brands embrace live streaming, and celebrity guests and press broadcast their catwalk experience via social media. Years ago consumers\u2019 experience of a collection was mediated by fashion stylists, merchandisers and buyers who determined which elements of a show would work in photoshoots and the retail environment. Now those interested can see everything straight away. This has created problems for fashion brands. Some labels fear the lag between runway and retail means consumers are already sick of the clothes by the time they go on sale, while others have found the trends they showcase on the racks of fast fashion retailers such as Zara well before their own collections are available. For the last five years, after the trade shows have concluded, MBFWA has hosted a series of consumer-facing events, called MBFWA Weekend Edition, giving the public a taste of the week\u2019s collections. But, Xenita says, \u201cconsumers are wanting a more authentic experience. It\u2019s no longer enough that they get to preview the collections.\u201d She says opening fashion week up to ticket buyers is the next step in delivering that authenticity. Xenita says the shows will still be primarily trade-facing events, distinct from see-now, buy-now runway shows like those offered by Melbourne fashion festival, and other Australian fashion events. \u201cThe trade event still needs to function well for the industry. A big part of the strategy around it means that it meets the industry needs.\u201d Another key difference will be the ticket price. Approximately a quarter of the seats at MBFWA\u2019s evening presentations will be available for purchase, and prices will start at $120. That\u2019s more than double the cost of a seat at Melbourne fashion festival. \u201cIt\u2019s comparing apples to oranges,\u201d Xenita says of the difference. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of money can\u2019t buy ... to attend the trade event.\u201d MBFWA tickets will be a relative bargain compared with the costs of shows internationally. In London a ticket to one of two public-facing fashion week presentations next February will cost upwards of \u00a3135, while in New York fashion week tickets started at US$550 in September. \u201cIt is expensive for sure,\u201d says a fashion blogger, Debasree Das, who attended MBFWA\u2019s Weekend Edition two years ago on a mixture of paid-for and gifted tickets. But, she says: \u201cI would attend it once, to see what difference it makes!\u201d Das doesn\u2019t believe that fashion shows will ever be a form of popular entertainment on par with going to the movies but says that for a certain audience, they can be very alluring. \u201cPerhaps if they want something to do, if they want to take photos for their Instagram?

      "bodyText": "After a six-week campaign, the UK goes to the polls on Thursday (Thursday night in Australia) in a vote to determine whether the Conservative party\u2019s Boris Johnson or Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn will form government. Johnson has been telling voters \u201clet\u2019s get Brexit done\u201d, while Corbyn has been emphasising this is the \u201clast chance to save the National Health Service\u201d. Here\u2019s a quick guide to how the voting works, when we\u2019re likely to get a result and what that result could mean for Brexit. How does the UK voting system work? Everyone aged over 18 is entitled to vote, which means the electorate comprises around 46 million people, but voting is not compulsory. Turnout at the last election in 2017 was 68.8%. There are 650 constituencies throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and voting will take place in 40,000 polling stations. It\u2019s a simple first-past-the-post system, which means that those 46 million voters will make one cross or tick on a ballot paper listing the candidates standing in their constituency. The candidate with the most votes wins a seat at Westminster. The timing of the election could affect turnout. It\u2019s the first election held in December since 1923 and parties have typically avoided polls in winter (there was one in February 1974) because it\u2019s considered harder to get the vote out in poorer weather \u2013 especially for Labour. The forecast for Thursday is rain for much of the country. What happens after that? When the polling stations close at 10pm GMT (9am Friday AEDT), the television stations will release an exit poll. These have become quite accurate predictors of the final outcome and in 2017 delivered a shock by showing that Theresa May was going to lose her majority. The first real results could be in as early as 11pm GMT (10am AEDT) with the final ones in within 24 hours. A party needs 326 seats for a majority in the Commons without relying on support from smaller parties. If Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn get to this magic number they can go to the Queen and tell her they are forming a government. Just like in The Crown. So who will it be? The polls indicate that it is Johnson who has the best chance of forming government and staying in 10 Downing Street. Our poll tracker shows Johnson\u2019s lead early in the campaign has fallen a bit. The Tories are on 43%, Labour on 33%, the Lib Dems on 13%, and the Greens and Brexit parties on 3% each. A YouGov poll on Tuesday reckoned Johnson would get a majority of 28, down from 68 a fortnight ago. Marginal constituencies hold huge importance in the winner-takes-all system and this one will be no different. Anti-Tory parties have been combining to argue for tactical voting in order to keep Conservative candidates out. This makes the outcomes harder to predict for pollsters and could distort the forecasts. What has the election been fought over? The election was called to resolve the Brexit imbroglio that has gripped the nation since the 2016 referendum. While Brexit has understandably been hotly debated throughout the campaign, fatigue over the issue has given space to other questions, such as the future of the NHS, big spending pledges by both major parties, and policing. However, even the NHS has been seen through the Brexit lens with Labour \u2013 which traditionally owns the issue \u2013 campaigning relentlessly on claims that the Tories would include NHS contracts in a post-Brexit deal with the US. This has forced Johnson to spend a lot of time visiting hospitals. North of the border, where the Scottish Nationalist party will be the biggest party ahead of the Tories, the chances of a second independence referendum to split from the UK has been a major issue. Ok, but what does it all mean for Brexit? If Johnson wins a majority he has promised to deliver Brexit by the end of next year, although obstacles still have to be overcome on the Irish border question. If he fails to get a majority but forms another minority government with, say, the Brexit party or the Democratic Unionists, he risks a repeat of the humiliations of earlier in the year. But this seems less likely because many Tories who voted against him are not standing for re-election this time so his parliamentary support should be firmer. If Corbyn wins a majority, which seems very unlikely, he has promised to hold a second referendum. If he forms a coalition government, say with the fiercely anti-Brexit Lib Dems or the SNP, it becomes more difficult to predict. How can I find out what\u2019s happening?

      "body": "<p>In choosing continuity by appointing Ian Foster as All Black coach, the New Zealand Rugby hierarchy appear to have been motivated by the need for what they perceive to be a safe pair of hands. It could prove that, in selecting Steve Hansen\u2019s right-hand man to take over, the powerbrokers have instead taken a greater risk than would have been the case in opting for the extrovert, but hugely successful, Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson.</p> <p>Regardless of the sport, a new coach almost always enjoys a honeymoon period. This is, at least in part, due to the optimism generated by an expectation of fresh ideas, a different voice, a different approach. It is difficult to argue that Foster ticks the box on any of those fronts. The 54-year-old brings in some fresh faces to support him, but as the front man he will be the one who is either showered with praise or the object of negativity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/11/ian-foster-named-steve-hansens-successor-as-all-blacks-head-coach\">Ian Foster named Steve Hansen's successor as All Blacks head coach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there are any early stumbles, the public is unlikely to be as sympathetic as it might have been to a Robertson-led team. This was reinforced by a poll on a leading nationwide news website, prior to the announcement, which had 78% of respondents favouring a Robertson appointment, while just nine selected Foster. </p> <p>Such polls are hardly an exact science, and do play to the discontented, but the overwhelmingly negative nature of the response, both before and since his appointment, does highlight the credibility mountain Foster has to climb.</p> <p>Through no real fault of his own, Foster lacks appeal among the supporter base. Although the assistant coach received little credit for the success enjoyed by the All Blacks during his eight years on the coaching staff, critics were quick to lay a big part of the blame in Foster\u2019s lap for the team\u2019s failure to break down England at the World Cup.</p> <p>This was unfair. While the best coaches allow their assistants plenty of input, the head coach makes the final call on the strategy, and the selection of the players to carry it out. Hansen has repeatedly shown in the past that, once on a set course, that\u2019s the way his ship is going. The failure in Japan was not met with the recriminations of failed World Cups past, but the recruitment process did underwhelm, with most of New Zealand\u2019s best coaches giving it a wide berth.</p> <p>Even so, Robertson offered the freshness Foster lacked.

      "bodyText": "In choosing continuity by appointing Ian Foster as All Black coach, the New Zealand Rugby hierarchy appear to have been motivated by the need for what they perceive to be a safe pair of hands. It could prove that, in selecting Steve Hansen\u2019s right-hand man to take over, the powerbrokers have instead taken a greater risk than would have been the case in opting for the extrovert, but hugely successful, Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson. Regardless of the sport, a new coach almost always enjoys a honeymoon period. This is, at least in part, due to the optimism generated by an expectation of fresh ideas, a different voice, a different approach. It is difficult to argue that Foster ticks the box on any of those fronts. The 54-year-old brings in some fresh faces to support him, but as the front man he will be the one who is either showered with praise or the object of negativity. If there are any early stumbles, the public is unlikely to be as sympathetic as it might have been to a Robertson-led team. This was reinforced by a poll on a leading nationwide news website, prior to the announcement, which had 78% of respondents favouring a Robertson appointment, while just nine selected Foster. Such polls are hardly an exact science, and do play to the discontented, but the overwhelmingly negative nature of the response, both before and since his appointment, does highlight the credibility mountain Foster has to climb. Through no real fault of his own, Foster lacks appeal among the supporter base. Although the assistant coach received little credit for the success enjoyed by the All Blacks during his eight years on the coaching staff, critics were quick to lay a big part of the blame in Foster\u2019s lap for the team\u2019s failure to break down England at the World Cup. This was unfair. While the best coaches allow their assistants plenty of input, the head coach makes the final call on the strategy, and the selection of the players to carry it out. Hansen has repeatedly shown in the past that, once on a set course, that\u2019s the way his ship is going. The failure in Japan was not met with the recriminations of failed World Cups past, but the recruitment process did underwhelm, with most of New Zealand\u2019s best coaches giving it a wide berth. Even so, Robertson offered the freshness Foster lacked. Importantly, he also offered form on the board. Before the Graham Henry-Steve Hansen period of domination began in 2004, a three-time Super Rugby-winning head coach would have been considered a certainty to coach the All Blacks, especially given there are three national provincial championship titles and a world Under-20 crown in Robertson\u2019s CV as well. To put that in perspective, Henry won Super Rugby twice as a head coach, while Hansen\u2019s experience was largely as an assistant, aside from an undistinguished period as head coach of Wales. Although well and truly shaded by Robertson, who is a former All Black, Foster can at least point to a more distinguished provincial career as both a player and a coach than his predecessor, who nonetheless won a World Cup while in the job. A Ranfurly Shield-winning captain in 1997, Foster played a record 148 games for Waikato, 14 more than the province\u2019s last All Black coach, John Mitchell. Although never an All Black himself, he played much of his career as a teammate of Mitchell\u2019s, as well as new Chiefs coach Warren Gatland, each being part of Waikato\u2019s maiden national provincial championship-winning side of 1992. Foster later had Scott McLeod and future professional referee Glen Jackson in the dressing room during his final playing seasons. Like Foster, defence coach McLeod will carry over from Hansen\u2019s staff.

The Australia Chinese United Business Association Federation (Acubaf), representing more than 50 associations and 1,000 individual businesses, is hosting a charity dinner on Friday to raise money for the Salvation Army and its bushfire appeal. Invitations to the dinner, seen by Guardian Australia, advertise Acubaf\u2019s role as to \u201cprovide a bridge between Australian Chinese business and to offer the chance to cooperate for all Chinese associations, meanwhile offering access to the \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 policy in China\u201d. The Belt and Road initiative is the Chinese Communist party\u2019s $1tn global infrastructure project, building trade and supply routes \u2013 and subsequent influence \u2013 across the world. After inquiries from the Guardian, one of the dinner\u2019s organisers, Lina Zhao, provided an alternative invitation, identical except that the reference to Belt and Road was absent. She suggested that the original invitation might be \u201cfraudulent\u201d. There is no evidence of manipulation on the original invitation, and it was sent to Guardian Australia by several independent sources. Zhao said the organising committee \u201cnever approved or distributed\u201d the original version of the invitation, and Acubaf was not a vehicle for Belt and Road. \u201cAcubaf is an independent and Australia-based business association, registered in NSW, which is not affiliated with any Chinese government organisation.\u201d Zhao said the dinner was a charitable event \u201cto help people affected by these catastrophic bushfire conditions\u201d.

The Australian government has declined to become involved in Belt and Road, though the Victorian state government has signed on, as have several Pacific Island states. The Acubaf \u2013 previously also known as the Australian Chinese Chamber of Commerce Association \u2013 has hosted the prime minister, Scott Morrison, the immigration minister, David Coleman, and a suite of federal and state government ministers, Chinese embassy and government officials. Acubaf is the peak body for Chinese business associations in Australia and was established at a meeting held at the Sydney premises of the Australian Council for the Peaceful Reunification of China in 2016, when the exiled Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo was its president. Liu served as vice-president of the ACPPRC and Jiang was on its executive committee during the time Huang was president. Liu\u2019s name has been removed from the ACPPRC website. Huang served for three years as president of the ACPPRC, which is regarded as the most significant of dozens of organisations in Australia controlled by the United Front Work Department, a Chinese government agency overseen directly by the Chinese Communist party\u2019s central committee. The United Front Work Department leads operations outside China aimed at influencing overseas Chinese and western elites, in particular business leaders and politicians, to back Beijing\u2019s policies and aims.

But the problems started decades ago | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no doubt that Labour has real and entrenched problems in a good number of these areas. The typical narrative lays the blame for this at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s door, and that of his supporters: these detached young metropolitans, it is said, are too busy riding their own hobby horses to forge any possible connection with the residents of former industrial areas across the north, Midlands and Wales. In fact, the concerns that animate millennial Corbynites are the same bread-and-butter issues that resonate in leave-voting towns: the lack of genuinely affordable housing, our increasingly inadequate public services, stagnant wages and declining living standards, the struggle for dignity and security at work, and so on.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the narrative endures. As the party\u2019s earlier collapse in Scotland ought to have indicated, the weakening of its so-called red wall began decades ago, and long predates both Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s ascendency. The labour movement\u2019s grassroots has been dwindling in many former industrial communities for nigh on 40 years: for instance, trade union membership, <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/trade-union-membership-rises-100000-single-year-challenges-remain\" title=\"\">though it rose slightly in 2017-18</a>, has roughly halved from its peak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/strikes-in-uk-fall-to-lowest-level-since-records-began-in-1893\" title=\"\">13 million at the turn of the 1980s</a>. Labour party membership was always much smaller than that of the unions, but even this halved from around 400,000 in the early New Labour years to nearer 200,000 before the Corbyn surge of 2015. The movement as a whole is simply no longer present in the life of these communities in the ways it once was.</p> <p>Suggestions that Labour has become <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonCowleyNS/status/1203603726424051714\" title=\"\">too \u201csocially liberal\u201d to stem this decline</a> tend to shy away from spelling out exactly what this means. With these arguments there are two assumptions that appear to be implicit: first, that working-class people in post-industrial areas can now only be reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/06/difficult-truth-labour-social-conservatives\" title=\"\">via social conservatism</a>, and second, that the working-class credentials of BAME and younger people \u2013 who are often Britain\u2019s most precarious and poorly paid workers \u2013 are insufficiently authentic.</p> <p>There has long been a dubious tendency to equate being working class with having a recognisably \u201cregional\u201d accent, and so mangled is the British discourse on class that it is often treated as a cultural signifier rather than a relationship to work, or a location in the economic and social hierarchy. The truth is that neglected ex-industrial communities are far from homogeneous, and there is no hope in any form of Labour politics that fails to recognise the immense diversity of the real-life working class \u2013 wherever it is located.</p> <p>For all the accusations that Labour is out of touch with left-behind Britain, it is in fact the only party to offer a serious programme for redressing <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2019/12/the-choice-facing-the-north\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s enormous regional inequalities</a>.

      "bodyText": "And finally, the London stock market has ended a fairly uneventful day with many stocks little changed. The FTSE 100 closed 2 point higher, or 0.03%, at 7216 - a really small move. Miners, utility companies, telecoms firms and healthcare stocks rose, but tech, energy and financial stocks fell. JD Sports dragged teh index down, shedding almost 10% after its majority shareholder, Pentland, cut its stake. Other European markets ended the day a little higher. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The US-China trade situation is still at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds. The Sunday deadline in relation to the US tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese imports is looming, and the lack of clarity has brought about low volatility in stocks. When it comes to the trade saga, it\u2019s the same old story \u2013 there is talk the planned tariffs will be deferred. It is possible the US might not slap on new levies, but in return they will be looking for Beijing to pledge to ramp up agricultural purchases. Maybe we\u2019ll learn more tomorrow, as Britain heads to the polls. Until then, goodnight! GW Newsflash: The oil price is falling sharply, following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. US oil inventories rose by 822,000 barrels, defying expectations of a 2.8m drop. That suggests weaker demand for energy - not what Aramco wants to hear today! In response, Brent crude has dropped by $1 per barrel, from $64.26 to $63.22. Astonishingly, Saudi Aramco is now worth more than the combined value of every company on Germany\u2019s DAX index. We mentioned earlier that only 1.5% of Aramco\u2019s shares were floated. That boosts the company\u2019s value in two ways. First it creates scarcity, so investors who HAVE to own the company (such as a tracker fund) pay more. Second, small flows into (or out of) the stock will have disproportionate impact on the overall market capitalisation, compared to a typical IPO where more shares are in public hands. Bloomberg have written a nice piece about how Wall Street put a spanner into the wheels of the Aramco IPO, by refusing to accept that it could be worth $2trn. Given the international wariness over Aramco, Saudi officials are clearly pleased to have pulled off the float. Energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman says it is \u2018vindication\u2019 for the authorities: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for Saudi Arabia and the leadership of Saudi Arabia and for the people of Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s a D-Day for Aramco, it\u2019s a day of reckoning and vindication.\u201d The Saudi stock market has now closed, with Aramco finishing its first day exactly 10% higher (the maximum daily move at 35.2 riyals. That lifts its valuation from $1.7trn to $1.87trn. If Aramco surges by another 10% on the next trading session, on Thursday, it would become the first company to be valued at $2trn. NEWSFLASH: US inflation has hit its highest level in a year. Consumer prices rose by 2.1% per year in November, up from 1.8% in October, partly due to rises in energy, rent and gasoline bills. Prices rose 0.3% month-on-month, suggesting inflationary pressures may be building... following three US interest rate cuts in recent months. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, remained at 2.3%. Pre-election jitters also appear to be hitting UK stocks. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized listed companies is down 1% today, with every sector in the red. It\u2019s a better barometer of UK economic prospects than the FTSE 100 (which is broadly unchanged today). The possibility of another hung parliament is keeping a lid on the pound today. Sterling is unchanged today at $1.315 against the US dollar, having fallen sharply from around $1.32 when last night\u2019s YouGov poll showed the Conservative\u2019s likely majority had shrunk. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The sharp selloff in the pound gives us a taste of what could be to come. Should the Conservatives win an overall majority, sterling gains are expected to be less pronounced than in the case of a hung Parliament or a Corbyn victory. These are outcomes which are considered less market friendly either due to the Brexit impasse continuing or in the case of a Labour government, economic policy concerns. There would be a less pronounced gain on a Tory majority because the market is anticipating this outcome; a market friendly outcome. Aramco has broken the US and China\u2019s grip on the chart of biggest companies, going straight in at number one. Most of the rest of the top 10 are tech stocks, along with Wall Street giant JP Morgan and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group. Aramco is now TWICE as valuable as Amazon, the e-commerce giant (currently worth $862bn). And this morning, Amazon\u2019s efforts to take a stake in food delivery group Deliveroo have taken a knock - regulators think the plan would hurt customers. Aramco\u2019s sparkling market debut is \u201ca piece of rare good news for Bin Salman\u2019s embattled project to transform his country\u2019s society and economy\u201d. That\u2019s according to the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, which writes: One of the major obstacles for Aramco was the very high valuation at $2 trillion, which officials were forced to bring down to $1.7 trillion. Early evidence of trading suggests that this $2 trillion mark will be reached, helping to provide some of the funds the Saudi royal family needs to wean the country off its oil dependence Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group suspects Aramco may struggle to justify its huge valuation, as the world moves beyond fossil fuels: A listing in Riyadh with mostly domestic investors doesn\u2019t have the prestige of an international listing in New York or London. But there is no denying the numbers. Saudi Arabia has made its mark in public markets. The listing was over four times subscribed so the first day always looked like it was going to be strong. Whether enthusiasm holds up longer term will in part rest upon the host nation\u2019s ability to stay relevant for the world\u2019s future energy needs. The oil industry needs to adapt to higher supply from the United States and calls for lower fossil fuel use because of climate change. Given the challengers, it is not impossible that this is the high watermark for Aramco. Back in the UK, holiday and insurance group Saga has turned to the former boss of fashion chain SuperDry. Saga, which targets over-50s consumers, hopes that Euan Sutherland (42) can revitalise its fortunes after seeing shares tumble this year. He certainly has a record for shaking things up, as Jasper Jolly writes: Saga will be the latest struggling company on Sutherland\u2019s CV. In 2013 he was appointed as the boss of the Co-operative Group but quit after 10 months. He had reportedly earned the moniker \u201cPol Pot\u201d, after the Cambodian dictator, from colleagues who thought he was pushing for change too quickly. Sutherland has previously also served as head of the DIY retailer B&amp;Q and is on the board of the Robinson\u2019s drinks maker, Britvic. Aramco\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t shifted since it surged 10%, the maximum allowed, at the start of trading. That suggests there\u2019s still strong buying interest among investors in Riyadh, so the stock could rally again tomorrow. Here\u2019s my colleague Jasper Jolly on the Aramco float: Saudi Aramco has become the world\u2019s largest listed company, as shares in the state-backed oil producer rose by 10% on its stock market debut in Riyadh. The company\u2019s market valuation reached $1.88tn in early trading, amid a push from the Saudi Arabian government to reach the $2tn market value coveted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS. However, the valuation means Aramco \u2013 which also has the distinction of being the biggest corporate contributor to carbon dioxide pollution in history \u2013 is already worth more than the next five largest oil companies, ExxonMobil, Total, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP, combined. Shares in Aramco, officially called the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, rose by 10% in initial trading to a price of 35.2 riyal each, up from the 32 riyal float price, according to Refinitiv. The shares, which trade under the 2222 ticker, are subject to a 10% daily price fluctuation limit. Saudi Aramco executives, including the chief executive, Amin Nasser, and the head of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, were showered with gold ticker tape in a ceremony at the Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, as they signed documents on stage after an extended opening auction. The oil company raised a record $25.6bn from an initial public offering managed by Goldman Sachs but investors were only able to buy a paltry 1.5% of the company..... More here: Saudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister has claimed that the Aramco float will help the Kingdom break its dependency on oil, and develop its economy. Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters that the most of the $25.6bn raised through the IPO will go to Saudi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund (PIF), which is trying to diversify its economy. \u201cThe proceeds will be used largely, maybe not totally, in the local economy, in projects where the PIF will be the first mover which then basically pulls more private sector participation ... so the money will remain in the system mostly.\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy did slow sharply this year, so it\u2019s a good time to be investing in growth-friendly measures. But, as most of the shares were sold to local investors, the IPO hasn\u2019t actually pulled in much foreign capital to stimulate its economy. Here\u2019s a reminder that Saudi Arabia has only sold a tiny slice of Aramco, just 1.5% of its stock. Professor John Colley, Associate Dean at Warwick Business School, reckons Aramco\u2019s value will keep rising.... perhaps thanks to allies of the Saudi royal family: \u201cOne senses that the Crown Prince will get his own way in the end with a $2 trillion valuation for Saudi Aramco. \u201cIt has been his determination since the very idea of an IPO was mooted. Despite much contrary advice from his advisors that the business was only worth between $1.2 and $1.5 trillion, he has pressed ahead. \u201cThey have had to launch the IPO on their own stock exchange as the valuation was unlikely to be achieved elsewhere. Tax and dividend arrangements have also been changed to make it more attractive. \u201cHowever, a surging price on launch suggests that buying may be from those affiliated to the crown prince. After all, if this IPO goes well there will be further Aramco issues which will no doubt produce major fees for advisors.\u201d Aramco\u2019s role as the top CO2 producer could (indeed should) deter some investors from taking a stake, if they take the climate emergency seriously. Andy Critchlow of S&amp;P Global Platts says fund managers will have environmental, social and corporate governance concerns: The boss of Aramco, Amin Nasser, is understandably happy about today\u2019s float. CNBC\u2019s Emma Graham reports: As well as being the world\u2019s most valuable company, Aramco is also one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis. Aramco heads the list of the 20 fossil fuel companies who have created more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. Indeed, the Saudi oil giant has produced 4.38% of the global CO2 emissions since 1965, as the Guardian showed two months ago. One of the best things about floating a company (apart from getting all that money) is being allowed to ring the opening bell. And Aramco certainly got the full works this morning, at a ceremony to mark its debut on the Tadawul: Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take: Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil company Aramco is listed and started trading on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange on Wednesday for the first time after a mammoth $25.6 billion initial public offering that set the record as the biggest ever in history. The state-owned company had announced a sale of 1.5% of its shares at 32 Saudi riyals a share, or what is $8.53. At pre-trading auction earlier in the morning, Saudi Aramco\u2019s shares reached 35.2 riyals, or $9.39 a share, according to Saudi state TV. That\u2019s an increase of 10%, hitting the regulatory cap on daily increases or decreases for the stock. That pushes the company\u2019s value up to $1.88 trillion. Bloomberg\u2019s Javier Blas points out that Aramco\u2019s float is being driven by local demand, with overseas investors keeping away.... Saudi Aramco is now worth $1.87 trillion, based on this morning\u2019s spike. The chairwoman of the Saudi stock market has confirmed that Aramco has become the world\u2019s largest listed company. Reuters has more details: Sarah al-Suhaimi was speaking at a ceremony marking the initial public offering (IPO) of the stock on the exchange in Riyadh. She added that the exchange will also become one of the world\u2019s largest due to the listing. Boom! Aramco\u2019s shares have opened 10% higher as investors in Saudi Arabia rush to buy shares in the oil giant. This has driven the stock up to 35.2 riyals, the maximum move allowed, up from the 32 riyal IPO price. That\u2019s a solid start, confirming Aramco as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company behind Apple. The word on the Tadawul trading floor is that Aramco\u2019s stock could indeed spike by 10% once the pre-market auction gets underway..... Given the importance of Aramco to the Saudi authorities, it\u2019s quite likely that today\u2019s IPO will go well. As Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd, told Bloomberg: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that we will see Aramco bid up to $2 trillion [valuation] or higher in the first days of trading, and potentially to trade limit up on the first day. It\u2019s worth noting that shares on the Saudi stock market are only allowed to rise or fall by 10% per day. There\u2019s a limit to how well, or badly, Aramco can do. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a massive day on the Saudi stock market as oil giant Aramco finally makes its debut -- becoming the biggest listed company in the world. Saudi Aramco is floating today, after raising $25.6bn through its sometime troubled IPO. That valued the company at $1.7trillion - even more than Apple ($1.2 trillion). The opening auction on the Tadawul is underway as I type, so we\u2019ll soon know if the float is a success. If Aramco\u2019s shares rally today, then the $2trillion valuation craved by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could be in sight again. But it\u2019s an usual float - just 1.5% of Aramco\u2019s stock is actually floating. The rest is owned by the Saudi state. That scarcity could help push the stock higher, after international investors proved reluctant to back the IPO. Human rights concerns, the climate crisis, and corporate government concerns all forced the Saudis to rein in their ambitious plans for the float, and restrict it to Middle East investors. As my colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: It was originally expected to sell about 5% through a dual-listing on the Saudi market and on a major international stock exchange. The IPO lost the support of international investors, which are sceptical of the company\u2019s valuation. Investors are also wary of Aramco\u2019s close ties to the Saudi regime, which is embroiled in geopolitical conflict and whose behaviour has raised human rights concerns. Among local investors demand for Aramco shares was almost three times oversubscribed after the Saudi government encouraged Middle Eastern investors and wealthy Saudi families to support the IPO. Aramco\u2019s shares were sold at 32 riyals each. The stock should start trading soon, so we\u2019ll see if it spikes or slides..... Also coming up today The City is becoming more anxious about tomorrow\u2019s general election. A closely-watched poll from YouGov showed Boris Johnson\u2019s likely majority has narrowed - from 68 seats to just 28. A hung parliament is still a real possibility, which knocked sterling a little last night. The pound is trading around $1.3135 this morning, having hit $1.32 last night (before YouGov hit the wires). Plus, America\u2019s central bank is holding its last (scheduled) meeting of 2019, but we\u2019re not expecting fireworks. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US inflation: Expected to rise to 2.0% per year, from 1.8% 3.30pm GMT: US weekly oil inventories 7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve decision: expected to leave interest rates unchanged",

      "bodyText": "The British Olympic Association has called for the \u201cfullest possible sanctions\u201d to be taken against Russia following the four-year World Anti\u2011Doping Agency ban imposed this week for alleged manipulation of doping data. While Wada also agreed that individual Russian athletes would still be able to compete internationally if they could prove they were not tainted, the BOA has demanded \u201cundeniable proof\u201d that those Russian athletes who travel to Tokyo are clean. The BOA Athletes\u2019 commission chair, Ben Hawes, said: \u201cDespite previous sanctions, including athletes competing under a neutral flag in the Pyeongchang [Winter Olympics], Russia has continued to deny clean athletes around the world the ability to compete fairly and with any confidence in the systems designed to protect them. \u201cWe echo the calls for stronger, robust and enforceable sanctions. If our athletes are to compete against athletes from Russia under a neutral flag at Tokyo 2020, they need to do so with undeniable proof they are clean and not implicated with anything that brings the Olympic movement into question or disrepute.\u201d Sir Hugh Robertson, the BOA chair, echoed those comments, stating: \u201cFor three consecutive Olympic Games the matter of systemic doping of athletes by Russia has hung like a dark cloud over the entire Olympic movement. Our support is for the fullest possible sanctions to be taken against Russia at Tokyo 2020. \u201cAt the Pyeongchang Games, Team GB athletes competed against a Russian team in all but name \u2013 this should not happen again. Our concern is that even after the sanctions in Pyeongchang, Russia continued to manipulate data and with it the outcome of sport. They have shown no contrition or respect for the Olympic movement and its athletes.\u201d The speaker of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament has suggested his country could host an alternative to the Olympics. Valentina Matvienko was harking back to the era of sport in the country after the Russian Revolution when the Soviet Union refused to compete in the Olympics and hosted its own Spartakiads \u2013 named after the gladiator Spartacus. The country first competed at the Olympics in 1952. \u201cThis ruling show the clear crisis in international sports institutions. I believe Russia could host its own games at home,\u201d Matvienko told the Interfax news agency. If doping sanctions forcing Russians to compete as neutral athletes are not overturned it seems likely their boxers will not travel to Tokyo. Umar Kremlev, the general secretary of the Russian Boxing Federation, said he has spoken with the Olympic boxing team and they \u201cunanimously\u201d rejected the conditions laid out by the Wada as punishment for manipulating doping data. \u201cThey said we won\u2019t go without our flag and anthem,\u201d Kremlev said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going for medals, but for that feeling that I brought the highest honor home for my country.\u201d Kremlev added that Russian boxers would prefer to turn pro rather than compete at the Olympics. The official decision on whether to dispute the sanctions will be made on 19 December by the Russian anti-doping agency\u2019s supervisory board\u2019 Senior Russian figures, including Vladimir Putin, have signalled their preference for taking the matter to the court of arbitration for sport.",

In a landmark case that lawyers claim demonstrates \u201cindustry-wide failures\u201d to prevent sex trafficking, it has been alleged that women and children were held captive, abused and sold for sex in their guest rooms across the US. A total of 13 women have accused a dozen hotel groups of wilfully ignoring warning signs that sexual exploitation was taking place on their premises. The litigation, which was filed this week in a federal court in Columbus, Ohio, marks the first time the hotel industry has faced legal action as a group. It draws together 13 separate lawsuits filed in Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Texas.

They all swear terribly, you see, even mums and grans. In the film, a common form of words that I always took to mean \u201cfuck your prick\u201d, was translated, I think, as \u201cnail your dick\u201d. This made for a heated, whispered exchange between me and my mum, which other filmgoers may have found distracting.

My mum gave two explanations for this. First, she has a terrible singing voice; second, she had never heard of the lullaby in question. The only thing like that she ever said to me was a rhyme beginning: \u201c<em>Laku no\u0107, buhe te grizle cijelu no\u0107 </em>...\u201d This, in its entirety, translates as: \u201cGood night.

      "body": "<p>Surgeons are working around the clock to help tourists who suffered horrendous burn injuries in the eruption of the New Zealand\u2019s White Island volcano, health experts have said.</p> \n<p>New Zealand health authorities have reportedly ordered 1.2 million sq cm of skin from the US in order to treat those injured: 27 of whom had burns to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/white-island-eruption-what-we-know-so-far\">more than 30% of their body</a>, with some having burns to 90-95% of their body. For context, experts say the palm of a hand is about 1.5% of the area of the body.</p> \n<p>At present 29 patients are being treated in intensive care and burns units in New Zealand; 22 patients are on airway support.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe currently have supply but are urgently sourcing additional supplies to meet the supply for dressing and temporary skin grafts,\u201d Counties Manukau district health board\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Peter Watson, told reporters <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/12/live-counties-manukau-health-update-media-on-injuries-and-burns.html\">in a press conference</a> on Wednesday. \u201cThese supplies are coming from the United States, and the order has been placed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watson added that injuries sustained by the tourists had been complicated by the mix of gases and chemicals from the disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has necessitated more rapid surgical treatment of these burns than is the usual case for thermal-only burns,\u201d he said, adding that the country\u2019s surgical teams have been working \u201caround the clock non-stop\u201d to begin surgical treatment \u2013 the start of a process that Watson said for some patients could last several months.</p> \n<p>Dr John Kenealy, clinical director of surgery at Middlemore hospital, said: \u201cThis number of burns at one time is certainly unprecedented in New Zealand, and it is unprecedented in most countries in the world. These are fortunately rare events.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, he said the team were well trained to cope with such injuries. \u201cThe patients that we are treating are standard from the point of view that we deal with patients of this severity of burn all of the time,\u201d he said, adding that the team had also been trained for mass casualty events.</p> \n<p>A patient with 40-50% burns, he added, would have about eight hours of surgery for the initial procedures.</p> \n<p>Jorge Leon-Villapalos, consultant in plastic surgery and burns at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, said many factors needed to be considered when a patient with severe burns was brought in.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe burn itself may be associated with a number of life-threatening priorities that need to be addressed first of all,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a possibility that some of these patients may have had damage to the airway because of inhaling toxic gases or very, very hot gases,\u201d he said, adding those problems must be tackled first to prevent the patient dying. </p> \n<p>Leon-Villapalos said it was also crucial to provide fluids \u2013 as these can be lost when the skin barrier is broken \u2013 and to stabilise the patient\u2019s body temperature.</p> \n<p>Once the initial priorities were taken care of, he said, the burn itself could be assessed in depth and extent. Deep burns, he said, would require operations to remove the dead skin and replace it with a temporary cover such as a dressing, skin substitute\u2013 or donated skin from cadavers which are stored in big tissue banks, typically frozen.</p> \n<p>David Barnes, consultant plastic surgeon at Broomfield hospital, Chelmsford, said the latter was most likely what the New Zealand team had ordered. This temporary cover would act as a barrier against infection, fluid loss and physical trauma; donor skin is tested for a wide range of possible diseases before being used. Over time however it would need to be replaced, not least because of rejection by the patient\u2019s body.</p> \n<p>\u201cEventually you graft [the wound] with a patient\u2019s own skin, but that comes once the patient has been stabilised,\u201d Leon-Villapalos added, saying that would take many difficult and time-consuming operations.</p> \n<p>All the time, he said, it was important to monitor all the body systems that may have been affected. \u201cA major burn will affect not only the lungs but also the gut, the cardiovascular system \u2013 the heart, your blood pressure, your pulse \u2013 your ability to fight infections and so on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The team would also carefully examine the patient for other injuries. \u201cWe do not deal only with the burn itself \u2013 it is a trauma situation in which the burn may be the most visually obvious situation, but there are other issues that we need to take into consideration in order not to miss any type of life-threatening situation,\u201d said Leon-Villapalos.</p> \n<p>But he stressed that treating patients with severe burns was a multidisciplinary and continuing effort, with experts ranging from anesthetists to nurses, pharmacists to physiotherapists crucial to the work. \u201cIt is absolutely a team effort,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Barnes added that such injuries would take months of care. \u201cIt is the biggest insult that you can have in your body, a major burn injury,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c4ad1c6-4992-4651-85bf-6584f90cec2c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KTn5MAZOtuA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Surgeons are working around the clock to help tourists who suffered horrendous burn injuries in the eruption of the New Zealand\u2019s White Island volcano, health experts have said. New Zealand health authorities have reportedly ordered 1.2 million sq cm of skin from the US in order to treat those injured: 27 of whom had burns to more than 30% of their body, with some having burns to 90-95% of their body. For context, experts say the palm of a hand is about 1.5% of the area of the body. At present 29 patients are being treated in intensive care and burns units in New Zealand; 22 patients are on airway support. \u201cWe currently have supply but are urgently sourcing additional supplies to meet the supply for dressing and temporary skin grafts,\u201d Counties Manukau district health board\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Peter Watson, told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cThese supplies are coming from the United States, and the order has been placed.\u201d Watson added that injuries sustained by the tourists had been complicated by the mix of gases and chemicals from the disaster. \u201cThis has necessitated more rapid surgical treatment of these burns than is the usual case for thermal-only burns,\u201d he said, adding that the country\u2019s surgical teams have been working \u201caround the clock non-stop\u201d to begin surgical treatment \u2013 the start of a process that Watson said for some patients could last several months. Dr John Kenealy, clinical director of surgery at Middlemore hospital, said: \u201cThis number of burns at one time is certainly unprecedented in New Zealand, and it is unprecedented in most countries in the world. These are fortunately rare events.\u201d However, he said the team were well trained to cope with such injuries. \u201cThe patients that we are treating are standard from the point of view that we deal with patients of this severity of burn all of the time,\u201d he said, adding that the team had also been trained for mass casualty events. A patient with 40-50% burns, he added, would have about eight hours of surgery for the initial procedures. Jorge Leon-Villapalos, consultant in plastic surgery and burns at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, said many factors needed to be considered when a patient with severe burns was brought in. \u201cThe burn itself may be associated with a number of life-threatening priorities that need to be addressed first of all,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a possibility that some of these patients may have had damage to the airway because of inhaling toxic gases or very, very hot gases,\u201d he said, adding those problems must be tackled first to prevent the patient dying. Leon-Villapalos said it was also crucial to provide fluids \u2013 as these can be lost when the skin barrier is broken \u2013 and to stabilise the patient\u2019s body temperature. Once the initial priorities were taken care of, he said, the burn itself could be assessed in depth and extent. Deep burns, he said, would require operations to remove the dead skin and replace it with a temporary cover such as a dressing, skin substitute\u2013 or donated skin from cadavers which are stored in big tissue banks, typically frozen. David Barnes, consultant plastic surgeon at Broomfield hospital, Chelmsford, said the latter was most likely what the New Zealand team had ordered. This temporary cover would act as a barrier against infection, fluid loss and physical trauma; donor skin is tested for a wide range of possible diseases before being used. Over time however it would need to be replaced, not least because of rejection by the patient\u2019s body. \u201cEventually you graft [the wound] with a patient\u2019s own skin, but that comes once the patient has been stabilised,\u201d Leon-Villapalos added, saying that would take many difficult and time-consuming operations. All the time, he said, it was important to monitor all the body systems that may have been affected. \u201cA major burn will affect not only the lungs but also the gut, the cardiovascular system \u2013 the heart, your blood pressure, your pulse \u2013 your ability to fight infections and so on,\u201d he said. The team would also carefully examine the patient for other injuries. \u201cWe do not deal only with the burn itself \u2013 it is a trauma situation in which the burn may be the most visually obvious situation, but there are other issues that we need to take into consideration in order not to miss any type of life-threatening situation,\u201d said Leon-Villapalos. But he stressed that treating patients with severe burns was a multidisciplinary and continuing effort, with experts ranging from anesthetists to nurses, pharmacists to physiotherapists crucial to the work. \u201cIt is absolutely a team effort,\u201d he said. Barnes added that such injuries would take months of care. \u201cIt is the biggest insult that you can have in your body, a major burn injury,\u201d he said.",

airwaves following uproar over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/06/gaffe-jacob-rees-mogg-grenfell-tories-votes\">his comments about the Grenfell tragedy</a>.</p> <p>His presence among the top 20 most prominent campaigners in the press and TV in the campaign\u2019s first week was largely a result of coverage of the Grenfell issue \u2013 and by the second week he had disappeared.</p> <p>Instead, a series of pictures on the politician\u2019s Twitter account suggests that he has been instructed to largely restrict himself to his safe seat of North East Somerset.</p> <h2><strong>Steve Barclay</strong></h2> <p>Virtually absent from major set-piece media slots, the Brexit secretary\u2019s name has instead tended to be mentioned when journalists have challenged Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about his Brexit deal.</p> <p>Most recently, the prime minister told Sky News that Barclay and others had been \u201cwrong\u201d to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the deal.</p> <p>While Barclay has stumbled over the details of the deal in the past, his northern roots and credentials as an MP who previously had a \u201creal job\u201d might otherwise have marked him out as a campaign asset.</p> <h2><strong>Priti Patel</strong></h2> <p>From introducing Boris Johnson at his first campaign rally on 6 November, the

      "bodyText": "The \u201cpresidential\u201d nature of a campaign dominated by the leaders of the two largest parties has been illuminated by research that also reveals how Labour and the Conservatives have hidden away senior figures deemed to be embarrassing or \u201coff message\u201d. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn appeared in 31.7% and 26.9% of media coverage analysed by researchers, while the third most prominent figure to feature was the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The research suggests a huge focus across the media on a small number of leading figures, with the top 10 on the list accounting for 45.7% of total coverage. By contrast, the campaign\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d men and women \u2013 who were relegated to taking selfies on the election trail or rallying constituency parties \u2013 include cabinet ministers and senior Labour frontbenchers such as the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and, following his comments about the Grenfell tragedy, Jacob Rees-Mogg. An irony of an election that has been largely about Brexit has also been the near invisibility of the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and the relative absence of his Labour shadow, Keir Starmer. The rankings were calculated by researchers at Loughborough University, who analysed election-related items in the press and TV between Monday and Friday over four weeks. Among figures who were more visible than might have been expected \u2013 though still with just 1.6% and 0.9% respectively \u2013 were Ian Austin and John Woodcock, the former Labour MPs who are backing Boris Johnson, who were the joint 11th and 16th most prominent figure in media coverage. The former prime minister Tony Blair was the 24th most prominent, well ahead of frontline senior politicians and his fellow former prime ministers. David Deacon, professor of communication and media analysis at Loughborough University, said: \u201cWhen you add up all appearances of politicians from all parties in election coverage, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn account for a third of that total.\u201d However, he added that levels of \u201cpresidentialisation\u201d were broadly in line with the 2017 campaign. \u201cJo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s positions in the upper regions of the table have been largely secured through the foothold they have established in TV news,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the press, they have been squeezed to the very margins.\u201d He also said that that \u201cinsurgents and renegades\u201d with a primarily anti-Labour message \u2013 such as Nigel Farage, Ian Austin and John Woodcock \u2013 gained more prominence than disillusioned and dispossessed ex-Conservatives like David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Michael Heseltine. The most striking absentees from broadcast coverage typically represent some aspect of their parties that election strategists have decided they would rather not emphasise \u2013 or, as in Rees-Mogg\u2019s case, compounded that problem with an unforced error. Conservatives Jacob Rees-Mogg From being a near-perennial fixture of political coverage in 2019, Rees-Mogg vanished from the airwaves following uproar over his comments about the Grenfell tragedy. His presence among the top 20 most prominent campaigners in the press and TV in the campaign\u2019s first week was largely a result of coverage of the Grenfell issue \u2013 and by the second week he had disappeared. Instead, a series of pictures on the politician\u2019s Twitter account suggests that he has been instructed to largely restrict himself to his safe seat of North East Somerset. Steve Barclay Virtually absent from major set-piece media slots, the Brexit secretary\u2019s name has instead tended to be mentioned when journalists have challenged Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about his Brexit deal. Most recently, the prime minister told Sky News that Barclay and others had been \u201cwrong\u201d to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the deal. While Barclay has stumbled over the details of the deal in the past, his northern roots and credentials as an MP who previously had a \u201creal job\u201d might otherwise have marked him out as a campaign asset. Priti Patel From introducing Boris Johnson at his first campaign rally on 6 November, the home secretary has remained relatively prominent in terms of her press and TV appearances despite other cabinet ministers being chosen for major set-piece debates. Moments have included appearing alongside Boris Johnson on London Bridge in the wake of the terror attack. But while Patel\u2019s credentials on law and order and Brexit dovetail with central themes of the Tory election campaign, she might be regarded as a turn-off for floating voters which the party are hoping to pick off. She just about crept into a table of the top 20 most prominent individuals in press and TV reporting of the first week of the formal campaign and then made the top 10 as a result of coverage of her party\u2019s plans for immigration policy, according to Loughborough University research. She was the seventh and eighth most prominent campaigner in weeks three and four. Labour Keir Starmer While he has not quite been as absent from the campaign as the Brexit secretary he shadows, Starmer is one of a number of remain-supporting Labour frontbenchers shunted to the back as figures with more ambiguous positions on Brexit have been brought to the fore on the media merry go round. He was number 17 in a list of the 20 most prominent individuals in the reporting of the first week of the formal campaign but completely dropped out of the top 20 for the following three weeks. Emily Thornberry Arguably the most vocal and prominent voice for remain on the Labour frontbench, Thornberry is another would-be Labour leadership contender who appears to have been kept away from the key media slots as the party leadership attempts to keep leave-supporting voters onside. From being the 18th most prominent figure in the first week of the campaign, she slipped out of that ranking for weeks two and three. Clive Lewis An active figure on social media and an energetic campaigner who is sometimes regarded as a potential leadership contender, Lewis had virtually no media profile in the rankings of Loughborough University\u2019s 150 most prominent figures. His very support for a second referendum and for remaining in the EU, may have been a factor in his lack of utilisation by the party leadership for prominent media slots.",

Never one to mince his words, he was a leader in the truest sense,\u201d said Wilkinson. Liverpool have supported calls by human rights groups for thorough investigations into the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar, before the club flies out to play in Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup. Chelsea. Wilfried Zaha. Nathan Ak\u00e9. Bournemouth\u2019s Jordon Ibe will face trial over crashing his Bentley into a trendy Bromley coffee shop in the early hours of 30 July. Shy and retiring Gennaro Gattuso is favourite to succeed Carlo Ancelotti at Napoli, where he will have to do as shy and retiring owner Aurelio De Laurentiis says. What could possibly go wrong? J\u00fcrgen Klopp has saluted Mo Salah after his geometry-defying finish helped Liverpool secure Big Cup qualification in the 2-0 win over Salzburg. \u201cThank God I don\u2019t have to [explain the finish],\u201d he honked. \u201cIt was a very, very good goal.\u201d And Spurs manager Humility Man\u2122 has banned his players from watching the video nasty of their 7-2 Big Cup shellacking before their more considered defeat in Germany. \u201cI forbid any image of it,\u201d he parped, while shielding Ryan Sessegnon\u2019s delicate eyes.

So there might be a deal, there might not be a deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The commission will also face a difficult task in gaining full backing for the rest of the package among all member states.

      "bodyText": "Nearly every major aspect of the European economy is to be re-evaluated in light of the imperatives of the climate and ecological emergency, according to sweeping new plans set out by the European commission on Wednesday. The comprehensive nature of the European Green Deal \u2013 which encompasses the air we breathe to how food is grown, from how we travel to the buildings we inhabit \u2013 was set out in a flurry of documents as Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, made her appeal to member states and parliamentarians in Brussels to back the proposals, which would represent the biggest overhaul of policy since the foundation of the modern EU. Von der Leyen said the package was aimed at economic growth and increasing prosperity. \u201c[This] is our new growth strategy, for a growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows how to transform our way of living and working, of producing and consuming, so that we live healthier [lives] and make our businesses innovate. We will help our economy to be a global leader by moving first and moving fast.\u201d As well as bidding to lead the world on climate action with a proposed target of net-zero carbon by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030, the EU will delve far more deeply into the root problems that contribute to carbon emissions and pollution. For instance, in manufacturing: in previous decades, the EU was content to set targets for recycling rates; under the European Green Deal, regulators would set specific standards on the manufacturing of goods to create a circular economy and phase out unnecessary plastic and other waste before it is created. From 2021, at least 40% of the budget for the common agricultural policy and 30% of fisheries subsidies would be devoted to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, instead of contributing to higher emissions and environmental degradation, as many of these subsidies do at present. Toxic air and its health impacts would be tackled through tougher air quality requirements, and energy targets would be raised to generate more energy from renewable sources, up to 100% by 2050. More freight would be transported by rail and water, and greenhouse gas emissions from air travel would be reduced. The emissions reduction target for 2030 was proposed at a level of 50-55%, with a new law enshrining the commitment to net zero carbon for 2050. As an inducement to the member states reluctant to sign up to the 2030 and 2050 targets \u2013 Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary \u2013 Von der Leyen promised\u20ac100bn (\u00a384bn) to help finance the transition to a low-carbon economy, along with the potential for a carbon border tax to be levied on imports to the EU from countries without sufficiently stringent carbon targets of their own. Leaders will discuss the emissions goals when they meet in Brussels at a summit on Thursday, but agreement still appears some way off. Failure to agree a second time, following a previous attempt in June, would be a blow to the EU\u2019s standing at the UN climate talks, now reaching their final days in Madrid. One senior EU official said: \u201cOne of the elements that the heads of state and government will have to take into account is the pressure outside the room on this. This is climate week, right. So there might be a deal, there might not be a deal.\u201d The commission will also face a difficult task in gaining full backing for the rest of the package among all member states. As well as those concerned about the carbon targets, there are the powerful agricultural and fishing lobbies in several states with concerns over reforms to the subsidy regime, and industries such as car manufacturing and chemicals that will face new regulations In one indication of the troubles yet to come, the UK on Wednesday joined the Czech Republic and France in blocking a deal on a set of rules governing which financial products can be labelled \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d. France was concerned that its nuclear industry would lose out from the \u201ctaxonomy for sustainable finance\u201d. Negotiations among member states and the European parliament on the green financing proposals are expected to resume on Monday. Green campaigners welcomed the aims of the European Green Deal but called for more detail and higher ambition, including a strengthening of the emissions target to a 65% cut by 2030. Franziska Achterberg, EU spokesperson for Greenpeace, said: \u201cThe climate targets [the commission is] proposing would be too little too late. On protecting nature, much is aspirational and needs to be fleshed out. The detailed measures that will follow must tackle the production and consumption patterns that have brought us to the brink.\u201d Some campaigners at the UN climate talks in Madrid also called for the EU to bring forward its international proposals faster, to give more momentum to the push for tougher carbon targets under the Paris agreement. Under the commission\u2019s proposals, the plans could not be formally adopted until next summer, giving only a few months before the crunch 2020 climate conference in Glasgow. Wendel Trio of the Climate Action Network said: \u201cTiming is everything. Now EU member states have a big responsibility to agree on a much higher 2030 climate target at the European Council in June 2020.\u201d \u201cThe proposed package is comprehensive, identifying the right areas for action \u2013 from biodiversity and nature restoration to climate change and stopping deforestation,\u201d said Ester Asin, director of the European policy office at WWF. \u201cHowever, by emphasising continued economic growth as a key objective, the commission has missed an opportunity to challenge the traditional growth paradigm in favour of an approach that would respect planetary boundaries.\u201d",

Only the SNP can beat the Tories in Scotland. Voting Labour will help the Tories.\u201d</p> <p>An hour later, Sturgeon began the SNP\u2019s final push by helping sort broccoli and brussels sprouts in a greengrocer cooperative in Labour\u2019s safest Scottish seat, Edinburgh South, where she repeated that message. \u201cThe SNP is the main challenger to the Tories,\u201d she said. \u201cVoting for other parties risks helping the Tories.\u201d</p> <p>The spat between Sturgeon and Corbyn illuminated the complex electoral picture in Scotland. A significant number of the country\u2019s 59 Westminster seats are marginals, and four are in the top 10 most marginal seats in the UK.</p> <p>Despite Sturgeon\u2019s claim that there are no Tory-Labour marginals, there is less than a percentage point between the SNP, the Conservatives and Labour in the SNP\u2019s seat of Lanark and Hamilton East. All three parties claim they could win there.</p> <p>Yet Sturgeon has won over much of Labour\u2019s support in Scotland and is expected to win back a handful of seats that Labour took in 2017.

A YouGov poll released on Tuesday evening indicated that the SNP could regain six of the 21 seats it lost in 2017, taking back seats from both the Conservatives and Labour.</p> <p>YouGov predicts that the Tories will save nine of the 13 seats it is defending, and Labour \u2013 despite a run of dire polls during this campaign, will retain five of its seven. That would surprise other Scottish party strategists.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn launched the final day of Labour\u2019s election campaign before dawn on the banks of the Clyde, with party activists and their children framed by the lights of a Christmas tree. Standing on the border of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Glasgow Southside constituency, Corbyn brought loud cheers from Labour candidates and campaigners by declaring: \u201cThe only way of getting rid of a Tory government is by voting Labour all across the country, including here in Glasgow and all across Scotland.\u201d It was a provocative claim and a provocative place to stand: Labour had arranged Corbyn\u2019s rally in a contituency it believes it can steal from the Scottish National party, Glasgow South West. Alerted by tweets from journalists covering his speech, Sturgeon retorted on Twitter: \u201cThere\u2019s not a single Tory/Labour marginal in Scotland. Only the SNP can beat the Tories in Scotland. Voting Labour will help the Tories.\u201d An hour later, Sturgeon began the SNP\u2019s final push by helping sort broccoli and brussels sprouts in a greengrocer cooperative in Labour\u2019s safest Scottish seat, Edinburgh South, where she repeated that message. \u201cThe SNP is the main challenger to the Tories,\u201d she said. \u201cVoting for other parties risks helping the Tories.\u201d The spat between Sturgeon and Corbyn illuminated the complex electoral picture in Scotland. A significant number of the country\u2019s 59 Westminster seats are marginals, and four are in the top 10 most marginal seats in the UK. Despite Sturgeon\u2019s claim that there are no Tory-Labour marginals, there is less than a percentage point between the SNP, the Conservatives and Labour in the SNP\u2019s seat of Lanark and Hamilton East. All three parties claim they could win there. Yet Sturgeon has won over much of Labour\u2019s support in Scotland and is expected to win back a handful of seats that Labour took in 2017. The SNP is the closest challenger in every one of Labour\u2019s seven Scottish constituencies. A number of seats could change hands on Thursday, but fewer than was suggested by polls at the start of the campaign. A YouGov poll released on Tuesday evening indicated that the SNP could regain six of the 21 seats it lost in 2017, taking back seats from both the Conservatives and Labour. YouGov predicts that the Tories will save nine of the 13 seats it is defending, and Labour \u2013 despite a run of dire polls during this campaign, will retain five of its seven. That would surprise other Scottish party strategists. Although Labour has recovered since a YouGov poll in October put its vote at a historic low of 12% (Panelbase put it recently at 21%), few believe it will hold more than three seats. YouGov predicts that the Liberal Democrats, deflated by a poor campaign, will win four seats \u2013 the same number it won in 2017. Tory strategists suspect there will be a few shocks. They believe the Lib Dems will win back the UK\u2019s most marginal seat, Fife North East, held by the SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins in 2017 by two votes. YouGov predicts Gethins will retain it. The Conservatives say thousands of Tory voters, including their own activists, will vote Lib Dem tactically to oust the SNP. The Tories are expected to lose several seats to the SNP, including Aberdeen South \u2013 suddenly vacated by the former MP Ross Thomson early in the campaign after Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney accused him of sexual assault in a Commons bar \u2013 and also Ochil and South Perthshire. They are also resigned to defeat in Stirling, where Alyn Smith, an MEP who became the poster boy for the SNP\u2019s anti-Brexit campaign in Brussels, has built a strong pro-remain coalition in a seat that voted 67% in favour of staying in the EU in 2016. The Tories say this election has come down to four interlinked issues in Scotland: \u201cIndependence, Nicola, Brexit and Boris.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s reputation has proven toxic for the Conservatives in some seats, while the Tories\u2019 relentless focus on Sturgeon and her early attempts to make independence a defining issue of this election appear to have had some impact.

      "body": "<p>Art Basel Miami highlights the best new work from the world\u2019s contemporary artists, many of whom toil away at their craft, painstakingly, hoping to create something new and innovative under the sun. But naturally all anyone can talk about is the guy who taped a $120,000 banana to the wall and the other guy who ate it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/09/the-art-world-is-bananas-thats-what-maurizio-cattelans-been-saying-all-along\">Don't make fun of the $120,000 banana \u2013 it's in on the joke | Jonathan Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The initial piece, Comedian by the Italian-born artist Maurizio Cattelan, and the subsequent performance/action, Hungry Artist by Georgian-born David Datuna, may seem too ludicrous to even parody, but all parties are making a good show of taking the matter seriously. In its pre-masticated form, Cattelan <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/maurizio-cattelan-banana-art-basel-miami-beach-1722516\">claimed</a> that he worked on Comedian for a year, before deciding on exactly how to let the banana manifest itself. (In earlier conceptions, it was made of resin, before the sculptor realized \u201cthe banana is supposed to be a banana\u201d.) Gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin explained that the angle of the tape and shape of the fruit were \u201ccarefully considered\u201d.</p> <p>While Cattelan certainly has an impish sense of humor, he isn\u2019t someone who barged on to the scene with a bag of groceries. He has had a long career pushing boundaries that include golden toilets (yes, the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/gold-toilet-reportedly-stolen-blenheim-palace-cattelan\">recently stolen from Blenheim Palace</a> was his), taxidermy, waxworks of John F Kennedy, the pope and Hitler, and large sculptures of extended middle fingers. When the banana was taped to the wall, it quickly sold for $120,000, followed by another. A third was up for bid to a museum at $150,000 before David Datuna hit the Miami Beach convention center.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7efc443d5c9f5d250828f5b25200526ccd90aceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7efc443d5c9f5d250828f5b25200526ccd90aceb/0_0_4962_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Datuna is not just another prankster looking for a potassium fix. He proudly tells me via telephone that he is one of only two artists to have had shows at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery while still alive. His mixed-media sculptures often include eyeglasses as a motif, and in recent years he has done site-specific political work, such as laying out blocks of ice to spell Trump in New York\u2019s Union Square, which would later melt. (This action was inspired by the withdrawal from the Paris agreement.) In 2022 in Qatar, timed for the World Cup, he is planning, as he calls it, the largest art installation incorporating artificial intelligence that has ever happened.</p> <p>There was near pandemonium from selfie-takers around Comedian in Miami, and when Datuna saw it (and saw it was from Cattelan) he thought it was great. But when he Googled it and saw the asking price it took \u201cabout 15 or 20 minutes\u201d to conceive of \u201cthe answer I must give to him and to the art world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWarhol put banana on a canvas,\u201d Datuna says with his Georgian accent. \u201cCattelan takes a real banana and puts it on the wall. David took banana from the wall and ate it!\u201d</p> <p>Datuna called his performance piece Hungry Artist and it quickly went viral. He did not have permission from Cattelan or the Perrotin Gallery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5yIFp2hyE-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Art Basel Miami highlights the best new work from the world\u2019s contemporary artists, many of whom toil away at their craft, painstakingly, hoping to create something new and innovative under the sun. But naturally all anyone can talk about is the guy who taped a $120,000 banana to the wall and the other guy who ate it. The initial piece, Comedian by the Italian-born artist Maurizio Cattelan, and the subsequent performance/action, Hungry Artist by Georgian-born David Datuna, may seem too ludicrous to even parody, but all parties are making a good show of taking the matter seriously. In its pre-masticated form, Cattelan claimed that he worked on Comedian for a year, before deciding on exactly how to let the banana manifest itself. (In earlier conceptions, it was made of resin, before the sculptor realized \u201cthe banana is supposed to be a banana\u201d.) Gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin explained that the angle of the tape and shape of the fruit were \u201ccarefully considered\u201d. While Cattelan certainly has an impish sense of humor, he isn\u2019t someone who barged on to the scene with a bag of groceries. He has had a long career pushing boundaries that include golden toilets (yes, the one recently stolen from Blenheim Palace was his), taxidermy, waxworks of John F Kennedy, the pope and Hitler, and large sculptures of extended middle fingers. When the banana was taped to the wall, it quickly sold for $120,000, followed by another. A third was up for bid to a museum at $150,000 before David Datuna hit the Miami Beach convention center. Datuna is not just another prankster looking for a potassium fix. He proudly tells me via telephone that he is one of only two artists to have had shows at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery while still alive. His mixed-media sculptures often include eyeglasses as a motif, and in recent years he has done site-specific political work, such as laying out blocks of ice to spell Trump in New York\u2019s Union Square, which would later melt. (This action was inspired by the withdrawal from the Paris agreement.) In 2022 in Qatar, timed for the World Cup, he is planning, as he calls it, the largest art installation incorporating artificial intelligence that has ever happened. There was near pandemonium from selfie-takers around Comedian in Miami, and when Datuna saw it (and saw it was from Cattelan) he thought it was great. But when he Googled it and saw the asking price it took \u201cabout 15 or 20 minutes\u201d to conceive of \u201cthe answer I must give to him and to the art world\u201d. \u201cWarhol put banana on a canvas,\u201d Datuna says with his Georgian accent. \u201cCattelan takes a real banana and puts it on the wall. David took banana from the wall and ate it!\u201d Datuna called his performance piece Hungry Artist and it quickly went viral. He did not have permission from Cattelan or the Perrotin Gallery. Below is a further transcript of our phone conversation, edited for clarity. Have you met Maurizio Cattelan? No, but I follow him, he is a great artist. Has he reached out to you since this past weekend? No. It\u2019s plausible you will meet him some day on the contemporary art circuit, though. Would it be a warm meeting? I would love to meet him. I think he is a genius. Art is about comedy, about fun, about tragedy, about emotions. He played this very well.

It is silly, and not good for our contemporary life. I have travelled in 67 countries around the world in the last three years, and I see how people live. Millions are dying without food. Then he puts three bananas on the wall for half a million dollars? So you felt compelled to do something? Cattelan beat Andy Warhol. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say beat, but brought it to another level. I began to think: \u201cWhat can I do with this banana? How can I bring it to yet another level?\u201d And how to do it also with comedy? So I ate the banana. It is something deeper.

      "body": "<p>Want to make your pet look a bit stupid? Now you can, by commissioning an artwork<a href=\"https://royalpetpawtrait.com/\" title=\"\"> from Royal Pet Pawtrait</a>. The artists behind this enterprise will turn a photo of your dog or cat into a posed portrait in what is purported to be \u201cRenaissance\u201d style, dressed up as a queen or soldier.</p> <p>The results look like a joke by someone who hates animals. The artists have seemingly taken that painting of dogs playing poker as inspiration.</p> <p>Well, if you loathe your pet ... but if you don\u2019t, you are better off taking inspiration from actual Renaissance portraits of animals to photograph or draw your own.</p> <p>Pets feature in Renaissance art, but not dressed up as some hideous human parody. On the contrary, they are honoured as the different species they are.</p> <p>No dogs in art have more dogness than the hounds portrayed by Andrea Mantegna in a fresco of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/mar/06/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">the Gonzaga family in their palace in Mantua</a>. They pant patiently, poised to go hunting.

      "bodyText": "Want to make your pet look a bit stupid? Now you can, by commissioning an artwork from Royal Pet Pawtrait. The artists behind this enterprise will turn a photo of your dog or cat into a posed portrait in what is purported to be \u201cRenaissance\u201d style, dressed up as a queen or soldier. The results look like a joke by someone who hates animals. The artists have seemingly taken that painting of dogs playing poker as inspiration. Well, if you loathe your pet ... but if you don\u2019t, you are better off taking inspiration from actual Renaissance portraits of animals to photograph or draw your own. Pets feature in Renaissance art, but not dressed up as some hideous human parody. On the contrary, they are honoured as the different species they are. No dogs in art have more dogness than the hounds portrayed by Andrea Mantegna in a fresco of the Gonzaga family in their palace in Mantua. They pant patiently, poised to go hunting. Maybe hunting dogs don\u2019t count as pets in a modern sense, but these hounds are part of the family, and they will tear your head off if you disagree. More sweetly domestic is a cat that Leonardo da Vinci drew in multiple moments as it rolls about and licks itself. Leonardo was a vegetarian who bought birds at market to set them free \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise he draws pets well. There are less conventional pets, too, in Renaissance art.

The party has criticised the police for saying they were not treating the latter incident as suspicious.</p> <p>Farage said that part of the reason for the number of abusive messages sent to Brexit party candidates was a Daily Mail front-page article that published their email addresses and called on people to write to them urging them to stand down. He said many candidates subsequently received thousands of messages.</p> <p>\u201cI think generally the tone of politics has deteriorated hugely, but I think our people have been subjected, certainly online, to something quite extraordinary,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBecause there has been a mass campaign organised to try and get our candidates to withdraw from standing in the election.</p> <p>\u201cIf it was South America we\u2019d all be saying something terrible was going on and call in election observers, but it\u2019s happening here. I cannot believe that is right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[Independent Group for Change MP] Anna Soubry gets a few nasty words from some lout outside parliament and everybody is up in arms,\u201d said Farage. \u201cThat is nothing compared to what hundreds of ordinary decent people who have put themselves forward because they believe in something have suffered over the course of the last eight weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Stewart, the Brexit party candidate in Doncaster North, who is mixed race, broke down when speaking to the audience in the town on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve seen racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people banging on the door and threatening my family, but it was never like this. It does upset me because people shouldn\u2019t be doing that at all.\u201d</p> <p>Farage said on Wednesday he expected the Conservatives to win a majority, but that British politics would be in crisis again by May because of the government\u2019s inability to secure a trade deal by the end of next year.</p> <p>Asked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/farage-appeared-with-antisemitic-pastor-on-us-web-radio-show\">the revelation earlier this week</a> that he had been interviewed multiple times by a far-right, antisemitic American pastor between 2011 and 2016, Farage said: \u201cI can\u2019t even remember. Who is he?\u201d Told that he had been interviewed at least six times, he said: \u201cPossibly. I was doing, at one time, more than 25 interviews a day, year after year after year.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if he\u2019d known he was antisemitic he wouldn\u2019t have done the interview. \u201cI obviously went on because the press officer said it was a good idea,\u201d he added.</p>",

Speaking the day before the country goes to the polls, the Brexit party leader said the campaign had been \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d and that he was surprised his candidates had been able to withstand the abuse they had been subjected to. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people who want to put themselves forward for election, which of course is our right in a free society, [be] hounded and bombarded in the most extraordinary way,\u201d he said. Farage was speaking to a gathering of activists in the constituency of Doncaster Central, after a major poll \u2013 produced using a method that accurately predicted the last election \u2013 forecast the Conservatives winning a majority of 28, within the margin of error, and the Brexit party winning no seats. The party\u2019s campaign has been dogged by criticism by campaigners and its own MEPs who say that standing candidates against the Conservatives risks splitting the leave vote. Catherine Blaiklock, the Brexit party\u2019s founder who resigned after retweeting Islamophobic messages, said on Tuesday that Farage\u2019s strategy had failed and that people should vote Tory. Surjit Singh Duhre, the Brexit party candidate in Doncaster Central, has reported receiving a death threat and being driven off the road. The party has criticised the police for saying they were not treating the latter incident as suspicious. Farage said that part of the reason for the number of abusive messages sent to Brexit party candidates was a Daily Mail front-page article that published their email addresses and called on people to write to them urging them to stand down. He said many candidates subsequently received thousands of messages. \u201cI think generally the tone of politics has deteriorated hugely, but I think our people have been subjected, certainly online, to something quite extraordinary,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBecause there has been a mass campaign organised to try and get our candidates to withdraw from standing in the election. \u201cIf it was South America we\u2019d all be saying something terrible was going on and call in election observers, but it\u2019s happening here. I cannot believe that is right.\u201d \u201c[Independent Group for Change MP] Anna Soubry gets a few nasty words from some lout outside parliament and everybody is up in arms,\u201d said Farage. \u201cThat is nothing compared to what hundreds of ordinary decent people who have put themselves forward because they believe in something have suffered over the course of the last eight weeks.\u201d Andy Stewart, the Brexit party candidate in Doncaster North, who is mixed race, broke down when speaking to the audience in the town on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve seen racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people banging on the door and threatening my family, but it was never like this. It does upset me because people shouldn\u2019t be doing that at all.\u201d Farage said on Wednesday he expected the Conservatives to win a majority, but that British politics would be in crisis again by May because of the government\u2019s inability to secure a trade deal by the end of next year. Asked about the revelation earlier this week that he had been interviewed multiple times by a far-right, antisemitic American pastor between 2011 and 2016, Farage said: \u201cI can\u2019t even remember. Who is he?\u201d Told that he had been interviewed at least six times, he said: \u201cPossibly. I was doing, at one time, more than 25 interviews a day, year after year after year.\u201d He said that if he\u2019d known he was antisemitic he wouldn\u2019t have done the interview. \u201cI obviously went on because the press officer said it was a good idea,\u201d he added.",

She brought the topic to life in a personable manner.\u201d Excellent content and structure.\u201d It is estimated that an adult makes about 35,000 remotely conscious decisions every day. Decision-making is a central aspect of your personal and professional life, but decisions can be difficult to arrive at in the presence of multiple objectives, or differences of opinion with others. Following our hugely successful one-day MBA, where Dr Valentina Ferretti, fellow in decision science at the London School of Economics and Political Science, engaged the audience with her interactive session on decision-making, we have invited her to deliver her own evening class. Valentina will help you hone your ability to make better decisions by providing solutions for each of some key traps hindering your decision-making processes. You will develop awareness of decision traps and discover how to use decision analytics to improve your judgments. This course is suitable for anyone with an interest in enhancing their decision-making capabilities. The evening will be highly experiential, with a mix of thought experiments and puzzles, feedback and group discussion. Content Why do we need to start making better decisions? What are the key decision traps we tend to fall into and which solutions may help us? Framing. Expanding. Stretching.

      "body": "<p>Strawberry sundae, carrot cake, lemon drizzle, berry delight \u2026 You can have any flavour of Nakd bar you like, as long as you like dates. Squished together into a caramelly goo, before being mixed with chopped nuts and dried fruit, flavoured with spices and shaped into bars, dates are the backbone of every product in the range. \u201cWe do actually call it date goo,\u201d says the brand\u2019s development manager, Mirka Butalova, holding an enormous log of it in her hands.</p> <p>We are at the company\u2019s head offices, in a Buckinghamshire business park. On the table before us is an assortment of bars, all containing between 40% and 55% dates. Nakd is one of the biggest consumers in the UK, purchasing 2,000 tonnes of the dried fruit yearly.</p> <p>Earlier, snapping on a par of latex gloves, Butalova had demonstrated how the company\u2019s cacao and orange bar is made. You mix the dates with chopped cashew nuts and raisins, and add cacao powder and orange essence before smushing the whole thing and shaping it into bars. It looks exactly like Play-Doh. I can\u2019t figure out if I want to play patty-cake with it or eat it.</p> <p>Since it was founded 14 years ago, Nakd has ridden the coat-tails of the healthy snacking revolution to become a national success story, with \u00a32.6m of sales in 2018, up 11% from 2017. This is a business empire built on dates. And it\u2019s not the only one. Snacking brands The Primal Pantry, The Protein Ball Co, RAW and Livia\u2019s Kitchen all use dates as a core ingredient in their ranges.</p> <p>Not so long ago, dates were an exotic luxury rarely seen in the UK. Perhaps they would be eaten at Christmas, scrawny and puckered in polystyrene packaging, bearing scant resemblance to their voluptuous medjool peers. In Middle Eastern households, such as the one I grew up in, dates are ever-present, arranged on silver platters ready to be served to visiting guests with hot sweet tea. Now, the whole of the UK has gone gaga for them \u2013 even if it is more as an ingredient than as a delicious treat in its own right.</p> <p>This boom is a product of consumer demand for alternatives to refined sugar. Dates may be 80% sugar themselves, but because they are high in fibre, your body absorbs it more gradually, so your blood sugar levels won\u2019t spike as much as they would if you ate a chocolate bar. Handily, the fibre in dates can also aid in easing constipation. With the rise of wellness culture, dates have become a sort of cure-all, the glue in everything from cookies to cake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"84ec7d421cd9ec363b10010712654c2d22e6749d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ec7d421cd9ec363b10010712654c2d22e6749d/0_184_4195_2517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A selection of Nakd bars in assorted flavours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A selection of Nakd bars in assorted flavours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcin Rogozinski/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The woman who probably kickstarted our obsession with dates is Sarah Britton, the Canadian writer behind the healthy recipe blog My New Roots. Her 2011 <a href=\"https://www.mynewroots.org/site/2011/04/the-raw-brownie-2/\" title=\"\">recipe for raw brownies</a> \u2013 medjool dates, walnuts, cacao, almonds and sea salt \u2013 was the first to use dates as a sugar substitute and has been widely imitated \u2013 a Google search for \u201cdate brownies\u201d returns some 40m results. \u201cIt has been redone so many times,\u201d Britton says. She devised the recipe while working at a raw food restaurant in Copenhagen. \u201cI think it\u2019s so popular because it\u2019s so easy to make. If you have a food processor, you can do it. It\u2019s a super-satisfying treat that\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the halo effect around dates can encourage overconsumption. \u201cAt the end of the day, the sugar in dates is sugar,\u201d warns the dietitian Priya Tew. \u201cIt is easier to view these foods as healthier and eat them in larger amounts because of this, which could lead to you consuming more sugar and calories than you would in a regular brownie.\u201d</p> <p>You can see the obsession with dates as symptomatic of our modern-day anxieties around food. The wellness industry has been criticised for encouraging disordered eating, and the perception that there are \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cunclean\u201d foods. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018guilt-free\u2019 food, because no food is bad for you,\u201d says Eve Simmons of the anti-diet-culture blog <a href=\"http://www.notplantbased.com/\" title=\"\">Not Plant Based</a>. Instead of finding ways to make brownies healthier using dates, Simmons thinks that you should just eat a regular brownie. \u201cStudies show that the more we deny ourselves certain food, or categorise food as \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019, the more likely we are to develop an unhealthy relationship with it.\u201d</p> <p>And there are ethical considerations that may escape many health-conscious foodies.</p> <p>The date palm tree flowers across the Middle East and north Africa, with every date-producing region fiercely proud of its crop. (Although medjool dates are the best-known, purists prefer black-brown Iranian piarom dates for their richer flavour.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c410fd74212a02d0d122478acc09c696dcb96072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c410fd74212a02d0d122478acc09c696dcb96072/0_18_3826_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farm worker harvesting dates on a farm in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza Strip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A farm worker harvesting dates on a farm in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza Strip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adel Hana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yasmin Khan, author of <a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Yasmin-Khan/Zaitoun--Recipes-and-Stories-from-the-Palestinian-Kitchen/21744431\" title=\"\">Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen</a>, explains that dates are central to many Middle Eastern cultural rituals: you feed dates to a woman after she has given birth, and break your fast during Ramadan with a date. Every Middle Eastern home will have a box somewhere.</p> <p>She has watched with enthusiasm the popularity of dates explode in recent years (\u201cThere is something so comforting about dates\u201d) but also some concern. \u201cI find it wonderful that wellness embraces traditional Middle Eastern ingredients such as pomegranates, tahini and dates, but I also find it frustrating, because food doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. All food reflects the social and political context in which it is grown.\u201d</p> <p>Dates are grown in some of the most contested land in the world. Seventy per cent of the dates grown by Israeli settlers on Palestinian land in the West Bank are exported internationally, although the <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\" title=\"\">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign</a> urges consumers to avoid such goods.</p> <p>Khan urges western consumers to think carefully about the provenance of their dates. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t celebrate certain aspects of Middle Eastern culture while remaining silent on the issues facing people in the Middle East.\u201d Khan herself buys Palestinian dates, which are darker in colour, as Palestinian farmers have less water to irrigate their crops. \u201cI eat them every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re a great snack food.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strawberry sundae, carrot cake, lemon drizzle, berry delight \u2026 You can have any flavour of Nakd bar you like, as long as you like dates. Squished together into a caramelly goo, before being mixed with chopped nuts and dried fruit, flavoured with spices and shaped into bars, dates are the backbone of every product in the range. \u201cWe do actually call it date goo,\u201d says the brand\u2019s development manager, Mirka Butalova, holding an enormous log of it in her hands. We are at the company\u2019s head offices, in a Buckinghamshire business park. On the table before us is an assortment of bars, all containing between 40% and 55% dates. Nakd is one of the biggest consumers in the UK, purchasing 2,000 tonnes of the dried fruit yearly. Earlier, snapping on a par of latex gloves, Butalova had demonstrated how the company\u2019s cacao and orange bar is made. You mix the dates with chopped cashew nuts and raisins, and add cacao powder and orange essence before smushing the whole thing and shaping it into bars. It looks exactly like Play-Doh. I can\u2019t figure out if I want to play patty-cake with it or eat it. Since it was founded 14 years ago, Nakd has ridden the coat-tails of the healthy snacking revolution to become a national success story, with \u00a32.6m of sales in 2018, up 11% from 2017. This is a business empire built on dates. And it\u2019s not the only one. Snacking brands The Primal Pantry, The Protein Ball Co, RAW and Livia\u2019s Kitchen all use dates as a core ingredient in their ranges. Not so long ago, dates were an exotic luxury rarely seen in the UK. Perhaps they would be eaten at Christmas, scrawny and puckered in polystyrene packaging, bearing scant resemblance to their voluptuous medjool peers. In Middle Eastern households, such as the one I grew up in, dates are ever-present, arranged on silver platters ready to be served to visiting guests with hot sweet tea. Now, the whole of the UK has gone gaga for them \u2013 even if it is more as an ingredient than as a delicious treat in its own right. This boom is a product of consumer demand for alternatives to refined sugar. Dates may be 80% sugar themselves, but because they are high in fibre, your body absorbs it more gradually, so your blood sugar levels won\u2019t spike as much as they would if you ate a chocolate bar. Handily, the fibre in dates can also aid in easing constipation. With the rise of wellness culture, dates have become a sort of cure-all, the glue in everything from cookies to cake. The woman who probably kickstarted our obsession with dates is Sarah Britton, the Canadian writer behind the healthy recipe blog My New Roots. Her 2011 recipe for raw brownies \u2013 medjool dates, walnuts, cacao, almonds and sea salt \u2013 was the first to use dates as a sugar substitute and has been widely imitated \u2013 a Google search for \u201cdate brownies\u201d returns some 40m results. \u201cIt has been redone so many times,\u201d Britton says. She devised the recipe while working at a raw food restaurant in Copenhagen. \u201cI think it\u2019s so popular because it\u2019s so easy to make. If you have a food processor, you can do it. It\u2019s a super-satisfying treat that\u2019s good for you.\u201d Yet the halo effect around dates can encourage overconsumption. \u201cAt the end of the day, the sugar in dates is sugar,\u201d warns the dietitian Priya Tew. \u201cIt is easier to view these foods as healthier and eat them in larger amounts because of this, which could lead to you consuming more sugar and calories than you would in a regular brownie.\u201d You can see the obsession with dates as symptomatic of our modern-day anxieties around food. The wellness industry has been criticised for encouraging disordered eating, and the perception that there are \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cunclean\u201d foods. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018guilt-free\u2019 food, because no food is bad for you,\u201d says Eve Simmons of the anti-diet-culture blog Not Plant Based. Instead of finding ways to make brownies healthier using dates, Simmons thinks that you should just eat a regular brownie. \u201cStudies show that the more we deny ourselves certain food, or categorise food as \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019, the more likely we are to develop an unhealthy relationship with it.\u201d And there are ethical considerations that may escape many health-conscious foodies. The date palm tree flowers across the Middle East and north Africa, with every date-producing region fiercely proud of its crop. (Although medjool dates are the best-known, purists prefer black-brown Iranian piarom dates for their richer flavour.) Yasmin Khan, author of Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen, explains that dates are central to many Middle Eastern cultural rituals: you feed dates to a woman after she has given birth, and break your fast during Ramadan with a date. Every Middle Eastern home will have a box somewhere. She has watched with enthusiasm the popularity of dates explode in recent years (\u201cThere is something so comforting about dates\u201d) but also some concern. \u201cI find it wonderful that wellness embraces traditional Middle Eastern ingredients such as pomegranates, tahini and dates, but I also find it frustrating, because food doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. All food reflects the social and political context in which it is grown.\u201d Dates are grown in some of the most contested land in the world. Seventy per cent of the dates grown by Israeli settlers on Palestinian land in the West Bank are exported internationally, although the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign urges consumers to avoid such goods. Khan urges western consumers to think carefully about the provenance of their dates. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t celebrate certain aspects of Middle Eastern culture while remaining silent on the issues facing people in the Middle East.\u201d Khan herself buys Palestinian dates, which are darker in colour, as Palestinian farmers have less water to irrigate their crops. \u201cI eat them every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re a great snack food.\u201d",

Sitting in the doorway with a clipboard and a rosette, I absentmindedly read the well-worn posters stuck to the wall. As I scanned ads for literacy classes, housing rights and emergency care parcels, it dawned on me: the room in which voters were helping to elect a new government was normally a food bank. It\u2019s the sort of situation that seems too crass for even parody. But then if it is a joke, it\u2019s getting old. Two years on, there are now more food banks in the UK than there are branches of McDonald\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "An Isle of Wight ferry captain has been acquitted of two maritime offences after his ship carrying 202 people was involved in a collision with a motor yacht. CaptIan Drummond was accused of failing to keep a proper lookout before the accident involving the Red Funnel ferry as it headed to East Cowes on the island. The 305ft (107m) ferry, named Red Falcon, had a collision with the 32ft motor cruiser Phoenix in the Thorn channel, off Southampton, as both vessels were heading across the Solent. The ferry was carrying 20 crew and 182 passengers, and the motor cruiser was being sailed by its owner, Peter Jackson, 57, and his wife, Julie, with two others onboard, but there were no injuries. Drummond, 63, was sitting in the \u201clookout\u2019s chair\u201d at the time of the collision and the expert witness Capt John Simpson, a master mariner, told the trial that standing up would have helped eliminate the ferry\u2019s blindspot. But at Southampton magistrates court, the district judge Anthony Callaway ruled that Drummond had used his experience to remain seated to maintain an overall best view around his ship including the use of CCTV monitors. He said: \u201cNot everything can be seen at all times, that is an impossible task. He remained in the seat because he perceived it gave him the best view available. In my judgment, to move is likely to have hampered certain aspects of the lookout.\u201d Callaway concluded: \u201cI am satisfied the defendant did keep a proper lookout and was not to blame for the collision.\u201d He said Drummond was considered by his employer to be an \u201cexperienced and safety-conscious\u201d captain who had made 6,000 crossings to the Isle of Wight without incident. The judge said the skipper of the Phoenix, Jackson, had accepted a caution for his part in the incident. He said that Jackson had \u201calmost no knowledge\u201d of Colregs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) and added: \u201cNo proper lookout was in evidence and which endangered himself, his crew and the Phoenix, and to a lesser extent, the ferry.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that Mr Jackson simply did not see the oncoming ferry, irrespective of the Colregs. As a matter of common sense, this was another huge failing on the part of this skipper.\u201d Drummond, of Southampton, was acquitted of failing to keep a lookout and misconduct of master likely to endanger ships, structures or individuals under the Merchant Shipping Act. Speaking after the hearing, Drummond said he had been dismissed from his job following the incident in September last year but was seeking for this to be reversed at an employment tribunal to be held next year. He said: \u201cI feel very relieved, as a Christmas present I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything nicer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Life is full of stresses: death; divorce; disasters, natural and otherwise. But another stress under D in the dictionary of stresses is the Dinner Party. It\u2019s a bit like opening a restaurant, it\u2019s a bit like putting on a play, and it\u2019s all for the benefit of people who are our friends or colleagues but also our audience, our guinea pigs, our judges.</p> <p>There\u2019s so much that can go wrong: the food can be undercooked or overcooked \u2013 or perfectly cooked but not very good. The conversation can stall or it can turn into a competition or an argument or a shouting match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/08/thrillers-roundup-observer-nicci-french-lee-child-caroline-corcoran-rene-denfield\">The best recent thrillers roundup \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-lying-room-9781471179235.html\">The Lying Room</a>, is our version of what might be called domestic noir. It\u2019s a thriller about a married woman who finds her lover murdered and, instead of calling the police, cleans up the scene to remove any trace of her presence. It proves to be a disastrous decision and sets off a chain of complications that take place in bedrooms and gardens and kitchens and, at the centre of the story, a catastrophic dinner party at which secrets are revealed, resentments unmasked and blood spilt.</p> <p>Here are 10 of the best dinner parties in literature; the good, the bad and the horrendous.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/symposium-9780199540198.html\">The Symposium by Plato</a><br></strong>A group of Athenians meet to eat, drink and talk about the meaning of love. The dialogue includes the beautiful myth that we are born torn in two and spend our lives searching for our our other half. It has Socrates. It isn\u2019t much bothered about whether the love is gay or straight. It\u2019s a profound philosophical discussion interrupted by a drunk man staggering in with a prostitute. (In fact the only women at this dinner party are slaves or courtesans or both.) It is an evening that has haunted western culture ever since.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight-9780571340163.html\">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a><br></strong>A dinner party is a kind of display and a kind of theatre, it\u2019s conspicuous consumption and it\u2019s entertainment. We eat and we tell stories. King Arthur is feeding his court (in Simon Armitage\u2019s wonderful translation of the early-15th-century poem): \u201cEach guest received his share / of bread or meat or broth; a dozen plates per pair \u2013 / plus beer or wine, or both!\u201d As they eat, a knight enters on a horse. He\u2019s huge, well-armed, handsome \u2013 and green. He issues a challenge, accepted on Arthur\u2019s behalf by Sir Gawain, who gets more than he bargained for. It\u2019s both an epic adventure and a dinner-party yarn.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-tragedy-of-macbeth-the-oxford-shakespeare-9780199535835.html\">Macbeth by William Shakespeare</a><br></strong>This play begins with a witches\u2019 sabbath followed by the murder of a king, unleashing many more killings. But for some of us, the most horrifying scene is its dinner party going terribly wrong. The appearance of murdered Banquo at the feast is a shock but it\u2019s also a scene of skin-crawling embarrassment.

      "bodyText": "Life is full of stresses: death; divorce; disasters, natural and otherwise. But another stress under D in the dictionary of stresses is the Dinner Party. It\u2019s a bit like opening a restaurant, it\u2019s a bit like putting on a play, and it\u2019s all for the benefit of people who are our friends or colleagues but also our audience, our guinea pigs, our judges. There\u2019s so much that can go wrong: the food can be undercooked or overcooked \u2013 or perfectly cooked but not very good. The conversation can stall or it can turn into a competition or an argument or a shouting match. Our new book, The Lying Room, is our version of what might be called domestic noir. It\u2019s a thriller about a married woman who finds her lover murdered and, instead of calling the police, cleans up the scene to remove any trace of her presence. It proves to be a disastrous decision and sets off a chain of complications that take place in bedrooms and gardens and kitchens and, at the centre of the story, a catastrophic dinner party at which secrets are revealed, resentments unmasked and blood spilt. Here are 10 of the best dinner parties in literature; the good, the bad and the horrendous. 1. The Symposium by Plato A group of Athenians meet to eat, drink and talk about the meaning of love. The dialogue includes the beautiful myth that we are born torn in two and spend our lives searching for our our other half. It has Socrates. It isn\u2019t much bothered about whether the love is gay or straight. It\u2019s a profound philosophical discussion interrupted by a drunk man staggering in with a prostitute. (In fact the only women at this dinner party are slaves or courtesans or both.) It is an evening that has haunted western culture ever since. 2. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight A dinner party is a kind of display and a kind of theatre, it\u2019s conspicuous consumption and it\u2019s entertainment. We eat and we tell stories. King Arthur is feeding his court (in Simon Armitage\u2019s wonderful translation of the early-15th-century poem): \u201cEach guest received his share / of bread or meat or broth; a dozen plates per pair \u2013 / plus beer or wine, or both!\u201d As they eat, a knight enters on a horse. He\u2019s huge, well-armed, handsome \u2013 and green. He issues a challenge, accepted on Arthur\u2019s behalf by Sir Gawain, who gets more than he bargained for. It\u2019s both an epic adventure and a dinner-party yarn. 3. Macbeth by William Shakespeare This play begins with a witches\u2019 sabbath followed by the murder of a king, unleashing many more killings. But for some of us, the most horrifying scene is its dinner party going terribly wrong. The appearance of murdered Banquo at the feast is a shock but it\u2019s also a scene of skin-crawling embarrassment. The focus of the scene is not really on Macbeth but on his desperate wife, first trying to pretend nothing is happening, hissing at her husband to hold things together, placating the guests, and in the end cutting her losses and hustling them out of the door before things get any worse: \u201cStand not upon the order of your going but go at once.\u201d Haven\u2019t we all been to that sort of evening? 4. David Copperfield by Charles Dickens Is there a funnier or more adorable dinner party in literature than the one young David, newly independent in London, throws for his friends? Eager and anxious, he gets in too much food (oysters, roast fowls, stewed beef with vegetables, a slab of \u201cmock turtle\u201d enough for 15, a tart and a jelly) and so many bottles of wine that seeing them lined up he is \u201cabsolutely frightened of them\u201d. He begins the evening shy and ardent and full of pleasure in his friends. He ends it helplessly inebriated, leaning out of windows to talk to himself, unsteadily contemplating himself in a glass and seeing that even his hair looks drunk, falling down stairs. At last he finds himself in his bed, which is like a rocking sea, his tongue like the bottom of an empty kettle. (And haven\u2019t most of us been there, too?) 5. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf Boeuf en daube is a beef stew \u2013 but in the wonderful drawn-out dinner party in this novel it is also a sacrament. Three days in the marinading, infused with bay leaves and wine, olives and oil, its \u201csoft mass\u201d served in the \u201cgreat brown dish\u201d, it gathers Mr and Mrs Ramsay\u2019s guests in, so the disappointments and separations of the day die away and the unknown future is pushed outside the warm circle of talk and appetite. The bowl of fruit, the lighted candles, a couple arriving to announce their engagement. Mrs Ramsay bringing them all together, saying: \u201cLife, stand still here.\u201d 6. Animal Farm by George Orwell A dinner party can be an occasion for celebration and reconciliation. Never has that notion been turned on its head with such savage irony as at the climax of this allegory. The pigs are entertaining a \u201cdeputation of neighbouring farmers\u201d. The other animals peer in through the dining room window and they witness the friendly speeches and mutual toasts: \u201c\u2018The creatures looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\u201d 7. Finn Family Moomintroll by Tove Jansson There\u2019s an enticing supper in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (fried trout and \u201cgloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot\u201d), but no dinner party in children\u2019s literature can beat the magical autumn feast at the end of this book, when the inhabitants of Moomin valley gather at the end of their adventures to eat and drink and celebrate before they face their long winter hibernations. Even the hobgoblin is placated with plum jam pancakes and agrees to grant everyone\u2019s wish. Moomintroll wishes that the laden table be taken to his much-missed friend Snufkin. (This is our family mantra when one of us is missing from a feast: \u201cMay this table go to them wherever they are\u2026 \u201d) 8. Atonement by Ian McEwan A sweltering summer day in 1935 with war on the horizon. A grand house. A clandestine affair just begun, a rape about to happen, a world about to unravel \u2013 and a very English dinner party in progress: roast meat and roast potatoes, wine not water, the windows won\u2019t open and an aroma of \u201cwarm dust from the Persian carpet\u201d Everything important is not being said. A tour de force in which desire, violence and encroaching disaster are accompanied by conversation about the weather and the implacable march of unwanted dishes to the table. 9. Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Set in 1960s Nigeria before and during the Biafran war, hunger and starvation are at the heart of this novel. So too is eating.

The \u00a3100m deal between Kale Group and Rolls-Royce was in effect put on hold in March after it was initially signed by the previous UK prime minister, Theresa May, in 2017. The news is likely to be controversial as Turkish jets strafe Kurdish positions in northern Syria, and the Turkish president has threatened to send troops to Libya in defiance of the UN weapons embargo. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has also threatened to take on a Nato partner, Greece, in a dispute over drilling rights in the Mediterranean. But the UK has been one of Turkey\u2019s staunchest partners and, after its planned departure from the EU, will be in search of trade and defence deals. In setting up the joint venture company in 2017, the Turkish defence firm Kale and Rolls-Royce said the engines would supply Turkey\u2019s first TF-X aircraft, an indigenous generation of fighters to replace the F-16 fighter jets. They are expected to be ready by 2023 as a symbol of Turkish strength on the 100th anniversary of the republic. The deal has been hampered by disputes over intellectual property rights and offers from alternative suppliers, including Russia. It also comes as Turkish membership of Nato is again questioned after its purchase of a Russian S-400 air defence system, a move that has led to renewed calls from the US Congress either for sanctions on Turkey or a permanent ban on the sale of US F-35s jets to the country. Turkey claims it had no option than to purchase the Russian S-400 system after the the US and Europe refused to supply their defence systems. Ankara has proposed a joint technical working party to examine how Turkey\u2019s simultaneous use of US fighter jets and Russian defence systems could be compatible with Nato membership. The announced revival of the Rolls-Royce deal may be a means of warning Congress that Turkey still has allies, and alternative suppliers if its access to the F-35s is halted. Justin Bronk, an analyst at the RUSI defence thinktank, said: \u201cS-400 ownership is not fundamentally incompatible with Nato membership but it is absolutely incompatible with F-35 ownership. As the Turkish armed forces have shown, the first thing the [Russian] technicians setting up the S-400 radars in Turkey will do is test the system thoroughly against Turkish air force jets. \u201cIf Turkey were allowed the F-35 as well as S-400, then they would be able to test the S-400 radars against the F-35 under various different conditions, giving extremely valuable intelligence to Russia about how to counter the latest Nato fast jet which is going to be the core of alliance air power for the next 30 years. There is no compromise to be had there.\u201d All this may make Erdo\u011fan an increasingly high-risk defence partner for the UK. Ankara\u2019s warning this week that it may send troops to Libya, if requested by the Tripoli-based UN-recognised Government of National Accord, will not be welcome to the Foreign Office as it tries to lessen outside interference in the country. The GNA since April has been fighting the United Arab Emirates-backed Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Haftar. A report by UN experts this week revealed wholesale breaches of the arms embargo by Turkey, Jordan and the UAE. It also accused an unnamed member state \u2013 believed to be the UAE \u2013 of a serious breach of international humanitarian law by bombing the Tajoura detention centre in the summer, an incident that killed up to 50 people. In recent weeks the military scales have tipped in Haftar\u2019s favour due to the support of 200 or so Russian mercenaries. Erdo\u011fan says he plans to speak to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone this week to argue that the Kremlin\u2019s support for Haftar is undermining the chances of Libya finding a path to democracy.",

I\u2019m not posting a link here as it is my firm conviction that if you aren\u2019t already aware of these things, you\u2019re probably best off not bothering. Because what the postcode sites will tell you is one of three things:</p> <p> You may be in a safe seat where tactical voting will not make any difference. In which case, vote for your favourite party, as it has a slight benefit in terms of the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/financial-information/financial-assistance-to-opposition-parties/\" title=\"\">short money</a> it will receive.</p> <p>Or it is really obvious which party you should tactically vote for, because everyone agrees on who\u2019s in second place.

The fact that they differ at all shows that there is normal statistical error in the forecasting process, and it is likely that as a well-informed voter of reasonable intelligence and diligence, you can outperform them by making use of information that isn\u2019t assembled in a numerical dataset.</p> <p>More importantly than that, tactical voting is, fundamentally, a coordination problem, not a forecasting problem. What the tactical voters want to do is maximise the chance that they all pick the same candidate. Knowing which candidate is currently likely to be in second place is an important piece of information to solve that problem, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all, particularly in cases (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\" title=\"\">such as Kensington</a>), where the margin of forecasting error is large compared to the gaps between parties.</p> <p>So you may use the postcode sites as one piece of information. But you must also consider these things:</p> <p><strong>1. You need a very good reason to vote against a sitting non-Tory MP</strong>. The fact that someone is the incumbent MP means that there is proof they can win; you don\u2019t have to worry so much about the willingness of other people to vote tactically for them. And they are easier to coordinate on because they have greater name recognition.</p> <p><strong>2. If you have really good local knowledge, use it</strong>. If there\u2019s a special factor in your constituency which means that polling data or extrapolations from national swings might not be reliable, use that to decide close calls. This might be a smart thing to do in the half-dozen London constituencies where the Jewish electorate is large compared to the usual margin of victory. If there are a lot of other people who will not vote Labour no matter what, the tactical thing to do is join them.</p> <p><strong>3. Pay attention to the ground game</strong>. The number of votes that are likely to be swayed by tactical voting is small. It is likely to be unusually large in this election but, according to surveys, we are <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/10/whos-tactically-voting-and-why\" title=\"\">still talking about</a> just under 20% of Labour voters and 36% of Lib Dem voters. And many of these people will be doing so in constituencies where it is obvious what to do; in close and difficult races, the \u201ceffective tactical margin\u201d will be reduced by people voting tactically the wrong way.

The location of Portrait of a Lady, one of the world\u2019s most sought-after missing artworks, has been a mystery since it was stolen in 1997. On Tuesday, a gardener clearing up ivy on an exterior wall of the Ricci Oddi modern art gallery, in the northern city of Piacenza, discovered a metal panel which, when opened, revealed a cavity with a painting in a bag. The gallery is not making an official announcement until the painting\u2019s authenticity is confirmed, but according to sources quoted by the local newspaper, Piacenza Sera, an initial expert inspection indicated the painting was the 1917 Klimt, a later work by the Austrian art nouveau painter. The director of the gallery, Massimo Ferrari, told the Italian newspaper La Libert\u00e0 that \u201cthe stamps and wax behind the picture are original\u201d. Jonathan Papamerenghi, a member of the Piacenza council with responsibility for culture, did not exclude the possibility that the painting had been left in the wall by thieves who wanted to return it. \u201cIt is very strange, because, immediately after the theft, every single inch of the gallery and garden was checked with a fine-tooth comb,\u201d he told La Repubblica. \u201cThe strangest thing is that the painting is in excellent condition.

      "body": "<h2>Editorial: the spread of barbarism</h2> <p>13 December 1939</p> <p>If anybody wants to measure the effects of the rise and influence of the totalitarian philosophies of the State on the brutalisation of life, he has only to study the newspaper for a single day and then ask himself how the events there recorded would have struck a reader in the days before the Communist, Nazi, and Fascist systems had swept over Europe. A great surface of the Continent was then under the rule of authoritarian Governments, and liberals all looked forward to the day when those Governments would be changed into something better. He could never have imagined the plight into which Europe has fallen. Take only the events recorded in the last few days.</p> <p>In Finland the Government that has succeeded the Tsar\u2019s Government is engaged in a wanton invasion, and it refuses the services of the International Red Cross on the cynical pretext that its violence is not war. In Poland the scientific laboratory of one university has been dismantled and the professors of another sent to a concentration camp by a Government whose predecessor was proud of its services to science. A Jewish prison State is being set up of which a visitor to Germany so unprejudiced as Mr <a href=\"https://spartacus-educational.com/USAvillard.htm\">Villard</a> has said that the treatment the Jews are receiving there would be condemned in any civilised country if it were applied not to human beings but to dogs or cattle. Children are taken as hostages for the docility of their parents. Populations are moved here and there at the pleasure of a single man; famine is wantonly created and spread.</p> <p>All the barbarities that have disfigured man\u2019s record in war are multiplied and organised as a system of civil life. What is terrifying in this spectacle is that it is not the result of war or of some passing emergency. It is the result of armed doctrine. Once societies succumb to the doctrine that man has no rights against the State this collapse of civilised standards is inevitable. The doctrine that Hitler preaches, that cruelty is the truest kindness, must of necessity turn the world back to barbarism, and to a barbarism infinitely worse than the barbarism of the ages when, in Hobbes\u2019s well-known description, man\u2019s life was nasty, brutish, and short.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01c365c9412344463637f42102bd1f0fef437097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c365c9412344463637f42102bd1f0fef437097/0_149_2893_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German troops parade in front of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Generals after entry into Warsaw, 5 October 1939.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German troops parade in front of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Generals after entry into Warsaw, 5 October 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Editorial: towards reconstruction</h2> <p>18 December 1939</p> <blockquote> <p>Ought we not to make a real partnership for this great common adventure of the war, and even think of prolonging it after the war, so that it might be the starting-point for the reconstruction that is eagerly expected by Europe? It is this solution, thought by some to be impossible, which we have adopted.</p> <p>\u2013<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reynaud\">M. Reynaud</a> in the Chamber of Deputies, 13 December 1939.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The more post-war history is studied the clearer does it become that the fatal mistake made at Paris in 1919 was the failure to grasp what was happening to Europe. Famine, which had been banished from the horizon, had returned to madden and terrify great populations; disease had attacked people after people and despair had settled on their spirit. It was because the peacemakers did not realise that their first business was to restore this afflicted Europe that the peace settlement has such a disastrous history.</p> <p>It is clear that vigorous economic co-operation will be essential after the war if any new peace is to have a tolerable chance. For this reason M. Reynaud\u2019s eloquent speech last Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies is an event of capital importance. It shows that this truth has been grasped by a French statesman who has the gift of leadership and is widely respected for his integrity, and courage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/second-world-war-phoney-london\">The second world war's 'phoney' beginning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a striking article in the Figaro last week M. <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladimir_d%27Ormesson\">Wladimir d\u2019Ormesson</a> presses the same view. He puts it that we have to find a way of turning the millions spent on armaments to the improvement of social conditions in Europe. This is the task that defeated us twenty years ago. It is the task not merely of making peace but of healing a sick Europe. At that time there were a number of inter-Allied bodies which might have given invaluable help in peacemaking and reconstruction. Mr Wickham Steed held rightly that they should be used as a nucleus for a working League of Nations. Unhappily President Wilson extinguished all such plans by withdrawing the American representatives from those bodies.</p> <p>To-day one of the most distinguished of the members of that inter-Allied service, M. Jean Monet, is the chairman of the Anglo-French co-ordinating committee, and the arrangements for financial and economic co-operation between the two countries go far beyond anything that was attempted in the last war. This is an excellent beginning, for if any scheme is ever to succeed in Europe it must start from the Western allies. But it is only a beginning, and certain things are essential to success. The Cabinet must be strengthened by the appointment of an Economic Minister; the economic conditions of the two countries must be thoroughly explored by experts; the full use must be made of the contacts established between the trade union movements of the two countries; and public opinion in both countries must be prepared for revolutionary changes. For we have in view an association that is not merely to serve the needs of the war but to become part of the life of the two peoples.

It is of this that historians are thinking when they draw their disturbing contrast between the two. France was treated with great generosity in 1815, whereas the defeated peoples in 1919 were harshly used. The reason for the indulgence shown to France is not obscure. The statesmen who made the Peace were afraid of the return of Napoleon or the rise of a successor, and they were therefore anxious to give the restored Bourbon house a good chance of keeping its throne. Moreover, France was represented by one of the greatest diplomatists of all history, and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Maurice-de-Talleyrand-prince-de-Benevent\">Talleyrand </a>by his skill obtained a great influence over Castlereagh and Wellington.</p> <p>The Allies should have seen in 1919 what the Allies had seen in 1814, that they had a special reason for treating the defeated Powers with consideration. For in the war they had distinguished between the old Government and the German people. If that distinction had been kept in mind when the Peace was made better terms would have been given to the enemy Powers because the old Governments had been dispossessed. But unhappily Germany had no Talleyrand in 1918, and the British people had felt the burden of a war of four years much more than their great-grandfathers had felt that of a war of twenty. In this atmosphere the desire for unlimited reparations drove out all generosity and wisdom, and the Allied statesmen at Paris made the mistake that Castlereagh and Wellington had avoided.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5b429706516e0504bdc03a82a34b63ca423908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5b429706516e0504bdc03a82a34b63ca423908/0_153_742_444/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 27 December 1939.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 27 December 1939. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/12/11/27_Dec_1939_editorial.jpg\">Read the article in full. </a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Editorial: the spread of barbarism 13 December 1939 If anybody wants to measure the effects of the rise and influence of the totalitarian philosophies of the State on the brutalisation of life, he has only to study the newspaper for a single day and then ask himself how the events there recorded would have struck a reader in the days before the Communist, Nazi, and Fascist systems had swept over Europe. A great surface of the Continent was then under the rule of authoritarian Governments, and liberals all looked forward to the day when those Governments would be changed into something better. He could never have imagined the plight into which Europe has fallen. Take only the events recorded in the last few days. In Finland the Government that has succeeded the Tsar\u2019s Government is engaged in a wanton invasion, and it refuses the services of the International Red Cross on the cynical pretext that its violence is not war. In Poland the scientific laboratory of one university has been dismantled and the professors of another sent to a concentration camp by a Government whose predecessor was proud of its services to science. A Jewish prison State is being set up of which a visitor to Germany so unprejudiced as Mr Villard has said that the treatment the Jews are receiving there would be condemned in any civilised country if it were applied not to human beings but to dogs or cattle. Children are taken as hostages for the docility of their parents. Populations are moved here and there at the pleasure of a single man; famine is wantonly created and spread. All the barbarities that have disfigured man\u2019s record in war are multiplied and organised as a system of civil life. What is terrifying in this spectacle is that it is not the result of war or of some passing emergency. It is the result of armed doctrine. Once societies succumb to the doctrine that man has no rights against the State this collapse of civilised standards is inevitable. The doctrine that Hitler preaches, that cruelty is the truest kindness, must of necessity turn the world back to barbarism, and to a barbarism infinitely worse than the barbarism of the ages when, in Hobbes\u2019s well-known description, man\u2019s life was nasty, brutish, and short. Editorial: towards reconstruction 18 December 1939 Ought we not to make a real partnership for this great common adventure of the war, and even think of prolonging it after the war, so that it might be the starting-point for the reconstruction that is eagerly expected by Europe? It is this solution, thought by some to be impossible, which we have adopted. \u2013 M. Reynaud in the Chamber of Deputies, 13 December 1939. The more post-war history is studied the clearer does it become that the fatal mistake made at Paris in 1919 was the failure to grasp what was happening to Europe. Famine, which had been banished from the horizon, had returned to madden and terrify great populations; disease had attacked people after people and despair had settled on their spirit. It was because the peacemakers did not realise that their first business was to restore this afflicted Europe that the peace settlement has such a disastrous history. It is clear that vigorous economic co-operation will be essential after the war if any new peace is to have a tolerable chance. For this reason M. Reynaud\u2019s eloquent speech last Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies is an event of capital importance. It shows that this truth has been grasped by a French statesman who has the gift of leadership and is widely respected for his integrity, and courage. In a striking article in the Figaro last week M. Wladimir d\u2019Ormesson presses the same view. He puts it that we have to find a way of turning the millions spent on armaments to the improvement of social conditions in Europe. This is the task that defeated us twenty years ago. It is the task not merely of making peace but of healing a sick Europe. At that time there were a number of inter-Allied bodies which might have given invaluable help in peacemaking and reconstruction. Mr Wickham Steed held rightly that they should be used as a nucleus for a working League of Nations. Unhappily President Wilson extinguished all such plans by withdrawing the American representatives from those bodies. To-day one of the most distinguished of the members of that inter-Allied service, M. Jean Monet, is the chairman of the Anglo-French co-ordinating committee, and the arrangements for financial and economic co-operation between the two countries go far beyond anything that was attempted in the last war. This is an excellent beginning, for if any scheme is ever to succeed in Europe it must start from the Western allies. But it is only a beginning, and certain things are essential to success. The Cabinet must be strengthened by the appointment of an Economic Minister; the economic conditions of the two countries must be thoroughly explored by experts; the full use must be made of the contacts established between the trade union movements of the two countries; and public opinion in both countries must be prepared for revolutionary changes. For we have in view an association that is not merely to serve the needs of the war but to become part of the life of the two peoples. If we fail in that, the task that defeated us twenty years ago will defeat us again. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full.

      "body": "<p>As the election draws to its frenetic close, the country is faced with a stark choice. The current favourite to be prime minister is a man who lied to the Queen, lied to the country and has repeatedly lied to you during this campaign. A man who refused to look at a photo of a child <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\" title=\"\">forced to sleep on the floor</a> of an A&amp;E unit, instead grabbing the journalist\u2019s phone and pocketing it to try to avoid the reality of what his party has done to the NHS.</p> \n<p>And that is before we get into the contempt he has shown to people whose job it is to hold him to account. Boris Johnson is a man who treats media scrutiny like most of us treat a trip to the dentist.</p> \n<p>That is the man who could be our prime minister on Friday morning. But there is still time to stop it and keep open the option of stopping Brexit. Because make no mistake, if Johnson gets a majority then he will use that as a mandate to push through his Brexit deal. But like so many other things in this election, even that deal is a facade. The Conservatives have admitted that they will continue planning for a no-deal Brexit because that is what we face at the end of 2020 if we can\u2019t negotiate a trade deal in record time.</p> \n<p>In so many seats around the country, it is the Liberal Democrats who are best placed to make sure that the Conservatives don\u2019t win. Our broken voting system means that tactical voting has always been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/tactical-voting-across-the-uk-a-region-by-region-guide\" title=\"\">part of the calculation</a> people make on polling day, and I know from travelling around the country that there are thousands of people who are voting Liberal Democrat this time because that is the best way to stop the Conservatives winning a majority.</p> \n<p>During this campaign, I\u2019ve never shied away from scrutiny. I\u2019ve done every one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/tories-left-on-ice-in-tv-debate-as-leaders-vie-for-climate-credentials\" title=\"\">leaders\u2019 debates</a>, interviews with all the broadcasters, the infamous Andrew Neil interview that the PM dodged and multiple phone-ins with members of the public. And in many of those, I\u2019ve been asked about our record in government. And I\u2019m always happy to answer questions about that. It might not be fashionable in our modern era of fake news and dodging scrutiny, but it is the job of politicians to face up to criticism and reflect on it. I won\u2019t ever shy away from answering the tough questions people want to ask, because that is part of my job as a political leader, even if Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn think that answering for their actions is beneath them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c58d76c1-e358-4a48-b31b-dd3c65ac2302\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kl4MPY1u2X8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I will always be incredibly proud of so many things we delivered in coalition. Cutting taxes for the lowest paid, introducing same-sex marriage and putting more money into our school system to support the poorest pupils. Stepping in at a time of national chaos and providing five years of stable government is a decision that was right for the country, even if it ended up costing the Liberal Democrats politically.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt we made mistakes in coalition, and I\u2019ve been open about that. Whether on the bedroom tax or tuition fees, there were battles that we did not win, and I wish every day that we had won more of them because I know the effect that losing those battles had on people\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>But if you want to end austerity and tackle the injustices that our society faces, then putting Boris Johnson into Downing Street is not the way to do it. Brexit will be austerity on stilts, damaging our economy and our job prospects as we cut ourselves off from our closest trading partner. It will starve our NHS of cash and make it harder to invest in our schools. </p> \n<p>It is why so many leading business figures are backing the Liberal Democrat plan for a brighter future, as they know the best economic future for our country is one where we remain in the EU and enjoy all the benefits that brings.</p> \n<p>Tomorrow we face a choice about the future of our country. Boris Johnson wants to pursue a path that will damage our economy, make us weaker on the world stage and undermine our vital public services. But your vote can stop him doing that. Your vote can deprive Boris Johnson of a majority, and keep open the option of stopping Brexit and building a brighter future that the Liberal Democrats offer.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jo Swinson is leader of the Liberal Democrats</p>",

Boris Johnson is a man who treats media scrutiny like most of us treat a trip to the dentist. That is the man who could be our prime minister on Friday morning. But there is still time to stop it and keep open the option of stopping Brexit. Because make no mistake, if Johnson gets a majority then he will use that as a mandate to push through his Brexit deal. But like so many other things in this election, even that deal is a facade. The Conservatives have admitted that they will continue planning for a no-deal Brexit because that is what we face at the end of 2020 if we can\u2019t negotiate a trade deal in record time. In so many seats around the country, it is the Liberal Democrats who are best placed to make sure that the Conservatives don\u2019t win. Our broken voting system means that tactical voting has always been part of the calculation people make on polling day, and I know from travelling around the country that there are thousands of people who are voting Liberal Democrat this time because that is the best way to stop the Conservatives winning a majority. During this campaign, I\u2019ve never shied away from scrutiny. I\u2019ve done every one of the leaders\u2019 debates, interviews with all the broadcasters, the infamous Andrew Neil interview that the PM dodged and multiple phone-ins with members of the public. And in many of those, I\u2019ve been asked about our record in government. And I\u2019m always happy to answer questions about that. It might not be fashionable in our modern era of fake news and dodging scrutiny, but it is the job of politicians to face up to criticism and reflect on it. I won\u2019t ever shy away from answering the tough questions people want to ask, because that is part of my job as a political leader, even if Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn think that answering for their actions is beneath them. I will always be incredibly proud of so many things we delivered in coalition. Cutting taxes for the lowest paid, introducing same-sex marriage and putting more money into our school system to support the poorest pupils. Stepping in at a time of national chaos and providing five years of stable government is a decision that was right for the country, even if it ended up costing the Liberal Democrats politically. There is no doubt we made mistakes in coalition, and I\u2019ve been open about that. Whether on the bedroom tax or tuition fees, there were battles that we did not win, and I wish every day that we had won more of them because I know the effect that losing those battles had on people\u2019s lives. But if you want to end austerity and tackle the injustices that our society faces, then putting Boris Johnson into Downing Street is not the way to do it. Brexit will be austerity on stilts, damaging our economy and our job prospects as we cut ourselves off from our closest trading partner. It will starve our NHS of cash and make it harder to invest in our schools. It is why so many leading business figures are backing the Liberal Democrat plan for a brighter future, as they know the best economic future for our country is one where we remain in the EU and enjoy all the benefits that brings. Tomorrow we face a choice about the future of our country. Boris Johnson wants to pursue a path that will damage our economy, make us weaker on the world stage and undermine our vital public services. But your vote can stop him doing that. Your vote can deprive Boris Johnson of a majority, and keep open the option of stopping Brexit and building a brighter future that the Liberal Democrats offer. \u2022 Jo Swinson is leader of the Liberal Democrats",

      "body": "<p>Old Trafford is one of football\u2019s most vibrant amphitheatres. During the 109-year history of Manchester United\u2019s home, Billy Meredith, George Best, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo are a few of the greats to grace the stage of England\u2019s record title winners<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Yet the venue has become tired and worn. When the Manchester rain poured hard last season the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand leaked. The seating is crammed and wifi patchy. The directors\u2019 box has an antiquated feel and the bars and suites a faded glamour. A venue that hosted 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 matches has not staged a showpiece game since the 2003 European Cup final.</p> <p>For the team left trailing since Sir Alex Ferguson retired the state of their home is an obvious emblem. Old Trafford is no sleek, 21st-century facility like Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium, opened in 2006, or the new Wembley (2007), and is further behind cutting-edge venues such as Los Angeles FC\u2019s Banc of California Stadium (April 2018) or Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (April 2019) \u2013 two bespoke builds that move spectator experience into the 2020s.</p> <p>Since the Glazers\u2019 takeover in 2005 there has been no notable modernisation of Old Trafford, the increased capacity to 75,000 via the quadrants built in 2006 having been greenlit before the American family became the proprietors.</p> <p>Like the team that once glittered, Old Trafford was formerly the domestic game\u2019s jewel. As Simon Inglis, author of Football Grounds of Britain, says: \u201cThe club were market leaders. You take it back to the 1960s, they were the first really to introduce executive boxes; to build cantilevered stands on a large scale - in \u201865, \u201866. They were the first, really, to have a master plan for the development of the stadium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f7c9f46f6db5d1f6554af38c3f02b41a94cd054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f7c9f46f6db5d1f6554af38c3f02b41a94cd054/0_229_4989_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new cantilever stand under construction in August 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new cantilever stand under construction in August 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry Mealy/Mirrorpix via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The new cantilever stand under construction in August 1965.

You could say there was a tipping point where they had more people employed on the commercial side than they did on the playing side. They had a hotel in \u201895. They had the museum in \u201898. They had stadium tours. They had a credit card. They introduced a radio station, a TV station. They were pioneers.\u201d</p> <p>All this occurred when Louis Edwards, from 1965-1980, then his son Martin (1980-1991), were majority owners, and when United subsequently became a PLC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/glazers-legacy-manchester-united-liverpool\">Debt \u00a3511m but dividends galore: the Glazers\u2019 legacy at Manchester United | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In January 1995 United\u2019s future owner, Malcolm Glazer, bought the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the following year began construction of the Raymond James Stadium. The NFL franchise\u2019s venue opened in 1998 and was funded by $192m of public money, as is common in American sports.</p> <p>Ira Kaufman, who began reporting on the Bucs in 1985, is a former Tampa Tribune reporter and now JoeBucsFan.com columnist. \u201cIt was imperative once the franchise was bought to get a new stadium,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople thought they were crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Malcolm Glazer died in 2014 to leave United \u2013 and the Bucs \u2013 in the control of his six children. Kaufmann says: \u201cI believe they put around $140m in to the Ray-Jay during the last year or two. In terms of renovation they went to the club level, which is premium. They also built an indoor facility, including air conditioning for fans.\u201d</p> <p>According to Kaufmann the Glazers take their cue from supporters, which may interest the constituency of United followers who feel disenfranchised.</p> <p>\u201cThey do put a lot of stock in fan surveys and feedback,\u201d he says. \u201cThey read those things carefully and try to address issues. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing the same thing at Old Trafford but they consider the place like a Fenway Park [Boston Red Sox\u2019s home] \u2013 an iconic venue that you don\u2019t want to mess with too much.</p> <p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re getting a strong message from the fan base that upgrades are needed, they\u2019re going to be reticent.\u201d</p> <p>United do survey match-going supporterson an ad hoc basis and the quarterly fans\u2019 forum, chaired by their chief operating officer, Collette Roche, and attended by the managing director, Richard Arnold, also allows feedback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdc3c8a09318e65e0744c4666eccf475129321be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdc3c8a09318e65e0744c4666eccf475129321be/0_0_6618_4464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans outside Old Trafford by the souvenir shop in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans outside Old Trafford by the souvenir shop in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"232cf4b0c268a7911b328af50ea564b1e5f8e949\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232cf4b0c268a7911b328af50ea564b1e5f8e949/0_90_2900_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Manchester United megastore in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Manchester United megastore in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Simpson/Empics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Fans outside Old Trafford by the souvenir shop in 1972 and the Manchester United megastore in 1996.

There\u2019s been no major development since the quadrants were built in 2006. The subsequent investment has been limited to mandatory \u2013 but still welcome \u2013 expansion of disabled facilities and corporate hospitality. Old Trafford is still the biggest in the Premier League but it\u2019s now far from the best \u2013 the facilities are limited and outdated.\u201d</p> <p>Barney Chilton, of Red News fanzine, says: \u201cOld Trafford carries memories, history. And a soul. The key is what the crowd in the near future might want \u2013 and a younger audience will want what others provide elsewhere \u2026 I remain convinced that under different owners we\u2019d have seen Old Trafford remain at the forefront of design and upgrades. We have had token work done on it, and doesn\u2019t it show? The leaking roof is a fitting analogy for the recent United.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stadium was the vision of United\u2019s majority shareholder John Henry Davies and designed by Archibald Leitch, who was responsible for around 40 builds, including Ibrox, Anfield and Craven Cottage.</p> <p>Although cost reduced capacity from the planned 100,000 to 80,000, when United welcomed Liverpool on 19 February 1910 for Old Trafford\u2019s inaugural match the venue was ultra-modern with scope for upgrades. \u201cIt was unusual in the sense that it was a very large wide-open site which was ripe for expansion,\u201d says Inglis.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later a first major refurb included adding a roof to what is now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, opposite the covered South Stand (now Sir Bobby Charlton). During the second world war the site was bombed, first in 1940, then a year later when it was all but destroyed. United had to play at Manchester City\u2019s Maine Road and went into debt, yet this would presage the venue\u2019s second phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4bed4c28a54bf298a833473550d35f032507757a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bed4c28a54bf298a833473550d35f032507757a/0_0_3246_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A general view of the action in the match between Manchester United and Liverpool, the first played at Old Trafford, in February 1910.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A general view of the action in the match between Manchester United and Liverpool, the first played at Old Trafford, in February 1910.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester United via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"271ea16199d9b4de4aefb68c0fec96681cbf2fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/271ea16199d9b4de4aefb68c0fec96681cbf2fd7/0_169_3855_2311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bomb-damaged Old Trafford, pictured shortly after the second world war in September 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bomb-damaged Old Trafford, pictured shortly after the second world war in September 1945</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"31dde216a0eb126b6904e4e4e6664b4f53300b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31dde216a0eb126b6904e4e4e6664b4f53300b25/0_96_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking down on the new uncovered stand which replaces for the present the covered stand destroyed during the blitz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking down on the new uncovered stand which temporarily replaced the covered stand destroyed during the blitz as Manchester United returned to Old Trafford in August 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bert Abell/Mirrorpix via Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903d6dbda291910ac4f91f147215287c81b4fd2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903d6dbda291910ac4f91f147215287c81b4fd2b/0_21_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea goalkeeper Petar Borota lines up his defensive wall at Old Trafford in May 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea goalkeeper Petar Borota lines up his defensive wall at Old Trafford in May 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Hastings/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f98ca5502b11451bf666cfcf2c1fb394b3676021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f98ca5502b11451bf666cfcf2c1fb394b3676021/0_247_4846_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A general view of the Stretford End during the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Bayern M\u00fcnich at Old Trafford in April 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A general view of the Stretford End during the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Bayern M\u00fcnich at Old Trafford in April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The first game at Old Trafford in February 1910, bomb damage in September 1945; Looking down, in August 1949, on the new uncovered stand which temporarily replaced the covered stand destroyed during the blitz, Chelsea goalkeeper Petar Borota lines up his defensive wall at Old Trafford in May 1979 and a view of the Stretford End in April 2014.

Inglis says: \u201cUnited\u2019s approach was founded on the philosophy of the architect in the 1960s, Ernest Atherden. He said there was no point in spending money on things like fancy rooms and glossy architecture. What the club needed was seats or standing room; that raising the capacity was the name of the game.</p> <p>\u201cManchester United in the 1960s took the decision to build narrow seat treads. The standard in the 60s had been 2ft 3in. United chopped an inch off that and it equates to 660mm. Now if you are anything over about 5ft 7in or 5ft 8in, you will really notice it.</p> <p>\u201cBy the mid-1990s most clubs were building to 720mm, about 2ft 6in. It\u2019s only another couple of inches but it makes a huge difference, not just in terms of how tall you are, but if somebody\u2019s coming from the megastore with merchandise or if you\u2019ve got kids and they need to get to the toilet, you need to move in and out: those extra few inches make a huge difference in terms of comfort levels.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of Old Trafford\u2019s lower bowl is indeed 660mm, while in the second tier of quadrants the measurement is 710mm. Inglis says: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that it varies in modern stands [now] between about 760 to about 800mm. There are parts of Wembley where I think it goes to 850.\u201d</p> <p>United point out that seating measurements comply with the Green Guide, the government-approved safety book. Yet Inglis states that adhering to the minimum affects match-day experience.</p> <p>\u201cIt means that you could build cheaper and taller and higher \u2013 effectively more for your money. Any Manchester United supporter sitting at Wembley or at the new Tottenham Stadium and the Emirates Stadium will be aware that it\u2019s roomier. Then you start going into the toilets, you look into the concourse areas, and the standard of finish.</p> <p>\u201cManchester United were advised that what they were doing was not progressive, that they were going to encounter problems with it.\u201d</p> <p>Progressive is an apt characterisation of the vision of Tottenham and LAFC. \u201cWe are definitely in a sea change if you talk about generations of stadiums,\u201d says Christopher Lee, project director for Populous, which designed Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \u201cProbably the biggest shift, and Tottenham\u2019s a great example of that, is this idea that these buildings are more civic than they were in the past. Clubs have such importance in our local communities \u2013 a sort of cultural relevance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c95c67bff9d17f5e653879920fa7210eab08de83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95c67bff9d17f5e653879920fa7210eab08de83/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tottenham Hotspur fans display a mosaic before the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Manchester City at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tottenham Hotspur fans display a mosaic before the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Manchester City at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Spurs fans display a mosaic ahead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April 2019.

As Kaufmann states, the<strong> </strong>Glazers like to think their policy is one of retaining the stadium\u2019s heritage via rejuvenation and regeneration, and the owners say \u00a3100m has been invested in the last decade, including \u00a320m in 2019. Of this latter sum, \u00a311m was for improvements to accessible facilities, \u00a34m on security and \u00a34m on refurbishing hospitality locales.</p> <p>Collette Roche, Manchester United\u2019s chief operating officer, tells the Guardian: \u201cOur investment plan for the stadium has to maintain all that makes Old Trafford special. We want to evolve and develop while keeping its allure. We have invested over \u00a320m into the stadium this year and we are working hard with our supporters to build the atmosphere and to continue to ensure that live football at Old Trafford is accessible and affordable.\u201d</p> <p>There are no plans to increase the capacity of the stadium, where the railway line on its south side brings limitations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c2b7056eae0fa874ba376c07e0ea4b0b5a705621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2b7056eae0fa874ba376c07e0ea4b0b5a705621/0_0_2283_1807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of Old Trafford, showing the surrounding houses, railway tracks and factory units during the 1930s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of Old Trafford, showing the surrounding houses, railway tracks and factory units during the 1930s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas/Popperfoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"73a3f8209407eabf7a052bf79c03a84aeb54eb44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a3f8209407eabf7a052bf79c03a84aeb54eb44/0_0_4096_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Old Trafford, home to Manchester United in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Old Trafford, home to Manchester United in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d2a5b7635ef02d919ea0047bcb25da7c9da7166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d2a5b7635ef02d919ea0047bcb25da7c9da7166/757_318_3069_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Old Trafford in August 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Old Trafford in August 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emre Zengin/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Aerial views of Old Trafford in the 1930s, 1966 and 2017.

      "bodyText": "Old Trafford is one of football\u2019s most vibrant amphitheatres. During the 109-year history of Manchester United\u2019s home, Billy Meredith, George Best, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo are a few of the greats to grace the stage of England\u2019s record title winners. Yet the venue has become tired and worn. When the Manchester rain poured hard last season the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand leaked. The seating is crammed and wifi patchy. The directors\u2019 box has an antiquated feel and the bars and suites a faded glamour. A venue that hosted 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 matches has not staged a showpiece game since the 2003 European Cup final. For the team left trailing since Sir Alex Ferguson retired the state of their home is an obvious emblem. Old Trafford is no sleek, 21st-century facility like Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium, opened in 2006, or the new Wembley (2007), and is further behind cutting-edge venues such as Los Angeles FC\u2019s Banc of California Stadium (April 2018) or Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (April 2019) \u2013 two bespoke builds that move spectator experience into the 2020s. Since the Glazers\u2019 takeover in 2005 there has been no notable modernisation of Old Trafford, the increased capacity to 75,000 via the quadrants built in 2006 having been greenlit before the American family became the proprietors. Like the team that once glittered, Old Trafford was formerly the domestic game\u2019s jewel. As Simon Inglis, author of Football Grounds of Britain, says: \u201cThe club were market leaders. You take it back to the 1960s, they were the first really to introduce executive boxes; to build cantilevered stands on a large scale - in \u201865, \u201866. They were the first, really, to have a master plan for the development of the stadium. The new cantilever stand under construction in August 1965. Photograph: Terry Mealy/Mirrorpix via Getty Images \u201cIn the 90s, it\u2019s a long list, but you think of the megastore \u2013 the idea of having the club supermarket selling merchandise. You could say there was a tipping point where they had more people employed on the commercial side than they did on the playing side. They had a hotel in \u201895. They had the museum in \u201898. They had stadium tours. They had a credit card. They introduced a radio station, a TV station. They were pioneers.\u201d All this occurred when Louis Edwards, from 1965-1980, then his son Martin (1980-1991), were majority owners, and when United subsequently became a PLC. In January 1995 United\u2019s future owner, Malcolm Glazer, bought the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the following year began construction of the Raymond James Stadium. The NFL franchise\u2019s venue opened in 1998 and was funded by $192m of public money, as is common in American sports. Ira Kaufman, who began reporting on the Bucs in 1985, is a former Tampa Tribune reporter and now JoeBucsFan.com columnist. \u201cIt was imperative once the franchise was bought to get a new stadium,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople thought they were crazy.\u201d Malcolm Glazer died in 2014 to leave United \u2013 and the Bucs \u2013 in the control of his six children. Kaufmann says: \u201cI believe they put around $140m in to the Ray-Jay during the last year or two. In terms of renovation they went to the club level, which is premium. They also built an indoor facility, including air conditioning for fans.\u201d According to Kaufmann the Glazers take their cue from supporters, which may interest the constituency of United followers who feel disenfranchised. \u201cThey do put a lot of stock in fan surveys and feedback,\u201d he says. \u201cThey read those things carefully and try to address issues. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing the same thing at Old Trafford but they consider the place like a Fenway Park [Boston Red Sox\u2019s home] \u2013 an iconic venue that you don\u2019t want to mess with too much. \u201cUnless they\u2019re getting a strong message from the fan base that upgrades are needed, they\u2019re going to be reticent.\u201d United do survey match-going supporterson an ad hoc basis and the quarterly fans\u2019 forum, chaired by their chief operating officer, Collette Roche, and attended by the managing director, Richard Arnold, also allows feedback. Fans outside Old Trafford by the souvenir shop in 1972 and the Manchester United megastore in 1996. Photographs: Colorsport/Shutterstock; Empics Sport Dave Pennington, the vice-chair of the Manchester United Supporters\u2019 Trust, says: \u201cSupporters have no faith in the owners committing the substantial long-term investment needed. There\u2019s been no major development since the quadrants were built in 2006. The subsequent investment has been limited to mandatory \u2013 but still welcome \u2013 expansion of disabled facilities and corporate hospitality. Old Trafford is still the biggest in the Premier League but it\u2019s now far from the best \u2013 the facilities are limited and outdated.\u201d Barney Chilton, of Red News fanzine, says: \u201cOld Trafford carries memories, history. And a soul. The key is what the crowd in the near future might want \u2013 and a younger audience will want what others provide elsewhere \u2026 I remain convinced that under different owners we\u2019d have seen Old Trafford remain at the forefront of design and upgrades. We have had token work done on it, and doesn\u2019t it show? The leaking roof is a fitting analogy for the recent United.\u201d The stadium was the vision of United\u2019s majority shareholder John Henry Davies and designed by Archibald Leitch, who was responsible for around 40 builds, including Ibrox, Anfield and Craven Cottage. Although cost reduced capacity from the planned 100,000 to 80,000, when United welcomed Liverpool on 19 February 1910 for Old Trafford\u2019s inaugural match the venue was ultra-modern with scope for upgrades. \u201cIt was unusual in the sense that it was a very large wide-open site which was ripe for expansion,\u201d says Inglis. Twenty-five years later a first major refurb included adding a roof to what is now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, opposite the covered South Stand (now Sir Bobby Charlton). During the second world war the site was bombed, first in 1940, then a year later when it was all but destroyed. United had to play at Manchester City\u2019s Maine Road and went into debt, yet this would presage the venue\u2019s second phase. The first game at Old Trafford in February 1910, bomb damage in September 1945; Looking down, in August 1949, on the new uncovered stand which temporarily replaced the covered stand destroyed during the blitz, Chelsea goalkeeper Petar Borota lines up his defensive wall at Old Trafford in May 1979 and a view of the Stretford End in April 2014. Photographs: Manchester United via Getty Images; Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images; Mirrorpix/Action Images; Chelsea FC via Getty Images; Offside/Getty Images The policy adopted then regarding seating remains. Inglis says: \u201cUnited\u2019s approach was founded on the philosophy of the architect in the 1960s, Ernest Atherden. He said there was no point in spending money on things like fancy rooms and glossy architecture. What the club needed was seats or standing room; that raising the capacity was the name of the game. \u201cManchester United in the 1960s took the decision to build narrow seat treads. The standard in the 60s had been 2ft 3in. United chopped an inch off that and it equates to 660mm. Now if you are anything over about 5ft 7in or 5ft 8in, you will really notice it. \u201cBy the mid-1990s most clubs were building to 720mm, about 2ft 6in. It\u2019s only another couple of inches but it makes a huge difference, not just in terms of how tall you are, but if somebody\u2019s coming from the megastore with merchandise or if you\u2019ve got kids and they need to get to the toilet, you need to move in and out: those extra few inches make a huge difference in terms of comfort levels.\u201d The majority of Old Trafford\u2019s lower bowl is indeed 660mm, while in the second tier of quadrants the measurement is 710mm. Inglis says: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that it varies in modern stands [now] between about 760 to about 800mm. There are parts of Wembley where I think it goes to 850.\u201d United point out that seating measurements comply with the Green Guide, the government-approved safety book. Yet Inglis states that adhering to the minimum affects match-day experience. \u201cIt means that you could build cheaper and taller and higher \u2013 effectively more for your money. Any Manchester United supporter sitting at Wembley or at the new Tottenham Stadium and the Emirates Stadium will be aware that it\u2019s roomier. Then you start going into the toilets, you look into the concourse areas, and the standard of finish. \u201cManchester United were advised that what they were doing was not progressive, that they were going to encounter problems with it.\u201d Progressive is an apt characterisation of the vision of Tottenham and LAFC. \u201cWe are definitely in a sea change if you talk about generations of stadiums,\u201d says Christopher Lee, project director for Populous, which designed Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \u201cProbably the biggest shift, and Tottenham\u2019s a great example of that, is this idea that these buildings are more civic than they were in the past. Clubs have such importance in our local communities \u2013 a sort of cultural relevance.\u201d The Spurs fans display a mosaic ahead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April 2019. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Old Trafford\u2019s location is in a largely industrial and retail area, with residential streets behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. As Kaufmann states, the Glazers like to think their policy is one of retaining the stadium\u2019s heritage via rejuvenation and regeneration, and the owners say \u00a3100m has been invested in the last decade, including \u00a320m in 2019. Of this latter sum, \u00a311m was for improvements to accessible facilities, \u00a34m on security and \u00a34m on refurbishing hospitality locales. Collette Roche, Manchester United\u2019s chief operating officer, tells the Guardian: \u201cOur investment plan for the stadium has to maintain all that makes Old Trafford special. We want to evolve and develop while keeping its allure. We have invested over \u00a320m into the stadium this year and we are working hard with our supporters to build the atmosphere and to continue to ensure that live football at Old Trafford is accessible and affordable.\u201d There are no plans to increase the capacity of the stadium, where the railway line on its south side brings limitations.

Around LAFC\u2019s stadium are electric vehicle charging facilities and bicycle parking spaces, with fan experience governing design. The United hierarchy have visited and were impressed. Tom Penn, an LAFC co-owner, says: \u201cThis is a really special experience here. That\u2019s been validated by executives from Man United, Man City, Barcelona and other European clubs. The hottest tickets in [US] professional sports are NBA courtside seats in basketball. We\u2019ve replicated that as we have what we call VIP bench seats that are adjacent to the player benches.\u201d These are 11ft away, have no barrier, and incorporate \u201cBunker Suites\u201d below with personal entrances. Across Manchester, City have upgraded the Etihad Stadium via the Tunnel Club which houses a high-class restaurant and bar and has the same innovation as at Tottenham: glass that allows sight of players walking from changing room to pitch. One of United\u2019s most recent innovations is the Seat of Dreams, a four-seat sofa that offers a free upgrade to randomly chosen fans and is sponsored by a hotel chain. The Glazers missed one commercial opportunity when the Class of \u201892 built Hotel Football opposite Old Trafford. Ed Woodward admits more is required regarding updating the stadium. But whether this extends to a broader vision of Old Trafford as the centre of a cultural and community hub similar to that found at Spurs and LAFC is unclear.",

      "body": "<p>Although school prevents him from campaigning as much as he would like, Hasan Patel has been spending every weekend canvassing for Labour during the campaign.</p> <p>This week he\u2019s just finished his exams and is off door-knocking in Kensington, then Chingford and Woodford Green, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\">marginal seats</a> and high on Labour\u2019s list of priorities. At 16 years old, Patel can\u2019t vote himself, so he\u2019s keen to utilise his skills where they\u2019ll be of most use.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad really because there are millions of us who are actually politically engaged and want to make a difference, and obviously voting is one of the best ways that you can do that,\u201d says Hasan, who lives in Leyton, east London.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to sit back. I thought it was imperative to get involved and try and make a difference, even though I can\u2019t vote. I want to show others that if I can do it, so can they, especially if they\u2019re older than me.\u201d</p> <p>Like many young people, the climate crisis is Hasan\u2019s priority and something he says comes up a surprising amount on the doorstep. \u201cClimate is the main issue facing our generation and the whole of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s about relating it to ordinary lives \u2013 it\u2019s not just a vague thing that will affect us in the future. It\u2019s here right now and we have to do something.\u201d</p> <p>His feelings are shared by Cameron Palin, 17, who is the youth and student officer for the Isle of Wight Green party. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously my generation\u2019s future which this election going to affect the most, especially with Brexit and the climate crisis, and we don\u2019t have a say,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He\u2019s been door-knocking, leafleting and helping to organise events for the past few weeks, trying to persuade the island\u2019s mainly older population that the climate crisis is a crucial issue for his future. \u201cBut conveying that message in such a short general election with so many other issues is difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The climate crisis is a concern that unites young people across party and political divides. When 16-year-old Callum Childs tells his peers he backs Brexit, he is met with either laughter or incredulity. But when he mentions his worries about the environment, he finds his peers are on the same page: across the political spectrum, they agree there has not been enough focus on the climate emergency in this election.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us, whether left, right or centre, want to live in a world where we don\u2019t have any nature or wildlife,\u201d says Callum, a year 12 student living in the London borough of Bromley.</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Morgan Smith, who is studying for her GCSEs in Leicester, says of the climate crisis: \u201cI\u2019m angry more than anything else. I\u2019m angry that no one seems to be caring about it as much as they should be,\u201d</p> <p>She has been canvassing and leafleting for the Labour party, which she believes is the best option to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cNo one is doing enough and it scares me because so many people are going to be harmed by this, so many people are going to lose their lives about this.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan wants the party to do more to promote its green new deal and shift the debate away from Brexit. \u201cBorders aren\u2019t going to exist when we are all dead,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Others have turned to protests as a way of affecting an election that they can\u2019t vote in. Fern Jameson-Green, 17, who is part of XR Youth in Bristol, says: \u201cI think that young people see the future as out of their hands, so we\u2019re trying to take back that power and make decisions regarding the climate crisis, especially because it\u2019s something we will live through.\u201d</p> <p>She is encouraging older family members to prioritise climate issues when deciding who to vote for. \u201cI am going to be doing as much as I can to make sure that my voice is heard through my family, and to try and educate them on what I know about politics and the climate,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Cameron admits he is sometimes not taken seriously because of his age. \u201cYou obviously get some people saying: \u2018You\u2019re too young to understand, you can\u2019t vote, 16- and 17-year-olds aren\u2019t informed.\u2019 I understand why they say that, but many of us are as informed as people who are 40 years old.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that it\u2019s our future and so much needs to happen in such little time. We just have to make these bold steps.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan finds that people on the doorstep have become increasingly used to the presence of young activists. \u201cFor the past few decades, young people just haven\u2019t been involved. But I think, especially with Jeremy Corbyn as a leader and his message that there is a better way to do things, that\u2019s inspired lots of young people.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the canvassing sessions I\u2019ve been to have been overwhelmingly young people. It\u2019s really heartwarming to see.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Although school prevents him from campaigning as much as he would like, Hasan Patel has been spending every weekend canvassing for Labour during the campaign. This week he\u2019s just finished his exams and is off door-knocking in Kensington, then Chingford and Woodford Green, both marginal seats and high on Labour\u2019s list of priorities. At 16 years old, Patel can\u2019t vote himself, so he\u2019s keen to utilise his skills where they\u2019ll be of most use. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sad really because there are millions of us who are actually politically engaged and want to make a difference, and obviously voting is one of the best ways that you can do that,\u201d says Hasan, who lives in Leyton, east London. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to sit back. I thought it was imperative to get involved and try and make a difference, even though I can\u2019t vote. I want to show others that if I can do it, so can they, especially if they\u2019re older than me.\u201d Like many young people, the climate crisis is Hasan\u2019s priority and something he says comes up a surprising amount on the doorstep. \u201cClimate is the main issue facing our generation and the whole of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s about relating it to ordinary lives \u2013 it\u2019s not just a vague thing that will affect us in the future. It\u2019s here right now and we have to do something.\u201d His feelings are shared by Cameron Palin, 17, who is the youth and student officer for the Isle of Wight Green party. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously my generation\u2019s future which this election going to affect the most, especially with Brexit and the climate crisis, and we don\u2019t have a say,\u201d he says. He\u2019s been door-knocking, leafleting and helping to organise events for the past few weeks, trying to persuade the island\u2019s mainly older population that the climate crisis is a crucial issue for his future. \u201cBut conveying that message in such a short general election with so many other issues is difficult.\u201d The climate crisis is a concern that unites young people across party and political divides. When 16-year-old Callum Childs tells his peers he backs Brexit, he is met with either laughter or incredulity. But when he mentions his worries about the environment, he finds his peers are on the same page: across the political spectrum, they agree there has not been enough focus on the climate emergency in this election. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us, whether left, right or centre, want to live in a world where we don\u2019t have any nature or wildlife,\u201d says Callum, a year 12 student living in the London borough of Bromley. Fifteen-year-old Morgan Smith, who is studying for her GCSEs in Leicester, says of the climate crisis: \u201cI\u2019m angry more than anything else. I\u2019m angry that no one seems to be caring about it as much as they should be,\u201d She has been canvassing and leafleting for the Labour party, which she believes is the best option to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cNo one is doing enough and it scares me because so many people are going to be harmed by this, so many people are going to lose their lives about this.\u201d Morgan wants the party to do more to promote its green new deal and shift the debate away from Brexit. \u201cBorders aren\u2019t going to exist when we are all dead,\u201d she says. Others have turned to protests as a way of affecting an election that they can\u2019t vote in. Fern Jameson-Green, 17, who is part of XR Youth in Bristol, says: \u201cI think that young people see the future as out of their hands, so we\u2019re trying to take back that power and make decisions regarding the climate crisis, especially because it\u2019s something we will live through.\u201d She is encouraging older family members to prioritise climate issues when deciding who to vote for. \u201cI am going to be doing as much as I can to make sure that my voice is heard through my family, and to try and educate them on what I know about politics and the climate,\u201d she says. Cameron admits he is sometimes not taken seriously because of his age. \u201cYou obviously get some people saying: \u2018You\u2019re too young to understand, you can\u2019t vote, 16- and 17-year-olds aren\u2019t informed.\u2019 I understand why they say that, but many of us are as informed as people who are 40 years old. \u201cWe understand that it\u2019s our future and so much needs to happen in such little time. We just have to make these bold steps.\u201d Hasan finds that people on the doorstep have become increasingly used to the presence of young activists. \u201cFor the past few decades, young people just haven\u2019t been involved. But I think, especially with Jeremy Corbyn as a leader and his message that there is a better way to do things, that\u2019s inspired lots of young people. \u201cMany of the canvassing sessions I\u2019ve been to have been overwhelmingly young people. It\u2019s really heartwarming to see.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The majority of young people who supported Labour in the last election are planning to do so again, but former Liberal Democrat and Conservative supporters are split over whether to remain loyal to the parties, a Guardian callout has shown. With almost a third of people who registered to vote in a pre-election surge being under 25, young voters could play critical role in this week\u2019s general election. More than 700 people between 18 and 24 responded to a Guardian callout about young voters. The issues of Brexit, the NHS and the climate crisis were key focal points. Many said they would like to back the Green party but feared their vote would be wasted. Most of those who voted Labour in 2017 said they planned to do so again, with many saying Jeremy Corbyn offered a vision of meaningful change. \u201cCorbyn has been fighting on the people\u2019s side for longer than I\u2019ve been alive,\u201d said 22-year-old Gaby in Birmingham, who said she felt the party had been losing touch with its working-class roots until Corbyn\u2019s leadership. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever lived under prime ministers that lied, schemed, ignored the people\u2019s wishes or ran away. Corbyn makes me excited to be following politics again, he speaks with my voice,\u201d she said. While most felt voting Labour was the most \u201crealistic\u201d choice to prevent a Conservative majority, many said they would do so reluctantly, having lost faith in the party over a perceived weakness on Brexit and failures to address allegations of antisemitism. Jack, 20, from Eddisbury, said: \u201cIn the current state of the party, I feel unable to consider voting for them. My constituency is a safe Tory seat and I\u2019m quite glad my vote doesn\u2019t count for too much. If I was in a marginal Labour-Tory seat, this decision would be torturous.\u201d Jamie, 22, in London, who voted Labour in the last election, said: \u201cI like the Green party a lot, especially Caroline Lucas. But I\u2019ve taken the view that, this election, the most important thing to do is to get the Tories out of power. Frankly, [Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership] is terrifying and makes me feel a bit sick.\u201d For 2017 Conservative voters who contacted the Guardian, Johnson was a polarising figure, losing as many supporters as he had attracted. Some cited his comments on groups including Muslim women, black people, and gay men as reasons for their departure from the party, with many feeling it had morphed into a political project they could no longer support. \u201cIf David Cameron had made those comments or used that language, it would have been unacceptable\u201d, said 21-year-old Ayman from London. \u201cI won\u2019t vote Conservative as long as it\u2019s drifted to the right, and I think it will take at least 10 years to get the centre ground back.\u201d However, for other voters, the Conservatives\u2019 repeated pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d had cut through the noise, with one describing Johnson as a \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d. Ben Duncanson, 19, from Warrington, said Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit was a \u201cfarce\u201d and he now \u201cjust wanted it over and done with\u201d \u2013 a job he felt was best entrusted to Johnson. Despite riding high on EU election success and soaring in the early general election polls, the Liberal Democrats have appeared to lose momentum in recent weeks, and most of those who said they would vote for the party this year were doing so tactically. While Jo Swinson\u2019s commitment to revoking article 50 offered some young voters welcome clarity in uncertain political times, many feared it would aggravate existing social tensions and undermine democracy. Lewis, a 24-year-old from Shropshire, who voted for the party in 2017, said the policy would not \u201cheal the wounds\u201d that caused Britain\u2019s withdrawal from Europe. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a majority of the country to win an election, so it wouldn\u2019t democratically override all those that voted for Brexit,\u201d he said. For many young voters, it seemed that Swinson was unable to escape the shadow of the 2010 coalition government in which she was a minister. Her role in the austerity policies and tuition fee failings of the administration was widely criticised, with both at the forefront of young voters\u2019 minds in light of high rates of youth unemployment, house and rent prices, and record high university tuition fees. In Hull, Faye Priestley, 22, said she had voted Liberal Democrat in 2017 but would now vote Labour. \u201cJo Swinson has tried to backtrack and apologise, but how can she support reducing austerity now when she was voting with the coalition?\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make them look trustworthy.\u201d",

As in, stop giving a fuck, calm the fuck down, say \u201cfuck, no\u201d: all sentiments at the heart of every self-help book published since the genre exploded. But where these books were once determinedly optimistic and outwardly focused on goals such as making money and influencing people, they now assume the voice of your bluntest friend, one who is not afraid to curse while telling you how it is.</p> <p>Self-help has turned sweary, and no one has made being blue a bigger part of their brand than Sarah Knight, author of the five \u201cNo Fucks Given Guides\u201d, most recently Fuck No!. The series, which started with the 2015 bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, has sold more than 2m copies worldwide and ushered in a new wave of tough-love tomes, such as <a href=\"https://markmanson.net/books\">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</a> by Mark Manson and <a href=\"https://garyjohnbishop.com/books/\">Gary John Bishop\u2019s Unfuck Yourself</a> \u2013 each bestsellers themselves.</p> <p>Pragmatic, profane, irreverent, it is self-help for people who don\u2019t like self-help, says Knight, 41, a former book editor who credits Jen Sincero with starting the trend with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/16/jen-sincero-says-she-can-make-you-a-badass-has-it-worked-for-her-millions-of-readers\">You Are a Badass</a> back in 2013. The appeal, Knight suggests, is \u201cbecause readers have these pent-up feelings that they felt they couldn\u2019t express, and we are helping them channel them\u201d.</p> <p>Knight\u2019s debut was intended as an affectionate parody of Marie Kondo\u2019s 2011 tidying bible, persuasively subtitled, \u201cHow to stop spending time you don\u2019t have with people you don\u2019t like doing things you don\u2019t want to do\u201d. (Baby showers, for Knight, are a particular sticking point.)</p> <p>The desire to say no \u2013 to care less \u2013 is already there, says Knight; her books just give readers permission to act on it, like throwing a lit match on gasoline. \u201cThat\u2019s been the catalyst for them to go forth and feel liberated, and live lives that they want to live \u2026 I\u2019m really preaching what I consider to be common sense, as someone who has done it \u2013 and I\u2019m here to tell them that it works.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, Knight was a senior editor at Random House in New York and had just signed Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl when she suffered her first panic attack, passing out in front of her coworkers. It spurred what she remembers now as \u201ca watershed time\u201d of re-evaluation and reckoning, and a clinical diagnosis of anxiety, which eventually led to her giving up her 15-year career in publishing and relocating with her husband to the Caribbean.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m getting messages daily from teenagers, saying \u2018I loved your book, it\u2019s making me think about what I want to do with my life'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was this very stark contrast between the success that I was having on paper, and the nadir of my emotional, mental and physical health and wellbeing,\u201d Knight says now, via Skype from her new home in the Dominican Republic. \u201cThe fact that they were happening at the same time [gave] me clarity: \u2018OK, obviously this really hardcore pursuit of success is damaging me in other ways. How do I balance it out?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, bringing together the lessons of what Knight terms her \u201cgreat personal and professional meltdown\u201d, was published just six months after Knight finally quit her job. The book has since sold more than half a million copies, with Knight\u2019s own trade of the rat race for a tropical island a big selling point. Such literal escape may not be possible for everyone \u2013 both Knight and her husband Judd can work remotely, and they are happily child-free \u2013 but the spirit of \u201cno fucks given\u201d behind it is, she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting messages daily from people as young as 14, 15 years old, saying \u2018I loved your book, it\u2019s making me think about what I want to do with my life\u2019, and from people in their 60s and 70s saying \u2018I wish I\u2019d adopted this life philosophy sooner\u2019,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She summarises her philosophy, explored over five books, as \u201ctake care of yourself first\u201d: granting yourself permission to say no, free from anxiety or guilt. Her method works to reduce mental clutter in the same way that Kondo\u2019s removed it from the home, creating space for joy. Policing one\u2019s personal boundaries gets easier with practice, she says. \u201cI do not agree that selfish is a four-letter word, even though it gets treated like that in our society \u2013 and I know quite a bit about four-letter words.\u201d</p> <p>Some people do need to be told to prioritise their health and happiness as much as they do their career or, in the case of caregivers, other people\u2019s, says Knight. \u201cAnd for an older generation, they just didn\u2019t ever know it was allowed \u2013 they weren\u2019t raised in a culture that promoted personal wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Today we have arguably over-corrected, with the modern preoccupation with \u201cwellness\u201d \u2013 which Knight agrees her work taps into \u2013 reflecting widespread unease with the impact of technology, work-life imbalance and unstable employment on our health. But she suggests that anxiety and burnout may not be more prevalent today than in the past \u2013 we might just understand them better. \u201cAt the very least, we\u2019re talking about them more, so it may make them feel more present.\u201d</p> <p>Knight is upfront that she is not a doctor or therapist, but even a strategy as simple as what she terms the \u201cno-and-switch\u201d (politely declining, with a preferred alternative) might still help some. \u201cHaving the opportunity to read a $20 book and get some really good suggestions, if you can\u2019t afford $2,000 in therapy, can only help.\u201d She readily admits that many of the techniques in her books are \u201cjust cognitive behavioural therapy, dressed up in sweary language \u2013 but I also take medication, and I\u2019m not ashamed of that.\u201d</p> <p> But Knight\u2019s advice, while sensible at the individual level, sits uneasily against a global backdrop of inequality and climate change that can only be tackled collectively. Are more people thinking only of themselves really what the world needs?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to raise a generation of sociopaths, or say that all you should do is look out for number one, because you won\u2019t have a good life that way either,\u201d she says. It is possible to prioritise one\u2019s own needs without hurting others, \u201cor at least without it hurting someone else more than it helps you\u201d.</p> <p>Say you refuse an invitation to a dinner party: \u201cYes, you are disappointing your friend. However, if you have terrible social anxiety or a really demanding job, and you simply cannot be out until 10 at night, guzzling white wine on a Wednesday \u2013 it would hurt you more to say yes, than it hurts them for you to say no,\u201d Knight says. She calls it being \u201cself-ish\u201d: a kind of risk-benefit analysis that takes others\u2019 needs into account \u2013 to an extent. \u201cOn the flipside, I think that other people have to be a little bit less sensitive about me not coming to their dinner party.\u201d</p> <p>She puts down the failures of political leaders in the US and the UK to greed. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not what being selfish is \u2026 that\u2019s the root of all evil.\u201d Knight is unequivocal in her disgust at the egocentrism on display among politicians; in Fuck No!, she writes that her aim is to \u201cdestigmatise the act of saying <em>nyet</em> \u2026 as in, \u2018No, I won\u2019t accept foreign interference in this election.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is also a \u201cmini-chapter\u201d in Fuck No! on sexual consent, empowering women to say no for any reason they like. It took Knight 30 years to learn this lesson herself, in which time she had sex with \u201cawful\u201d people, wasted time and compromised her individual ethics with \u201cregrettable yeses\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/07/self-and-wellbeing-how-to-rest-relaxation-gardening-travel\">We need to learn how to relax, without guilt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Noes beget noes, with more positive consequences than negative. \u201cYou have to be able to communicate your boundaries.

      "bodyText": "Fuck seems to have been the word we\u2019ve all needed to hear. As in, stop giving a fuck, calm the fuck down, say \u201cfuck, no\u201d: all sentiments at the heart of every self-help book published since the genre exploded. But where these books were once determinedly optimistic and outwardly focused on goals such as making money and influencing people, they now assume the voice of your bluntest friend, one who is not afraid to curse while telling you how it is. Self-help has turned sweary, and no one has made being blue a bigger part of their brand than Sarah Knight, author of the five \u201cNo Fucks Given Guides\u201d, most recently Fuck No!. The series, which started with the 2015 bestseller The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, has sold more than 2m copies worldwide and ushered in a new wave of tough-love tomes, such as The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson and Gary John Bishop\u2019s Unfuck Yourself \u2013 each bestsellers themselves. Pragmatic, profane, irreverent, it is self-help for people who don\u2019t like self-help, says Knight, 41, a former book editor who credits Jen Sincero with starting the trend with You Are a Badass back in 2013. The appeal, Knight suggests, is \u201cbecause readers have these pent-up feelings that they felt they couldn\u2019t express, and we are helping them channel them\u201d. Knight\u2019s debut was intended as an affectionate parody of Marie Kondo\u2019s 2011 tidying bible, persuasively subtitled, \u201cHow to stop spending time you don\u2019t have with people you don\u2019t like doing things you don\u2019t want to do\u201d. (Baby showers, for Knight, are a particular sticking point.) The desire to say no \u2013 to care less \u2013 is already there, says Knight; her books just give readers permission to act on it, like throwing a lit match on gasoline. \u201cThat\u2019s been the catalyst for them to go forth and feel liberated, and live lives that they want to live \u2026 I\u2019m really preaching what I consider to be common sense, as someone who has done it \u2013 and I\u2019m here to tell them that it works.\u201d In 2009, Knight was a senior editor at Random House in New York and had just signed Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl when she suffered her first panic attack, passing out in front of her coworkers. It spurred what she remembers now as \u201ca watershed time\u201d of re-evaluation and reckoning, and a clinical diagnosis of anxiety, which eventually led to her giving up her 15-year career in publishing and relocating with her husband to the Caribbean. \u201cThere was this very stark contrast between the success that I was having on paper, and the nadir of my emotional, mental and physical health and wellbeing,\u201d Knight says now, via Skype from her new home in the Dominican Republic. \u201cThe fact that they were happening at the same time [gave] me clarity: \u2018OK, obviously this really hardcore pursuit of success is damaging me in other ways. How do I balance it out?\u2019\u201d The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck, bringing together the lessons of what Knight terms her \u201cgreat personal and professional meltdown\u201d, was published just six months after Knight finally quit her job. The book has since sold more than half a million copies, with Knight\u2019s own trade of the rat race for a tropical island a big selling point. Such literal escape may not be possible for everyone \u2013 both Knight and her husband Judd can work remotely, and they are happily child-free \u2013 but the spirit of \u201cno fucks given\u201d behind it is, she says. \u201cI\u2019m getting messages daily from people as young as 14, 15 years old, saying \u2018I loved your book, it\u2019s making me think about what I want to do with my life\u2019, and from people in their 60s and 70s saying \u2018I wish I\u2019d adopted this life philosophy sooner\u2019,\u201d she says.

That was four or five feet,\u201d says one of the kids at the Huntington Beach skatepark in California as Sky Brown launches into the air and performs a frontside grab.</p> <p>She soars above the head of her younger brother, Ocean, who is watching from the rim, and bails out of the landing at the last minute, dropping more than 10 feet into a concrete bowl before grinding safely to a halt on her knee pads.</p> <p>\u201cI like to skate high; I like to do spins and kickflips,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to do tricks that boys are doing because I feel like some boys think girls can\u2019t do what boys can do. I want to go to the same height as them and push the boundaries for girls.\u201d</p> <p>At 11 years old, Brown has a precocious talent for a sport that will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo next summer. She is ranked third in the world for women in the \u201cpark\u201d discipline and has an advantage of more than 70,000 points over those outside the top 20. With four major events remaining this season, she has all but officially qualified for the Olympics.</p> <p>She is set to become Britain\u2019s youngest summer Olympian, beating the record of 13 years and 43 days held by the swimmer Margery Hinton since 1928, and giggles at the idea of winning an Olympic medal less than a month after her 12th birthday: \u201cLike, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d she says in a thick American accent.

But if I want to learn a trick I\u2019ll just search it online and study about it myself.\u201d</p> <p>Such is her natural talent for boardsports, Brown had hoped to compete at the Olympics in skateboarding and surfing, but ultimately there was only one viable path. \u201cI like them both the same, they\u2019re super similar,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like if you go and get ramen and ice cream \u2013 if you eat too much ramen you want to go and get ice cream. I used to be better at surfing but I\u2019ve been skating a lot lately and I\u2019ve got way better from doing contests. It\u2019s made me want to go harder.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy Adams, the chair of Skateboard GB, says Brown has \u201ca natural, flowing style\u201d and \u201cworks at one with the skateboard\u201d. Brown beat Adams, who is now her mentor, in a competition at NASS festival in 2017. \u201cHer ability is endless,\u201d Adams says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s like the whole of skateboarding: it\u2019s infinite, no one can complete it. There\u2019ll always be new variations of tricks and that\u2019s exciting for her.\u201d</p> <p>Brown is not immune from fear when tackling new tricks but she won\u2019t surrender to it. She broke her arm a week before the Dew Tour, the first Olympic qualifier, but skated at the competition in a cast.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to slam. You\u2019re going to fall. But I like it when I fall, it makes me feel good. It\u2019s part of skateboarding,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her father, Stewart, says: \u201cSince Sky and Ocean were little, we play outside, we let our dogs lick their faces, we roll in the mud, we eat food with dirty fingers \u2013 that\u2019s life.

      "bodyText": "\u201c\u2018Woah, did you see how high she went? That was four or five feet,\u201d says one of the kids at the Huntington Beach skatepark in California as Sky Brown launches into the air and performs a frontside grab. She soars above the head of her younger brother, Ocean, who is watching from the rim, and bails out of the landing at the last minute, dropping more than 10 feet into a concrete bowl before grinding safely to a halt on her knee pads. \u201cI like to skate high; I like to do spins and kickflips,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to do tricks that boys are doing because I feel like some boys think girls can\u2019t do what boys can do. I want to go to the same height as them and push the boundaries for girls.\u201d At 11 years old, Brown has a precocious talent for a sport that will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo next summer. She is ranked third in the world for women in the \u201cpark\u201d discipline and has an advantage of more than 70,000 points over those outside the top 20. With four major events remaining this season, she has all but officially qualified for the Olympics. She is set to become Britain\u2019s youngest summer Olympian, beating the record of 13 years and 43 days held by the swimmer Margery Hinton since 1928, and giggles at the idea of winning an Olympic medal less than a month after her 12th birthday: \u201cLike, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d she says in a thick American accent. Only, it\u2019s not crazy; it\u2019s entirely realistic. When we first meet at 8am on a fresh winter\u2019s morning in California where she lives part-time, Brown, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and British father, seems to be half-asleep: she went to the movies late the previous night to watch Frozen 2 and, uncharacteristically, did not wake up in time for an early morning surf. She began skating aged four and recalls borrowing her father\u2019s skateboard without his permission and riding it around the house: \u201cAt first I mostly learned from YouTube,\u201d she says. \u201cI said to my dad \u2018please, please, please teach me\u2019 and he told me a little. But if I want to learn a trick I\u2019ll just search it online and study about it myself.\u201d Such is her natural talent for boardsports, Brown had hoped to compete at the Olympics in skateboarding and surfing, but ultimately there was only one viable path. \u201cI like them both the same, they\u2019re super similar,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like if you go and get ramen and ice cream \u2013 if you eat too much ramen you want to go and get ice cream. I used to be better at surfing but I\u2019ve been skating a lot lately and I\u2019ve got way better from doing contests. It\u2019s made me want to go harder.\u201d Lucy Adams, the chair of Skateboard GB, says Brown has \u201ca natural, flowing style\u201d and \u201cworks at one with the skateboard\u201d. Brown beat Adams, who is now her mentor, in a competition at NASS festival in 2017. \u201cHer ability is endless,\u201d Adams says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s like the whole of skateboarding: it\u2019s infinite, no one can complete it. There\u2019ll always be new variations of tricks and that\u2019s exciting for her.\u201d Brown is not immune from fear when tackling new tricks but she won\u2019t surrender to it. She broke her arm a week before the Dew Tour, the first Olympic qualifier, but skated at the competition in a cast. \u201cYou\u2019re going to slam. You\u2019re going to fall. But I like it when I fall, it makes me feel good. It\u2019s part of skateboarding,\u201d she says. Her father, Stewart, says: \u201cSince Sky and Ocean were little, we play outside, we let our dogs lick their faces, we roll in the mud, we eat food with dirty fingers \u2013 that\u2019s life. In society now people sterilise everything but at the same time everyone seems to have allergies and is getting sick \u2026 I feel like kids are tough and as long as it\u2019s not stupid I trust her. Sky\u2019s a good judge of what she can and can\u2019t do.\u201d Evidently so: she came 12th in the Dew Tour competition, before placing fifth in China, third in S\u00e3o Paolo, third in Rio and first at the UK skate nationals. After waiting an hour for the skatepark to dry out, Brown traces a sinuous path around the bowl\u2019s contours, performing inverts and kickflip indies while men four times her age smack their boards on the coping in appreciation. In breaks between skating she fools around with \u201cOshie\u201d and asks the kinds of innocent questions you\u2019d expect of an 11-year-old. \u201cIs yellow your favourite colour?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite fruit?\u201d Hers, I learn, is turquoise and peaches. A self-described \u201cgirly girl\u201d who likes to do the Floss dance on the sidelines at competitions, she displays a maturity beyond her years when discussing her charity work in the favelas of Brazil or the rise of women\u2019s skateboarding, of which she is a vocal advocate. \u201cWhen you skate you forget about what you\u2019re struggling through, you just think about happiness \u2013 that\u2019s why I think skating can help people,\u201d she says. She says she loves visiting the UK because of the food \u2013 especially bangers and mash with gravy \u2013 but defers to her father when asked why she chose to represent Team GB over her native Japan. \u201cWe chose GB because we felt that there was no pressure and they didn\u2019t ask us to commit,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made it very clear that if she wasn\u2019t happy or wasn\u2019t feeling good at any time we could pull out. That was huge for us.\u201d Valid reasoning, for sure, but one wonders about the pressures wrought by her wider commitments: she is sponsored by Nike SB; she has appeared in a global advertising campaign alongside stars such as Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe and Caster Semenya; she has nearly half a million followers on Instagram; and she won the American TV show Dancing With The Stars: Juniors this time last year.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Da-da.\u201d \u201cTa-boo.\u201d These two words are spoken early on in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/22/claire-denis-let-sunshine-in-binoche-weinstein-bourgeois-metoo\">Claire Denis</a>\u2019s singular head-trip through the cosmos, from a father to his infant daughter. He\u2019s teaching her the building blocks of our existence as Homo sapiens: the biological, expressed as the genetic bonds linking progenitor and progeny, and the sociological, represented by the arbitrary precepts ruling what is and is not natural. These oppositional forces \u2013 the organic inclination of the body, and the ego\u2019s drive to pervert it \u2013 are locked in a tug-of-war aboard the orbiting station that sets the scene for this space odyssey, in which both the god-given and manmade aspects of personhood start to break down.<br><br>The facility has been designed as a prison, a holding cell for death-row inmates enrolled in a program through which they conduct perilous black hole explorations in exchange for commuted sentences. Abandoned by earthbound society and forgotten by time, they have in many senses let themselves go; the mad Dr Dibs (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliette-binoche\">Juliette Binoche</a>) allows her hair to grow into an anaconda of a French braid, while Tcherny (Andr\u00e9 Benjamin) spends all of his waking hours in the self-sustaining garden. To maintain his sanity, our protagonist Monte (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/14/robert-pattinson-unlikely-arthouse-superstar\">Robert Pattinson</a>, perhaps the best performance of his career) has done just the opposite, holding himself to a monk-like standard of asceticism. Despite all of Dr Dibs\u2019 attempts to extract semen from him for her depraved experiments, he remains steadfastly celibate, having boiled his sense of personal agency down to the power to procreate (or not).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb4c0b8bf68684ffb0940d26db638b051b8895a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4c0b8bf68684ffb0940d26db638b051b8895a9/0_0_4292_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliette Binoche and Robert Pattinson in High Life\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliette Binoche and Robert Pattinson in High Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Alcatraz Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The proper functioning of the reproductive process emerges as the closest thing this film has to dramatic stakes, positing copulation, gestation, lactation and a handful of other -ations as clinical trials establishing what it means to be human. Any reading of the film will start with the ability to create and sustain new life, but from there Denis leaves a lot of room for interpretation. She assembles images that provoke awe while confounding easy comprehension, at times leaving her audience to bask in the raw power of such scenes as the one that sends the suicidal Boyse (Mia Goth) to her oblivion by spaghettification. Or the showstopping set piece in which Dr Dibs strips nude, mounts a phallic metallic contraption referred to as \u201cthe fuckbox,\u201d and desperately straddles it in a passage unrivaled this year for pure poeticism.<br><br>Even in their inscrutability, both sequences speak to a quality of accessibility heretofore largely alien to Denis\u2019s cerebral canon. The production design borrows from HR Giger\u2019s famed techno-corridors, and her engagement with the tropes of sci-fi can give the film the feel of a popcorn blockbuster from a parallel dimension. High Life is perhaps the most intellectually beguiling and definitely the most gratuitously entertaining of the French master\u2019s films. It is an epochal achievement that challenges the future of its genre to chart new horizons and plumb new depths.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018Da-da.\u201d \u201cTa-boo.\u201d These two words are spoken early on in Claire Denis\u2019s singular head-trip through the cosmos, from a father to his infant daughter. He\u2019s teaching her the building blocks of our existence as Homo sapiens: the biological, expressed as the genetic bonds linking progenitor and progeny, and the sociological, represented by the arbitrary precepts ruling what is and is not natural. These oppositional forces \u2013 the organic inclination of the body, and the ego\u2019s drive to pervert it \u2013 are locked in a tug-of-war aboard the orbiting station that sets the scene for this space odyssey, in which both the god-given and manmade aspects of personhood start to break down. The facility has been designed as a prison, a holding cell for death-row inmates enrolled in a program through which they conduct perilous black hole explorations in exchange for commuted sentences. Abandoned by earthbound society and forgotten by time, they have in many senses let themselves go; the mad Dr Dibs (Juliette Binoche) allows her hair to grow into an anaconda of a French braid, while Tcherny (Andr\u00e9 Benjamin) spends all of his waking hours in the self-sustaining garden. To maintain his sanity, our protagonist Monte (Robert Pattinson, perhaps the best performance of his career) has done just the opposite, holding himself to a monk-like standard of asceticism. Despite all of Dr Dibs\u2019 attempts to extract semen from him for her depraved experiments, he remains steadfastly celibate, having boiled his sense of personal agency down to the power to procreate (or not). The proper functioning of the reproductive process emerges as the closest thing this film has to dramatic stakes, positing copulation, gestation, lactation and a handful of other -ations as clinical trials establishing what it means to be human. Any reading of the film will start with the ability to create and sustain new life, but from there Denis leaves a lot of room for interpretation. She assembles images that provoke awe while confounding easy comprehension, at times leaving her audience to bask in the raw power of such scenes as the one that sends the suicidal Boyse (Mia Goth) to her oblivion by spaghettification. Or the showstopping set piece in which Dr Dibs strips nude, mounts a phallic metallic contraption referred to as \u201cthe fuckbox,\u201d and desperately straddles it in a passage unrivaled this year for pure poeticism. Even in their inscrutability, both sequences speak to a quality of accessibility heretofore largely alien to Denis\u2019s cerebral canon. The production design borrows from HR Giger\u2019s famed techno-corridors, and her engagement with the tropes of sci-fi can give the film the feel of a popcorn blockbuster from a parallel dimension. High Life is perhaps the most intellectually beguiling and definitely the most gratuitously entertaining of the French master\u2019s films. It is an epochal achievement that challenges the future of its genre to chart new horizons and plumb new depths.",

Fill the sink, or a heatproof bowl larger than your saucepan, with about 5cm cold water and boil a little water in the kettle. These are both insurance policies in case of disaster, but don\u2019t worry: as long as you make these preparations, you won\u2019t need them. Cut the butter into cubes.</p> <h2><strong>2 Combine the eggs and butter</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edc81c590a83cd5b09441bdd28158babfb9ab9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edc81c590a83cd5b09441bdd28158babfb9ab9f/0_0_3731_3996/934.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake Eggs royale 2 First make the hollandaise.

Put over a very low heat and stir to help melt the butter; I find it easiest to start with a wooden spoon, then swap this for a whisk once the lumps have turned liquid.</p> <h2><strong>3 Stir until it thickens</strong></h2> <p>Gradually, the sauce will thicken; don\u2019t be tempted to turn up the heat to hurry it along, but if it looks like it\u2019s threatening to split or scramble anyway, plunge the base of the pan into the cold water and whisk vigorously. This should bring the temperature back down and you can put it back on the heat and continue whisking.</p> <h2><strong>4 In the event of disaster \u2026</strong></h2> <p>If it does curdle, whisk in a little boiling water to see if it can be rescued; if not, pour the mess into a jug, wash the pan, then put a fresh egg yolk in there with a splash of water, and gradually whisk in the curdled sauce over a very low heat.</p> <h2>5 Finish the sauce and keep it warm</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cace0f7eb5afc8a9391560c1bf0d53e3680aef39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cace0f7eb5afc8a9391560c1bf0d53e3680aef39/0_0_3731_4066/918.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake Eggs royale 5 Beat in the lemon juice, season, then set the pan over, but not touching, a pot of hot water.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beat in the lemon juice, season, then set the pan over, but not touching, a pot of hot water to keep the hollandaise warm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once the sauce has thickened, beat in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the sauce to a heatproof pan set over a second pan of hot water, making sure the base of the hollandaise pan doesn\u2019t touch the water, and stir occasionally: unfortunately, hollandaise doesn\u2019t reheat well, so you can\u2019t make it too far ahead, though it will sit happily for a while.</p> <h2><strong>6 Poach (or boil) the eggs</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79a671e41962147b31819125c9ebcaad8f63e7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79a671e41962147b31819125c9ebcaad8f63e7e/0_63_2835_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake Eggs royale 6 Crack each egg into a ramekin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crack each egg into a ramekin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bring a small pan of water to a boil, and crack each egg into its own ramekin.

      "bodyText": "Eggs royale \u2013 a decadent pile of salmon, eggs and a criminally rich sauce atop a fluffy muffin \u2013 is my dream breakfast on 25 December, even if in reality the big day tends to start with chaos and a hurried slice of toast. If you have fewer children and dogs in residence, however, enjoy an extra dollop of sauce with your eggs royale \u2013 and benedict or florentine for me, too. It is Christmas, after all. Prep 5 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 4-8 eggs, depending on hunger 1 drop vinegar 4 English muffins Butter, to spread 400g baby spinach (optional) 4 slices cooked ham or 100g smoked salmon Salt and pepper Nutmeg (optional) For the hollandaise 125g cold unsalted butter 2 large egg yolks \u00bc lemon 1 Precautionary measures Start with the hollandaise. Fill the sink, or a heatproof bowl larger than your saucepan, with about 5cm cold water and boil a little water in the kettle. These are both insurance policies in case of disaster, but don\u2019t worry: as long as you make these preparations, you won\u2019t need them. Cut the butter into cubes. 2 Combine the eggs and butter Put the butter in a small, heavy-based saucepan with the egg yolks and two tablespoons of cold water. Put over a very low heat and stir to help melt the butter; I find it easiest to start with a wooden spoon, then swap this for a whisk once the lumps have turned liquid. 3 Stir until it thickens Gradually, the sauce will thicken; don\u2019t be tempted to turn up the heat to hurry it along, but if it looks like it\u2019s threatening to split or scramble anyway, plunge the base of the pan into the cold water and whisk vigorously. This should bring the temperature back down and you can put it back on the heat and continue whisking. 4 In the event of disaster \u2026 If it does curdle, whisk in a little boiling water to see if it can be rescued; if not, pour the mess into a jug, wash the pan, then put a fresh egg yolk in there with a splash of water, and gradually whisk in the curdled sauce over a very low heat. 5 Finish the sauce and keep it warm Once the sauce has thickened, beat in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the sauce to a heatproof pan set over a second pan of hot water, making sure the base of the hollandaise pan doesn\u2019t touch the water, and stir occasionally: unfortunately, hollandaise doesn\u2019t reheat well, so you can\u2019t make it too far ahead, though it will sit happily for a while. 6 Poach (or boil) the eggs Bring a small pan of water to a boil, and crack each egg into its own ramekin. Put a drop of vinegar into the water and whisk vigorously, then immediately slip the eggs into the centre two at a time. Poach on a low heat and set the timer for three minutes. (Alternatively, make soft-boiled eggs: simmer them for seven minutes, then plunge into cold water and peel.) 7 Now for the muffins and spinach Meanwhile, split, toast and butter the muffins. If you want spinach, wash, then put in a medium pan on a medium heat with the water still clinging to its leaves. Cover and cook until wilted, shaking the pan from time to time, then squeeze dry and season generously with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Make sure you haven\u2019t forgotten about the eggs. 8 Plate and serve Drain the eggs and pat dry on kitchen paper. Working quickly now, put two muffin halves on each plate and top first with the spinach (if using) and then the ham or salmon, followed by an egg and a good dollop of hollandaise. Finish with a grating of black pepper or a little nutmeg, and serve at once before the sauce goes cold. 9 Variations on the theme If you\u2019re not a slave to tradition, swap in ripe avocado, grilled bacon, warm crab meat or brown shrimp, or a grilled field mushroom or beef tomato for the ham, etc. Or swap the muffin for a crumpet or good toast. Or spice up the hollandaise with a squeeze of hot sauce, anchovy paste or a handful of fresh, soft herbs. Fiona Beckett\u2019s drink match I\u2019d pick a lighter (ie, non-vintage) style of fizz. I like the toasted brioche flavours of the smart-looking Hattingley Valley Reserve (\u00a329, Tesco, and at \u00a330 from Great Western Wine in Bath, 12%).",

      "body": "<p>World leaders are meeting in Spain to decide whether or not to bother with preventing the destruction of the earth, like people in a vehicle speeding toward a cliff deciding whether to brake or swerve or just chat about other things. Powerful senior citizens in the United States \u2013 Trump, Giuliani, Biden \u2013 are trading playground insults, and the middle-aged people who make a lot of decisions about how to handle this emergency seem incapable of thinking beyond the singularly imagination-killing criterion of short-term profit.</p> <p>I began writing this column at a Youth v Apocalypse demonstration in San Francisco. The protest, which was led by teens, of course, as well as some of the 20-something members of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion, took place in front of Black Rock, the world\u2019s largest investor in fossil fuels. There was a little cluster of mothers at the demonstration too, with babies and toddlers whose life expectancy, barring catastrophes, extends into the 22nd century. It was a Fridays for Future demonstration taking place all over the world, with half a million mostly young people in Madrid.</p> <p>Sometimes I think that our species was for most of its history a child: it had limited capacity to harm and thus limited responsibility to do no harm. We could kill each other, but we did it without napalm and nuclear weapons that kill a lot of other things. We could think small because we acted small, mostly; we were altering the earth with hunting, grazing, farming, foraging, building, but most of our traces would vanish and most of our impact left no lasting damage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must expand our imaginations so can experience real climate victory. That means making radical changes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the industrial revolution and its reliance on fossil fuels and with technologies capable of changing the earth on a more profound scale, childhood harmlessness faded into the past for those who wielded those powers and used those tools and benefitted from it all. Humans ceased to be human-scale, but our imaginations and ethics lagged behind our impact. We have for two centuries been in a sort of wild adolescence, too reckless and impatient to pay attention to consequences or to listen to the Rachel Carsons and Vandana Shivas when they point out that there are consequences. Because, really, environmentalism has been to no small degree about shouting \u201cdon\u2019t break that\u201d and \u201cclean up your room\u201d at corporations and governments.</p> <p>We are on the brink, and part of what that brink is, I believe, is the necessary end of that adolescence. As a species we must act with restraint in the face of consequences, must consider the other species with us now, those of our own not yet born, and those currently facing ultimate climate vulnerability around the world from floods, fire, sea level rise, crop failure, superstorms and more.</p> <p>We must expand our imaginations and act on that bigger understanding of our place in the world and our impact on the future. That means making radical changes, like our homes and transit being powered by renewables, our government not plotting more extractivism. It means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, where they belong. We need to remind ourselves why these changes are necessary: that the earth is finite, that actions have consequences, that they go beyond the horizon of what we can see and hear, in time and space, that those who come after us have rights we can\u2019t just annihilate. We must make sweeping changes by the end of the coming decade, and we must stick to them afterward by remembering why they matter.</p> <p>What is striking in this moment is that such maturity is largely the property of the young. Many of the significant grownups in the room of climate chaos are 16 or 20 or 27, Greta and the thousands of youths like her who are less visible but no less committed, the teens from Nigeria to Alaska doing their utmost for the climate. But because they are truly young, they control no shares, have no votes, sit on no boards: they need us as we need them. They are the leadership in this moment, the people who are thinking about 2100, the people who are ready to change everything, the people who understand the gravity and scale of the catastrophe.</p> <p>They are the people who have never experienced a below-average temperature on Earth, who have the capacity to recognise we are in an emergency. There is wisdom in youth, in its lack of attachment to the status quo that is not their status quo, and in its ability to imagine profound change.</p> <p>There have been farsighted altruistic people in every generation, but there are signs of a wider evolution of imagination that is taking place among the young. We see that profound change in new ways of dealing with conflict, with rejecting competition and capitalism, new understandings of what is possible and ethical. We see the children are mature and too many old people are juvenile (though bless Jane Fonda at 81 for her #FireDrillFriday protests). Juvenility and maturity are no longer categories attached to how long you\u2019ve been on Earth, but how far you see and how much you care.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "World leaders are meeting in Spain to decide whether or not to bother with preventing the destruction of the earth, like people in a vehicle speeding toward a cliff deciding whether to brake or swerve or just chat about other things. Powerful senior citizens in the United States \u2013 Trump, Giuliani, Biden \u2013 are trading playground insults, and the middle-aged people who make a lot of decisions about how to handle this emergency seem incapable of thinking beyond the singularly imagination-killing criterion of short-term profit. I began writing this column at a Youth v Apocalypse demonstration in San Francisco. The protest, which was led by teens, of course, as well as some of the 20-something members of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion, took place in front of Black Rock, the world\u2019s largest investor in fossil fuels. There was a little cluster of mothers at the demonstration too, with babies and toddlers whose life expectancy, barring catastrophes, extends into the 22nd century. It was a Fridays for Future demonstration taking place all over the world, with half a million mostly young people in Madrid. Sometimes I think that our species was for most of its history a child: it had limited capacity to harm and thus limited responsibility to do no harm. We could kill each other, but we did it without napalm and nuclear weapons that kill a lot of other things. We could think small because we acted small, mostly; we were altering the earth with hunting, grazing, farming, foraging, building, but most of our traces would vanish and most of our impact left no lasting damage. With the industrial revolution and its reliance on fossil fuels and with technologies capable of changing the earth on a more profound scale, childhood harmlessness faded into the past for those who wielded those powers and used those tools and benefitted from it all. Humans ceased to be human-scale, but our imaginations and ethics lagged behind our impact. We have for two centuries been in a sort of wild adolescence, too reckless and impatient to pay attention to consequences or to listen to the Rachel Carsons and Vandana Shivas when they point out that there are consequences. Because, really, environmentalism has been to no small degree about shouting \u201cdon\u2019t break that\u201d and \u201cclean up your room\u201d at corporations and governments. We are on the brink, and part of what that brink is, I believe, is the necessary end of that adolescence. As a species we must act with restraint in the face of consequences, must consider the other species with us now, those of our own not yet born, and those currently facing ultimate climate vulnerability around the world from floods, fire, sea level rise, crop failure, superstorms and more. We must expand our imaginations and act on that bigger understanding of our place in the world and our impact on the future. That means making radical changes, like our homes and transit being powered by renewables, our government not plotting more extractivism. It means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, where they belong. We need to remind ourselves why these changes are necessary: that the earth is finite, that actions have consequences, that they go beyond the horizon of what we can see and hear, in time and space, that those who come after us have rights we can\u2019t just annihilate. We must make sweeping changes by the end of the coming decade, and we must stick to them afterward by remembering why they matter. What is striking in this moment is that such maturity is largely the property of the young. Many of the significant grownups in the room of climate chaos are 16 or 20 or 27, Greta and the thousands of youths like her who are less visible but no less committed, the teens from Nigeria to Alaska doing their utmost for the climate. But because they are truly young, they control no shares, have no votes, sit on no boards: they need us as we need them. They are the leadership in this moment, the people who are thinking about 2100, the people who are ready to change everything, the people who understand the gravity and scale of the catastrophe. They are the people who have never experienced a below-average temperature on Earth, who have the capacity to recognise we are in an emergency. There is wisdom in youth, in its lack of attachment to the status quo that is not their status quo, and in its ability to imagine profound change. There have been farsighted altruistic people in every generation, but there are signs of a wider evolution of imagination that is taking place among the young. We see that profound change in new ways of dealing with conflict, with rejecting competition and capitalism, new understandings of what is possible and ethical. We see the children are mature and too many old people are juvenile (though bless Jane Fonda at 81 for her #FireDrillFriday protests). Juvenility and maturity are no longer categories attached to how long you\u2019ve been on Earth, but how far you see and how much you care. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist",

While Amazon has stressed it has only a minority stake in Deliveroo, the CMA said it was concerned that competition could be damaged because Amazon might be discouraged from re-entering the food delivery market, which it exited last year. The competition watchdog also raised concerns that a tie-up between Amazon and Deliveroo would dampen competition in the ultra-fast grocery delivery market in the UK, in which there were currently only a small number of suppliers. Deliveroo has been testing out sub-two hour deliveries for Morrisons and the Co-op while Amazon offers a within-the-hour service to its Prime subscribers in some areas. They are up against other express services including Sainsbury\u2019s Chop Chop, the Co-op\u2019s own e-bikes, Ocado Zoom and Waitrose\u2019s Rapid delivery service. The regulator said that the two companies were among the strongest players in the nascent ultra-fast grocery market, as they both have UK-wide delivery networks. It said that, if they remained separate, competition between the two companies could increase, to the benefit of customers. Andrea Gomes da Silva, the CMA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cIf the deal were to proceed in its current form, there\u2019s a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services as these markets develop. \u201cThis is because the significant competition which could otherwise exist between Amazon and Deliveroo would be reduced.\u201d Deliveroo said it had been working closely with the CMA and would continue to do so. \u201cWe are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers,\u201d it said. In May, Deliveroo said it would use money from the Amazon-backed funding round to invest in its technology team at its London headquarters and to further expand its geographic reach and open more of its delivery-only kitchens. An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cA homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters. Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to build its world-class service and remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space.\u201d The company, founded by the former banker Will Shu in 2013, reported a loss of \u00a3232m last year despite a 72% rise in sales to \u00a3476m. Having started in London, it now operates in 500 towns and cities across 13 markets worldwide, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain and the United Arab Emirates.",

The US president\u2019s refusal to approve the appointment or reappointment of any judges on the appellate body has left it unable to function. From midnight on Wednesday, the WTO court will no longer adjudicate on trade disputes, putting the world at risk of a free trade free-for-all in which the largest blocs have greater freedom to use their economic weight to do as they wish. Countries or trade blocs who have not negotiated bilateral trade deals containing dispute resolution mechanisms will have no independent means for resolving their problems with each other. If the UK leaves the EU on 31 January, Johnson has said he will not extend an 11-month transition period in which he wants to negotiate a comprehensive free trade deal with the bloc. A failure to complete those complex talks by the end of that period would result in the UK trading with the EU entirely on WTO terms, including the imposition of tariffs and quotas, from 1 January 2021. Under the terms of the transition period, the UK is to remain in the single market and EU customs union temporarily. Should the UK, once outside of those structures, come to believe that the EU is imposing vexatious barriers to trade, there would be no recourse to legal redress for the British government. WTO members are still be expected to comply with their international obligations. The EU would be expected to sincerely follow the terms to which they have signed up along with the 164 other members of the trade organisation. The WTO appellate body deals with the most extreme trade disputes. But the CBI has said the shutdown of the WTO court will leave global trade \u201clike a football match without referee\u201d and the UK\u2019s lack of free trade agreements post-Brexit would leave the country\u2019s economy vulnerable.

My sister Nye Taylor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DemocracyCollab/status/1202942798162546689\">directed a short video</a> in partnership with the non-profit Democracy Collaborative. The title: \u201cA Warning From Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The stories we collected were gut-wrenching. One woman\u2019s 22-year-old daughter died because the hospital turned her away for lack of insurance, despite the fact that her massively swollen leg was a sign of a deadly blood clot. Another woman spoke of her 45-year-old sister, long diagnosed with type one diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, who ended her own life less than a month ago, in part due to her stress over constant negotiations with insurance companies that delayed or denied access to essential treatment.</p> <p>And those are just the interviews that made it on screen. When we were recruiting, my inbox overflowed with unbearable tales of woe. One woman told of tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills that accumulated as the result of sexual assault. A devastated nephew wrote of an uncle who died by suicide after a cancer diagnosis so he wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden on his family. A young man confessed to going 15 years without seeing a doctor because he couldn\u2019t afford a visit. A woman said her partner had to pay $5,000 for some tests and an MRI, despite having \u201cgold standard\u201d insurance. And so on.</p> <p>In the end, the story that struck me the most was, in many ways, the least sensational. It stood out because it underscores what is perhaps the biggest threat posed by the prospect of a decimated NHS \u2013 the way it would limit people\u2019s freedom, including the freedom to challenge powerful interests. The potential privatization of British healthcare is not only a grab for profit, it is also a grab for power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/04/us-healthcare-costs-brits-reaction-nhs\">AOC and Sanders tout NHS after video of Brits gasping at US healthcare goes viral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGkYcuDGZxA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Ann Larson recounts</a> how she once had health insurance through her spouse, who was on the faculty at Long Island University. In 2016, the faculty were trying to negotiate a new contract with better terms. In response, the administrators <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/an-unprecedented-faculty-lockout/499016/\">cut off their health insurance</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat that meant was that people had to give in,\u201d Larson explains. \u201cPeople were worried about rationing their medication. People with children were worried about how they were going to care for their families.\u201d As Larson tells it, people who might otherwise have been ready to battle together for better working conditions had to give in. The university\u2019s ability to terminate insurance was an overpowering source of leverage, one that hit people who were ill or who had ill family members the hardest.</p> <p>This is part of the deeper pathology of the American for-profit healthcare model. It gives bosses a tremendous advantage, since millions of people get medical coverage through their employers.

      "bodyText": "As has been widely reported, if the Conservatives win the British election, a potential trade deal with the United States could put vital parts of the NHS at risk of privatization. \u201cI think everything with the trade deal is on the table,\u201d Donald Trump has remarked. \u201cNHS or anything else \u2026 everything will be on the table, absolutely.\u201d Those of us across the pond are horrified on the UK\u2019s behalf. Don\u2019t let Trump and his cronies carve up the NHS. Vote and fight as if your life depends on it \u2013 because it does. A jaw-dropping 34 million Americans say a friend or family member died because they were unable to afford medical treatment. That\u2019s what it means for the health services to be \u201con the table\u201d. Given the high stakes, it\u2019s no wonder my social media feeds have been dominated by videos informing British voters of the horrors of US healthcare and the superiority of the British model. In one, which has chalked up over 20 million views, Londoners are stunned by the cost of routine procedures such as giving birth in a hospital. Their jaws drop when they hear the extortionate rates charged for prescription drugs. \u201cSo if you\u2019re poor, you die?\u201d a young woman asks incredulously. The answer, too often, is yes. I spent a few hours this week recruiting subjects for a contribution to this budding don\u2019t-follow-our-example video genre. My sister Nye Taylor directed a short video in partnership with the non-profit Democracy Collaborative. The title: \u201cA Warning From Americans.\u201d The stories we collected were gut-wrenching. One woman\u2019s 22-year-old daughter died because the hospital turned her away for lack of insurance, despite the fact that her massively swollen leg was a sign of a deadly blood clot. Another woman spoke of her 45-year-old sister, long diagnosed with type one diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, who ended her own life less than a month ago, in part due to her stress over constant negotiations with insurance companies that delayed or denied access to essential treatment. And those are just the interviews that made it on screen. When we were recruiting, my inbox overflowed with unbearable tales of woe. One woman told of tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills that accumulated as the result of sexual assault. A devastated nephew wrote of an uncle who died by suicide after a cancer diagnosis so he wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden on his family. A young man confessed to going 15 years without seeing a doctor because he couldn\u2019t afford a visit. A woman said her partner had to pay $5,000 for some tests and an MRI, despite having \u201cgold standard\u201d insurance. And so on. In the end, the story that struck me the most was, in many ways, the least sensational. It stood out because it underscores what is perhaps the biggest threat posed by the prospect of a decimated NHS \u2013 the way it would limit people\u2019s freedom, including the freedom to challenge powerful interests. The potential privatization of British healthcare is not only a grab for profit, it is also a grab for power. In the video, Ann Larson recounts how she once had health insurance through her spouse, who was on the faculty at Long Island University. In 2016, the faculty were trying to negotiate a new contract with better terms. In response, the administrators cut off their health insurance. \u201cWhat that meant was that people had to give in,\u201d Larson explains. \u201cPeople were worried about rationing their medication. People with children were worried about how they were going to care for their families.\u201d As Larson tells it, people who might otherwise have been ready to battle together for better working conditions had to give in. The university\u2019s ability to terminate insurance was an overpowering source of leverage, one that hit people who were ill or who had ill family members the hardest. This is part of the deeper pathology of the American for-profit healthcare model. It gives bosses a tremendous advantage, since millions of people get medical coverage through their employers. It limits people\u2019s life options, binding them to jobs they literally can\u2019t live without. Do you dislike your degrading boss or the mandatory overtime? Do you dream of taking time off to pursue your passion for art or activism, or do you want to start a business? Too bad, because if you stand up for yourself or quit to follow your dreams you will be uninsured, and if there\u2019s an emergency you will wind up ill and destitute. Want to divorce your partner? Best you reconsider, because you only have coverage through their job, and that coverage might mean the difference between life and death if you have a chronic condition. This sort of dependence is incredibly disempowering, and that\u2019s precisely the point. Coming after four decades of neoliberal attacks on working people \u2013 the weakening of trade unions, the rise of zero-hour contracts, and the privatization of well-unionized public services \u2013 gutting public healthcare would be catastrophic. No surprise, then, that the Labour party, with its historic emphasis on workers\u2019 rights, is the most committed to defending and expanding the NHS. Of course, we mustn\u2019t forget that privatization is about profit. As Bernie Sanders frequently points out, the American healthcare industry raked in over $100bn in profits last year, which is why industry CEOs are salivating at the money that could be ruthlessly extracted from the British system. In response, we must emphasize the obscenity of their desire. It\u2019s immoral to profit from pain, to price-gouge patients who cannot survive without insulin and EpiPens, or to jack up the costs of routine hospital stays and doctor visits. But we also must not forget that plutocrats aren\u2019t only after wealth; they also want control. For-profit medical coverage is a form of domination. It puts regular people in a precarious position, and the result has devastating implications for any country that calls itself a democracy.

      "bodyText": "The Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has defended Myanmar\u2019s government against accusations of genocide at the international court of justice, calling the allegations an \u201cincomplete and misleading factual picture of the situation\u201d. Addressing a bench of 17 judges from around the world, the 74-year-old leader dismissed reports of state violence against Rohingya Muslims and blamed the conflict on an uprising by sectarian insurgents. An estimated 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since late 2016, escaping military clearance operations that a UN fact-finding mission described as \u201cbrutal\u201d. It warned that Myanmar was failing to prevent genocide. Once internationally feted as a human rights champion, Aung San Suu Kyi is leading Myanmar\u2019s delegation to the court in The Hague. The state counsellor, in effect the country\u2019s prime minister, opened her defence with a 25-minute speech which placed primary responsibility for the violence on a terrorist uprising. The attacks were initiated by members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), Aung San Suu Kyi told the court as she displayed detailed maps of Rakhine state showing, she claimed, where the first assaults began in late 2016. \u201cThe situation in Rakhine state is complex and not easy to fathom,\u201d she said. \u201cThe troubles in Rakhine state \u2026 go back into past centuries and have been particularly severe. ARSA has received weapons and explosives-training from Afghan and Pakistani militants.\u201d Her speech to the UN\u2019s highest tribunal came on the second day of an emergency legal hearing convened to consider whether protective \u201cprovisional measures\u201d should be imposed to prevent further killings and destruction in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi said an initial phase of violence began in October 2016 when ARSA attacked police stations near the border with Bangladesh. \u201cThis led to the deaths of nine police officers and more than 100 civilians as well as the theft of 68 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition.\u201d She said a second wave of ARSA assaults launched in August 2017 aimed to seize the township of Maungdaw. Myanmar\u2019s army had been forced to respond with \u201ccounter-insurgency operations\u201d, she said. The charge that Myanmar\u2019s military carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of Rohingya Muslim communities has been brought by the Gambia, a west African state that belongs to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It alleges there has been \u201cextrajudicial killings \u2026 sexual violence, burning of homes and destruction of livestock \u2026 calculated to bring about a destruction of the Rohingya group in whole or in part\u201d. But Aung San Suu Kyi told the court: \u201cWe are dealing with an internal armed conflict, started by coordinated and comprehensive attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. \u201cTragically, this armed conflict led to the exodus of several hundred thousand Muslims from the three northernmost townships of Rakhine into Bangladesh \u2013 just as the armed conflict in Croatia [in the 1990s] led to the massive exodus of first ethnic Croats and later ethnic Serbs.\u201d Under the rules of the ICJ, member states can initiate actions against fellow member states over disputes alleging breaches of international law \u2013 in this case, the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi said the principle of international law is that it should complement domestic justice. If war crimes or human rights violations had been committed, she said, they would be dealt with by Myanmar\u2019s justice system, adding that in one case soldiers had already been punished for the execution of civilians. \u201cThere will be no tolerance of human rights violations in Rakhine or elsewhere in Myanmar,\u201d she said. \u201cNo stone has been left unturned to make domestic accountability work \u2026 We are dealing with an internal conflict started by ARSA to which Myanmar responds.\u201d One of the lawyers representing Myanmar, Prof William Schabas of Middlesex University, said the Gambia had not addressed the issue of intent to conduct genocide or stated the number of victims. He said a figure of 10,000 used by some commentators was an \u201cexaggeration\u201d, but, even if true, the suggestion of 10,000 deaths out of a total of more than one million Rohingya residents could not constitute an attempt to \u201ccompletely destroy this [ethnic] group\u201d. Christopher Staker, a London-based barrister at 39 Essex Chambers also appearing for Myanmar, alleged Gambia was not the true driving force behind the claim but the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) of which Gambia is only one member. Phoebe Okowa, professor of international rights at Queen Mary University in London, who is also representing Myanmar, told the court that the fact that the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, was meeting with Myanmar to prepare to return Rohingya people meant that they could not be facing a risk of genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s supporters were out in force in front of the ICJ at dawn holdingplacards saying \u201cWe stand with you\u201d. Swe Aye, who lives in the Netherlands, said: \u201cOur leader is the only person who can solve this big issue for our country. This is an accusation against our whole country, not just the military. They should [concentrate on] the perpetrators.\u201d Than Htoo said she had flown in from Myanmar. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the genocide claims,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to tell the world the truth.\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi conceded that her country had made some mistakes. \u201cMyanmar could have done more to emphasise our shared heritage and deeper layers of unity between the different peoples of our country,\u201d she said.

Last year, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum revoked her Elie Wiesel award. Critics claim Aung San Suu Kyi made the surprising decision to appear at the court to contest the well-documented claims because her defiance plays well to her domestic, Buddhist-majority audience and electorate.

It was a massive thing.\u201d</p> <p>Robinson had been hit by a milkshake earlier that week, with a member of the public launching one at him from distance. But Mahmud was standing right in front of him and the impact was dramatic. Robinson lunged at him and threw punches until he was pulled away.</p> <p>The impact of that fleeting moment on Mahmud\u2019s life was enormous. \u201cI had people coming over to me, taking selfies wherever I went,\u201d says Mahmud. \u201cI was getting thousands of messages, literally thousands. I\u2019ve still not read through them all. Dessert bars was offering me to come over, saying: \u2018Have a dessert on us and do promotions for us,\u2019 and stuff like that. People were offering me limousines, car-hiring firms were saying: \u2018Come hire a car from us for free.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The comedians Guz Khan and Tez Ilyas both searched Mahmud out, taking him out for meals and offering him parts in their television shows. He even had a private audience with Jeremy Corbyn when the Labour leader came to visit Blackburn.</p> <p>Despite many people who regarded him a hero, there were those who hated him for what he did. He began receiving death threats. Police mounted extra patrols in his neighbourhood for security. Fearing for his safety and that of his family, Mahmud chose to stay quiet and let it all blow over.</p> <p>He says his friends can\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t want the attention. \u201cEven now, to this day, my friends and that constantly pester me, like: \u2018Why don\u2019t you post anything online ever? Put something on Instagram. Why don\u2019t you just post what you are eating or something like that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I go: \u2018I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u2019\u201d He watched the milkshake saga play out online. \u201cTo be honest, after a while, it got a bit boring for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scott_eff/status/1129486192595079168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The McDonald&#39;s next to the Farage demo.

      "bodyText": "Few could have expected that the year\u2019s biggest protest symbol would be the humble milkshake. But in 2019, they became such pervasive political weapons that when Nigel Farage went to campaign for his Brexit party in Scotland, police asked the local branch of McDonald\u2019s to take them off sale. So loaded was their ideological significance that for publicly flouting and mocking that ban in a tweet, Burger King was sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority for inciting antisocial behaviour. By the eve of European election polling day, just the sight of a milkshake was enough to paralyse the Brexit party campaign, with Farage forced to remain on his bus in Rochester, Kent, after three young men dressed in black and carrying milkshakes were spotted among crowds awaiting his arrival. The Milkshake Spring began in May, when a 23-year-old customer services apprentice, Danyaal Mahmud, was captured on video in Warrington, Cheshire, tipping a milkshake over Tommy Robinson. The imagery was potent: a handsome, slightly built Muslim youth face to face with Britain\u2019s most notorious anti-Islam campaigner. \u201cAt first I was like: wow, I\u2019m actually standing in front of this guy,\u201d says Mahmud, now a fully fledged customer services practitioner. \u201cI was like: am I even breathing the same air as him? \u201cBut then, after it sank in, when he started with his racist, abusive comments and threatening behaviour, the rest obviously was all on the news \u2013 and all over Facebook and Instagram and social media ... It was a massive thing.\u201d Robinson had been hit by a milkshake earlier that week, with a member of the public launching one at him from distance. But Mahmud was standing right in front of him and the impact was dramatic. Robinson lunged at him and threw punches until he was pulled away. The impact of that fleeting moment on Mahmud\u2019s life was enormous. \u201cI had people coming over to me, taking selfies wherever I went,\u201d says Mahmud. \u201cI was getting thousands of messages, literally thousands. I\u2019ve still not read through them all. Dessert bars was offering me to come over, saying: \u2018Have a dessert on us and do promotions for us,\u2019 and stuff like that. People were offering me limousines, car-hiring firms were saying: \u2018Come hire a car from us for free.\u2019\u201d The comedians Guz Khan and Tez Ilyas both searched Mahmud out, taking him out for meals and offering him parts in their television shows. He even had a private audience with Jeremy Corbyn when the Labour leader came to visit Blackburn. Despite many people who regarded him a hero, there were those who hated him for what he did. He began receiving death threats. Police mounted extra patrols in his neighbourhood for security. Fearing for his safety and that of his family, Mahmud chose to stay quiet and let it all blow over. He says his friends can\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t want the attention. \u201cEven now, to this day, my friends and that constantly pester me, like: \u2018Why don\u2019t you post anything online ever? Put something on Instagram. Why don\u2019t you just post what you are eating or something like that?\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I go: \u2018I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u2019\u201d He watched the milkshake saga play out online. \u201cTo be honest, after a while, it got a bit boring for me.\u201d As Mahmud stayed under the radar, \u201cmilkshaking\u201d entered Britain\u2019s political language. Milkshake memes oozed over the websites and social media of leftwing activist sites. Calls went to \u201clactose the intolerant\u201d.

The area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is notoriously polluted and often referred to as Cancer Alley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/cancertown-reserve-louisiana-residents-stories\">'It\u2019s been killing us for 50 years': residents on living in Cancer Town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2018, Residents of Gordon Plaza sued the city of New Orleans and then mayor Mitch Landrieu. The suit, which was passed on to Mayor Cantrell after entering office alleges the city knowingly duped owners into buying on toxic land and that current levels of contamination are above health standards, endangering the lives of residents.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a report by the Louisiana Tumor Registry found the census tract in which Gordon Plaza is located had the second-highest <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_90d7ad47-fe60-5dcc-8ce7-b539f6007ce4.html\">cancer rate in Louisiana</a>, at 745 cases per million people, compared to a state average of 489.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the fight for our lives,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cY\u2019all put us in this situation \u2026 We thought we bought our houses on clean, safe land!\u201d</p> <p>Shannon Rainey, the persistent force behind this decades-long struggle and the president of Residents of Gordon Plaza, put it bluntly: \u201cThey used us as guinea pigs,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew this was a toxic landfill, so y\u2019all used us as guinea pigs to see how long black folks can live on top of a toxic landfill.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The ground beneath their feet</strong></h2> <p>Marilyn Amar doesn\u2019t like to go outside. She keeps the windows and doors at her tidy Gordon Plaza home closed, dusts every day and changes the air vents \u201cconstantly\u201d. A friend takes care of her lawn so she doesn\u2019t have to be exposed to the dust, soil and fumes from her yard that she believes caused her breast cancer. \u201cGod bless him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The 69-year-old New Orleans native has been here for decades. In the 1970s, she lived in the Press Park apartments \u2013 a neighboring public housing site, also built on the landfill, that was ordered closed after Katrina and the last abandoned remnants of which were finally demolished by the city last year.</p> <p>Amar bought her Gordon Plaza home in 1990, never knowing that the site was a former toxic landfill. Before the full extent of soil contamination was revealed, she and her son ate tomatoes from her backyard garden. Now she links that homegrown produce to her cancer and her son\u2019s mysterious childhood illnesses, which ultimately led to intestinal surgery. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecc8a5929f1b4152f353ddcb78c12404e6eb8c9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecc8a5929f1b4152f353ddcb78c12404e6eb8c9f/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs calling for fully-funded relocation support for the residents of Gordon Plaza hang on the fence surrounding Morton elementary school, which sits empty and covered in graffiti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs calling for fully-funded relocation support for the residents of Gordon Plaza hang on the fence surrounding Morton elementary school, which sits empty and covered in graffiti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Widmer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her cancer is not unusual here.

The 75-year-old breast cancer survivor has undergone two surgeries and 28 rounds of radiation to combat the disease.</p> <p>After the area was declared a Superfund site, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the city of New Orleans and Gordon Plaza residents engaged in relocation talks, but couldn\u2019t strike a deal after the city refused to contribute \u201cin-kind services\u201d that could help fund the move.</p> <p>Instead, in 1997 the EPA pursued a controversial clean-up plan: dig up 2ft of the contaminated topsoil, place a permeable liner, known as a geotextile mat, and re-cover it with clean dirt. Only exposed soil was excavated, leaving landfill contamination under homes, sidewalks, roads and any other developed surface.</p> <p>While EPA contractors swarmed the area in hazmat suits, disturbing and piling contaminated soil, residents were not relocated, but instead told it was safe to stay on site.</p> <p>The geotextile mat \u2013 which looks like the thin black fabric often used to line backyard garden beds \u2013 was never meant to stop contaminants or fumes from migrating upwards.

      "bodyText": "In 1988, Jesse Perkins was 27 years old and trying to get his piece of the American dream. With savings from his job at New Orleans\u2019 sewage and water board, he purchased his first home in Gordon Plaza, a newly built subdivision in the city\u2019s Desire neighborhood. The modest single-family home was one of dozens developed by the city\u2019s housing authority, built with the help of federal funds, and marketed as affordable housing to African Americans starting to rise into the city\u2019s middle class. Perkins planned to live there with his mother and, hopefully, one day pass it on to his future children. Now, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it to a dog\u201d. Like other residents who bought in Gordon Plaza in the 80s and early 90s, Perkins says he had no idea his house was built on top of a toxic dump. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from the American dream to a nightmare,\u201d said Perkins, now 68. In his backyard, a giant orange tree grows, but he can\u2019t eat any of its fruit. After chemical drums and other detritus started literally popping out of front yards, the EPA began testing the soil in the 1980s. The land was rich in arsenic, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and had extremely high levels of lead, among other powerful toxins left behind by the Agriculture Street landfill. All told, about 150 contaminants have been found in the soil, 49 of which are known carcinogens. In 1994 the area \u2013 including Gordon Plaza, an elementary school, a public housing development called Press Park apartments and a senior housing complex \u2013 was declared a Superfund site (a US federal government program designed to fund the clean-up of toxic wastes). \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s criminal,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cHow can you treat human beings like this?\u201d \u2018The fight for our lives\u2019 For 50 years, from 1909 to 1958, the city\u2019s medical, municipal and industrial waste was sent here to be incinerated and sprayed with now banned pesticides. In the late 90s city officials started planning low-income housing developments here. Last year, a local developer converted an abandoned building on the original Press Park site into new apartments. A buoyant and friendly man with a quick smile, Perkins is a member of Residents of Gordon Plaza Inc, a community not-for-profit. Despite multiple legal victories, the group has been fighting for relocation since the 1990s, unsuccessfully lobbying six different mayors. They are now ramping up pressure on the current mayor, LaToya Cantrell, to take action. Over the past three decades, residents here have won two class action lawsuits against city agencies and insurance companies totaling more than $26m. A 2015 settlement with insurance companies garnered small payments \u2013 about $3,000 to $10,000 \u2013 for all but nine plaintiffs on the case. But the city has yet to pay out anything because there is no legal mechanism to force them. \u201cThey all hid behind the law,\u201d Perkins says of city officials\u2019 buck-passing. \u201cThat allows them to drag this thing out so long and they will never pay a penny.\u201d The Guardian is running a series called Cancer Town over the course of the next year from Reserve, a small town outside of New Orleans, to draw attention communities who are fighting to win the right to a clean and safe environment for their children. The area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is notoriously polluted and often referred to as Cancer Alley. In 2018, Residents of Gordon Plaza sued the city of New Orleans and then mayor Mitch Landrieu. The suit, which was passed on to Mayor Cantrell after entering office alleges the city knowingly duped owners into buying on toxic land and that current levels of contamination are above health standards, endangering the lives of residents. Earlier this year, a report by the Louisiana Tumor Registry found the census tract in which Gordon Plaza is located had the second-highest cancer rate in Louisiana, at 745 cases per million people, compared to a state average of 489. \u201cWe\u2019re in the fight for our lives,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cY\u2019all put us in this situation \u2026 We thought we bought our houses on clean, safe land!\u201d Shannon Rainey, the persistent force behind this decades-long struggle and the president of Residents of Gordon Plaza, put it bluntly: \u201cThey used us as guinea pigs,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew this was a toxic landfill, so y\u2019all used us as guinea pigs to see how long black folks can live on top of a toxic landfill.\u201d The ground beneath their feet Marilyn Amar doesn\u2019t like to go outside. She keeps the windows and doors at her tidy Gordon Plaza home closed, dusts every day and changes the air vents \u201cconstantly\u201d. A friend takes care of her lawn so she doesn\u2019t have to be exposed to the dust, soil and fumes from her yard that she believes caused her breast cancer. \u201cGod bless him,\u201d she says. The 69-year-old New Orleans native has been here for decades. In the 1970s, she lived in the Press Park apartments \u2013 a neighboring public housing site, also built on the landfill, that was ordered closed after Katrina and the last abandoned remnants of which were finally demolished by the city last year. Amar bought her Gordon Plaza home in 1990, never knowing that the site was a former toxic landfill. Before the full extent of soil contamination was revealed, she and her son ate tomatoes from her backyard garden. Now she links that homegrown produce to her cancer and her son\u2019s mysterious childhood illnesses, which ultimately led to intestinal surgery. Her cancer is not unusual here. In a 1997 report, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) found that women living on the former landfill site had a 60% excess risk of breast cancer. Besides cancer, many residents here report chronic respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin ailments. \u201cI believe if there were at least two Caucasian people back here, we would not still be here,\u201d said Lydwina Hurst, a neighbor of Amar and resident of Gordon Plaza since 1989. The 75-year-old breast cancer survivor has undergone two surgeries and 28 rounds of radiation to combat the disease. After the area was declared a Superfund site, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the city of New Orleans and Gordon Plaza residents engaged in relocation talks, but couldn\u2019t strike a deal after the city refused to contribute \u201cin-kind services\u201d that could help fund the move. Instead, in 1997 the EPA pursued a controversial clean-up plan: dig up 2ft of the contaminated topsoil, place a permeable liner, known as a geotextile mat, and re-cover it with clean dirt. Only exposed soil was excavated, leaving landfill contamination under homes, sidewalks, roads and any other developed surface. While EPA contractors swarmed the area in hazmat suits, disturbing and piling contaminated soil, residents were not relocated, but instead told it was safe to stay on site. The geotextile mat \u2013 which looks like the thin black fabric often used to line backyard garden beds \u2013 was never meant to stop contaminants or fumes from migrating upwards. Instead it serves as a visual cue for anyone digging underground to stop. \u201cThe toxins are still there!\u201d said Amar. \u201cThey did a cover-up, not a clean-up.\u201d By EPA\u2019s own calculations, if soil below the mat were to rise to the surface, cancer risks would increase by nearly fivefold. Like most things in New Orleans, time in Gordon Plaza is divided into \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d Hurricane Katrina. The EPA has maintained Katrina had little impact on its clean-up, even though its soil testing has been limited (Superfund laws don\u2019t require regular comprehensive testing on sites). The agency tested two elements after the storm \u2013 lead and arsenic \u2013 and found lead levels stable. But data gaps have left open questions in the agency\u2019s own conclusions \u2013 a 2008 report notes the risk for PAHs still might pose \u201cindeterminate\u201d risk to residents. After the levees broke and toxic water smothered the area for three weeks, the agency determined the top layer of cover soil survived Katrina and was \u201cprotective of human health\u201d. Outside scientists have drawn very different conclusions. Wilma Subra, a renowned environmental scientist and Superfund expert who helped shape that program\u2019s laws, has served as a technical consultant to Gordon Plaza residents since the 1990s. She says that to this day, residents are being directly exposed to carcinogenic landfill toxins through several pathways. \u201cWe clearly identified that people were in direct contact with contamination,\u201d said Subra, who estimates that the EPA clean-up only touched about 10% of the site\u2019s total area. Subra contends that after Katrina, leachate \u2013 groundwater that has flowed through the contaminated soil, carrying chemicals with it \u2013 flowed across the area. Her tests showed carcinogens such as dioxins, furans and several PAHs were all present in the soil in levels that exceeded regulatory standards. In 1997 Subra estimated relocation would have cost about $12m, compared with the $20m spent for remediation. Residents today are asking the city for $20m to move the 54 families still living there. \u201cEPA believes human health and the environment are protected from hazardous substances found at the Agriculture Street landfill site. Specific health problems affecting an individual are best addressed by discussing them with a healthcare provider,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Between the EPA\u2019s contention that the soil is safe, and the city\u2019s intransigence on relocation or lawsuit payments, residents here are left with few choices: stay, knowing the health risks, or walk away from their investment, an option that anyone who could afford to do so has already exercised. \u201cI feel that we are enslaved in this community,\u201d said Hurst. \u201cEverybody wants to live comfortable.

The American magazine has a long history of racist visual overtones that place people of colour in a subjugated relationship to the imperial gaze of white western photographers. The artists juxtapose images with concrete poetry to create image-text intersections that reveal privileged looking. Dizon writes: \u201cThere are certainly a lot of images where the camera is present, or where a white photographer took a picture within a specific context. Where there is looking, it\u2019s usually a very gendered looking, and those forms of gendered violence across the bodies of both colonized women and men run throughout these images.\u201d</p> <h2>Ken Gonzales-Day</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c1b01fd0e036b0cf6b59311e778170c8a917cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c1b01fd0e036b0cf6b59311e778170c8a917cc/0_0_2100_3300/636.jpg\" alt=\"East First Street (St James Park) from the series \u2018Erased Lynchings\u2019, 2013\" width=\"636\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Gonzales-Day, East First Street (St James Park) from the series </em><em>Erased Lynchings</em><em>, 2013.

This places our attention on the real guilty subjects, those white people who take it upon themselves extrajudicially to police black and brown bodies. The black body is here removed from the gaze of white eyes, a form of sight which undergirds the social dominance of whiteness.

What remains are images that function both as a reflection of the way women are expected to perform as both gendered objects of beauty available to the patriarchal gaze of men, and as complicit possessors of whiteness. In one image, a white woman gazes tearfully into a mirror, perhaps in crisis about her own subjectivity. Of this image, philosopher George Yancy writes that white people should go home this evening and \u201ctake a long look in the mirror and pose this question: what in the hell makes whiteness, <em>my whiteness</em>, so special? By posing the question, they will begin to glimpse the insidious norm that is operating, perhaps they will see the lie that has functioned as the \u2018truth\u2019 for so long, the lie that returns them to themselves as \u2018innocent\u2019 and as disconnected from white supremacy.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Buck Ellison</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6ec87addd9bec8f3e72024d522bf8424a1c8e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ec87addd9bec8f3e72024d522bf8424a1c8e0c/0_0_2500_1892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prince Children, Holland, Michigan, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Buck Ellison, The Prince Children, Holland, Michigan, 2019.

      "bodyText": "White people are blind to the dominance of white visuality, and we can understand this most clearly with the invention and popularization of photography \u2013 a visual world white people created in our own image. What if the canonical history of photography is best understood not as an objective \u201chistory of pictures\u201d, but as a history of white visuality, even white visual racism? What if the camera is the extension of the white eye? In order to untie ourselves from whiteness, and from white dominant photographic practices, we need to subvert what I call \u201cthe image of whiteness\u201d. Images are, after all, forms of imagination \u2013 so why can\u2019t we imagine a world without whiteness, without white eyes? In the hope that we might get there someday, let\u2019s consider how contemporary photographic art on the subject of whiteness, in its varying subtleties and guises, can be put to use as a form of subversion, or disruption \u2013 a rebuttal to white visual culture. How might photography be reclaimed from its own history, in order to help even white people see anew? The Image of Whiteness introduces readers to extracts from the troubling story of whiteness, describing its falsehoods, its paradoxes and its oppressive nature, and highlights some of the work contemporary photographic artists are doing to subvert and critique its image and its continuing power. Below is a selection of some images from the book. Michelle Dizon and Vi\u1ec7t L\u00ea Michelle Dizon &amp; Vi\u1ec7t L\u00ea, White Gaze (book spread), 2018. Courtesy the artists and Sming Sming Books. In White Gaze, Michelle Dizon and Vi\u1ec7t L\u00ea appropriate photographs from the National Geographic archive and put them to anti-racist use. The American magazine has a long history of racist visual overtones that place people of colour in a subjugated relationship to the imperial gaze of white western photographers. The artists juxtapose images with concrete poetry to create image-text intersections that reveal privileged looking. Dizon writes: \u201cThere are certainly a lot of images where the camera is present, or where a white photographer took a picture within a specific context. Where there is looking, it\u2019s usually a very gendered looking, and those forms of gendered violence across the bodies of both colonized women and men run throughout these images.\u201d Ken Gonzales-Day Gonzales-Day, East First Street (St James Park) from the series Erased Lynchings, 2013. Courtesy the artist and Luis De Jesus Los Angeles. Ken Gonzalez-Day\u2019s images from the series Erased Lynchings sees the artist digitally remove the dead hanging body of a nameless murdered person of colour, in order to avoid re-victimising the individual. This places our attention on the real guilty subjects, those white people who take it upon themselves extrajudicially to police black and brown bodies. The black body is here removed from the gaze of white eyes, a form of sight which undergirds the social dominance of whiteness. Gonzales-Day writes: \u201cThe work asks viewers to consider the crowd, the spectacle, the role of the photographer, and even the impact of flash photography, and their various contributions to our understanding of racialized violence in this nation.\u201d Hank Willis Thomas Hank Willis Thomas, Wipe Away the Years 1932/2015, from the series Unbranded: A Century of White Women, 1915-2015. Courtesy the artists and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York. Hank Willis Thomas\u2019s works Unbranded: A Century of White Women, 1915-2015, are made by appropriating old advertisements and removing logos and text. What remains are images that function both as a reflection of the way women are expected to perform as both gendered objects of beauty available to the patriarchal gaze of men, and as complicit possessors of whiteness. In one image, a white woman gazes tearfully into a mirror, perhaps in crisis about her own subjectivity. Of this image, philosopher George Yancy writes that white people should go home this evening and \u201ctake a long look in the mirror and pose this question: what in the hell makes whiteness, my whiteness, so special? By posing the question, they will begin to glimpse the insidious norm that is operating, perhaps they will see the lie that has functioned as the \u2018truth\u2019 for so long, the lie that returns them to themselves as \u2018innocent\u2019 and as disconnected from white supremacy.\u201d Buck Ellison Buck Ellison, The Prince Children, Holland, Michigan, 2019.

Its director, Kimberly Peirce, said: \u201cTwenty years later, it still feels like a miracle that Boys Don\u2019t Cry got made. I fell in love with Brandon Teena and his desire to live and love as himself in a time and place where that was impossible. \u201cI felt a powerful conviction to bring Brandon to life on screen, so audiences would love him as I did and share my horror at his rape and murder. To our amazement, the world embraced Brandon. It is meaningful to me as a film-maker, a genderqueer and as a person that the Library of Congress has recognised Boys Don\u2019t Cry. This moment is a culmination, unimaginable and wonderful.\u201d Only one woman has won an Oscar for best director: Kathryn Bigelow for 2009\u2019s The Hurt Locker. The national film registry, which now has 775 titles, is dominated by men. But the 2019 list adds the 1984 documentary Before Stonewall, directed by Greta Schiller; Claudia Weill\u2019s 1978 Girlfriends; Gunvor Nelson\u2019s 1969 avant-garde film My Name is Oona; A New Leaf, which in 1971 made Elaine May the first woman to write, direct and star in a major American studio feature; and the 2002 indie Real Women Have Curves, directed by Patricia Cardoso and starring America Ferrera. This year\u2019s selections span a century of film-making, from 1903 to 2003. They include Amadeus, a 1984 film about the composer Antonio Salieri\u2019s dark envy of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, starring F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, and Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter, a 1980 biopic about the country singer-songwriter Loretta Lynn. The film\u2019s director, Michael Apted, said: \u201cIt means the world to me that the world will know that Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter has been acknowledged as an important and lasting film. For a young British director to be given the reins to capture what was truly a deep American subject was beyond rewarding.\u201d Also included is Prince\u2019s 1984 autobiographical hit Purple Rain. Co-star Apollonia Kotero was quoted by the library as saying: \u201cAs a young Latina actress, being cast in Purple Rain was the opportunity of a lifetime. \u201cRoles for women that looked like me were scarce in the 80s. Prince was never afraid of taking risks. He created a melting pot of cultures and racial interactions within his purple worlds \u2026 Prince would be thrilled.\u201d There are nods too for the 1944 movie Gaslight, starring Ingrid Bergman; Disney\u2019s 1959 fairytale Sleeping Beauty; Spike Lee\u2019s 1986 breakout film, She\u2019s Gotta Have It, and Oliver Stone\u2019s Oscar-winning Platoon from the same year; Kevin Smith\u2019s Clerks, from 1994, and The Last Waltz, Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1978 documentary that pays homage to the epic farewell concert by the Band. The most recent film on the list is the documentary Fog of War, in which the former defence secretary Robert McNamara contemplates his role in shaping American military and foreign policy. Carla Hayden, the first woman and first African American to lead the Library of Congress, said: \u201cUnlike many other honours, the registry is not restricted to a time, place or genre. It encompasses 130 years of the full American cinematic experience \u2013 a virtual Olympiad of motion pictures. \u201cWith the support of Congress, the studios and other archives, we are ensuring that the nation\u2019s cinematic history will be around for generations to come.\u201d The list was praised for its inclusiveness. Jacqueline Stewart, chair of the National Film Preservation Board\u2019s taskforce on diversity, equity and inclusion, said: \u201cWith this year\u2019s national film registry selections, Dr Hayden recognises the importance of amplifying cinematic voices and stories that have been marginalised for far too long.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Garry O\u2019Connor\u2019s book about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen</a> is as much involved with ideas as it is with facts. It makes no claim to be an exhaustive account. O\u2019Connor has been writing more or less experimental biographies of actors for many years, starting with his classic account of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/09/theatrenews.theatre\" title=\"\"> Ralph Richardson</a>, continuing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/20/2\" title=\"\">Paul Scofield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/08/1\" title=\"\">Alec Guinness</a> (twice) and a fine double portrait of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/02/laurence-olivier-vivien-leigh-love-letters\" title=\"\">Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh</a>. A former drama critic, he is fascinated by the mystery of great acting. Of the present volume, he says, quoting Hamlet, but sounding more like a fairground barker: \u201cHere is the height, the presumption of my endeavour: to \u2018pluck out the heart\u2019 of the Ian McKellen mystery \u2013 how such a single being could create a monumental career of such depth and span; where the ever-charging source of his energy comes from; and how his personality and character have continued to develop and change throughout his life. All in all to make it speak as it never has before, to sound him from his lowest note to the top of his compass.\u201d</p> <p>There is a McKellen mystery and at its centre is his duality, his paradoxical capacity to be both/and. He is simultaneously \u201cdeeply secretive, intensely private\u201d, as his former partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/30/masterclass-sean-mathias\" title=\"\">Sean Mathias </a>says, and perhaps the most open and accessible personality British theatre has ever produced.</p> <p>Even his influences are contradictory, both roundhead and cavalier: on the one hand the Marlowe Society at Cambridge, where he imbibed the principles of rigorous textual fidelity and deep moral purpose; on the other Olivier, living embodiment of the theatrical. His approach is strikingly similar to Olivier\u2019s. Both are great prose actors, resistant to lyricism and displays of personal emotion; both need to root everything in observed reality.</p> <p>They had opposite journeys: Olivier a beetle-browed, gap-toothed boy with huge eyes and thin lips, physically slight, a whippet who turned himself into a panther; McKellen, built like a carthorse, who, to begin with, when he was concealing his sexuality, hid his underlying power under a carapace of assumed prettiness, which made him seem rather camp. When he came out as gay, which coincided with middle-age, he stripped himself of all that and revealed his earthiness, his masculinity. Coming out, as McKellen has tirelessly insisted, is a wonderful thing: one is finally relieved of whatever mask one has been wearing and is able to acknowledge not just who one wants to sleep with but who and what one really is. And \u2013 supreme bonus \u2013 it makes for better acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f03b0c493c879c679b76369479d63919d69cfffe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03b0c493c879c679b76369479d63919d69cfffe/0_0_5250_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The actor in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The actor in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Smith/Radio Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is paradox here, though, even on the physical plane: his sizable feet are rarely still, tracing elaborate dainty patterns across the boards. His physical transformations have been extraordinary, none more so than his semi-paralysed, proto-Mosley Richard III: utterly, chillingly credible, a real threat. But here he differs from his hero Olivier, and also from Antony Sher, both of whom, in that role, created fairytale ogres, figures out of nightmare, dredged, one can only presume, from the actors\u2019 subconscious selves. McKellen\u2019s Richard was a different kind of nightmare, the sort whose hyper-realism is what renders it truly disturbing. Olivier created mythic figures, McKellen full-length portraits. So it was with his King Lear: characterised not by mental befuddlement but by a terrifying clarity of each individual thought, thoughts unconnected but each one perfectly coherent, Nietzschean aphorisms spoken in the glare of a lightning flash.</p> <p>Where, O\u2019Connor asks, does it all come from? A remote father and a caring but not especially close mother who died early? Well, yes, but more revealing is McKellen\u2019s remarkable comment about the autobiography he gave up writing: \u201cI was getting too emotionally upset that I hadn\u2019t been a good enough child, because I\u2019d not shown enough interest in them.\u201d A devastating assessment, but it suggests that he didn\u2019t allow himself to be close to them because he feared their power over him, feared being hurt or rejected by them, so declared his independence of them as early as possible.</p> <p>His deep amorous commitments \u2013 and there appear to have been few of them \u2013 seem to have followed a similar pattern: his first long and stable relationship became stiflingly domestic, so he left; his second, more turbulent relationship, with Mathias, was too unsettling. O\u2019Connor\u2019s revelation is about McKellen\u2019s passionate involvement with the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2019/mar/02/50-years-of-joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Gary Bond</a>, one of the theatre\u2019s <em>grands horizontals</em>, with whom he seems to have fallen deeply in love. But that left him too vulnerable; it would have stopped him from doing what he wanted to do with his life, so it too ended. He briefly flirted with directing, he has been a formidable spokesman for LGBT rights, he has been close to power. But acting is what his life has been all about, and he has done it in an astonishing multiplicity of ways, on stages large and small, metropolitan and regional, in the great companies and in the commercial theatre, at the centre of a large cast and on his own.</p> <p>Like Maggie Smith, he is, in the end, the great actor he is because it matters so much to him. Not the event or even the play but the fact that he is more fully alive, more fully himself, on stage than anywhere else. Crucial to his art is that we are in it with him. No fourth wall illusions for McKellen: it is all shared with an audience with whom his complicity is very frank \u2013 \u201cDid you see what I just did?\u201d being the unspoken question. And in life, when he is not on the stage, he is in the wings \u2013 always ready, as actors are in the wings, to share a joke or to become fascinated by some fresh thought, while all the while waiting and ready for the heightened life once they step into the light. His audiences have loved him for it, though few of the characters he has played have been lovable.</p> <p>It is another McKellenish paradox that relatively late in his career, and on film, he should at last have found himself playing a character who has been universally loved, in a semi-Christian fantasy filled with elaborate pseudo-profundities of the sort that would normally be anathema to him. O\u2019Connor devotes a long chapter to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/lord-rings-trilogy-fantasy\" title=\"\">The Lord of the Rings</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/lord-rings-trilogy-fantasy\" title=\"\">,</a> teasing out tenuous connections between Tolkien and McKellen himself, but the simple truth is that playing an embodiment of wisdom and truth and essential benevolence has made the actor very happy (and very rich).</p> <p>By the end of O\u2019Connor\u2019s fascinating voyage round McKellen, the author has, as he says, peeled away as many layers as he could.

Without wickedness and temptation there can be no road to maturity. The director and his multitasking ensemble treat the tale with the seriousness it deserves.</p> <p>And yet with playfulness, too. On an ersatz Victorian theatre set by Rachael Canning that aches to be back in the company\u2019s Gorbals home, the actors find their props in wicker baskets and take turns drumming up sound effects according to Nikola Kodjabashia\u2019s off-kilter score. Whether funny or frightening, they are always sincere.</p> <p>A case in point is Pinocchio himself, voiced by Liam King. He and Elisa De Grey manipulate the puppet with total concentration, their focus entirely on the boy, who seems all the more vulnerable for it.

They\u2019re as deceptive as Irene Allan\u2019s glamorous Florenzina while she lures poor wooden Pinocchio with a promise of year-round play. No, Dominic Hill\u2019s superb staging for his exiled Citizens theatre is concerned only about drawing us into the darkest corners of Carlo Collodi\u2019s allegory. Without wickedness and temptation there can be no road to maturity. The director and his multitasking ensemble treat the tale with the seriousness it deserves. And yet with playfulness, too. On an ersatz Victorian theatre set by Rachael Canning that aches to be back in the company\u2019s Gorbals home, the actors find their props in wicker baskets and take turns drumming up sound effects according to Nikola Kodjabashia\u2019s off-kilter score. Whether funny or frightening, they are always sincere. A case in point is Pinocchio himself, voiced by Liam King. He and Elisa De Grey manipulate the puppet with total concentration, their focus entirely on the boy, who seems all the more vulnerable for it. With a telescopic nose extending like a radio aerial after every lie (Boris and Stanley Johnson eat your hearts out), he is naive and trusting as much as he is naughty and rebellious, and all the more lovable for it. Not that you could be more lovable than Gary Lilburn\u2019s Geppetto, who captures the quiet tragedy of a man out of time, his principles intact while a post-puppet world passes him by. There are lovely performances, too, from Andy Clark, Stephanie Payne and Helen Katamba as fox, cat and cricket in a sparky adaptation by Robert Alan Evans. At Tramway, Glasgow, until 4 January.",

If you can remember back as far as 2006, you may recall seeing pictures of Ljungberg gazing out of huge billboards in just his smalls after signing a deal with Calvin Klein.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWith the interim appointment of Freddie Ljungberg as Arsenal manager, the Gunners now have a former professional underwear model in charge,\u201d begins Sam Rowe. \u201cAre there any other managers who have once been models, past or present, excluding players modelling their team\u2019s kit?\u201d Let\u2019s start by giving you a bit of context on how and why Ljungberg came to be an underpants model. If you can remember back as far as 2006, you may recall seeing pictures of Ljungberg gazing out of huge billboards in just his smalls after signing a deal with Calvin Klein. The story goes that he only landed the contract because David Beckham was reluctant to compromise his image in the UK. Initially Ljungberg had no such reservations and was paired with the Russian model Natalia Vodianova for a global campaign but he soon grew weary of seeing his own flesh everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to see yourself on billboards and I don\u2019t really enjoy it now,\u201d he said in 2007, when he hung up his briefs. He\u2019s far from the only future manager to have posed in their undies for cash. Here\u2019s Tom Aldous: \u201cLjungberg\u2019s old teammate and current Montreal Impact manager Thierry Henry has done some modelling for Nike, Puma and Reebok. Also there was this campaign from Dolce and Gabbana and the Italian national team in 2006. Of the five chaps in the photo, four of them became managers while Andrea Pirlo is now an international playboy. The quartet and their teams managed are: Gianluca Zambrotta (Chiasso and Delhi Dynamos), Manuele Blasi (Hamrun Spartans), Gennaro Gattuso (Milan, Palermo, Pisa, OFI Crete) and Fabio Cannavaro (Guangzhou Evergrande, Al-Nassr, Tianjin Quanjian, China). D&amp;G actually reprised this campaign in 2010 but to date none of the players who featured in it have gone on to management. From the same campaign involving Italy players in 2006, Justin Lim points us in the direction of this well-oiled image including Gattuso, Zambrotta and Cannavaro. Eduardo Enrique Villanueva Mansilla writes: \u201cJuan Carlos Oblitas, a left winger that played in two World Cups and then became manager of Sporting Cristal and Peru\u2019s national team (missing out on qualification to France 98 by one point), was one of many football players modelling for Glostora, a male hair gel.

      "body": "<p>The British Horseracing Authority has responded to criticism of its \u201cstop race\u201d procedures in the wake of the chaotic scenes surrounding the London National at Sandown on Saturday, insisting that yellow is the best colour for flags warning jockeys to stop racing and that the entry-point penalty of a 10-day ban for failing to stop is appropriate given \u201cthe risk to human and equine life should a [subsequent] collision take place\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dan Skelton, whose brother Harry is one of the seven jockeys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/dec/09/talking-horses-sandown-seven-either-failed-to-see-the-flag-or-ignored-it\">facing Christmas on the sidelines</a>, was one of several trainers to criticise the procedures on Saturday, saying that it \u201cis completely inadequate to have just one flag out there\u201d. Neil Mulholland, whose horse Doing Fine was first past the post in the void race, said that the process \u201cis just not good enough in this day and age\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/10/talking-horses-tuesday-top-tips-racing-news\">Talking Horses: Native River in line for King George if ground is testing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While the BHA offered no comment on the specifics of the Sandown case ahead of an appeal by seven jockeys who received 10-day bans as a result, the Authority said in a blog <a href=\"https://www.britishhorseracing.com/importance-stop-race-procedure/\">posted to its website on Tuesday afternoon</a> that it had been \u201csurprised by some of the comment since the incident\u201d. It also singled out an article in Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post by journalist David Jennings, which it claimed \u201cis based on a misunderstanding of the serious risks involved and how the sport\u2019s rules are designed to deter behaviour that might add to the risk\u201d.</p> \n<p>In response to a number of suggestions that a red flag could be more visible than the current yellow, the BHA\u2019s blog said that this option \u201chas been rejected in the past because one in 12 males and one in 200 females are colour blind with red/green colour blindness being the most common\u201d. It added: \u201cLuminous yellow flags are visible in all conditions and designed to be consistent with the flags waved by starters and advanced flag operators. Wherever you are on a course, a yellow flag being raised or waved means \u201cdon\u2019t race\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Authority also describes as \u201cirresponsible\u201d a suggestion that pulling up for a yellow could be \u201ca risk not worth taking\u201d. This, it said, \u201cdoes not consider the more pertinent and serious scenario of a jockey continuing to ride and then colliding with a horse or human receiving treatment. <em>This</em> is the risk that is not worth taking and this is what the stop race procedures are designed to prevent.\u201d</p> \n<p>The decision to stop Saturday\u2019s race was taken after Houblon Des Obeaux suffered a fatal heart attack on the first circuit and collapsed on the racing line.

      "bodyText": "The British Horseracing Authority has responded to criticism of its \u201cstop race\u201d procedures in the wake of the chaotic scenes surrounding the London National at Sandown on Saturday, insisting that yellow is the best colour for flags warning jockeys to stop racing and that the entry-point penalty of a 10-day ban for failing to stop is appropriate given \u201cthe risk to human and equine life should a [subsequent] collision take place\u201d. Dan Skelton, whose brother Harry is one of the seven jockeys facing Christmas on the sidelines, was one of several trainers to criticise the procedures on Saturday, saying that it \u201cis completely inadequate to have just one flag out there\u201d. Neil Mulholland, whose horse Doing Fine was first past the post in the void race, said that the process \u201cis just not good enough in this day and age\u201d. While the BHA offered no comment on the specifics of the Sandown case ahead of an appeal by seven jockeys who received 10-day bans as a result, the Authority said in a blog posted to its website on Tuesday afternoon that it had been \u201csurprised by some of the comment since the incident\u201d. It also singled out an article in Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post by journalist David Jennings, which it claimed \u201cis based on a misunderstanding of the serious risks involved and how the sport\u2019s rules are designed to deter behaviour that might add to the risk\u201d. In response to a number of suggestions that a red flag could be more visible than the current yellow, the BHA\u2019s blog said that this option \u201chas been rejected in the past because one in 12 males and one in 200 females are colour blind with red/green colour blindness being the most common\u201d. It added: \u201cLuminous yellow flags are visible in all conditions and designed to be consistent with the flags waved by starters and advanced flag operators. Wherever you are on a course, a yellow flag being raised or waved means \u201cdon\u2019t race\u201d. The Authority also describes as \u201cirresponsible\u201d a suggestion that pulling up for a yellow could be \u201ca risk not worth taking\u201d. This, it said, \u201cdoes not consider the more pertinent and serious scenario of a jockey continuing to ride and then colliding with a horse or human receiving treatment. This is the risk that is not worth taking and this is what the stop race procedures are designed to prevent.\u201d The decision to stop Saturday\u2019s race was taken after Houblon Des Obeaux suffered a fatal heart attack on the first circuit and collapsed on the racing line. Two of the jockeys on the nine remaining runners after another circuit obeyed the yellow flag but seven continued around the third-last fence and then also raced around a tarpaulin covering Houblon Des Obeaux\u2019s body. The seven riders\u2019 appeals against their 10-day bans for continuing to race are expected to be heard next Tuesday. If the bans are upheld, Skelton, Adam Wedge, Daryl Jacob, James Davies, Jamie Moore, Stan Sheppard and Philip Donovan will all miss the busy and lucrative Christmas programme, when demand for jockeys is at a premium. Wednesday\u2019s best bets Leicester\u2019s meeting has passed a precautionary inspection so there is a full programme of five meetings, but the going at the Midlands track is going to be testing, on the hurdles course in particular, and bets may be best kept to a minimum there with only Chambard (2.30), in the handicap chase, making much appeal. It is heavy at Hexham too, where Lastin Memories (2.50) has a big chance to register a first win over fences after a promising chase debut over course and distance three weeks ago. He finished less than two lengths behind Mah Mate Bob and a neck in front of Warendorf, who was a winner next time out, and is only 1lb higher in the ratings. Smuggler\u2019s Stash (12.50) and Casimir Du Clos (1.50) are also fairly priced on the same card, while the consistent Kwela (1.40) is a decent price for the fillies\u2019 handicap at Lingfield Park at around 7-1. Elena (2.40) is still a maiden but has been running well recently and could offer some value against favourite Subliminal, while Ruby Power (4.10) should go well in the nursery at Kempton.",

Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979.

As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.</p>\n    <p>These \"rapid\" and \"unprecedented\" changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card.

The types of injury varied in magnitude from batteries exploding to injuries sustained by walking into a lamppost. The researchers wanted to encourage users to be more aware of the dangers of dividing their attention between tasks, and to educate people on how to prevent such issues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/05/tell-us-about-your-mobile-phone-injuries\">We asked Guardian readers</a> to respond with their own examples of phone-related injuries and were greeted with tales of punching chairs, football-style saves and black eyes. Here are some of our favourites:</p> <h2>\u2018My phone went flying and I shattered my elbow\u2019</h2> <p>A year ago I was away for one night on business in Nottingham and I didn\u2019t like the look of the hotel menu so set out to eat at a nice fish restaurant that I knew. Not knowing how to get there I decided to follow Google maps. Unfortunately, I searched the wrong name and ended up following a route far longer than I expected through some dubious looking areas. </p> <p>After walking for nearly an hour following Google maps (the restaurant was only 10 minutes away from my hotel) I concluded I was lost and headed towards a local tram stop believing it was the quickest route back. Still examining Google maps, I stepped off the kerb, checking for traffic first, only to kick the kerb on the other side and fall straight down. My phone went flying (and smashed) and I shattered my elbow. I gave up my venture in excruciating pain, lost, hungry and with a broken phone all in one night. <strong>Robert, 51, director, Swindon</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I slipped down a steep set of stairs\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One morning I was watching a YouTube video of the Superbowl half-time show where Madonna kissed Britney and Christina. I slipped down a steep set of stairs, taking off most of the skin on my left side and leaving me with a terrible ache in my elbow in cold weather that I now affectionately refer to as \u201cMadonna elbow\u201d whenever it strikes. I learnt a lesson that day! <strong>Gwen, 34, lawyer, Liverpool</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m not a professional and the \u2018ball\u2019 was a rock solid phone\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I dropped my old iPhone (the big one) and instead of letting it drop to the ground in its case, I tried to cushion the fall by catching it with my foot. My aim was to replicate to some extent how a professional footballer cushions a long ball out of the sky ... the problem is I\u2019m not a professional and the \u2018ball\u2019 was a rock solid phone. My foot was in agony for a week but at least my phone screen didn\u2019t break! <strong>Rakin, 26, accountant, Hull</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I ended up dislocating the knuckle of my ring finger and breaking my metacarpal\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In March 2017 I took a phone call, once it ended I hung up and somehow my phone dropped out of my hand. Instinctively I went to catch my phone with my right hand, which managed to do. Unfortunately, in doing so I effectively punched the chair which my phone was falling towards. I dislocated the knuckle of my ring finger and broke my metacarpal. I was in a sling for a week which made for some nice graduation photos three days after the injury. I had to keep my hand in a cast for six weeks. My phone was completely fine though. <strong>Samir Gelb, 25, intern, Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018What was less funny was waking up on Christmas day with a huge, swollen black eye\u2019</strong></h2> <p>When I was a teenager two of my friends had classic Nokia brick phones, the indestructible kind. Because of their tough exterior they used to play a game called \u2018phone skid\u2019 where they would skim them hard and fast across the ground at each other and try and score points \u2013 kind of like a penalty shoot out. </p> <p>One Christmas Eve, we were out in town and a raucous game of phone skid began. I sat on the kerb to observe the match, when out of nowhere, a Nokia 3310 travelling at light speed ricocheted from the tarmac and hit me square in the face, right on my cheekbone. At the time, though painful, it was hilarious. What was less funny was waking up on Christmas Day with a huge, swollen black eye and having to explain to my family what had happened. <strong>Ginny, 24, social media manager, Bristol</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I found myself in mid-air having just stepped off the wall\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I was talking on my mobile whilst walking along the sea wall in Portland. Suddenly I found myself in mid-air having just stepped off the wall. As it was unexpected, I landed on the pebbled beach stiff-legged which caused me the initial fear that I had broken my legs. Eventually, I managed to crawl back into the pub shamefacedly where friends were meeting and explain what had happened. Luckily I didn\u2019t sustain any long term injury. <strong>Anonymous, 62</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I just ended up pouring the boiling water all over myself\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I was a couple of weeks into my first year of university, and discovering how veritably incompetent I was when it came to performing basic tasks.

      "bodyText": "A study in the US has found that since the release of the first iPhone in 2007 phone-related injuries have risen dramatically. The types of injury varied in magnitude from batteries exploding to injuries sustained by walking into a lamppost. The researchers wanted to encourage users to be more aware of the dangers of dividing their attention between tasks, and to educate people on how to prevent such issues. We asked Guardian readers to respond with their own examples of phone-related injuries and were greeted with tales of punching chairs, football-style saves and black eyes. Here are some of our favourites: \u2018My phone went flying and I shattered my elbow\u2019 A year ago I was away for one night on business in Nottingham and I didn\u2019t like the look of the hotel menu so set out to eat at a nice fish restaurant that I knew. Not knowing how to get there I decided to follow Google maps. Unfortunately, I searched the wrong name and ended up following a route far longer than I expected through some dubious looking areas. After walking for nearly an hour following Google maps (the restaurant was only 10 minutes away from my hotel) I concluded I was lost and headed towards a local tram stop believing it was the quickest route back. Still examining Google maps, I stepped off the kerb, checking for traffic first, only to kick the kerb on the other side and fall straight down. My phone went flying (and smashed) and I shattered my elbow. I gave up my venture in excruciating pain, lost, hungry and with a broken phone all in one night. Robert, 51, director, Swindon \u2018I slipped down a steep set of stairs\u2019 One morning I was watching a YouTube video of the Superbowl half-time show where Madonna kissed Britney and Christina. I slipped down a steep set of stairs, taking off most of the skin on my left side and leaving me with a terrible ache in my elbow in cold weather that I now affectionately refer to as \u201cMadonna elbow\u201d whenever it strikes. I learnt a lesson that day! Gwen, 34, lawyer, Liverpool \u2018I\u2019m not a professional and the \u2018ball\u2019 was a rock solid phone\u2019 I dropped my old iPhone (the big one) and instead of letting it drop to the ground in its case, I tried to cushion the fall by catching it with my foot. My aim was to replicate to some extent how a professional footballer cushions a long ball out of the sky ... the problem is I\u2019m not a professional and the \u2018ball\u2019 was a rock solid phone. My foot was in agony for a week but at least my phone screen didn\u2019t break! Rakin, 26, accountant, Hull \u2018I ended up dislocating the knuckle of my ring finger and breaking my metacarpal\u2019 In March 2017 I took a phone call, once it ended I hung up and somehow my phone dropped out of my hand. Instinctively I went to catch my phone with my right hand, which managed to do. Unfortunately, in doing so I effectively punched the chair which my phone was falling towards. I dislocated the knuckle of my ring finger and broke my metacarpal. I was in a sling for a week which made for some nice graduation photos three days after the injury. I had to keep my hand in a cast for six weeks. My phone was completely fine though. Samir Gelb, 25, intern, Johannesburg \u2018What was less funny was waking up on Christmas day with a huge, swollen black eye\u2019 When I was a teenager two of my friends had classic Nokia brick phones, the indestructible kind. Because of their tough exterior they used to play a game called \u2018phone skid\u2019 where they would skim them hard and fast across the ground at each other and try and score points \u2013 kind of like a penalty shoot out. One Christmas Eve, we were out in town and a raucous game of phone skid began. I sat on the kerb to observe the match, when out of nowhere, a Nokia 3310 travelling at light speed ricocheted from the tarmac and hit me square in the face, right on my cheekbone. At the time, though painful, it was hilarious. What was less funny was waking up on Christmas Day with a huge, swollen black eye and having to explain to my family what had happened. Ginny, 24, social media manager, Bristol \u2018I found myself in mid-air having just stepped off the wall\u2019 I was talking on my mobile whilst walking along the sea wall in Portland. Suddenly I found myself in mid-air having just stepped off the wall. As it was unexpected, I landed on the pebbled beach stiff-legged which caused me the initial fear that I had broken my legs. Eventually, I managed to crawl back into the pub shamefacedly where friends were meeting and explain what had happened. Luckily I didn\u2019t sustain any long term injury. Anonymous, 62 \u2018I just ended up pouring the boiling water all over myself\u2019 I was a couple of weeks into my first year of university, and discovering how veritably incompetent I was when it came to performing basic tasks. I was boiling eggs for my lunch one day, very pleased with myself that I\u2019d finally worked how long to wait to get that perfect runny yolk. My mistake was that I was on the phone at the same time, doing that thing you see in 90s movies where they cradle the smartphone between their shoulder and cheek. I got so involved in bragging about my eggs on the phone that I forgot to take them off the boil, realised this, and rushed to pour the water out of the pan completely haphazardly. But ... I was still trying to hold the phone, so I just ended up pouring the boiling water all over myself. Worst thing was, I stayed on the phone for half an hour maintaining it didn\u2019t hurt that much until my stomach and hand literally started blistering up. So, I finally removed myself from the phone and went and waited three hours in an NHS walk-in centre. I still have the scars, and since then I have not divided my attention between my phone and boiling eggs. Jasmine, 21, student, Sheffield",

It upset me that I liked my new reflection so much, because I didn\u2019t know <em>why</em> I was happy with it. For years, I had subscribed to the notion that defining women\u2019s worth by their weight was a feminist cardinal sin. Like countless others, I had found self-love and acceptance in the arms of the body positivity movement.</p> <p>It offered me a welcome respite from the stress of constantly looking at myself with a critical eye, as well as a counterattack to the once prevailing idea that shame gets bodies in shape (<a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-war-on-childhood-obesity-needs-a-war-on-blame/\">it doesn\u2019t</a>). So why was I so happy at the sight of my new, thinner shape?</p> <p>I lost more than 100 pounds in two parts over 18 months, during two big stages of my life. The first occurred when I went from a depressed, overworked college student to a stressed, fully employed adult. I replaced meals with coffee and ate once daily \u2013 usually the easiest thing I could pop into the microwave after a 12-hour day. On top of my 9-5 job, my four-hour daily commute made finding any time for myself nearly impossible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It upset me that I liked my new reflection so much, because I didn\u2019t know why I was happy with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My body responded to my new environment by shedding 50 pounds, but even then I knew my weight loss wasn\u2019t healthy. My stress had reached a peak, and all I could do was shrink in the face of it. I had no time for physical activity, and if I was lucky enough to get a day off, I was too exhausted to move anyways. The stuff I consumed could barely be called food; I ate quick meals rife with saturated fats and sodium that just made me more sluggish. Research backs this up: stressful jobs <a href=\"https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/eating-your-feelings-the-link-between-job-stress-junk-food-and-sleep/\">lead to poor eating</a>, junk food <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/26/eating-junk-food-raises-risk-of-depression-says-multi-country-study\">makes us depressed</a> and failing mental health <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338017\">becomes a roadblock</a> to improving health.</p> <p>I bristled whenever someone congratulated me on my weight loss. To accept outsiders\u2019 compliments on my weight loss was to betray the body-positive ethos I had adopted.</p> <p>And then, just as easily as I had adopted it, I threw that life away. Less than a year into my first full-time job, I quit to travel Europe for five months. Suddenly, I had a limitless resource of something I hadn\u2019t had my entire working life: time. I could spend all day walking, climbing or hiking in a different country. I could stroll through local markets, relishing the hues and aromas of the displayed fruits and vegetables, to pick foods that made me happy and gave me the energy I needed to keep exploring. Regular physical activity, a Mediterranean-style diet and freedom to do as I pleased changed me, and I lost another 60lb.</p> <p>When I came back home to the US, my family and friends were shocked by my dramatic transformation and my weight loss was only part of it. Yes, I was smaller, but I also looked happier. I was more confident and said stuff like: \u201cYou know what would be so fun right now? A bike ride.\u201d I even got a cool haircut. My new body was a reflection of the new life I was living.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes my friends noticed is how experimental and colorful my fashion sense has become, compared with when all I wore was an ensemble of leggings and a T-shirt. Being more confident helps, but buying cool clothes is just easier the less fat you are. Albeit I\u2019m still a solid size 14, but the realm of possibilities for my wardrobe has vastly expanded from the ironically slim size-20-and-up rack I used to shop from. I can put more care into my appearance and feel more secure in the way I present myself to the world because I actually have options.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one thing, though. My new commitment to health has also bordered on obsession at times. I don\u2019t want to fall back on my old habits, so I pore over the ingredients in everything I eat.

      "bodyText": "The first time I felt body euphoria was in an Old Navy dressing room. The floor was sticky with inexplicable customer gunk, a toddler was sobbing in the next stall and I was wearing jeans five sizes smaller than usual. I gaped at my reflection in awe. It\u2019s not just that the jeans fit; I could also see my collarbones, which had been hidden under layers of fat and tissue for so long that I forgot I had them. My jaw line was more pronounced, and my belly didn\u2019t jut out the way I remembered it to. I had lost more than 100 pounds, and I could see the difference right there in the mirror. With euphoria came guilt. It upset me that I liked my new reflection so much, because I didn\u2019t know why I was happy with it. For years, I had subscribed to the notion that defining women\u2019s worth by their weight was a feminist cardinal sin. Like countless others, I had found self-love and acceptance in the arms of the body positivity movement. It offered me a welcome respite from the stress of constantly looking at myself with a critical eye, as well as a counterattack to the once prevailing idea that shame gets bodies in shape (it doesn\u2019t). So why was I so happy at the sight of my new, thinner shape? I lost more than 100 pounds in two parts over 18 months, during two big stages of my life. The first occurred when I went from a depressed, overworked college student to a stressed, fully employed adult. I replaced meals with coffee and ate once daily \u2013 usually the easiest thing I could pop into the microwave after a 12-hour day. On top of my 9-5 job, my four-hour daily commute made finding any time for myself nearly impossible. My body responded to my new environment by shedding 50 pounds, but even then I knew my weight loss wasn\u2019t healthy. My stress had reached a peak, and all I could do was shrink in the face of it. I had no time for physical activity, and if I was lucky enough to get a day off, I was too exhausted to move anyways. The stuff I consumed could barely be called food; I ate quick meals rife with saturated fats and sodium that just made me more sluggish. Research backs this up: stressful jobs lead to poor eating, junk food makes us depressed and failing mental health becomes a roadblock to improving health. I bristled whenever someone congratulated me on my weight loss. To accept outsiders\u2019 compliments on my weight loss was to betray the body-positive ethos I had adopted. And then, just as easily as I had adopted it, I threw that life away. Less than a year into my first full-time job, I quit to travel Europe for five months. Suddenly, I had a limitless resource of something I hadn\u2019t had my entire working life: time. I could spend all day walking, climbing or hiking in a different country. I could stroll through local markets, relishing the hues and aromas of the displayed fruits and vegetables, to pick foods that made me happy and gave me the energy I needed to keep exploring. Regular physical activity, a Mediterranean-style diet and freedom to do as I pleased changed me, and I lost another 60lb. When I came back home to the US, my family and friends were shocked by my dramatic transformation and my weight loss was only part of it. Yes, I was smaller, but I also looked happier. I was more confident and said stuff like: \u201cYou know what would be so fun right now? A bike ride.\u201d I even got a cool haircut. My new body was a reflection of the new life I was living. One of the biggest changes my friends noticed is how experimental and colorful my fashion sense has become, compared with when all I wore was an ensemble of leggings and a T-shirt. Being more confident helps, but buying cool clothes is just easier the less fat you are. Albeit I\u2019m still a solid size 14, but the realm of possibilities for my wardrobe has vastly expanded from the ironically slim size-20-and-up rack I used to shop from. I can put more care into my appearance and feel more secure in the way I present myself to the world because I actually have options. There\u2019s just one thing, though. My new commitment to health has also bordered on obsession at times. I don\u2019t want to fall back on my old habits, so I pore over the ingredients in everything I eat. I work out regularly, sometimes to the point I can barely move my muscles the next day. And when I can\u2019t bring myself to push my limits again \u2013 just one extra set of crunches or lunges \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m failing myself. Maybe getting healthier has made me happier, but being so preoccupied with health can be my downfall. Orthorexia, disordered eating influenced by an obsession with \u201chealthy\u201d foods, is one symptom of the larger problem diet culture was born from. Being perfect is a never-ending game of moving goalposts, and we\u2019re compelled to spend the rest of our lives chasing after it. I\u2019m still plus size, but I have become a more \u201csocially acceptable\u201d fat woman worth catering to.

      "bodyText": "The last time Charlton Athletic played Huddersfield Town and Hull City in the same week, they ended up reimbursing supporters\u2019 travel costs following a 5-0 shellacking only to get hit for six five days later. That 11-0 aggregate defeat almost four years ago followed a nine-match winless streak, including a meek surrender to Colchester United, then bottom of League One, in the FA Cup third round. Charlton were drowning in the Championship at a time when the arrival of new, and usually obscure, out-of-work managers marked the changing of the seasons. In the midst of the despised Roland Duch\u00e2telet\u2019s reign, those were some of the darkest days in the club\u2019s history. That reign is almost over. East Street Investments (ESI) will complete a takeover worth more than \u00a350m, ending Duch\u00e2telet\u2019s parsimonious five-year tenure as owner, providing they satisfy the EFL\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test.

With notable exceptions, such as the protean folklore of Max Porter, a new fiction of fatherhood has been slower to emerge. This first fictional experiment by the poet Caleb Klaces addresses the deficit in stark terms, hoping to capture \u201ca life and language split open\u201d.</p> <p>On the surface, at least, these fissures are not readily apparent. The new parents (neither is named) buy a house and must grapple with the division of domestic labour. The nearest thing to cataclysm is supplied by planning failures and sketchy estate agents: the house has been built on a flood plain and on Christmas morning is duly inundated. A cache of notebooks and a laptop are destroyed, and with them the only draft of the father\u2019s novel.</p> <p>In the surfaces of language, though, there are intimations of crisis from the beginning. At the birth, the father\u2019s sleep-deprived reverence gives rise to a skittish lyricism. \u201cI wanted to lay a hand on every head in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted another word for love.\u201d To those who have served as lumbering bystanders at this main event, these reflections will be touchingly recognisable, as will the lurches of dissociation and existential panic: \u201cThe baby was all that I could see and was impossible to look at.\u201d</p> <p>Still, as parents and newborn navigate their transfigured circumstances, the notes of alarm remain subdued. When his wife takes a full-time job, the father devotes his days to the baby. In this role, he is at once self-absorbed and fanatically attentive, lending to his observations both an unsettling inwardness and, at times, a startling grace. When the baby closes her eyes in a lift, he is prompted to \u201cimagine dark that is busier than light\u201d. When she first makes the shapes of words, \u201cher lips kiss ghosts\u201d. And when she smiles, indelibly, she seems to be \u201corganising mist into a stream\u201d.</p> <p>These passages are leavened by humour as well as beauty. Consulting a manual on parenthood, he concludes that \u201cI was, in some important respect, the first father who had ever lived.\u201d But the family\u2019s tentative idyll seems perforated by unease, and the narrative voice \u2013 already distractable and rhapsodic \u2013 gives way to seizure-like episodes of fragmented verse. The father encourages his wife to attend a conference, though she is anxious about leaving him alone with the baby. By now, alerted to the flooding risk, they obsess routinely over the level of the river. She should not leave, she says, if it reaches 3.5m. These measurements, clearly, are the index of some lurking malaise, but its nature remains undivined.</p> <p>She makes the trip, but calls from the conference and asks what he is hiding. By now we too are beginning to wonder. The father has hit his head against a kitchen cabinet, losing consciousness briefly while in charge of the baby. The baby, for her part, has ingested four entire pages of printed manuscript and has been vomiting for 12 hours. His response is to take her for a walk, \u201cwith the idea that she could be aired\u201d.</p> <p>It is possible, even at such moments, to sustain an admiration for <em>Fatherhood</em>\u2019s impassive examination of male failure and implosion, but to welcome it as a \u201crewriting of masculinity\u201d, as the publisher puts it, is more onerous. The father betakes himself to a hospital for stitches, where he chats idly to the doctor and enjoys \u201cthe reassuring spectacle of a large, strong man engaged in gentle work\u201d. The baby, meanwhile, must make do with al fresco healthcare. What\u2019s troubling here are not real or imagined parenting failures but the wash of affectlessness that by now obscures both the father\u2019s view and ours. What do all these lapses and ruptures portend? What, if anything, is wrong with this man?</p> <p>In a conversation with his stepfather, late in the book, the father confesses to an inchoate rage, an urge to \u201cbreak it all and be broken\u201d, but the revelation is isolated and seems almost tangential to the scenes we have witnessed. There is writing of a glancing brilliance here, and an emotional and sensory acuity well matched to the terrain. Klaces may well return to it, and assemble from these studies in dissolute identity a more recognisable whole.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Paraic O\u2019Donnell\u2019s The House on Vesper Sands is published by W&amp;N.

It is possible, even at such moments, to sustain an admiration for Fatherhood\u2019s impassive examination of male failure and implosion, but to welcome it as a \u201crewriting of masculinity\u201d, as the publisher puts it, is more onerous. The father betakes himself to a hospital for stitches, where he chats idly to the doctor and enjoys \u201cthe reassuring spectacle of a large, strong man engaged in gentle work\u201d. The baby, meanwhile, must make do with al fresco healthcare. What\u2019s troubling here are not real or imagined parenting failures but the wash of affectlessness that by now obscures both the father\u2019s view and ours. What do all these lapses and ruptures portend? What, if anything, is wrong with this man? In a conversation with his stepfather, late in the book, the father confesses to an inchoate rage, an urge to \u201cbreak it all and be broken\u201d, but the revelation is isolated and seems almost tangential to the scenes we have witnessed. There is writing of a glancing brilliance here, and an emotional and sensory acuity well matched to the terrain. Klaces may well return to it, and assemble from these studies in dissolute identity a more recognisable whole. \u2022 Paraic O\u2019Donnell\u2019s The House on Vesper Sands is published by W&amp;N.

The failure up to now of the 28 member states to commit to a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, let alone anything more ambitious, highlights the danger of history repeating itself. It is still to be seen whether there is sufficient buy-in among all the member states for the new green deal outlined by the new European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Back in June 1990, amid discussions about the unification of Germany, the flowering of democracy in eastern Europe and need to support the Russian president, Mikhail Gorbachev, in his perestroika, leaders gathering in Dublin turned for the first time to the emerging climate disaster. An annex to the summit communique agreed by the then 12 leaders of the European economic community warned that \u201cthe earth\u2019s atmosphere is seriously threatened\u201d and that a \u201cbusiness as usual approach will lead to additional global warming in the decades to come\u201d. They went on to agree to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 \u2013 but attempts to agree a carbon tax were blocked by the UK, among others. Less radical initiatives, including common standards on boilers, electric refrigerators and freezers, along with targets for the use of renewable energy supplies were the order of the day. The fall in greenhouse emissions in the decade that followed should be seen in the context of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s assault on the coal industry in the UK and a decline of the East German industrial and power sectors post-unification. It was only at the turn of the millennium, and the launch of the first European climate change programme, that real dynamism entered the EU\u2019s approach to the environment. Policy leaps included the European Emissions Trading Scheme, with national caps for the power and industrial sectors, indicative targets on the share of renewable electricity in each of the member states and further drives to make energy use more efficient. Brussels can justifiably claim to have helped lead the rest of the world towards the Paris agreement to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and agreement to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has urged voters to \u201creject the politics of despair and division\u201d as he began a whistlestop tour of key seats across the UK in Glasgow. Speaking to a crowd of Labour activists gathered in the early morning darkness, the Labour leader said the British people had a choice: \u201cTomorrow you can vote for despair and the dishonesty of this government or you can vote Labour and get a government that is determined to bring about justice and equality in our society.\u201d Activists were in buoyant mood following the release of YouGov\u2019s second constituency-by-constituency poll overnight, which suggests that \u2013 while the Tories remain the favourites \u2013 the possibility of a hung parliament cannot be ruled out. The poll leaves the Conservatives unchanged on 43% and Labour on 34%, up two points, which would cut Johnson\u2019s notional majority from 68 to 28. Reflecting on a bitterly contested campaign, Corbyn said: \u201cOur party has suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse from some of the media and the right in British politics. But our strength, our ideas, our principles and our determination are stronger than ever. \u201cWe have never indulged in the politics of personal abuse and we never will, because it demeans politics and demeans democracy, and at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t build a house, it doesn\u2019t train a doctor and it doesn\u2019t eliminate poverty.\u201d Glasgow was the first stop in a tour that will take the Labour leader to the north of England and the Midlands, before ending at a rally in Hoxton, east London.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people have rallied in Sydney to protest against inaction on the climate crisis, after months of bushfires and hazardous smoke in New South Wales and Queensland. On Tuesday, the level of dangerous PM2.5 particles in Sydney\u2019s air was as high as 10 times normal, and fires have burnt through nearly 3 million hectares of land across NSW and Queensland this season. Outside Sydney\u2019s Town Hall, protesters gathered wearing face masks, asking the government to act on the role global heating had in making bushfire seasons longer and more devastating. Speakers called on the state and federal governments to increase funding to the Rural Fire Service, and provide P2 masks and Hepa air filters to firefighters, hospitals, aged care facilities and schools. Leighton Drury, the NSW secretary of the Fire Brigades Employees Union, said that firefighters were \u201cspread thin\u201d. \u201cI am well-qualified to say that these are the worst fires we\u2019ve had in decades, and they\u2019re not going to get better unless we take action,\u201d he said. \u201cA decade of denial about own environment changing has led to this \u2026 the solution is simple. Firefighters put out fires. Politicians put out policies and budgets. We\u2019ve got our job, they need to do theirs better\u201d. Dr Janet Rowden from the Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association said the weeks of smoke were now posing a public health risk. \u201cAlready four of our members have lost their homes in the fires,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are suffering a public health climate emergency. We need to go on for another three months we are told.\u201d The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said earlier on Tuesday the fires were \u201cnot normal\u201d and that we \u201cneed to reduce our carbon emissions immediately\u201d. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about concerns over how long the tens of thousands of volunteer firefighters \u2013 many who have been away from work for weeks now \u2013 were expected to continue without pay. Morrison said volunteer firefighters \u201cwant to be out there defending their communities\u201d and told media he was \u201cpleased with the way those arrangements [between state and federal governments] are being worked out\u201d. On Wednesday, former fire chiefs called for a national emergency summit on bushfires, and on Monday former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said it was a \u201cnational security issue\u201d. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge told the crowd of protesters in Sydney that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was \u201cmissing in action\u201d and Morrison had not done enough. \u201cHis big policy announcement has been a draft religious discrimination bill,\u201d Shoebridge said to loud boos. Natalie Wasley from the Maritime Union of Australia said this week\u2019s smoke haze was among the worst she had ever seen. \u201cAs a wharfie, I work in extreme conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work in heat, we work in rain, we are exposed to diesel particulates, we are exposed to dust.

I can\u2019t even imagine that type of in-fighting among our baseball crew, but our kids are only eight and nine. Who knows if in five years one of us will go postal if a coach makes a decision that we feel unfairly harms our kid\u2019s trajectory?</p> <p>For now, I am laser-focused on protecting my son against the outside forces who care about what they can squeeze out of him. Last summer, my son was invited to play on a travel team \u2013 he could even make it without a tryout, the coach said. When we politely declined citing concerns about burnout, the coach said my son is the type who will never burn out because he loves baseball so much. He was pleasant about the whole thing and we eventually joined his fall travel team, largely because my son likes him and a ton of his friends signed up. But I\u2019m concerned about fending off future invites.</p> <p>The future scares me. I don\u2019t want my son\u2019s joy to wane. But I know there will be more recruiting, more join-this-or-that-or else-your kid may fall behind sales methods.</p> <p>I dropped my five-year-old off at an after-school class a few weeks ago and had a coach ask me if my eight-year-old would be participating in their \u201cwinter workouts\u201d. I said no, that we didn\u2019t want to burn him out. The coach looked at me like I was torturing my child, and simply uttered, \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t get too rusty.\u201d I smiled on the outside and rolled my eyes on the inside. Then I left to pick up my kid and meet my husband at a local park where we all played catch for the next hour. Like we always do.</p>",

Who knows if in five years one of us will go postal if a coach makes a decision that we feel unfairly harms our kid\u2019s trajectory? For now, I am laser-focused on protecting my son against the outside forces who care about what they can squeeze out of him. Last summer, my son was invited to play on a travel team \u2013 he could even make it without a tryout, the coach said. When we politely declined citing concerns about burnout, the coach said my son is the type who will never burn out because he loves baseball so much. He was pleasant about the whole thing and we eventually joined his fall travel team, largely because my son likes him and a ton of his friends signed up. But I\u2019m concerned about fending off future invites. The future scares me. I don\u2019t want my son\u2019s joy to wane. But I know there will be more recruiting, more join-this-or-that-or else-your kid may fall behind sales methods. I dropped my five-year-old off at an after-school class a few weeks ago and had a coach ask me if my eight-year-old would be participating in their \u201cwinter workouts\u201d. I said no, that we didn\u2019t want to burn him out. The coach looked at me like I was torturing my child, and simply uttered, \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t get too rusty.\u201d I smiled on the outside and rolled my eyes on the inside. Then I left to pick up my kid and meet my husband at a local park where we all played catch for the next hour. Like we always do.",

Press pictures of the painting provoked strong reactions in Mexico, where Zapata has maintained an unambiguously heroic reputation since the revolution of 1910 \u2013 when he called for \u201creform, freedom, justice and law\u201d. Some of Zapata\u2019s heirs \u2013 with matching droopy moustaches \u2013 vowed to take legal action against the exhibition. \u201cWe are not going to allow this,\u201d said Jorge Zapata Gonzalez. \u201cFor us as relatives, this denigrates the figure of our general \u2013 depicting him as gay.\u201d Apocryphal tales of a gay romances involving Zapata have been published in recent decades, but historians say there is little evidence to support the stories. Mexican politicians of all stripes have long tried to claim Zapata as their own \u2013 including the some of his supposed revolutionary allies, who later betrayed and killed him. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador declared 2019 \u2013 the centennial of his death \u2013 as the \u201cyear of Zapata\u201d, emblazoning the revolutionary leader\u2019s familiar image of a bushy mustache, sombrero and bandolier on government letterhead and promotional materials. \u201cHe\u2019s the least controversial revolutionary strongman and the most \u2018leftwing\u2019 in the modern sense,\u2019\u201d said Harim B Guti\u00e9rrez, history professor at the Autonomous Metropolitan University. But Zapata\u2019s image is also the most malleable, and it has been appropriated by a host of social causes which may not have much to do with his original struggle to secure a better deal for landless peasants. \u201cEvery 20 years or so something pops up\u201d involving Zapata\u2019s image, said Luis Vargas Santiago, the curator of the current exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Most recently, that \u201csomething\u201d has been gender and sexuality. The current exhibition comes at time when Mexico\u2019s LBGTQ communities have become more prominent and women have been more outspoken against the country\u2019s endemic machismo, sexual harassment, and femicides. In recent weeks, women protesting in Mexico City against sexual violence have been criticised for spraying graffiti on monuments and centuries-old buildings. Vargas Santiago said the use of Zapata to advance social agendas followed a similar logic. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Zapata\u2019s image is a fixed symbol which cannot be challenged,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like monuments are questioned, Zapata is also an image that can be subverted.\u201d Vargas Santiago said some of Zapata\u2019s descendants had expressed support for the exhibition. The family itself has also split over the use of Zapata\u2019s image \u2013 with some descendants applying for a trademark to sell Zapata-branded merchandise such as T-shirts and tequila. The core question, according to Vargas-Santiago, is: \u201cWho does Zapata belong to? Does he belong to his family members? Does he belong to the government? Or does he belong to everyone? Our response is: he belongs to everyone who identifies with his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said on Wednesday that the painting didn\u2019t bother him, \u201cbut I\u2019m not a member of the Zapata family.\u201d He asked the culture ministry to find a solution to family\u2019s concerns. Government spokesman Jes\u00fas Ram\u00edrez Cuevas later tweeted that the government was \u201ccommitted to artistic freedom and respect for diversity.\u201d \u201cYes to freedom, no to censorship. Yes to respect, no to violence,\u201d he wrote.",

Green campaigners also want to see higher targets for 2030, and want the EU to confirm its commitments sooner. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told the Guardian: \u201cTo be truly credible and consistent with staying below 1.5C, the EU needs to commit to increasing its 2030 commitment to 65% [emissions cuts]. This is what\u2019s needed to be taken seriously by China in the lead-up to the EU-China summit in autumn next year.\u201d Green campaigners are also worried that the EU will not finalise its commitments until late next year, but the Commission is confident that by signalling its intent now it can form alliances with other key countries to come up with the joint pledges needed at next year\u2019s crunch conference in November in Glasgow. That is the deadline for new commitments on emissions to fulfil the Paris accord.",

      "bodyText": "Trees have had an unexpectedly good election, with every major party pledging to plant millions more of them. The exact numbers vary, and some parties seem unsure even what their own target may involve, but a huge national increase in foliage is one of the few policies that bridges the vast political distance between the Greens and the Brexit party. How this plays out on the ground will be another issue \u2013 even if all the promised trees are planted, about a quarter of saplings die long before maturity, and the types of tree and location will be big factors. Local authorities are likely to come in for a big share of the heavy work, whichever party wins, but how the budgets and responsibility for this massive climate-protecting project will be devolved remains opaque in most of the manifestos. Local parks spending may continue to be squeezed, even while national forests are high on the agenda. A similar vagueness over implementation dogs many of the other less eye-catching green policies proposed across the board, even though the public sector \u2013 mainly in the form of local authorities \u2013 is likely to be key to delivery. From home insulation to transport, renewable energy to waste and recycling, the infrastructure pledges made by all the major parties will require public sector oversight, spending, workers and planning. Hospitals, schools and other public buildings are all promised a share of the cash for upgrading and insulating buildings, which are one of the UK\u2019s biggest sources of emissions. By 2030, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens would insulate every home, and in most cases other buildings too, while the Conservatives will spend \u00a39.2bn on insulation nationwide. Electric cars are also a central environmental pledge, with the three biggest parties all targeting a phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles, and an expansion of charging infrastructure. Restoring and expanding bus routes looms large for Labour, which would electrify all buses for \u00a34bn, and the Lib Dems have pledged \u00a34.8bn to restore local bus routes. The Conservatives promise \u00a34.2bn for local trains, buses and trams. Waste and recycling have been largely determined by EU directives to date.

      "body": "<p>Jane Austen aficionados think that they know the story of their favourite author\u2019s posthumous dis-appearance and then re-emergence. For half a century after she died in 1817, her books were little known or read. A few discriminating admirers such as George Henry Lewes and Lord Macaulay kept the flame of her reputation burning, but most novelists and novel readers were oblivious to her. Then, in 1869, her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh published a memoir about her and the public got interested. Her novels started being republished and widely read. She has never looked back.</p> <p>Janine Barchas\u2019s <em>The Lost Books of Jane Austen</em> puts us right. Her book about books is a beautifully illustrated exploration, indeed compendium, of the popular editions of Austen\u2019s novels that have appeared over the last two centuries. This includes those decades when Austen was supposedly lost from sight. The first chapter is a \u201cvignette\u201d on a copy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/16/sense-and-sensibility-jane-austen-elena-ferrante-anonymity\" title=\"\"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>, published in 1851 for George Routledge\u2019s Railway Library (books suitable for reading on the train). It cost one shilling and was bought for the 13-year-old Gertrude Wallace, the youngest daughter of a Plymouth naval officer. It is the first of many examples of cheap and popular editions of Austen\u2019s work that kept it alive for ordinary readers and that literary scholars have largely ignored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"83bd633f3be1bcf5a99c5c6bc92a295c4060b437\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83bd633f3be1bcf5a99c5c6bc92a295c4060b437/0_0_1406_2188/643.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost Books of Jane Austen by Janine Barchas\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After Austen\u2019s death, the copyrights to her novels were bought by the publisher Richard Bentley, who issued them in his Standard Novels series in 1833, in single volumes at six shillings each \u2013 much cheaper than the triple decker editions selling for a guinea and a half, but still out of reach of all but the affluent. He cut his prices in the 1840s, but already there were alternatives. By the late 1840s, there were what we would call paperback editions of her novels cheaply available and aimed at train travellers. Pioneering publishers such as Simms &amp; M\u2019Intyre produced Austen novels for a shilling a shot, and then for sixpence each in their Books for the People series. (They paid no attention to the fact that Bentley officially still owned the copyright to some of these.)</p> <p>\u201cCheap books make authors canonical,\u201d proclaims Barchas\u2019s first sentence. Thousands of mid-century readers consumed \u201cyellowback\u201d versions of Austen\u2019s novels, so-called because of the yellow paper stuck to the back of them on which advertisements were printed. The sheer proliferation of cheaply produced editions of Austen\u2019s fiction has been invisible because very few of these books have survived. Paradoxically, the expensive first editions of Austen\u2019s novels are now easier to find than the mass-market editions of the Victorian age. Barchas has clearly relished her detective work (and apparently amassed quite a collection herself). She not only describes them, she shows us what they looked like.</p> <p>Photographs are essential to this book. There in front of you is the 1851 Parlour Library reprint of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/10/mansfield-park-unsung-literary-heroines\" title=\"\"> <em>Mansfield Park</em></a>, with its red design and lettering on a startling acid green cover, in waxed paper boards. It retailed at WH Smith at British railway stations for two shillings. The willingness of publishers to spice up Austen\u2019s novels is caught in the 1870 Chapman &amp; Hall edition of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, whose cover depicts Lydia Bennet flirting with officers at their camp in Brighton, or the 1887 sixpenny <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>, featuring Colonel Brandon and Willoughby pointing their duelling pistols at each other (neither scene was actually included in either novel).</p> <p>Tracking down these endlessly repackaged reprints, Barchas is in <em>terra incognita</em>. Scholarly bibliographers have minutely recorded the various respectable editions of Austen\u2019s fiction, but most of these cheap popular products, never having made it on to the library shelf, remained unknown to bibliographers. These are volumes that scarcely feature in the catalogues of the great research libraries of Britain and North America. The existing record is, as Barchas characteristically says, \u201cgobsmackingly incomplete\u201d. Her style is sometimes informal, but her attention to print history is painstaking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71ff82ee3e11e54fcebe470429ec34734af9b099\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71ff82ee3e11e54fcebe470429ec34734af9b099/0_0_1391_2140/650.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost Books of Jane Austen by Janine Barchas\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She explains the importance of stereotyping processes, whereby printers could mould and then cast in metal the expensively assembled type of a new edition. The resultant stereotyple plates could be used over and over again. Routledge would go on to use his same stereotype plates to produce seven more editions of <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> over the next three decades. (Barchas gives us a photograph of all of them in their very various liveries.) Austen stereotype plates would be sold on from one publisher to another, the resultant type becoming more and more faded as one printing succeeded another.</p> <p>There clearly was a new enthusiasm for the novels after 1870. Barchas shows us the flurry of colourfully jacketed Austen volumes that began appearing, some evidently intended for the juvenile reader. In America, where publishers treated Austen\u2019s texts with greater literary respect, the market for her work was much quieter in the mid-19th century, but appears to have taken off in the 1870s. Her novels became available for a dime or 15 cents each. In Britain, the sixpenny novel became standard. Soon Austen was being serialised.</p> <p>In the 1890s, radical publishers produced a library of \u201cfamous books\u201d for working-class readers at a penny per volume, which included <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. At the same time <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> was being boiled down by two thirds for William Stead\u2019s Penny Prose Classic series for young readers. In the 1890s the soap manufacturers Lever Brothers published their own editions of the two novels as prizes for teenage consumers who sent in the largest number of soap wrappers. Barchas dedicates a whole chapter to her researches into the Sunlight Library, calculating that the company gave away some 1.5m books over the course of seven years (though perhaps more by Sir Walter Scott than Jane Austen).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cd2336a7bc3479d2a7afb654b7c30870951b982e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2336a7bc3479d2a7afb654b7c30870951b982e/0_0_1494_2210/676.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost Books of Jane Austen by Janine Barchas Annie Munro\u2019s copy of Northanger Abbey (Glasgow: Blackie &amp; Sons, n.d.), awarded to her as an attendance prize in 1911 from her school in Forfar, Scotland.

Your can read the latest wrap of today\u2019s developments here, plus Eleanor Ainge Roy\u2019s interview with the mayor of Whakat\u0101ne here. Efforts to reach White Island have in effect been called off for Wednesday after GNS Science, New Zealand\u2019s main scientific organisation, said tremors had increased since this morning and there was a \u201cmedium likelihood\u201d \u2013 a 40-60% chance \u2013 of an eruption in the next 24 hours Police have said they intend \u201cabsolutely to return to that island\u201d but that it can happen only \u201cwhen there are no risks and the risks can be managed\u201d. Searchers would face \u201cserious physical and chemical hazards\u201d, says John Tims from the New Zealand police. 30 patients remain in burns units across New Zealand, 22 of whom still need airway support. One person is being transferred to Sydney later today. Doctors are close to full identification of all patients. Police have released a list of nine victims who are officially missing. The list is a mix of six people known to have died, and three more who are presumed dead but whose bodies remain on the island. Health officials require 120 square metres of skin to treat victims, highlighting the severity of the burns injuries. This has been ordered from the United States. Australia has already provided one square metre. The Australian Defence Force will soon be arriving to repatriate injured Australians, with one due to arrive in Sydney later today. Tims defended the decision not to allow rescuers to return to the island on Monday, but says it was made \u201cat a local level\u201d. The alert level remains at three, on a scale of increasing activity of one to five. Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, has released further details of the repatriation effort in a joint statement with foreign affairs minister Marise Payne, defence minister Lisa Reynolds and emergency management minister David Littleproud. He anticipates transferring up to 10 injured patients to New South Wales and Victoria, within the next 24 hours. Three Royal Australian Air Force aircraft \u2013 a C-130 Hercules and two C-17 Globemasters \u2013 have been deployed to Christchurch with a team of specialist aircrew and medical equipment on board. The NSW, Victorian, Queensland and South Australian governments have also provided aircraft. In his statement the ministers say: \u201cToday is another difficult day for those involved in the White Island volcano disaster in New Zealand, for people who remain in hospital and families who have received the most devastating of news, and those still enduring the agony of awaiting news of their loved ones. \u201cOur hearts go out to all of the Australians and their families caught up in this tragedy, and our Kiwi cousins across the Tasman. \u201cThis is a time of immense grief and great sorrow for everyone involved.\u201d Here are some edited excerpts from this afternoon\u2019s press conferences with police and health officials, plus a volcano expert. New Zealand police have released the names of nine victims. Seven of them are Australian, two are New Zealanders. Officially, they have been classed as missing, although some have already been confirmed as dead. Gavin Dallow (Australia) Jessica Richards (Australia) Krystal Browitt (Australia) Richard Elzer (Australia) Zoe Hosking (Australia) Karla Matthews (Australia) Julie Richards (Australia) Tipene Maangi (New Zealand) Hayden Inman (New Zealand) Gavin\u2019s father, Brian Dallow, has just spoken to the media. He praised his son as \u201ca person who was always interested in helping other people\u201d and enjoyed a range of sports. His body is in Auckland and will be released after a postmortem examination and flown back home. He says Gavin was the kind of person who \u201cif he\u2019d known there was a danger he wouldn\u2019t have gone\u201d. \u2018At Christmas we\u2019re really going to miss him.\u201d Gavin Dallow was a \u201cwonderful son and brother\u201d, according to a family statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss him at the cricket and we\u2019ll miss him at the football. He was a generous man, always helping his family and his community.\u201d \u201cOur hearts break at the loss of Zoe at such a young age. We know her loss will also devastate her school community and the local Girl Guides, of which she was an active member.\u201d Gavin Dallow\u2019s wife, Lisa, remains in a critical condition in hospital in Hamilton. The body of Gavin Dallow from Adelaide has been identified by New Zealand police, according to the family. His 15-year-old step-daughter Zoe Hosking is also presumed dead, with her body still on Whakaari/White Island. Her school, St Aloysius College, has released a statement saying: \u201cThe family\u2019s pain and that of their friends and school community are beyond words, yet we cherish all that we have shared with Zoe and her family over 10 years and we believe that one day we will share with Zoe in God\u2019s eternal love.\u201d Here is a summary of what we have heard from police, science and health officials at two press conferences just now. Efforts to reach White Island have in effect been called off for Wednesday after GNS Science, New Zealand\u2019s main scientific organisation, said tremors had increased since this morning and there was a \u201cmedium likelihood\u201d \u2013 a 40-60% chance \u2013 of an eruption in the next 24 hours Police have said they intend \u201cabsolutely to return to that island\u201d but that it can happen only \u201cwhen there are no risks and the risks can be managed\u201d. Searchers would face \u201cserious physical and chemical hazards\u201d, says John Tims from the New Zealand police. 30 patients remain in burns units across New Zealand, 22 of whom still need airway support. One person is being transferred to Sydney later today. Doctors are close to full identification of all patients. Health officials require 120 square metres of skin to treat victims, highlighting the severity of the burns injuries. This has been ordered from the United States. Australia has already provided one square metre. The Australian Defence Force will soon be arriving to repatriate injured Australians, with one due to arrive in Sydney later today. Tims defended the decision not to allow rescuers to return to the island on Monday, but says it was made \u201cat a local level\u201d. The alert level remains at three, on a scale of increasing activity of one to five. The press conferences have finished up. We will provide a summary of the new information shortly. Watson says 22 of the 30 patients in hospital still need airway support. The nature of the burns suffered is complicated by the gases and chemicals in the eruption. This has necessitated more rapid treatment than is normally the case for thermal-only burns, he says. He gives a breakdown of the number of patients at each hospital: Eight at Christchurch hospital Seven patients are at Middlemore hospital in Auckland, Six at Waikato hospital Four at Hutt hospital near Wellington, Two at Auckland city hospital, Two at Tauranga base hospital, One at Wellington hospital. That person is in the process of being transferred to Sydney. There are 30 patients in burns units across New Zealand \u2013 one person is being transferred to Sydney later today. Doctors have \u201calmost\u201d completed full identification of who they are, says Dr Peter Watson, chief medical officer at Counties Manukau. Lots of information coming through at multiple press conferences. We will circle back soon with a summary of all the fresh information. We will switch now from the press conference in Wellington to one being held by health officials in Auckland. The squeamish may want to look away now. They say that due to the scale of burns they\u2019re dealing with, they require 120 square metres of skin. This has been ordered from the United States. Ashley Bloomfield from the Ministry of Health speaks next. He says operating theatres are working 24 hours a day to treat the injured. He says doctors now have \u201can almost complete picture\u201d of who is who in hospitals, after early challenges because of the extent of the burns injuries. Tims is defending the decision not to allow rescuers to return to the island on Monday. He says it was made \u201cat a local level\u201d. There have been various media reports today quoting helicopter pilots who rescued injured tourists before emergency services prevented searchers from returning to White Island. Some of those pilots claim they could have returned safely to pick up more people. When asked if he can confidently say that searchers can return to the island at all given the worsening conditions, Tims says: \u201cThose families and friends absolutely deserve\u201d closure. It\u2019s \u201cmy absolute intent\u201d to return to the island, he says. He also apologises for incorrectly saying yesterday that a criminal investigation was underway when it was not. A coroner\u2019s investigation is underway, and one by the workplace safety agency WorkSafe. Disaster victim identification specialists are standing by to identify bodies, Tims says. Police will release the names of the missing shortly, with details to be published online. The Australian Defence Force will soon be arriving to repatriate injured Australians, he says. Leonard\u2019s assessment is echoed by John Tims from the New Zealand police. He says his intent is \u201cabsolutely to return to that island\u201d but that it can happen only \u201cwhen there are no risks and the risks can be managed.\u201d \u201cWe are confident in our ability to manage the rescue operation,\u201d but only once they know they can manage the dangers, he said. Searchers would face \u201cserious physical and chemical hazards\u201d, he says. Graham Leonard from GNS science is speaking now. He says conditions on the island are worsening, and that it would be challenging for breathing, seeing or walking on the disaster site. There is a risk of another eruption like Monday\u2019s eruption \u2013 there\u2019s a 40-60% chance of that happening in the next 24 hours, up from 30-50% yesterday. Sarah Stuart-Black, a spokesperson for New Zealand\u2019s civil defence ministry, is speaking now. She says a recovery operation has not been possible today due to conditions on the island. New Zealand\u2019s immigration agency is helping with visas for families arriving in New Zealand. (More information can be found at immigration.govt.nz). Families from overseas are expected to start arriving in Whakat\u0101ne, the town where White Island is located, today. It is an \u201cabsolute imperative\u201d to retrieve the bodies, Stuart-Black says. Every day that passes without that happening is a \u201cday of anguish\u201d for the families.\u201d \u201cHowever, the preservation of human life and the prevention of further human harm must be taken into account,\u201d Stuart-Black says. The scientific data stipulates that the risk is too high, she says. Medical supplies have been arriving from Australia to help treat the injured, including one square metre of skin. Stefan Poniatowski, the head of the Donor Tissue Bank of Victoria, says it received an urgent request from the New Zealand Blood Service on Tuesday, and sent the tissue. He said the number of people that could be treated depended on the severity of their injuries. It could be anywhere from two or three, to up to 10. New Zealand\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Pete Watson, said on Tuesday that 27 of the 31 people injured in the eruption had burns to more than 30% of their body. Kelly says: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember Whakaari/White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active volcano, and there remains significant uncertainty about any future activity.\u201d The alert level remains at three, on a scale of increasing severity of one to five. GNS Science, New Zealand\u2019s main scientific organisation, has issued an update on conditions on the island. Volcanologist Craig Miller says tremors have increased since this morning and there is a \u201cmedium likelihood\u201d \u2013 a 40-60% chance \u2013 of an eruption in the next 24 hours. We have heard earlier that it is believed the bodies of eight people remain on the island but retrieval efforts have been hampered by volcanic activity and weather conditions. A friend of Julie and Jessica Richards, the first Australians to be named as victims of the disaster, has said the family are \u201cunited in grief\u201d after receiving a call from New Zealand police this morning. John Mickel said the family wished the mother and daughter to be remembered as \u201coutdoor and adventurous people\u201d. \u201cThey really loved the cruise atmosphere but more particularly they loved the adventurism that went with all the outdoor sports.\u201d Jessica was a promising AFL player and was studying at the University of Queensland. Mickel said the family had just celebrated an 85th birthday and that the upcoming festive season \u201cwill be one of deep poignancy\u201d. Messages and tributes to all the victims of the Whakaari/White Island disaster have been gathering at the harbour in Whakatane. Here is a selection of them: Jen Eborn, Julie Richards\u2019 sister in law, said on Facebook on Wednesday morning that they had been \u201cpraying for a miracle\u201d. Authorities were said to have contacted them this morning. The pair were listed as missing after the disaster. Julie and Jessica, a student vet, had been on board the Ovation of the Seas and had booked on a tour of the island. They had been due to return home on the weekend. The identities of two Australian victims have been confirmed in multiple media reports, quoting relatives. Julie Richards, 47, and her daughter Jessica, 20, were on the island at the time of the eruption. The family is expected to give a statement later. Hello, Graham Russell here taking over from Martin Farrer. Here is a brief summary of where things stand so far today. Emergency authorities are awaiting the all-clear to gain access to Whakaari/White Island, two days after an eruption that has killed at least six people, with a further eight presumed dead. The retrieval operation has been hampered by what a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in volcanic tremor activity, adding to the frustration of families who have lost relatives. Helicopter pilot has described the horrific aftermath of the eruption, seen when he helped fly the injured off the island. He has offered to fly in again to retrieve the eight bodies believed to still be on the volcano. Paramedic Rusty Clarke was on a helicopter that flew to White Island. He told RNZ that it looked like a nuclear explosion had taken place. \u201cLooking down on it, I would have to describe it as Chernobyl,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a complete, absolute whiteout of the area involved.\u201d Thirty patients are being cared for in hospitals across New Zealand, of whom 25 are in a critical condition. The burns units of six New Zealand hospitals are at full capacity caring for survivors, and police have said more deaths are likely. The remaining five patients are in a serious but stable condition. A reconnaissance drone was successfully launched on Wednesday morning but bad weather may hamper any future recovery mission. The Chief Coroner has declared a mass fatality incident and is working with police, disaster specialists, forensic pathologists, and odontologists to identify victims and release them to families. Paul Quinn, chairman of White Island Tours, has issued a statement this morning. The company operates daily boat trips to the island and last year it ferried 17,500 people to the volcano. Two of its employees are missing after Monday\u2019s disaster and Quinn\u2019s statement said the recovery of loved ones was of \u201cparamount concern\u201d. First and foremost, we would like to express our sorrow and offer condolences to those who have lost their loved ones following the eruption on Whakaari / White Island on Monday. At this stage, recovery of loved ones who are still on the island is of paramount concern and all of our resources including vessels, protection equipment and personnel have been made available to NZ Police and Civil Defence to support the recovery mission. For Ng\u0101ti Awa (tangata whenua of Whakat\u0101ne) our responsibility to provide care for our people and visitors during this difficult time is foremost in our minds and actions. We are focussed on wrapping the necessary support around affected families and staff, all of whom are understandably distraught. Karakia (prayer) services are being held daily to give staff and affected families an opportunity to come together in our grief. Local liaisons are being appointed to support overseas families who are arriving in Whakat\u0101ne. Support packages are being put together today including practical and useful items for those families as they await news and updates on the recovery mission. We are committed to facilitating family members\u2019 travel and other arrangements while we all await the return of loved ones to their families. We would like to acknowledge the numerous offers of support from our community and also wider iwi from across the country. Ka nui te mihi ki a koutou katoa. There are many questions that are left to be answered but our priority at this time is on the welfare of those affected. Eleanor Aigne Roy has filed this update from Whakatane about a police drone flight over the island today. She also says that facilities have been put in palce at the local airport to deal with the bodies of victims once they are recovered from the island. In Whakat\u0101ne it is a calm, clear day and for the first time police have successfully launched a reconnaissance drone over White Island, from boats stationed 1km of its coast. No further flights today have been reported after the 8.30am mission. At the local airport a cordon has been erected as the small hub prepares to process eight bodies. The chief coroner has declared the white island disaster a \u201cmajor fatality incident\u201d, and after landing in Whakatane, bodies will then be transported to Auckland mortuary for forensic examination and formal identification. The area around the wharf and local marae has now become a no-go zone for media, and the situation at both sites is increasingly tense, with security guards forcing media to leave. You can also catch up with a piece by our reporter Calla Wahlquist about the scale of the injuries suffered by many of the victims. Police said today that 25 out of 30 people still in hospital have critical injuries. Calla talked to doctors who said patients had severe burns to their skin from hot gas, ash and debris from the volcano. They also had \u201cquite severe\u201d inhalation burns from sulphur dioxide, methane and other chemicals. Read her full report here: Our New Zealand correspondent, Eleanor Aigne Roy, is in Whakatane and has filed a report on the press conference earlier today in which police explained their cautious approach to recovering victims from the island. Acting assistant police commissioner Bruce Bird said: \u201cThose deploying to the island will likely encounter serious physical and chemical hazards, for which we must be prepared.\u201d Here is her report: Police caution about the recovery of bodies victims presumed dead on the island were slightly contradicted by Mark Law, the helicopter pilot who helped in the initial rescue efforts (see this blog post). He told New Zealand TV this morning \u2013 albeit before the GeoNet warning about increased tremor activity \u2013 that conditions had been \u201cfavourable\u201d and that an operation could be completed in 90 minutes. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s 20 minutes to get out there. We could load those folks on and be back here in an hour and a half,\u201d Law told the AM show on Three television. \u201cI know where they all are, and the conditions are perfect for recovery in my mind.\u201d Lisa Dallow, the Adelaide woman who was listed as missing, has been found alive overnight in a hospital in New Zealand. Dallow, 48, an engineer with the resources company Santos, is being treated for severe burns in Hamilton. She was visiting the island with her partner Gavin Dallow, 53, and her 15-year-old daughter, Zoe Hosking. They are still unaccounted for. In a statement on Tuesday issued when she was still missing, Santos said she was avery well respected engineer and a good friend to many\u201d. Our reporter in Whakatane, Stephen D\u2019Antal, has filed a gripping piece about the helicopter pilot who rescued 12 victims from the island on Monday. Mark Law described a scene of horror as he and a colleague, Jason Hill, landed their aircrafts on the ash-covered terrain. We both landed in the centre of the island where we felt it was OK. It was ashing but we could deal with it. We went to assess everyone. We were moving around tending to people who were in real distress. We wanted to reassure them. We found people dead, dying and alive but in various states of unconsciousness. Read Stephen\u2019s full report here. The police warning about the dangers of searching for victims on the island were reinforced shortly after the press conference by an update from GeoNet, the NZ agency that gathers volcano data, which noted increased activity since 4am local time. GeoNet also said eruptions were \u201clikely\u201d to occur within the next 24 hours. \u201cThe level of volcanic tremor has significantly increased at the island,\u201d GeoNet said. \u201cThis has been accompanied by vigorous steaming and localised mud jetting in several of the craters created by the eruption on Monday. \u201cWe interpret these signals as evidence of continued high gas pressures within the volcano.\u201d GeoNet\u2019s alert warning for the island is at three, which indicates a \u201cminor volcanic eruption\u201d is likely. Good morning and welcome to the live blog on the White Island volcano tragedy. The main developments today include a press conference given in Whakatane earlier this morning by chief coroner Judge Deborah Marshall and acting assistant police commissioner Bruce Bird. Of the 30 people being treated in hospitals across New Zealand, 25 of them are in a critical condition. Another three were discharged from hospital. Six people have now been confirmed dead and the other eight of the 47 people who were on the island are still missing. Police say they cannot name the deceased victims because they have to go through a \u201cstringent\u201d identification process while carrying out the postmortems Bird said it was still too dangerous to go onto the island to search for bodies. Police said on Tuesday that no one left on the island could have survived. Volcanic activity has \u201csignificantly increased\u201d on the island this morning, GeoNet says. An Australian woman who was reported missing has been found alive in a hospital in Hamilton. Lisa Dallow is being treated for severe burns.",

When the film came out, it had only been 10 years since California became the first state to pass a no-fault divorce law, in which the dissolution of a marriage does not require evidence of wrongdoing by either party. And New York, where the film takes place, was the last of the 50 states to allow no-fault divorce, through a law that wasn\u2019t signed until 2010.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, no-fault allowed for easier and cheaper divorces, which both unburdened the legal system and accommodated a higher divorce rate. While the law isn\u2019t specifically relevant to Kramer vs Kramer \u2013 which has the parties fighting in court at great expense \u2013 it does reflect a change in the culture, where women especially were better able to leave unhappy marriages and achieve self-actualization. That didn\u2019t relieve the stigma of a mother leaving a child behind, as Joanna Kramer (Streep) does here, or undercut social biases about women being better caregivers to their children than men, which ultimately harms Ted Kramer (Hoffman) in court. But when the film came out, such matters were up for fierce debate.</p> <p>Viewers are definitely free to assign fault to the characters in Kramer vs Kramer, just as they currently are over Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson\u2019s characters in Marriage Story, which has an equally jaundiced view of the legal process. And at first glance \u2013 and maybe every glance, for some \u2013 Benton\u2019s film is hugely unbalanced in favor of Ted, a workaholic ad executive who scrambles to look after his son Billy (Justin Henry) when Joanna quietly yet firmly walks out the door. Joanna only appears near the beginning and end of the film, and in the 18 months between when she leaves and when she comes back seeking sole custody of Billy, all we see are scenes of father and son bonding together. In terms of audience sympathy, she never stands a chance.</p> <p>But Benton and Streep do their best with the time that they have. Kramer vs Kramer opens with a devastating scene of Joanna tucking Billy into bed one last time, stroking his hair and telling the boy she loves him. Had the film been about her journey, it might have been something like Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s excellent 1969 road movie The Rain People, in which a housewife leaves her husband for destinations unknown, motivated equally by wanderlust and a feeling of suffocation at home. Joanna is obviously a deeply unhappy woman, forced to cede her ambitions to her career-driven husband and beaten down by motherhood, with all its hassles and loneliness. Streep suggests a combination of vulnerability and resolve, as if Joanna is using the vapors of self-esteem she has left to will a new life for herself.</p> <p>And it\u2019s clear from the start that Ted has been clinging to old-fashioned notions of parenthood, when men were married to the office and fatherhood was more of a ceremonial role. The morning after Joanna leaves, he disastrously improvises a breakfast of French toast and coffee, and loses his temper around his son, not for the last time. The 80s would make comedies like Mr Mom and Three Men and a Baby out of hapless fathers thrown into domestic chaos, but Kramer vs Kramer plays it straight, as the steep learning curve caused by his negligence.

Three new bedrooms have been created in the large former farmhouse, while another 14 \u2013 in what were once outbuildings \u2013 have had extensive makeovers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba3cd6f1afd91ff30d24477dd155d3f810dafa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba3cd6f1afd91ff30d24477dd155d3f810dafa1/126_394_5239_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of The Clive Arms Shropshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My stay was in one of the new rooms and I found it a comfortable, unfussy space. While it doesn\u2019t have the wow factor, the decor\u2019s shades of light green, prints of birdlife and books artfully scattered about made for a relaxing environment. Slipping into my en suite I found a deep, free-standing roll-top bath and walk-in shower, and big bottles of eco-friendly 100 Acres toiletries \u2013 including a very silky conditioner. In one of the new rooms, the bath is actually inside the bedroom (\u201csomething younger couples like\u201d according to one of the staff). It\u2019s a pity the noisy A49 runs in front of the hotel but at least the traffic had reduced to a trickle by bedtime.</p> <p><strong>What about breakfast </strong><strong>and dinner</strong><strong>?</strong><br>The restaurant, with a strong farm-to-fork ethos, specialises in modern British cuisine with the food-miles kept to a minimum. Most meat comes from the estate\u2019s farm and there\u2019s a natty map on the menu showing all its suppliers within a three-mile radius, and a list of those within 25 miles. Between them, they supply most of the ingredients served here, from salmon to gin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ff29d4f1474a2664357c521af87febd69fbb453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff29d4f1474a2664357c521af87febd69fbb453/1_149_4186_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Main course, photographed from above, of roast chicken and veg, The Clive Arms Shropshire, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I tested their mettle by requesting vegan options: kicking off with a tempura-battered courgette flower that melted in the mouth. My main was a platter of produce picked fresh from the walled garden, half a mile away on the River Teme. This proved a delicious ensemble that included broccoli, broad beans, fried salad potatoes, marigold flowers and crispy slices of <em>cavolo nero</em>, washed down with a bottle of Stairway, a very acceptable pale gold ale from the <a href=\"http://www.theludlowbrewingcompany.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ludlow Brewing Company</a>.</p> <p>Breakfast was enlivened by two twists to a now-ubiquitous dish: the Clive\u2019s smashed avocado was not laid on toast but a lovingly crafted hash brown that was laced with chives and studded with beetroot. Served with homegrown tomatoes and broad beans, it set me up for the day.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>The Clive is part of an estate-run complex that includes a garden centre, bike shop, restaurant and a huge farm shop that sells the locally produced food served in the hotel. A 2.5-mile stroll from the hotel along the well-signposted Shropshire Way passes Bromfield\u2019s fine cluster of medieval estate buildings and heads across the fields of the Teme valley to Ludlow. Beloved of John Betjeman, Ludlow was the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/slow-food-chooses-ludlow-93805/\" title=\"\">first slow food town</a>. It may have lost its three Michelin-starred restaurants but remains a destination for foodies, thrumming with delis, local producers, a farmers\u2019 market and three annual <a href=\"http://www.foodfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">food festivals</a>.</p> <p><strong>How much?</strong><br>Farmhouse doubles from \u00a3145 B&amp;B, courtyard doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B</p> <p><strong>Value for money?</strong><br>For dinner or an outer room, definitely.

It was formerly called the Hare and Hounds and was looking a little tired before it reopened as the Stump \u2013 the local nickname for the pub \u2013 in August. Unlike many Cotswold inns, it hasn\u2019t been gutted and turned into a characterless, overpriced restaurant, but has been restored as a proper pub that happens to do great food. It has three open fires, exposed beams, cosy nooks, friendly staff \u2013 and great beer: from the <a href=\"https://www.tapbrewery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tap Brewery</a> up the road and the <a href=\"https://deyabrewing.com/\" title=\"\">DEYA Brewing Company</a> in Cheltenham. It also serves wine from \u00a318 a bottle and barrel-aged negronis for \u00a38. Encouragingly, the bar area is for drinkers, and those playing pool, rather than given over to diners.</p> <p>There are 10 bedrooms, in an adjoining building. The master suite features a rolltop bath in the bedroom and a wetroom with a walk-in shower and Bramley products.

We loved it all: the starters of wild mushroom croquettes and fig and burrata salad. The mains of marinara pizza (anchovies, capers, oregano) and ragu pappardelle, made with slow-braised beef shin. An irresistible wodge of boozy tiramisu. In fact, we loved it so much that we changed our plans and ate there the next night, too. And that experience included sea bass cooked in the wood-fired oven, from the short specials board, and a decadent cheesy garlic pizza bread with lardo and truffle aioli (\u00a36). Yes, cheesy bread topped with pig fat, dipped in more fat. Heaven.</p> <p>Breakfast is a restrained affair of sourdough toast with jam, eggs and/or bacon. After an overindulgent dinner, it is more than enough. For those who can\u2019t face more carbs, there is a lighter option of homemade granola with berries and yoghurt.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>Cirencester, the biggest town in the Cotswolds, is 10 minutes away by car or infrequent bus. We went to its <a href=\"https://coriniummuseum.org/\" title=\"\">Corinium Museum</a>, which has one of the best collections of Roman artefacts in the country. We also watched glassblowers in action at the <a href=\"https://www.newbreweryarts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">New Brewery Arts centre</a>; visited the cathedral-like St John the Baptist church; and walked in the Abbey Grounds, where an Augustinian monastery once stood.

Dark-wood panelling has been painted white, and airy ground-floor rooms now form linked dining-bar areas.

Inventive dishes make good use of fresh produce from the palace\u2019s acre of kitchen garden. Palace garden salad with soft-boiled egg and sweet mustard dressing (\u00a37) is a popular starter but English burrata with heritage tomatoes is great, too. Mains include classics, such as steak and fish and chips, but more unusual items put fresh seasonal veg centre stage, such as smashed courgettes with devilled Cornish crab (\u00a316). There were more tender leaves from the palace with a delicate tart of shallots and aged cheddar. A good next step might be to put that bountiful harvest to use in some vegan menu choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e9f9bee42908a9bd769e76234801af6f60b7bdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9f9bee42908a9bd769e76234801af6f60b7bdd/0_57_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast and dining room at the Kings Arms, Hampton Court, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The continental breakfast, included in the room rate, is plentiful, with a selection of oozy English cheeses and interesting charcuterie, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal and pastries. For those who still have room after last night\u2019s dinner, appealing extras include organic duck eggs (\u00a34 for two), mangalitza black pudding or bacon (\u00a33), and grilled heritage tomatoes with smashed avocado (\u00a38).</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>The palace, literally. Windows at the back of the hotel (particularly the second floor ones) give a good view into the famous maze and its disorientated visitors. (No, you\u2019ve tried that way \u2013 turn RIGHT!) The grounds, including that amazing kitchen garden, are free to enter, and while tickets to the palace are pricey (adult \u00a323.70 on the gate) there\u2019s lots to see, and it\u2019s often peopled with actors in costume and in character. We attended \u201cquestion time\u201d with Katherine of Aragon and Catherine Parr. The art gallery has old masters, including Rembrandt\u2019s moving The Artist\u2019s Mother and a room of Canalettos. The 444-hectare Bushy Park is across the road, with its woods, waterways, grassland and free-roaming deer.

It was unfamiliar terminology to me and \u2013 meaning mating \u2013 this was much to the amusement of my mum (who lives on a sheep farm). Chatting between courses made for a warm welcome, and perfectly in tune with the Yan\u2019s home-from-home, relaxed vibe. On a former sheep farm, in a converted 17th-century barn, the surrounding fields are now filled with the neighbours\u2019 grey-faced Lakeland Herdwicks (along with free-range chickens, who provide eggs for breakfast). The property\u2019s name is connected to its heritage: <em>yan</em> means \u201cone\u201d in the Cumbrian dialect still used by locals to count sheep.</p> <p>Bought by Sally and Dave Keighley in 2011, it was run as a self-catering hostel before being transformed into a bistro with rooms with the help of their daughter, Jess, and her husband, and chef, Will.

The nine double rooms come in different sizes, with a mix of pastel-painted and left-as-found distressed walls, iron fireplaces, recycled furniture, beds with Naturalmat organic mattresses, lamps by Dartington\u2019s Rodney Lomas, and a kettle and teapot (Pukka teas). There is some random art but no clutter, no plastic, and no bottled water. No TV, either.</p> <p>Bathrooms are lino-floored and tiled, with showers (Bette baths in rooms 4 and 5), shelving crafted from an old snooker table and Tabitha James Kraan toiletries.

      "bodyText": "The Clive Arms, Bromfield, Shropshire What\u2019s it like? Completely refurbished this year, the hotel is part of the Oakly Park estate owned by a direct descendant (and namesake) of Robert Clive, scourge of the Indian subcontinent. Three new bedrooms have been created in the large former farmhouse, while another 14 \u2013 in what were once outbuildings \u2013 have had extensive makeovers. My stay was in one of the new rooms and I found it a comfortable, unfussy space. While it doesn\u2019t have the wow factor, the decor\u2019s shades of light green, prints of birdlife and books artfully scattered about made for a relaxing environment. Slipping into my en suite I found a deep, free-standing roll-top bath and walk-in shower, and big bottles of eco-friendly 100 Acres toiletries \u2013 including a very silky conditioner. In one of the new rooms, the bath is actually inside the bedroom (\u201csomething younger couples like\u201d according to one of the staff). It\u2019s a pity the noisy A49 runs in front of the hotel but at least the traffic had reduced to a trickle by bedtime. What about breakfast and dinner? The restaurant, with a strong farm-to-fork ethos, specialises in modern British cuisine with the food-miles kept to a minimum. Most meat comes from the estate\u2019s farm and there\u2019s a natty map on the menu showing all its suppliers within a three-mile radius, and a list of those within 25 miles. Between them, they supply most of the ingredients served here, from salmon to gin. I tested their mettle by requesting vegan options: kicking off with a tempura-battered courgette flower that melted in the mouth. My main was a platter of produce picked fresh from the walled garden, half a mile away on the River Teme. This proved a delicious ensemble that included broccoli, broad beans, fried salad potatoes, marigold flowers and crispy slices of cavolo nero, washed down with a bottle of Stairway, a very acceptable pale gold ale from the Ludlow Brewing Company. Breakfast was enlivened by two twists to a now-ubiquitous dish: the Clive\u2019s smashed avocado was not laid on toast but a lovingly crafted hash brown that was laced with chives and studded with beetroot. Served with homegrown tomatoes and broad beans, it set me up for the day. What\u2019s on the doorstep? The Clive is part of an estate-run complex that includes a garden centre, bike shop, restaurant and a huge farm shop that sells the locally produced food served in the hotel. A 2.5-mile stroll from the hotel along the well-signposted Shropshire Way passes Bromfield\u2019s fine cluster of medieval estate buildings and heads across the fields of the Teme valley to Ludlow. Beloved of John Betjeman, Ludlow was the UK\u2019s first slow food town. It may have lost its three Michelin-starred restaurants but remains a destination for foodies, thrumming with delis, local producers, a farmers\u2019 market and three annual food festivals. How much? Farmhouse doubles from \u00a3145 B&amp;B, courtyard doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B Value for money? For dinner or an outer room, definitely. For the main room, just about. \u2022 theclive.co.uk Dixe Wills The Stump, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire What\u2019s it like? This roadside inn on Roman road the Fosse Way has been licensed since at least 1772. It was formerly called the Hare and Hounds and was looking a little tired before it reopened as the Stump \u2013 the local nickname for the pub \u2013 in August. Unlike many Cotswold inns, it hasn\u2019t been gutted and turned into a characterless, overpriced restaurant, but has been restored as a proper pub that happens to do great food. It has three open fires, exposed beams, cosy nooks, friendly staff \u2013 and great beer: from the Tap Brewery up the road and the DEYA Brewing Company in Cheltenham. It also serves wine from \u00a318 a bottle and barrel-aged negronis for \u00a38. Encouragingly, the bar area is for drinkers, and those playing pool, rather than given over to diners. There are 10 bedrooms, in an adjoining building. The master suite features a rolltop bath in the bedroom and a wetroom with a walk-in shower and Bramley products. Its style is spare but appealing: mostly white with one accent wall; hooks rather than a wardrobe; a colourful still life. The other rooms are similar in style but on a smaller scale (and minus the bath). What about breakfast and dinner? The Stump is run by Baz and Fred, two best mates in their late 20s, who started providing pizzas at events, and now have a permanent spot in Flat Iron Square, a street-food hub near London Bridge. The Stump is their first pub and here they have branched out to include pasta but otherwise kept things simple: four starters (each around \u00a35), seven pizzas and four pastas (from \u00a38), and four desserts (\u00a32-\u00a35). The quality of ingredients and the standard of cooking are outstanding. We loved it all: the starters of wild mushroom croquettes and fig and burrata salad. The mains of marinara pizza (anchovies, capers, oregano) and ragu pappardelle, made with slow-braised beef shin. An irresistible wodge of boozy tiramisu. In fact, we loved it so much that we changed our plans and ate there the next night, too. And that experience included sea bass cooked in the wood-fired oven, from the short specials board, and a decadent cheesy garlic pizza bread with lardo and truffle aioli (\u00a36). Yes, cheesy bread topped with pig fat, dipped in more fat. Heaven. Breakfast is a restrained affair of sourdough toast with jam, eggs and/or bacon. After an overindulgent dinner, it is more than enough. For those who can\u2019t face more carbs, there is a lighter option of homemade granola with berries and yoghurt. What\u2019s on the doorstep? Cirencester, the biggest town in the Cotswolds, is 10 minutes away by car or infrequent bus. We went to its Corinium Museum, which has one of the best collections of Roman artefacts in the country. We also watched glassblowers in action at the New Brewery Arts centre; visited the cathedral-like St John the Baptist church; and walked in the Abbey Grounds, where an Augustinian monastery once stood. Chedworth Roman Villa is within walking distance of the Stump, and pretty Cotswolds villages, such as Bourton-on-the-Water, are a short drive away. How much? From \u00a395 for a small double, \u00a399 for a double, \u00a3109 for a twin or \u00a3119 for the suite, all B&amp;B. Value for money? By Cotswolds standards, the accommodation is good-value and the food is an absolute steal. \u2022 thestump.co.uk Rachel Dixon The Kings Arms, Hampton Court, Surrey What\u2019s it like? A cream-painted three-storey, 300-year-old inn next to Lion Gate, the main entrance to Hampton Court Palace. Originally barracks for soldiers serving at the palace, it became the Queens Arms in the early 18th century but had a sex change in 1772 in honour of George III. A Nigerian investor bought it from brewery chain Hall &amp; Woodhouse a couple of years ago and it had a major facelift before reopening in July. Dark-wood panelling has been painted white, and airy ground-floor rooms now form linked dining-bar areas. The 14 bedrooms are also in bright white, with soft-grey carpets and fittings, and plenty of boutiquey touches: still and sparkling bottled water, fresh milk in the minibar, Nespresso machine, teapig teas, Jenny Betts toiletries in big bottles, Smart TV. What about breakfast and dinner? At the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Six (after a certain number of wives), the menu, devised and overseen by Mark Kempson of Michelin-starred Kitchen W8, is enough on its own to merit a visit. Inventive dishes make good use of fresh produce from the palace\u2019s acre of kitchen garden. Palace garden salad with soft-boiled egg and sweet mustard dressing (\u00a37) is a popular starter but English burrata with heritage tomatoes is great, too. Mains include classics, such as steak and fish and chips, but more unusual items put fresh seasonal veg centre stage, such as smashed courgettes with devilled Cornish crab (\u00a316). There were more tender leaves from the palace with a delicate tart of shallots and aged cheddar. A good next step might be to put that bountiful harvest to use in some vegan menu choices. The continental breakfast, included in the room rate, is plentiful, with a selection of oozy English cheeses and interesting charcuterie, fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal and pastries. For those who still have room after last night\u2019s dinner, appealing extras include organic duck eggs (\u00a34 for two), mangalitza black pudding or bacon (\u00a33), and grilled heritage tomatoes with smashed avocado (\u00a38). What\u2019s on the doorstep? The palace, literally. Windows at the back of the hotel (particularly the second floor ones) give a good view into the famous maze and its disorientated visitors. (No, you\u2019ve tried that way \u2013 turn RIGHT!) The grounds, including that amazing kitchen garden, are free to enter, and while tickets to the palace are pricey (adult \u00a323.70 on the gate) there\u2019s lots to see, and it\u2019s often peopled with actors in costume and in character. We attended \u201cquestion time\u201d with Katherine of Aragon and Catherine Parr. The art gallery has old masters, including Rembrandt\u2019s moving The Artist\u2019s Mother and a room of Canalettos. The 444-hectare Bushy Park is across the road, with its woods, waterways, grassland and free-roaming deer. Hampton Court railway station is just the other side of the Thames (Waterloo 30 minutes), so the sights of London are accessible, too. How much? Doubles from \u00a3120 including continental breakfast Value for money? Pretty good for the premium location and chic surroundings. Most accommodation around here is serviced apartments, so this is a welcome addition. \u2022 kingsarmshamptoncourt.com Liz Boulter The Yan, Grasmere, Lake District What\u2019s it like? \u201cWhat\u2019s tupping?\u201d I asked, during a chat about sheep that my mum was having with the owners of The Yan, a new bistro-with-rooms in the Lakes. It was unfamiliar terminology to me and \u2013 meaning mating \u2013 this was much to the amusement of my mum (who lives on a sheep farm). Chatting between courses made for a warm welcome, and perfectly in tune with the Yan\u2019s home-from-home, relaxed vibe. On a former sheep farm, in a converted 17th-century barn, the surrounding fields are now filled with the neighbours\u2019 grey-faced Lakeland Herdwicks (along with free-range chickens, who provide eggs for breakfast). The property\u2019s name is connected to its heritage: yan means \u201cone\u201d in the Cumbrian dialect still used by locals to count sheep. Bought by Sally and Dave Keighley in 2011, it was run as a self-catering hostel before being transformed into a bistro with rooms with the help of their daughter, Jess, and her husband, and chef, Will. There are now seven bedrooms and three cottages \u2013 some dog-friendly, as is the bistro \u2013 all with huge beds, National Trust blankets and views across the fells. What about breakfast and dinner? Dinner is served early (3pm-8.30pm), catering to hungry walkers. The menu focuses on seasonal British classics and modern European dishes. There are also epic sharing platters: seafood (with king scallops, smoked salmon and warm mackerel), roast meats with trimmings and a vegetarian option, including hummus of the day with flatbreads and baked potatoes filled with leeks and herb mash. If the rooms are fully booked, I\u2019d still recommend coming for dinner. We tried pickled beetroot and stilton salad with roast pumpkin and toasted seeds and a creamy parsnip and pear soup to start. For main, smoky tomato and chicken stew with chorizo dumplings; and a parmesan polenta cake with a warm vegetable chutney and crisped steam broccoli. Then poached pear in red wine syrup, with apple sorbet and a brandy snap basket for dessert. Breakfast (not included) is a feast: thick-cut sourdough, loaded with smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and chive sour cream; fry-ups; or smaller breakfast baps, porridge and homemade muesli. Produce comes from the farm or the next one along. What\u2019s on the doorstep? The nearest railway station is Windermere, a transport hub for the lakes. The No 555 bus heads to Keswick and Kendal, including Grasmere for the Yan (in around 35 minutes). \u201cTo the lakes\u201d, a sign reads at one end of Windermere town, with an easy circular walk up Queen Adelaide\u2019s Hill for a view of the lake and back along the woodland stream of Wynlass Beck. The closest walk to the Yan, is up to Helm Crag \u2013 also known as the Lion and the Lamb \u2013 one of the area\u2019s best-known routes, it\u2019s a moderate 6km up and back. Passing National Trust property Allan Bank, we took a walk to Silver How (around 4.5km), which increases with difficulty, but offers lots of viewpoints before the climb gets steeper towards Wray Gill. Dog-friendly, walkers\u2019 pubs in the area include Sticklebarn and Wainwrights\u2019 Inn, where we stopped for a Sunday roast. Also nearby, the famous Grasmere Gingerbread Shop, Wordsworth\u2019s former home Dove Cottage, and a great bookshop, Sam Read, on the corner of the village green. How much? From \u00a3100 a night, breakfast from \u00a33.95, two-course dinner for two, around \u00a350. Value for money? Yes \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect mid-range accommodation option in the area, with the bonus of affordable high-quality food. \u2022 theyan.co.uk Antonia Wilson Train travel from London to Windermere provided by thetrainline.com The Bull, Totnes, Devon What\u2019s it like? At the summit of Totnes High Street, this sometime-grotty boozer, which closed its doors in 2017, has been rescued thanks to a painstaking refurbishment by local architect Jackie Gillespie. Layers have been peeled back to reveal a rambling mid-19th century inn full of quirks. The nine double rooms come in different sizes, with a mix of pastel-painted and left-as-found distressed walls, iron fireplaces, recycled furniture, beds with Naturalmat organic mattresses, lamps by Dartington\u2019s Rodney Lomas, and a kettle and teapot (Pukka teas). There is some random art but no clutter, no plastic, and no bottled water. No TV, either. Bathrooms are lino-floored and tiled, with showers (Bette baths in rooms 4 and 5), shelving crafted from an old snooker table and Tabitha James Kraan toiletries. As well as a fabulous restaurant and bar, therapist Sarah Carr offers deep-cleanse facials (1hour, \u00a355). Kitchen heat is recycled to warm water and solar panels scoop up Devon\u2019s blue skies. What about breakfast and dinner? Owner Geetie Singh-Watson has a stellar track record in green-minded gastronomy, opening the UK\u2019s first organic pub, Islington\u2019s Duke of Cambridge, in the late 1980s (in 2009 she was awarded an MBE for Services to the Organic Pub Trade). She admits to having a \u201cbrutal passion for sourcing food meticulously\u201d and avoiding waste. Don\u2019t ask for crisps or anything in packets. The kitchen, led by chef James Dodd (who worked with Singh-Watson previously at Riverford Field Kitchen), changes menus daily. I tried starters of beetroot, red cabbage, creme fraiche and pomegranate (\u00a35.50) and pork terrine (\u00a36.50). My main was seven-spiced lamb shoulder (\u00a316.50, perfect to share) \u2013 cooked overnight \u2013 with leeks, beans and fried cauliflower. \u201cVeggies are the main, meat is sides,\u201d insists Singh-Watson. The chocolate cake was vegan. Unusual wines are all sold by the glass, along with a range of British spirits and vermouths. Check out Totnes\u2019s own New Lion ales. Breakfast is granola and berries plus baked grapefruit, or shakshuka, or bacon and r\u00f6sti, coffee and Almond Thief sourdough toast. What\u2019s on the doorstep? Check out local history at Totnes Museum (free, donations welcome). Round the corner from The Bull, The Bay Horse is the town\u2019s ale pub, while the Totnes Brewing Co does craft beers, with live music upstairs. Totnes has impressive shopping for a small town. Drift Records has a selection of vinyl and books (its Sea Change Festival is a top-notch showcase). Me and East sells bespoke, handmade gifts. For a country walk, there are paths on the River Dart, and the Dartington Estate has gardens, ancient yews, a deer park and cool modernist buildings. How much? B&amp;B doubles from \u00a3130; all rooms \u00a3130 for the first three months (The Bull opened 1 December 2019). Dinner for two \u00a350-\u00a380 with wine. Value for money? The rooms are good-value, the food superb value. You could go cheaper and do a B&amp;B, but The Bull feels private and intimate \u2013 and falling into bed after an indulgent dinner is the way to go. Totnes, a popular stopover for coast-bound holidaymakers, now has an inn that befits its Transition Town status and indy spirit. \u2022 bullinntotnes.co.uk Chris Moss Looking for a holiday with a difference?

It urges people to back Labour and \u201ccandidates who can defeat the Tories in constituencies where Labour is an also-ran\u201d \u2013 asking them to \u201cthink of the electrifying impact of relieving Mr Johnson of high office\u201d.</p> \n<p>Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is wasting a moment of this last day.

Compared with the first poll, Labour is two points up, meaning Johnson\u2019s notional majority has been cut from 68 to 28 as his party\u2019s predicted seat count falls by 20 to 339, while Labour\u2019s improves by the same amount to 231. The SNP takes 41 and the Liberal Democrats 15, with some particularly surprising Lib Dem gains predicted.</p> \n<h2>At a glance</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/10/woman-says-account-hacked-to-post-fake-story-about-hospital-boy\">has claimed her Facebook account was hacked</a> after it was used to post false information claiming a photograph of an ill boy on the floor of a hospital was staged for political purposes.</p></li> \n <li><p>Corbyn has dismissed as \u201cbanter\u201d a recording of Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, saying Labour would not win the election.</p></li> \n <li><p>Jo Swinson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/empathy-bypass-lib-dem-jo-swinson-attacks-pm-in-tactical-voting-call\">accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d</a> in his attitude to other people.</p></li> \n <li><p>How was a PM on day release for nicking a phone allowed in a JCB, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/boris-johnson-jcb-polystyrene-bricks-campaign-john-crace-sketch\">asks John Crace</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p>Want to vote tactically?

The UK ended March 2019 with 39,135 pubs, which is 320 more than a year earlier, says the Office of National Statistics (ONS). It is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/11/british-pub-numbers-grow-for-first-time-in-decade\">first net increase since 2010</a> and contrasts with the previous nine years during which pubs closed at a rate of more than 700 each year. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), though, cautions that its own statistics \u2013 due in the new year and covering a higher number of pubs \u2013 may not be as bubbly.</p> \n<p>&gt; Labelling food and drinks with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/10/exercise-advice-on-food-labels-could-help-to-tackle-the-obesity-crisis\">how much walking or running is needed to burn them off</a> could help tackle the obesity crisis, researchers say. While nutritional information such as calorie count is mandatory, there is limited evidence it makes people choose healthier food. A study led by Daley calls for small symbols showing how much physical activity is needed to compensate for consuming the item. A fizzy drink containing 138 calories, for example, would take 26 minutes of walking or 13 minutes of running to burn off. \u201cIf I tell you something is going to take you 60 minutes of walking to burn, I think most people understand that and know that 60 minutes of walking is a long way,\u201d says Professor Amanda Daley of Loughborough University. </p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Britain\u2019s homelessness epidemic</h2> \n<p>A record number of homeless people died in 2018 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2019/dec/11/the-empty-doorway-britains-homelessness-crisis-podcast\">charities are warning this year could be worse</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. This is it, the last day of the campaign, the end is in sight, but not before one final flurry of campaigning effort from all the parties. Herein we bring you the election news and the best of the rest \u2013 and of course you should follow the day\u2019s live political news here. What\u2019s going on? Labour and the Conservatives are in a frantic scramble for votes as the last day of campaigning begins. Both parties have labelled Thursday\u2019s vote the \u201cmost important in a generation\u201d . The Guardian\u2019s election editorial shares this view, saying \u201cBritain has not faced a more critical election in decades than the one it faces on Thursday\u201d. It urges people to back Labour and \u201ccandidates who can defeat the Tories in constituencies where Labour is an also-ran\u201d \u2013 asking them to \u201cthink of the electrifying impact of relieving Mr Johnson of high office\u201d. Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is wasting a moment of this last day. The prime minister will be crisscrossing the country from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London, delivering his message that the Conservatives need only another 12 seats to win a majority and that only his party can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Corbyn will start his day in Scotland before visiting at least five key seats in a whirlwind tour across England \u2013 calling for those who are undecided to \u201cvote for hope in this election\u201d. Both sides insist the election remains closely fought and that polls giving the Conservatives a lead could be wrong. The release of YouGov\u2019s second and much-hyped constituency-by-constituency poll suggests that this is not just a campaign line from the parties and we could be in for a nerve-jangling finish. Compared with the first poll, Labour is two points up, meaning Johnson\u2019s notional majority has been cut from 68 to 28 as his party\u2019s predicted seat count falls by 20 to 339, while Labour\u2019s improves by the same amount to 231. The SNP takes 41 and the Liberal Democrats 15, with some particularly surprising Lib Dem gains predicted. At a glance A woman has claimed her Facebook account was hacked after it was used to post false information claiming a photograph of an ill boy on the floor of a hospital was staged for political purposes. Corbyn has dismissed as \u201cbanter\u201d a recording of Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, saying Labour would not win the election. Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d in his attitude to other people. How was a PM on day release for nicking a phone allowed in a JCB, asks John Crace. Want to vote tactically? We have a region-by-region guide. Huw Edwards has said \u201cthe stakes are very high\u201d for the BBC\u2019s general coverage amid Conservative threats to examine the licence fee and Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting remit after the election. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, won\u2019t talk to us, say \u201cbullied\u201d doctors at his local hospital in Suffolk. The Conservatives have opened a second investigation into the party\u2019s Hastings candidate, Sally-Ann Hart \u2013 this time for alleged Islamophobia. The day ahead A busy day all round. Johnson will be travelling from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London. Jo Swinson will be making appearances at a series of rallies. She is targeting Lib Dem seats around Surrey and the London area. Nigel Farage is back on the campaign trail and will be in Yorkshire backed by local Prospective Parliamentary Candidates. Nicola Sturgeon will join SNP candidates on the final day of campaigning in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dunbartonshire.

Best of the rest &gt; A coroner has warned theme park operators about the risk of future deaths unless safety measures are adopted after an inquest into the drowning of Evha Jannath. The 11-year-old girl was propelled from a vessel on the Splash Canyon river rapids ride at Drayton Manor in Staffordshire in May 2017. The inquest jury found that Evha died accidentally. Jurors heard there had been no safety warnings given to guests boarding the ride, warning signs were incomplete or illegible, CCTV was not adequately monitored and no water rescue equipment or training was available to staff. &gt; The decline of the British pub may be at an end, according to figures showing that their number has increased for the first time this decade. The UK ended March 2019 with 39,135 pubs, which is 320 more than a year earlier, says the Office of National Statistics (ONS). It is the first net increase since 2010 and contrasts with the previous nine years during which pubs closed at a rate of more than 700 each year. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), though, cautions that its own statistics \u2013 due in the new year and covering a higher number of pubs \u2013 may not be as bubbly. &gt; Labelling food and drinks with how much walking or running is needed to burn them off could help tackle the obesity crisis, researchers say. While nutritional information such as calorie count is mandatory, there is limited evidence it makes people choose healthier food. A study led by Daley calls for small symbols showing how much physical activity is needed to compensate for consuming the item. A fizzy drink containing 138 calories, for example, would take 26 minutes of walking or 13 minutes of running to burn off. \u201cIf I tell you something is going to take you 60 minutes of walking to burn, I think most people understand that and know that 60 minutes of walking is a long way,\u201d says Professor Amanda Daley of Loughborough University.

      "body": "<p>New Zealand police have vowed to return to White Island as soon as possible to retrieve the bodies of eight tourists who died there, as the first Australian victims of the fatal volcanic eruption were named.</p> \n<p>Wednesday dawned clear and calm in Whakat\u0101ne, but still police efforts to reach the island were hampered after volcanic activity substantially increased, making it too dangerous for disaster victim identification officers to land.</p> \n<p>In a small victory, police managed to conduct four flyovers of the island with a drone, but their cautious response is drawing the ire of locals in the Bay of Plenty, who hold simmering resentments that more people weren\u2019t rescued in the aftermath of the eruption, and those that were saved was largely due to local helicopter pilots who ignored official warnings to stay away.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey should go and get them back now,\u201d said Maree Heke, 47, a local musician.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking too long. And then they should close that island off to all tourists.\u201d</p> \n<p>As victims\u2019 families grow increasingly anxious about when their loved ones will be coming home, police deputy commissioner John Tims promised his officers wouldn\u2019t rest till the bodies were returned, displaying an emblazoned authority that has largely been absent from officials in the days following the disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur number one priority is to return to the island and recover those bodies,\u201d he said emphatically, saying he would give families his \u201cpromise\u201d to return their kin.</p> \n<p>The identities of several victims began to emerge on Wednesday. Gavin Dallow, from Adelaide, was named by his family as one of the dead. The body of his 15-year-old step-daughter Zoe Hosking is believed to still be on the island.</p> \n<p>Gavin\u2019s father, Brian Dallow, praised his son as \u201ca person who was always interested in helping other people\u201d and enjoyed a range of sports. He said Gavin was the kind of person who \u201cif he\u2019d known there was a danger he wouldn\u2019t have gone\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt Christmas we\u2019re really going to miss him.\u201d</p> \n<p>A family statement said: \u201cOur hearts break at the loss of Zoe at such a young age. We know her loss will also devastate her school community and the local Girl Guides, of which she was an active member.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Brisbane mother and daughter, Julie Richards, 47, and 20-year-old Jessica, who were passengers on Ovation of the Seas, were also confirmed by family members to have died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

of whom worked for White Island Tours.</p> \n<p>The Australian Defence Force arrived late on Wednesday to 10 injured Australians to hospitals in NSW and Victoria and had already sent medical supplies to New Zealand, including one square metre of human skin, to help treat burns victims. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

\n</aside> \n<p>As the names of some of the deceased emerged, New Zealand activated its burn disaster national response plan for the first time ever. 30 White Island victims remain in six hospitals around the country, with 25 in a critical condition and 22 requiring round-the-clock breathing assistance.</p> \n<p>The ministry of health said 120 square metres of skin had been purchased from the US to treat victims, and it was likely more people would die from their severe and complex injuries, despite operating theatres working around the clock.</p> \n<p>Dr Peter Watson, the Counties Manukau chief medical officer said: \u201cThe nature of the burns suffered is complicated by the gases and chemicals in the eruption.\u201d</p> \n<p>As criticism of police\u2019s lethargic response mounted from locals, a scientist from GNS Science, Graham Leonard backed up their decision not to return to the island, saying conditions were worsening and it would be challenging for people to breathe, see or walk on the disaster site.</p> \n<p>Leonard said the risk of another eruption like Monday\u2019s had substantially increased and there was now a 40-60% chance of one in the next 24 hours.</p> \n<p>As families were beginning to arrive from overseas to Whakat\u0101ne, aided by cheap flights from Air New Zealand and fast-tracked consular support, they were being looked after by police family liason officers, and local iwi (tribal authority).</p> \n<p>Paul Quinn, the chair of White Island tours, said iwi were<strong> \u201c</strong>wrapping the necessary support around affected families and staff, all of whom are understandably distraught\u201d, and support care packages were being put together for those families as they await news on the recovery mission.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are many questions that are left to be answered but our priority at this time is on the welfare of those affected,\u201d Quinn said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

after White Island eruption</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the wait for the recovery mission lengthens, local people in the Bay of Plenty expressed frustration at the multiple delays and the lack of information from police, including any discussion of the details of the recovery plan or how long it would take.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about it and do it,\u201d says Ben Smith, 44, a local orchard worker. \u201cI think they are over-rationalising it. You have to take that information from all the scientists into account but also listen to the locals. They know the island and the weather as good as anyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some likened the situation in Whakat\u0101ne to the Pike River Mine disaster in Greymouth in 2010. The bodies of 29 miners remain entombed in the mine nine years after a blast in the mine.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m old school and it\u2019s been frustrating me,\u201d said BJ Hawthorn, 51, a bobcat driver. \u201cThis country has got extremely PC and out of control when it comes to worksafe conditions. Just go and get them. I know guys in the fire brigade here who just want the opportunity to go and get them. If there\u2019s a car on fire you don\u2019t wait until someone puts road cones around it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some in the town said they think tourists should never have been allowed on White Island \u2013 and never should be again. Hinepare Tawa, 32, a local mother-of-four said: \u201cMy belief is that Whakaari is a living being, an ancestor, and I don\u2019t believe she is a person to be disturbed. If the island was closed I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it because I really have a problem with capitalising on nature\u201d.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand police have vowed to return to White Island as soon as possible to retrieve the bodies of eight tourists who died there, as the first Australian victims of the fatal volcanic eruption were named. Wednesday dawned clear and calm in Whakat\u0101ne, but still police efforts to reach the island were hampered after volcanic activity substantially increased, making it too dangerous for disaster victim identification officers to land. In a small victory, police managed to conduct four flyovers of the island with a drone, but their cautious response is drawing the ire of locals in the Bay of Plenty, who hold simmering resentments that more people weren\u2019t rescued in the aftermath of the eruption, and those that were saved was largely due to local helicopter pilots who ignored official warnings to stay away. \u201cThey should go and get them back now,\u201d said Maree Heke, 47, a local musician. \u201cThey\u2019re taking too long. And then they should close that island off to all tourists.\u201d As victims\u2019 families grow increasingly anxious about when their loved ones will be coming home, police deputy commissioner John Tims promised his officers wouldn\u2019t rest till the bodies were returned, displaying an emblazoned authority that has largely been absent from officials in the days following the disaster. \u201cOur number one priority is to return to the island and recover those bodies,\u201d he said emphatically, saying he would give families his \u201cpromise\u201d to return their kin. The identities of several victims began to emerge on Wednesday. Gavin Dallow, from Adelaide, was named by his family as one of the dead. The body of his 15-year-old step-daughter Zoe Hosking is believed to still be on the island. Gavin\u2019s father, Brian Dallow, praised his son as \u201ca person who was always interested in helping other people\u201d and enjoyed a range of sports. He said Gavin was the kind of person who \u201cif he\u2019d known there was a danger he wouldn\u2019t have gone\u201d. \u201cAt Christmas we\u2019re really going to miss him.\u201d A family statement said: \u201cOur hearts break at the loss of Zoe at such a young age. We know her loss will also devastate her school community and the local Girl Guides, of which she was an active member.\u201d A Brisbane mother and daughter, Julie Richards, 47, and 20-year-old Jessica, who were passengers on Ovation of the Seas, were also confirmed by family members to have died. John Mickel, a friend of the Richards\u2019, said the family was \u201cunited in grief\u201d. Police also named Krystal Browitt, Richard Elzer and Karla Matthews as among the missing from Australia and Tipene Maangi and Hayden Inman from New Zealand, both of whom worked for White Island Tours. The Australian Defence Force arrived late on Wednesday to 10 injured Australians to hospitals in NSW and Victoria and had already sent medical supplies to New Zealand, including one square metre of human skin, to help treat burns victims. As the names of some of the deceased emerged, New Zealand activated its burn disaster national response plan for the first time ever. 30 White Island victims remain in six hospitals around the country, with 25 in a critical condition and 22 requiring round-the-clock breathing assistance. The ministry of health said 120 square metres of skin had been purchased from the US to treat victims, and it was likely more people would die from their severe and complex injuries, despite operating theatres working around the clock. Dr Peter Watson, the Counties Manukau chief medical officer said: \u201cThe nature of the burns suffered is complicated by the gases and chemicals in the eruption.\u201d As criticism of police\u2019s lethargic response mounted from locals, a scientist from GNS Science, Graham Leonard backed up their decision not to return to the island, saying conditions were worsening and it would be challenging for people to breathe, see or walk on the disaster site. Leonard said the risk of another eruption like Monday\u2019s had substantially increased and there was now a 40-60% chance of one in the next 24 hours. As families were beginning to arrive from overseas to Whakat\u0101ne, aided by cheap flights from Air New Zealand and fast-tracked consular support, they were being looked after by police family liason officers, and local iwi (tribal authority). Paul Quinn, the chair of White Island tours, said iwi were \u201cwrapping the necessary support around affected families and staff, all of whom are understandably distraught\u201d, and support care packages were being put together for those families as they await news on the recovery mission. \u201cThere are many questions that are left to be answered but our priority at this time is on the welfare of those affected,\u201d Quinn said in a statement. White Island\u2019s alert level remains at three (out of five) and volcanologist Craig Miller said volcanic gas pressures remained high. \u201cThe situation remains highly uncertain as to future activity.\u201d As the wait for the recovery mission lengthens, local people in the Bay of Plenty expressed frustration at the multiple delays and the lack of information from police, including any discussion of the details of the recovery plan or how long it would take. \u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about it and do it,\u201d says Ben Smith, 44, a local orchard worker. \u201cI think they are over-rationalising it. You have to take that information from all the scientists into account but also listen to the locals. They know the island and the weather as good as anyone.\u201d Some likened the situation in Whakat\u0101ne to the Pike River Mine disaster in Greymouth in 2010. The bodies of 29 miners remain entombed in the mine nine years after a blast in the mine. \u201cI\u2019m old school and it\u2019s been frustrating me,\u201d said BJ Hawthorn, 51, a bobcat driver. \u201cThis country has got extremely PC and out of control when it comes to worksafe conditions. Just go and get them. I know guys in the fire brigade here who just want the opportunity to go and get them. If there\u2019s a car on fire you don\u2019t wait until someone puts road cones around it.\u201d Some in the town said they think tourists should never have been allowed on White Island \u2013 and never should be again. Hinepare Tawa, 32, a local mother-of-four said: \u201cMy belief is that Whakaari is a living being, an ancestor, and I don\u2019t believe she is a person to be disturbed. If the island was closed I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it because I really have a problem with capitalising on nature\u201d.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "They are this year\u2019s five most-viewed properties on the UK\u2019s biggest house-selling website \u2013 from a Premier League footballer\u2019s \u201cwagtastic\u201d Essex mansion to a castle that could double for Downton Abbey. Former West Ham footballer Andy Carroll scored top place in the 2019 Rightmove list of most-snooped-around properties with his Chigwell home, shared with his partner, Billi Mucklow, a star of the The Only Way Is Essex television show. Its 8,000 sq feet of zebra print walls, a sweeping marble staircase, mirrored-ceiling master bedroom and dark velour-clad cinema room went on the market in January with a \u00a35m price tag. Located on Chigwell\u2019s millionaire row, it includes a full-size football pitch, swimming pool and tennis court. Buyers can pop down to the nearby Sheesh restaurant, a celebrity haunt in a building owned by fellow Chigwell resident Lord Alan Sugar, where footballers Harry Kane and Rio Ferdinand have been pictured hanging out. But despite gaining 150,000 views on Rightmove, the property has yet to find a buyer after 11 months on the market. Footballers appear to have trouble selling their luxury pads, because the third most-viewed property on Rightmove is a triple-level penthouse occupying the 44th to 46th floors of Manchester\u2019s Beetham Tower. It is understood to be owned by former Manchester United and England defender Phil Neville, now manager of the England women\u2019s team. First listed on Rightmove in June 2017 for \u00a34m, it has failed to find a buyer and the asking price is now \u00a33.5m. It has four bedrooms, a chandelier cascading down a spiral staircase and views of Old Trafford. The agents describe it as \u201caspirational living at its best\u201d. The current owner can at least comfort themselves with the rental income, believed to be around \u00a315,000 a month. Fourth in the league of most-viewed properties on Rightmove was yet another home in top-flight football territory. Prestbury, a picturesque village in Cheshire\u2019s \u201cgolden triangle\u201d is home to Wayne Rooney and Peter Crouch. Overdale is a seven-bed mansion with spa, indoor pool and gym priced at \u00a33.95m, but it too has hung around on the market for a long time, after first being listed in November last year. James Webster of agents Gascoigne Halman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of near-misses with buyers. It has been an interesting market this year what with Brexit and the election and there is considerable holding of breath until the outcome on Thursday night. I think after that we\u2019ll see a lot more activity.\u201d Castles were the other properties most sought after by professional snoopers. Glenborrodale Castle, a five-storey of the Scots baronial architectural style, was the second-most viewed home on Rightmove. But with a price tag of \u00a33.75m the buyer will get rather more than a footballer\u2019s palace; apart from the 16 bedrooms there are 132 acres, a gate lodge, coach house and three islands. The fifth most-viewed property on Rightmove during the year was perhaps its most traditionally appealing: a 400-year-old grade I-listed country manor in Christow, about 12 miles southwest of Exeter. Priced at \u00a33.95m, Canonteign Manor was taken for King Charles I and his troops during the English civil war and was built on land given to the canons of St Mary du Val in Normandy around 1125. Rightmove\u2019s five most-viewed homes in 2019 1. Chigwell, Essex, \u00a34.95m, nine-bed mansion 2. Glenborrodale Castle, Loch Sunart, Scotland, 16-bed castle, \u00a33.75m 3.

But what about the causes of crime? Very little on offer. The manifesto briefly mentions a prison education service focused on work and a new approach to drug addiction treatment to reduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/15/drug-poisoning-deaths-in-england-and-wales-at-highest-level-ever-recorded\" title=\"\">drug deaths</a>. </p> <p>But this is important. This is despite the government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/rise-in-violent-not-due-to-police-cuts-alone-figures-show\" title=\"\">serious violent crime strategy</a> acknowledging that like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. Low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates all have links to crime. Furthermore, the evidence shows that at least with regards to non-sexual and non-violent crimes, a more rehabilitative, community approach is more effective. <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">Labour</a> promises to set new standards for community sentences and introduce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/04/magistrates-call-for-end-to-prison-sentences-under-eight-weeks\" title=\"\">presumption against prison sentences of six months</a> or less for non-violent and non-sexual offences. It will rebuild youth services and invest in a youth justice system in which schools, local authorities, health authorities and youth services divert young people away from the pathways towards crime. And it will tackle the disproportionate levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/29/more-than-half-young-people-jail-are-of-bme-background\" title=\"\">black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME)</a> children in custody.</p> <p>But there are other areas where the party looks to strengthen the security framework.

      "bodyText": "From the off, the Conservative party hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson\u2019s premiership became clear: 20,000 new police officers on the streets was one of his first pledges, followed by increased use of stop and search, prison expansion, more Tasers, and longer jail sentences \u2013 all of which have ended up in the manifesto. So, clearly, tough on crime. But what about the causes of crime? Very little on offer. The manifesto briefly mentions a prison education service focused on work and a new approach to drug addiction treatment to reduce drug deaths. But this is important. This is despite the government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy acknowledging that like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. Low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates all have links to crime. Furthermore, the evidence shows that at least with regards to non-sexual and non-violent crimes, a more rehabilitative, community approach is more effective. Labour promises to set new standards for community sentences and introduce a presumption against prison sentences of six months or less for non-violent and non-sexual offences. It will rebuild youth services and invest in a youth justice system in which schools, local authorities, health authorities and youth services divert young people away from the pathways towards crime. And it will tackle the disproportionate levels of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) children in custody. But there are other areas where the party looks to strengthen the security framework. It also pledges to create \u201cmodern\u201d prisons, hire 2,000 more prison officers than the Tories and overhaul use of stop-and-search but doesn\u2019t specifically promise to reduce its application. The Liberal Democrats have one of the most radical offers. The manifesto talks about adopting a public health approach to violent crime, a line the previous home secretary, Sajid Javid, appeared to be warming to before Johnson took power, transforming prisons into \u201cplaces of rehabilitation and recovery\u201d and makes a specific pledge to cut the number of people in prison by introducing a presumption against short prison sentences and ending sentences for the possession of drugs for personal use \u2013 a first step to decriminalisation. Most radically, it wants to legalise cannabis in the UK by introducing a legal, regulated market for the drug. The party would introduce limits on the potency levels and permit cannabis to be sold through licensed outlets to adults over the age of 18. This would be following the steps of other countries such as Canada, and some US states. Labour offers a Royal Commission, which drug reform experts have warned would take years and could deliver nothing but the status quo.",

Every day Nadia is back: at a birthday party thrown for her by her obnoxious hipster friend Maxine, who coos the words \u201csweet birthday baby\u201d as she offers her a joint laced with cocaine. And back in a place where everyone is completely oblivious to the fact that she can\u2019t stop dying.</p> <p>Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-good-place\">The Good Place</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/21/maniac-review-jonah-hill-emma-stone-netflix-cary-fukunaga\">Maniac</a>, Russian Doll \u2013 produced by Lyonne, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland \u2013 continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2019/jan/31/dead-and-loving-it-why-has-tv-become-so-obsessed-with-the-afterlife\">the trend for existential </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2019/jan/31/dead-and-loving-it-why-has-tv-become-so-obsessed-with-the-afterlife\">crises on TV</a>, but pushed it to blackly comic new depths. Nadia\u2019s predicament is so strange, she tells Maxine, that \u201cexplaining it might give us both an aneurysm.\u201d She consults a rabbi and her therapist \u2013 a friend of her late mother\u2019s \u2013 who try to help her with what appears to be psychosis, but it\u2019s all in vain. She ends up freezing to death, being run over or electrocuted before being shunted back to the party each time. Indeed, her death is the show\u2019s one constant, a coda that pulls us back to that original refrain (and to the actual musical refrain that plays every time she is reincarnated: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jRh2PRa1tU\">Harry Nilsson\u2019s Gotta Get Up</a>). Everything comes focalised via Nadia \u2013 irascible, vulnerable, whip-smart and, like the show\u2019s viewers, extremely confused.</p> <p>That is, until she links up with Alan (Charlie Barnett), who has to relive the end of his relationship with his brilliantly stuck-up PhD student girlfriend (Lyonne\u2019s Orange Is the New Black co-star Dascha Polanco) every day. Their parallel tortures begin to interweave, illuminating what has actually been happening and allowing them to save one another. For Alan, that means confronting the truth about the night of the breakup, and the fact that he wanted to end his life. For Nadia, it means facing up to the trauma caused by her mother, Leonora, whose suicide rumbles gently through Russian Doll like a faraway train before eventually crashing into the centre of the action, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chloe-sevigny\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a> shows up as the chronically unstable Leonora in a sepia-tinged, melon-flavoured flashback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Watch the trailer for Russian Doll.\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YHcKoAMGGvY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nadia and Alan\u2019s mutual support is nothing short of a blessing. Unlike the moral improvement narrative that underpins so many other shows about death, Russian Doll emphasises the need to be there for ourselves and for others, and to be present in the moment. Like addiction, one of the inspirations for the show, Russian Doll presents a cycle with no clear end or beginning, which is often terrifying, and requires human connection to confront. The parallels with Lyonne\u2019s own life made it all the more poignant; once tipped for major stardom, her life was derailed by heroin addiction and a string of related health issues. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/06/antibirth-star-natasha-lyonne-isnt-everyone-entitled-to-an-existential-breakdown\">previously told this newspaper</a>: \u201cAt the back of that addiction are feelings that so many of us have, that don\u2019t go away. Isn\u2019t everyone entitled to a moment of existential breakdown in a lifetime?\u201d</p> <p>Here, she plays out that existential breakdown to its logical end \u2013 before pulling it back from the brink. In the end, this quirky, haunting and sometimes hysterical show truly was a lifesaver.</p>",

Indeed, her death is the show\u2019s one constant, a coda that pulls us back to that original refrain (and to the actual musical refrain that plays every time she is reincarnated: Harry Nilsson\u2019s Gotta Get Up). Everything comes focalised via Nadia \u2013 irascible, vulnerable, whip-smart and, like the show\u2019s viewers, extremely confused. That is, until she links up with Alan (Charlie Barnett), who has to relive the end of his relationship with his brilliantly stuck-up PhD student girlfriend (Lyonne\u2019s Orange Is the New Black co-star Dascha Polanco) every day. Their parallel tortures begin to interweave, illuminating what has actually been happening and allowing them to save one another. For Alan, that means confronting the truth about the night of the breakup, and the fact that he wanted to end his life. For Nadia, it means facing up to the trauma caused by her mother, Leonora, whose suicide rumbles gently through Russian Doll like a faraway train before eventually crashing into the centre of the action, when Chlo\u00eb Sevigny shows up as the chronically unstable Leonora in a sepia-tinged, melon-flavoured flashback. Nadia and Alan\u2019s mutual support is nothing short of a blessing. Unlike the moral improvement narrative that underpins so many other shows about death, Russian Doll emphasises the need to be there for ourselves and for others, and to be present in the moment. Like addiction, one of the inspirations for the show, Russian Doll presents a cycle with no clear end or beginning, which is often terrifying, and requires human connection to confront. The parallels with Lyonne\u2019s own life made it all the more poignant; once tipped for major stardom, her life was derailed by heroin addiction and a string of related health issues. She previously told this newspaper: \u201cAt the back of that addiction are feelings that so many of us have, that don\u2019t go away. Isn\u2019t everyone entitled to a moment of existential breakdown in a lifetime?\u201d Here, she plays out that existential breakdown to its logical end \u2013 before pulling it back from the brink. In the end, this quirky, haunting and sometimes hysterical show truly was a lifesaver.",

      "body": "<p>A man (it is almost always a man) strikes a deal for greatness and pays a terrible price for it. The Faust myth teaches us to be careful of what we wish for, that pride comes before a fall, that nothing comes for free. Faustus is bored by the limits of his mortality (and his humanity) and so seeks supernatural aid. Only when the devil comes to claim his due does Faustus realise he has reached too far. He begs forgiveness, but it\u2019s too late \u2013 he\u2019s made his bed and now he must lie in it.</p> <p>The story endures because greed endures, and ambition endures, and we are never short of contemporary figures who believe they can beat the system, or that the rules needn\u2019t apply to them. A modern Faustus might be a tech billionaire, a doctor playing God, or a Boris Johnson-type signing over his soul to a Mephistophelian Dominic Cummings figure \u2013 the only part that may feel like a stretch is that, in most versions, Faustus gets his comeuppance.</p> <p>However, there is one element of the story that I often find unsatisfying. Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus has moments of genius but thoroughly derails itself in the middle, primarily because Faustus doesn\u2019t really do anything of note with his powers. He is granted near unlimited gifts and he squanders them pulling pranks and playing tricks. I think this is partially because Marlowe\u2019s Faustus never has a real need for the devil. He is already a successful medical doctor whose bills are \u201chung up as monuments, whereby whole cities have escaped the plague\u201d. He\u2019s on top as it is. Now, the story of a man who has everything and yet still yearns for more is not uninteresting, but I think it misses a trick.</p> <p>In my new play, my Faustus is a young woman in 17th-century London, the daughter of a plague doctor father and a herbalist mother who was tried and killed as a witch when Faustus was a girl. She\u2019s grown up with a mistrust of organised religion and a fascination with the occult, and exists on the fringes of society. She has no wealth and little agency. By the time she meets Lucifer she knows the risks but sees his offer as the least bad option available to her. As she tells him:</p> <blockquote> <p>Why then how could this fate be any worse<br>Than to be bound to any common man?<br>Oh, if you knew the lives we women lead<br>You\u2019d understand the Devil is a catch.</p> </blockquote> <p>Faustus sells her soul in order to control her destiny, and to ensure what happened to her mother cannot happen to her (or any other woman). The deal she strikes is similar, but her road to damnation is driven by a very different set of circumstances. Faustus\u2019s sex (and social class) doesn\u2019t just affect her motivations; it also affects how she\u2019s treated and what she\u2019s able to do with the gifts she\u2019s given. Through this, the play becomes a study of how we treat women who pursue greatness, and how traits that seem admirable in men here might warrant damnation. I wanted to create an epic, ambitious, gothic, baroque fever dream of a piece that took a well-known classic and inverted it to say something truthful about the contemporary female experience.</p> <p>About five years ago, I decided to stop writing male protagonists for a while. This isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule (and one I broke when making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/30/pericles-review-national-theatre-public-acts-scheme\">Pericles</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/30/pericles-review-national-theatre-public-acts-scheme\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/30/pericles-review-national-theatre-public-acts-scheme\">for the National Theatre</a> last year, although we did explore what a female Pericles might have looked like), but it\u2019s something I intend to stick with for a little while longer.

      "bodyText": "A man (it is almost always a man) strikes a deal for greatness and pays a terrible price for it. The Faust myth teaches us to be careful of what we wish for, that pride comes before a fall, that nothing comes for free. Faustus is bored by the limits of his mortality (and his humanity) and so seeks supernatural aid. Only when the devil comes to claim his due does Faustus realise he has reached too far. He begs forgiveness, but it\u2019s too late \u2013 he\u2019s made his bed and now he must lie in it. The story endures because greed endures, and ambition endures, and we are never short of contemporary figures who believe they can beat the system, or that the rules needn\u2019t apply to them. A modern Faustus might be a tech billionaire, a doctor playing God, or a Boris Johnson-type signing over his soul to a Mephistophelian Dominic Cummings figure \u2013 the only part that may feel like a stretch is that, in most versions, Faustus gets his comeuppance. However, there is one element of the story that I often find unsatisfying. Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus has moments of genius but thoroughly derails itself in the middle, primarily because Faustus doesn\u2019t really do anything of note with his powers. He is granted near unlimited gifts and he squanders them pulling pranks and playing tricks. I think this is partially because Marlowe\u2019s Faustus never has a real need for the devil. He is already a successful medical doctor whose bills are \u201chung up as monuments, whereby whole cities have escaped the plague\u201d. He\u2019s on top as it is. Now, the story of a man who has everything and yet still yearns for more is not uninteresting, but I think it misses a trick. In my new play, my Faustus is a young woman in 17th-century London, the daughter of a plague doctor father and a herbalist mother who was tried and killed as a witch when Faustus was a girl. She\u2019s grown up with a mistrust of organised religion and a fascination with the occult, and exists on the fringes of society. She has no wealth and little agency. By the time she meets Lucifer she knows the risks but sees his offer as the least bad option available to her. As she tells him: Why then how could this fate be any worse Than to be bound to any common man? Oh, if you knew the lives we women lead You\u2019d understand the Devil is a catch. Faustus sells her soul in order to control her destiny, and to ensure what happened to her mother cannot happen to her (or any other woman). The deal she strikes is similar, but her road to damnation is driven by a very different set of circumstances. Faustus\u2019s sex (and social class) doesn\u2019t just affect her motivations; it also affects how she\u2019s treated and what she\u2019s able to do with the gifts she\u2019s given. Through this, the play becomes a study of how we treat women who pursue greatness, and how traits that seem admirable in men here might warrant damnation. I wanted to create an epic, ambitious, gothic, baroque fever dream of a piece that took a well-known classic and inverted it to say something truthful about the contemporary female experience. About five years ago, I decided to stop writing male protagonists for a while. This isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule (and one I broke when making Pericles for the National Theatre last year, although we did explore what a female Pericles might have looked like), but it\u2019s something I intend to stick with for a little while longer. This wasn\u2019t intended as a huge political gesture, but it\u2019s one tiny thing I can do to try to redress the gender imbalance that exists across our stages. The western canon is dominated by male leads, and our industry is stuffed with incredible women who shouldn\u2019t be relegated to always playing someone\u2019s wife or mother. Quite aside from that, it makes my work more interesting, especially when reimagining existing stories. Inserting a woman into a traditionally male narrative complicates things.

When TV footage emerged capturing Field\u2019s ferocious look as he propelled Barker roughly towards the exit, it unleashed a formidable backlash.</p> <p>The image of male physical dominance over a slightly built female, attired in an elegant red evening gown and wearing a climate emergency sash, triggered anger, disbelief and the immediate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/mark-field-suspended-as-minister-after-grabbing-climate-protester-by-neck\" title=\"\">suspension of Field</a> as a foreign office minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.</p> <p>Field\u2019s reputation was certainly not enhanced when Barker, with red marks still visible on her upper arm, told the Guardian the following day that the parliamentarian had shoved her into the street with the words: \u201cThis is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Six months on, Barker, 40, says that although she was \u201csurprised and shocked \u201d by the incident at the time, it really hit her afterwards when she saw the footage. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. When you are in that position, you don\u2019t really realise what is happening. When I watched it afterwards, I was shocked; more shocked in a sense than when it happened.</p> <p>\u201cYou see it from a different perspective, the perspective everyone else viewed it from. So I was quite taken aback afterwards when I viewed it and I could then kind of understand why it got so much attention.\u201d</p> <p>Barker\u2019s action at the banquet was designed to draw attention to the climate emergency; what it led to was a debate on male aggression, entitlement and privilege.</p> <p>As a longstanding activist, Barker had been one of a group of 20 to 30 Greenpeace members carrying out peaceful protest at the black-tie City event.

      "bodyText": "When the Conservative MP Mark Field leapt from his chair, pushed a female Greenpeace protester against a pillar, gripped the back of her neck and then manhandled her out of a Mansion House banquet in June, he probably did not anticipate the headlines. Janet Barker, the climate emergency activist, was not alone in being stunned at his hot-headed actions. When TV footage emerged capturing Field\u2019s ferocious look as he propelled Barker roughly towards the exit, it unleashed a formidable backlash. The image of male physical dominance over a slightly built female, attired in an elegant red evening gown and wearing a climate emergency sash, triggered anger, disbelief and the immediate suspension of Field as a foreign office minister in Theresa May\u2019s government. Field\u2019s reputation was certainly not enhanced when Barker, with red marks still visible on her upper arm, told the Guardian the following day that the parliamentarian had shoved her into the street with the words: \u201cThis is what happens when people like you disturb our dinner.\u201d Six months on, Barker, 40, says that although she was \u201csurprised and shocked \u201d by the incident at the time, it really hit her afterwards when she saw the footage. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. When you are in that position, you don\u2019t really realise what is happening. When I watched it afterwards, I was shocked; more shocked in a sense than when it happened. \u201cYou see it from a different perspective, the perspective everyone else viewed it from. So I was quite taken aback afterwards when I viewed it and I could then kind of understand why it got so much attention.\u201d Barker\u2019s action at the banquet was designed to draw attention to the climate emergency; what it led to was a debate on male aggression, entitlement and privilege. As a longstanding activist, Barker had been one of a group of 20 to 30 Greenpeace members carrying out peaceful protest at the black-tie City event. Their aim was to deliver a copy of a speech, in a sealed letter, to the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, who was sitting at the top table, about government investment in fossil fuels. Field later apologised for \u201cgrabbing her\u201d, claiming he had reacted \u201cinstinctively\u201d, fearing she might be armed. He referred himself to the Cabinet Office for investigation. \u201cThe only thing I was armed with was peer-reviewed science,\u201d Barker, who was carrying a phone, a small handbag and some leaflets, said later. She suggested Field might like to avail himself of some help for anger management. Declining to make an official police complaint, she thought it \u201csomething best dealt with in the court of public opinion\u201d, and a Cabinet Office investigation was enough for her. Except that there has been no official investigation into Field\u2019s actions. Nor will there be. When Boris Johnson became prime minister, one of his first actions was to drop Field from his ministerial role as part of a reshuffle, and drop any Cabinet Office investigation into the behaviour of the then MP for Cities of London and Westminster. It was, said Johnson, a matter for the previous prime minister. Barker, who is from a village in mid-Wales, where she works in environmental education and homelessness prevention, says: \u201cIt was a bit of an eye-rolling moment for me. I just thought: \u2018Oh God.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t surprised, let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d Field is not contesting his seat in this election. City of London police received a number of third-party reports that an offence of assault had occurred that night. After \u201ccareful assessment\u201d, it later announced no further action would be taken against Field. When the Cabinet Office inquiry was dropped, Field said he was \u201chugely relieved\u201d that the matter was now considered closed and pointed to the police exonerating his actions \u201cas proportionate and lawful in the circumstances of the serious breach in security\u201d. Barker still stands by her decision not to make a formal police complaint, fearing the climate crisis argument would be lost in any subsequent legal fray. \u201cHe has now resigned.

      "bodyText": "The health secretary Matt Hancock has repeatedly failed to respond to concerns that his local hospital is bullying and intimidating senior doctors to prevent them raising serious issues of patient safety, the Guardian can reveal. Doctors at West Suffolk hospital have complained of harassment after trust bosses demanded they give fingerprints as part of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d to identify staff members who blew the whistle on potentially botched surgery. The family of Susan Warby, who died five weeks after an operation in August 2018, was sent an anonymous letter highlighting errors in her procedure. After conducting a serious incident investigation into her treatment, the trust threatened senior medics with possible disciplinary action if they failed to give their fingerprints and samples of their handwriting. The trust insisted this request was not threatening but a note to staff warned that refusal to consent \u201ccould be considered as evidence which implicates you in writing the letter\u201d. Consultants at the hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, are so angry at the threats and what one called a \u201cculture of bullying from the top down\u201d that they have written to the trust\u2019s chairwoman raising \u201cgrave concerns\u201d. They accused the management team of denying staff the freedom to speak about their concerns over care, which has been an enshrined right for NHS staff since the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Details of the treatment of staff have been passed to Hancock. However, he has rebuffed on three occasions attempts to discuss the deep-seated problems at the trust with those who have raised concerns, including a senior clinician who was asked for fingerprints. His refusal to engage threatens to undermine his claims to be a champion of NHS whistleblowers. Earlier this year he tweeted his determination \u201cto end the injustice of making NHS staff choose between the job they love &amp; speaking [to] the trust to keep patients safe\u201d. The hospital\u2019s hunt for the whistleblower also raised questions about the trust\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Dunn, who was given a CBE for \u201cservices to health and patient safety\u201d last year. The trust\u2019s medical director, Dr Nick Jenkins, accused the anonymous letter-writer of trying to \u201cweaponise a patient\u201d during a staff medical committee meeting in October. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which campaigns to improve doctors\u2019 working conditions, said: \u201cThese are utterly extraordinary and unprecedented behaviours from an NHS trust that fly in the face of everything learned from Mid Staffs. Threats, secrecy and a toxic culture towards dedicated NHS staff where whistleblowers are persecuted serve only to move us further away from a just culture and threaten patient safety.\u201d Dan Sharpstone, a consultant gastroenterologist at the hospital who is also Suffolk\u2019s assistant coroner, suggested to the staff medical meeting that the letter-writer could have approached the family because the hospital\u2019s procedures \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d, and he was worried that \u201cevery whistleblower will now be treated like this\u201d.

Four months after Warby\u2019s death, Dunn was awarded his CBE, prompting congratulations from Hancock. An inquest into Warby\u2019s death will be held next month. Warby\u2019s family is planning to sue the trust for medical negligence after she was operated on for a burst bowel five weeks before her death. Her husband, Jon Warby, said: \u201cI have instigated a claim for medical malpractice. I am not happy how things were done, but the rest will have to wait until after the inquest.\u201d Her father-in-law, Frank Warby, said: \u201cMy son got a letter from somebody anonymous saying there was a whole catalogue of errors.\u201d A West Suffolk NHS foundation trust spokeswoman said: \u201cAny allegations of bullying are taken extremely seriously and are thoroughly and urgently investigated, which is one of the reasons why we are among the top five NHS trusts in the country for having engaged, happy, and empowered staff.\u201d \u201cIn this case we shared our serious incident investigation process with the CQC [Care Quality Commission], and the NHS national head of whistleblowing, who backed our approach.\u201d Hancock\u2019s office insisted he had taken up his constituent\u2019s concerns with the hospital, but did not explain why he had failed to address the doctor\u2019s concern.

Yanking the anti-immigration lever is a sure sign of impatience with an electorate that has proved less responsive to the prime minister\u2019s charm than Tory strategists hoped. That alleged charm is a veneer that cracks and flakes in the sustained heat of a campaign, exposing a coarse grain of nastiness underneath. It was visible this week to all who saw Johnson on TV holding his gaze stubbornly aloft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\" title=\"\">to avoid looking at a photograph</a> of a sick child asleep on a hospital floor.</p> <p>Many Tories know well enough that the main requirement for liking Johnson is ignorance of his true character. The more he is exposed, the wider grows the gap between mask and man. His amiable act works in short bursts in front of receptive audiences. Too long in the limelight and he struggles to stay in role. Not only does he lack decency and compassion, but he cannot even fake them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34eef7be5156746c9e8dd4a0bc90a696236f1656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34eef7be5156746c9e8dd4a0bc90a696236f1656/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson during an interview with ITV, in which he refused to look at a photograph of a sick boy on a hospital floor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson during an interview with ITV, in which he refused to look at a photograph of a sick boy on a hospital floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At this point in the argument, it should be easy to prescribe Labour as the antidote to the venom that Johnson injects into the body politic: the cloying mix of xenophobia, deceit, entitlement and faux bonhomie. But many of the hearts that sink at the prospect of a Tory triumph on Thursday cannot quicken with joy at the thought of Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister instead. Mine is one of those hearts. It will not beat in time with the Labour campaign in much the same way that it will not be reconciled to Brexit. There is the same chilling feeling of a border that was not there a few years ago, cutting across the intimate terrain of identity. It is the line, drawn by Corbyn, which many Jews feel they cannot cross.</p> <p>Plenty of Labour supporters (and non-aligned remainers) are weary of this topic. I have seen eyes roll because it is unhelpful to point out the awkward facts about the only anti-Tory candidate for prime minister: that Corbyn has been a comrade to antisemites, Holocaust deniers and people who celebrate violence against Jews; that the claim to oppose all forms of racism rings hollow from a man who saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural\" title=\"\">nothing offensive in a mural </a>depicting caricatured Jews playing Monopoly on the backs of bowed bodies. This is the man who once dismissed \u201cZionists\u201d for failure to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2018/aug/24/jeremy-corbyns-2013-remarks-on-some-zionists-not-understanding-english-irony-video\" title=\"\">understand English irony</a>\u201d: despite \u201chaving lived in this country a long time, probably all their lives\u201d. Corbyn was the magnet to Labour for Jew-hating cranks and conspiracy theorists who bullied two Jewish MPs out of the party. His peevish, reluctant apology contains no trace of understanding or real contrition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/once-lifetime-election-dirty-democracy\">Everyone says this is a once-in-a-lifetime election.

Outrage does not have to be rationed for one side or the other. Reluctance to see Corbyn in No 10 does not use up a portion of horror that could otherwise be spent on Tories. Both sentiments can coexist. But the intensity of my desire to see Johnson beaten can also fuel my anger that Labour demands support for Corbyn as the means to do it.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s nationalist train, driven by locomotive mendacity, can be derailed only by a barricade of opposition MPs. There are feasible configurations of a hung parliament with a sufficient number of Liberal Democrats and independents to make a change of leader the condition of buttressing a Labour-led administration. It is just about possible, for one day more at least, to imagine a Britain that is spared the lunacy of Brexit, and a Labour party no longer in thrall to Corbyn. But the combination defies electoral probability. Those of us who wish for it must be reconciled to a darker prospect. We live with the undertow of sadness and dread. We are braced for that feeling, like seeing callous hands rummaging in a private drawer where a delicate, tangled identity is stored and pulling at the threads. It feels like exile.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Yanking the anti-immigration lever is a sure sign of impatience with an electorate that has proved less responsive to the prime minister\u2019s charm than Tory strategists hoped. That alleged charm is a veneer that cracks and flakes in the sustained heat of a campaign, exposing a coarse grain of nastiness underneath. It was visible this week to all who saw Johnson on TV holding his gaze stubbornly aloft to avoid looking at a photograph of a sick child asleep on a hospital floor. Many Tories know well enough that the main requirement for liking Johnson is ignorance of his true character. The more he is exposed, the wider grows the gap between mask and man. His amiable act works in short bursts in front of receptive audiences. Too long in the limelight and he struggles to stay in role. Not only does he lack decency and compassion, but he cannot even fake them. At this point in the argument, it should be easy to prescribe Labour as the antidote to the venom that Johnson injects into the body politic: the cloying mix of xenophobia, deceit, entitlement and faux bonhomie. But many of the hearts that sink at the prospect of a Tory triumph on Thursday cannot quicken with joy at the thought of Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister instead. Mine is one of those hearts. It will not beat in time with the Labour campaign in much the same way that it will not be reconciled to Brexit. There is the same chilling feeling of a border that was not there a few years ago, cutting across the intimate terrain of identity. It is the line, drawn by Corbyn, which many Jews feel they cannot cross. Plenty of Labour supporters (and non-aligned remainers) are weary of this topic. I have seen eyes roll because it is unhelpful to point out the awkward facts about the only anti-Tory candidate for prime minister: that Corbyn has been a comrade to antisemites, Holocaust deniers and people who celebrate violence against Jews; that the claim to oppose all forms of racism rings hollow from a man who saw nothing offensive in a mural depicting caricatured Jews playing Monopoly on the backs of bowed bodies. This is the man who once dismissed \u201cZionists\u201d for failure to \u201cunderstand English irony\u201d: despite \u201chaving lived in this country a long time, probably all their lives\u201d. Corbyn was the magnet to Labour for Jew-hating cranks and conspiracy theorists who bullied two Jewish MPs out of the party. His peevish, reluctant apology contains no trace of understanding or real contrition. None of that diminishes Johnson\u2019s prolific record of racially aggravated offences. Outrage does not have to be rationed for one side or the other. Reluctance to see Corbyn in No 10 does not use up a portion of horror that could otherwise be spent on Tories. Both sentiments can coexist. But the intensity of my desire to see Johnson beaten can also fuel my anger that Labour demands support for Corbyn as the means to do it. Johnson\u2019s nationalist train, driven by locomotive mendacity, can be derailed only by a barricade of opposition MPs. There are feasible configurations of a hung parliament with a sufficient number of Liberal Democrats and independents to make a change of leader the condition of buttressing a Labour-led administration. It is just about possible, for one day more at least, to imagine a Britain that is spared the lunacy of Brexit, and a Labour party no longer in thrall to Corbyn. But the combination defies electoral probability. Those of us who wish for it must be reconciled to a darker prospect. We live with the undertow of sadness and dread. We are braced for that feeling, like seeing callous hands rummaging in a private drawer where a delicate, tangled identity is stored and pulling at the threads. It feels like exile. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

Labour has made fresh calls for the Tories to suspend their candidate in the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye, who was also publicly condemned last week for implying that disabled people should be paid less than the minimum wage because they do not understand money. The latest allegations relate to a post that Hart shared on her Facebook wall in 2017, in which she described a blog by anti-Islam activist and author Cheri Berens as an \u201caffecting read\u201d. In the blog, Berens claimed the Women\u2019s March against Trump in the US had been used to promote the \u201cMuslim agenda\u201d in the US and that the Muslim Brotherhood had hijacked the movement. She claimed this was because they want American women to have abortions to limit the non-Muslim population, adding that American women should not wear the headscarf and wherever it is worn in the world there is oppression.

      "bodyText": "On 10 December, Scott Morrison and the attorney general, Christian Porter, released the second draft religious discrimination bill. The new bill is designed to respond to a revolt from conservative religious organisations that forced the Coalition to miss its self-imposed deadline to introduce the bill to parliament by year\u2019s end. What is the original bill about? The religious discrimination bill prohibits discrimination in certain areas of public life on the ground of religious belief or activity. The bill prohibits both direct discrimination, treating another person less favourably based on religion, and indirect discrimination, where an apparently neutral condition has the effect of disadvantaging people based on religion. What\u2019s changed? The second draft bill includes provisions allowing religious hospitals, aged care facilities and accommodation providers such as retirement homes to discriminate against staff on the basis of religion in order to preserve the \u201creligious ethos\u201d of that institution. It will ensure that the exemption that applies to religious bodies extends to \u201cpublic benevolent institutions\u201d, allowing them to discriminate on the grounds of religion also. The new bill creates a new right for religious camps and conference centres to discriminate \u2013 including against their prospective customers \u2013 provided they publish a policy explaining their ethos and rules. Religious institutions would be protected from discrimination claims when they take actions \u201cto avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherence of their faith\u201d. The bill also contains a protection for \u201cassociates of religious individuals\u201d to protect people from discrimination based on the religion of their friends or relatives, such as discrimination against a woman because she married a Muslim man. The Coalition has proposed adding an objects clause to all federal discrimination laws that \u201call human rights have equal status under international law\u201d, a change that LGBTI advocates have warned is designed to undermine the right to non-discrimination. A requirement that a religious practice must comply with Australian laws to be protected will now only apply to commonwealth, state and territory laws \u2013 not council laws. How will religious speech of employees be regulated? By banning indirect discrimination, the original bill sought to prevent employers setting policies such as social media codes of conduct that stop employees\u2019 expressing their religious views. Dubbed the Israel Folau clause, the provision set a particularly high bar for large businesses with a turnover of more than $50m, which would have to show that they would suffer \u201cunjustifiable financial hardship\u201d without the rule to escape the ban. The second bill narrows the provision slightly, so that employers are prohibited from setting a rule that indirectly discriminates on religion only where the rule is \u201cother than in the course of the employee\u2019s employment\u201d. Porter said the change was meant to prohibit rules regulating what employees said in their \u201cspare time\u201d but allow employers to continue to regulate activities connected to work, such as office Christmas parties. The new bill will also impose a further restriction on qualifying bodies \u2013 such as those that admit doctors and lawyers to practise \u2013 stipulating they cannot impose rules such as social media codes of conduct restricting statements of belief unless they are an \u201cessential requirement\u201d of the profession. Can medical practitioners refuse to treat me? The original bill said that \u2013 unless it is against the law to refuse treatment \u2013 health practitioners are allowed to \u201cconscientiously object to providing a health service\u201d and no professional rules can override that right. The new bill specifies that this does not give a right to medical practitioners to discriminate against individuals based on gender or other characteristics. Nevertheless, doctors, pharmacists and other limited categories of medical practitioners could refuse to perform certain procedures or dispense certain drugs \u2013 such as abortion or the morning after pill \u2013 provided they refused to do so for all patients. The new bill narrows the range of medical practitioners who can object to procedures to nurses, midwives, doctors, psychologists and pharmacists, removing dentists, occupational therapists, optometrists, physiotherapists and podiatrists. Does the bill water down existing protections in discrimination law? Yes. The bill declares that a statement of religious belief does not constitute discrimination under commonwealth, state or territory anti-discrimination law and does not contravene subsection 17(1) of the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act 1998. That law bans speech that \u201coffends, insults or humiliates\u201d people based on a range of grounds including gender, race, age, sexual orientation, disability and relationship status. To the extent of inconsistency the federal law applies, so the new bill would provide greater protection to speech like: that gay people are going to hell, that disabled people are possessed, that pregnant unmarried women are sinners. The Law Council has also noted that the religious discrimination bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t carry the same type of protection as section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act\u201d \u2013 which prohibits language that \u201coffends, insults, or humiliates\u201d a person based on race. However, the religious discrimination bill does not protect statements that are \u201cmalicious, would harass, vilify or incite hatred or violence against a person or group or which advocate for the commission of a serious criminal offence\u201d. The new bill makes a few changes to this basic architecture by defining \u201cvilify\u201d as meaning to \u201cto incite hatred or violence\u201d and evening out the standards for religious and non-religious speech. Under the new bill, non-religious people are protected when they express a view that \u201ca person who does not hold a religious belief could reasonably consider to relate to the fact of not holding a religious belief\u201d. Has the new bill addressed stakeholders\u2019 concerns? While religious organisations have welcomed the changes, here is a non-exhaustive list of other concerns raised in consultation that were not addressed: The bill takes the \u201cunprecedented step\u201d of giving religious bodies standing to sue for discrimination (raised by the Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities) The bill will prevent state tribunals from having jurisdiction to decide matters where religious belief is used as a defence because tribunals cannot decide a federal question of law (The Australian Council of Human Rights Authorities, and the Australian Human Rights Commission) The bill will \u201csustain nastiness and hostility that [Australia] can well do without\u201d (former high court justice Michael Kirby) The bill does not define religion, meaning that Indigenous spirituality could be excluded by the common law definition while \u201cesoteric or emerging religions\u201d are protected (the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry) Beliefs regarded as stemming from religion will have higher protection than political beliefs which do not stem from belief or lack of belief, such as support for gay marriage (discrimination law academics\u2019 joint submission) The bill impairs employers\u2019 efforts to implement diversity and inclusion policies by prohibiting offensive speech (the Diversity Council of Australia)",

      "bodyText": "The autonomous region of Bougainville has voted overwhelmingly in favour of becoming independent from Papua New Guinea, paving the way for the group of islands to become the world\u2019s newest nation. More than 180,000 people in Bougainville, a collection of islands flung 700km off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Solomon Sea, participated in a referendum over the last few weeks that has been nearly 20 years in the making. Almost 98% of people (176,928 people) voted for independence and less than 2% (3,043 people) voted to remain as part of Papua New Guinea but with \u201cgreater autonomy\u201d. There were 1,096 informal ballots. Those gathered in Buka to hear the announcement of the results from the chair of the Bougainville Referendum Commission\u2019s chair Bertie Ahern burst into cheers and applause when the result was announced. As the writs were signed by commissioners after the result, the crowd burst into song. In 2001, the government of Papua New Guinea promised the vote as part of a peace agreement to end a devastating decade-long civil war that saw an estimated 20,000 people, out of a population at the time of 200,000, killed. The vote took place amid a mood of great celebration, with people in the main township of Buka singing, dancing, cheering and playing pan flutes as they followed the region\u2019s president John Momis to the polling booth to watch him cast the first vote in the referendum on 23 November. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the people are now in the mood for celebration and I join them as they have every right to celebrate,\u201d said Momis, emerging from the polling booth with arms raised. However, Bougainville will not become a new nation overnight, as the referendum result is non-binding, the leadership of PNG and Bougainville will have to negotiate, with the final say as to whether Bougainville will be allowed to break away from the rest of the country resting with the PNG parliament. Speaking at the announcement of the result in Buka, Sir Puka Temu, PNG\u2019s minister for Bougainville, said the result was a \u201ccreditable one\u201d but reminded the crowd that the referendum was non-binding and that the national parliament of PNG \u201chad the final authority\u201d over the result. Temu said PNG\u2019s prime minister, James Marape, would make a statement in the coming days about the way forward, adding: \u201cI will not present the result of the referendum to the parliament until after the consultation has been concluded.\u201d \u201cFor the rest of PNG, this is a big big result, this is a transformational political announcement and therefore please allow PNG sufficient time to absorb this result.\u201d There are fears that the PNG government, which does not wish to lose part of its nation, or set a precedent for other independence-minded provinces, might drag out the consultations process, with some Bougainville observers estimate it could be a decade before an independent Bougainville is established. There are concerns that any delays in this process could cause frustration in Bougainville and eventually lead to unrest, threatening the hard-won peace on the islands. However, the president of the Autonomous Bougainville Government, John Momis, told the crowd he believed Marape was committed to Bougainville, saying of the prime minister: \u201cHe is intelligent, he is educated and he is humble, he is prepared to listen.\u201d \u201cWe are all full of expectations and hope,\u201d said Momis. \u201cIf we work together the outcome will be good and official\u2026 and most importantly and produce lasting peace.\u201d",

In fact, economics textbooks suggest that when it comes to a big problem like climate change, <a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/production-gap-report-2019\">we should cut with both arms of the scissors</a>.</p> <p>The good news is if we are willing to take a new look at old arguments, we can develop win-win solutions to problems that can sometimes seem unresolvable.</p> <p>As Albanese has said, it\u2019s important to differentiate between thermal and coking coal. That\u2019s true, and when we do, we can see that none of the new mines such as Adani being proposed in the Galilee Basin produce coking coal. But if we go further down the road of arguing that not all coalmines are created equally, we can find even more common ground.</p> <p>If, for example, we distinguish between <em>existing</em> coalmines and <em>proposed</em> coalmines, we can develop policies which effectively \u201cgrandfather\u201d our treatment of the mines we already have while imposing much tougher rules on proposed new ones.</p> <p>The opposition leader is right to say it would be economically reckless to close down all <em>existing</em> coalmines overnight. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it is economically or environmentally responsible to open up <em>new</em> coalmines in regions that have never mined a tonne of coal.</p> <p>Once we separate calls to stop opening new coalmines from calls to shut all coalmines down tomorrow, a range of economic and political possibilities present themselves \u2013 the most important of which is that by preventing any increase in the supply of coal from new coalmines, we can actually keep the price of coal higher, keep the existing mines operating for a bit longer, and in turn, keep the existing coal workers in existing coal regions working longer. Put simply, new coalmines in far north Queensland don\u2019t help existing coal communities, they hurt them.</p> <p>The Morrison government often tells us that if we frack more gas, the price will fall and if we build more coal-fired power stations electricity prices will fall, but they don\u2019t talk much about what would happen if Australia opened up the Galilee Basin and doubled our coal exports. That\u2019s because the answer is that it would push the world price of coal down and the world\u2019s consumption of cheaper coal up.</p> <p>Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal. When it comes to exportable coal, Australia has a bigger share of the traded coal market than Saudi Arabia has of the world oil market. Our supply decisions matter. A lot.</p> <p>Back in 2011, Queensland suffered from catastrophic flooding, and the floods disrupted Queensland\u2019s coal export facilities. The world price of coal shot up for the same reason that the world price of oil shot up when terrorists attacked Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil refinery this year. Supply decisions affect price.</p> <p>Flooding the world coal market with an extra 200 million tonnes of Galilee Basin coal will push the price of coal down, down, down, along with production and employment at other Australian coalmines.</p> <p>But don\u2019t take my word for it. <a href=\"http://envlaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/carmichael43A.pdf\">Adani\u2019s own evidence</a> to the Queensland land court showed employment in other Australian mines would contract. The Port of Newcastle has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-06/galilee-basin-mining-project-will-reduce-coal-output:-research/8682164\">argued publicly</a> that new coalmines in Queensland will lead to coal job losses in the Hunter. Even Joel Fitzgibbon was quoted saying that the economic warnings about the impact of the proposed new mines in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin on the Hunter coal industry were <a href=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/4626993/adani-threatens-hunter-jobs/\">\u201cabsolutely correct\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Again, once we distinguish between the economic impacts of opening new mines from the economic impacts of shutting existing ones, the political landscape looks quite different. Similarly, once we understand that supply and demand interact, the policy case for focusing on both fossil fuel supply and fossil fuel demand makes a lot more sense.</p> <p>But rather than plan a gradual transition out of coal by allowing existing mines to wind down on schedule over the coming decades, the New South Wales, Queensland and federal governments are offering a wide range of subsidies to build new ones. Subsidising new coalmines is a poor way to fund our schools and hospitals and it\u2019s an even worse way to help existing coal communities. As Queensland\u2019s Treasury <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/wise-investment-or-fossil-fools-queensland-backs-coal-as-g20-moves-the-game-on-20141117-11odkq.html\">has said,</a> \u201cspending on mining related infrastructure means less infrastructure spending in other areas, including social infrastructure such as hospitals and schools\u201d.</p> <p>It gets worse. The NSW government\u2019s policy for setting coal royalties states: \u201cRoyalty rates are set to encourage present and future exploration and development of mineral resources.\u201d And so keen to open new coalmines is the Queensland government that they a have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/adani-coalmine-queensland-warned-not-to-sign-royalty-deal-until-rail-line-agreed\">offered a \u201croyalty holiday</a>\u201d for the coal itself which would amount to an enormously expensive \u201cdig now pay later\u201d scheme. Of course, that assumes that Adani will be around in the future to pay later. But the consequence of this interstate \u201ccompetition\u201d to attract new coalmines is that Australian taxpayers, and the world\u2019s climate, pays a high price.</p> <p>But with absurdity comes opportunity. Imagine if Australia had a national plan to manage the decline in coal, a decline that even the coal industry accepts will come \u201cin the decades to come\u201d. Imagine if instead of subsidising new mines to come and compete with existing coalmines, we tried to protect existing coal communities and the environment at the same time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/25/global-use-of-coal-fired-electricity-set-for-biggest-fall-this-year\">Global use of coal-fired electricity set for biggest fall this year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If such a plan was based on economics, not spin, it could be simple and cheap:</p> <p><strong>Step 1 \u2013</strong> Stop building new coalmines \u2013 you can\u2019t transition out of coal while you are still building new coalmines.</p> <p><strong>Step 2 \u2013 </strong>Admit the obvious: new coalmines push down prices and threaten jobs in existing coalmines.</p> <p><strong>Step 3 \u2013</strong> Keep existing mines open for longer by preventing new ones from opening. That\u2019s the fairest way to help existing coalminers in existing mines and an easy way to help the climate.</p> <p><strong>Step 4 \u2013 </strong>Increase the very low coal royalties and raise a lot more revenue from existing mines (for context, Saudi Arabia <a href=\"http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/Saudi-Arabia-Corporate-Taxes-on-corporate-income\">has a tax rate on oil companies of 85%</a> \u2013 and no lack of foreign oil companies).</p> <p><strong>Step 5 \u2013</strong> Fund regional development from the increase in revenue that will accompany higher royalty and company tax revenues. We just need NSW, Queensland and the commonwealth cooperating to help existing communities instead of competing to help foreign coal companies establish new ones.</p> <p><strong>Step 6 \u2013 </strong>Ban robot trucks and robot trains. What\u2019s the point of causing climate change from mines that don\u2019t even employ anyone in regional areas?</p> <p>With faith in politics at record lows, temperatures, pollution and bushfire damage at record highs, it\u2019s a brave politician who hopes that the issue of coal exports will fade away like the Sydney Opera House behind its new shroud of smoke.</p> <p>Sure, it\u2019s hard to imagine states cooperating with each other for the benefit of their citizens, but now more than ever Australia needs some blue sky thinking.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute</p>",

Imagine if Australia had a national plan to manage the decline in coal, a decline that even the coal industry accepts will come \u201cin the decades to come\u201d. Imagine if instead of subsidising new mines to come and compete with existing coalmines, we tried to protect existing coal communities and the environment at the same time. If such a plan was based on economics, not spin, it could be simple and cheap: Step 1 \u2013 Stop building new coalmines \u2013 you can\u2019t transition out of coal while you are still building new coalmines. Step 2 \u2013 Admit the obvious: new coalmines push down prices and threaten jobs in existing coalmines. Step 3 \u2013 Keep existing mines open for longer by preventing new ones from opening. That\u2019s the fairest way to help existing coalminers in existing mines and an easy way to help the climate. Step 4 \u2013 Increase the very low coal royalties and raise a lot more revenue from existing mines (for context, Saudi Arabia has a tax rate on oil companies of 85% \u2013 and no lack of foreign oil companies). Step 5 \u2013 Fund regional development from the increase in revenue that will accompany higher royalty and company tax revenues. We just need NSW, Queensland and the commonwealth cooperating to help existing communities instead of competing to help foreign coal companies establish new ones. Step 6 \u2013 Ban robot trucks and robot trains. What\u2019s the point of causing climate change from mines that don\u2019t even employ anyone in regional areas? With faith in politics at record lows, temperatures, pollution and bushfire damage at record highs, it\u2019s a brave politician who hopes that the issue of coal exports will fade away like the Sydney Opera House behind its new shroud of smoke. Sure, it\u2019s hard to imagine states cooperating with each other for the benefit of their citizens, but now more than ever Australia needs some blue sky thinking. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

First reported by the New York Times, the policy would broaden the federal definition of antisemitism, according to administration officials who spoke to various news outlets on condition of anonymity. By expanding protections granted by title VI of the Civil Rights Act to people subjected to antisemitism, the order could also redefine Judaism as a race or nationality. Title VI bars discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin at colleges and universities that receive federal funding. One official said Trump\u2019s order would make it clear that title VI will apply to antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. That definition says antisemitism may include \u201ctargeting of the state of Israel\u201d. The move has drawn criticism from those who worry that such a characterization of Judaism as a race or nation is itself antisemitic. Free-speech advocates also have concerns that a broader definition of antisemitism might be used to limit criticism of Israeli government actions. A second official insisted the order was not intended to limit freedom of expression and was not aimed at suppressing the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement known as BDS, which aims to support Palestinian aspirations for statehood by refusing to purchase Israeli products or invest in Israeli companies. The movement is on the rise, sparking tension on many college campuses. The Israeli government has urged allies to rein in the boycott movement, while its backers deny antisemitism charges and describe themselves as critical of Israeli decision-making, not Jewish people. A third official said the order was a response to an alarming rise in the number of antisemitic incidents on campuses and would mean that Jewish students who are discriminated against for their religion have the same kind of recourse as black students who are victimized by racism. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said it recorded 201 antisemitic incidents at colleges and universities in 2018, down from 204 in the previous year. The Republican Jewish Coalition applauded the move, with the group\u2019s chairman, the former senator Norm Coleman, calling it \u201ca truly historic and important moment for Jewish Americans\u201d and hailing Trump as \u201cthe most pro-Jewish president\u201d in the nation\u2019s history. The Trump administration has previously acted to constrain perceived campus antisemitism, last year reopening a case of alleged discrimination against Jewish students at Rutgers University in New Jersey. The ADL and the Academic Engagement Network released model guidelines for faculty in November after two instructors at the University of Michigan declined to write letters of recommendation for students seeking to study abroad in Israel. Trump delivered a speech on Saturday night that featured remarks from a recent New York University graduate who had accused the school of failing to protect its Jewish students from harassment.",

On Wednesday, the government announced its response to the findings of deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame\u2019s inquest into six drug-related deaths of young people at music festivals in the state. Handed down last month, the long-awaited report recommended the government introduce a pill-testing trial, limit the use of strip-searches at music festivals to cases of suspected drug supply and stop the use of sniffer dogs. But the government has ignored the majority of the recommendations from the inquest, instead saying it would introduce drug amnesty bins at music festivals to allow festival-goers in the state to discard illegal substances \u201cwithout fear of prosecution or penalty\u201d. \u201cWhat we want to do is send a strong message out to young people which is the most important one: do not panic if you see police officers, if you see anything that worries you because you\u2019ve got pills on your person or your friends do, just throw the pill away, no questions asked,\u201d she said. \u201cJust don\u2019t take them because that can kill you or kill one of your friends.\u201d While the government has maintained a steadfast opposition pill testing, the premier\u2019s refusal to adopt the coroner\u2019s recommendation was immediately criticised by advocates and both Labour and the Greens. The emergency doctor David Caldicott, a long-time pill testing advocate who has overseen the only Australian trial of the method in ACT, wrote on Twitter that he found it \u201chard to recall a time when a politician has announced that they are \u2018closing the door\u2019 on any health intervention that has as much expertise behind it\u201d. Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said amnesty bins \u201con their own will not save lives\u201d. \u201cMy fear is that police will use amnesty bins as an excuse to increase their intimidation tactics in the hopes that they can scare kids into throwing away their drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe war on drugs has proven that a focus on getting people to not take drugs doesn\u2019t work.

In her findings, Grahame wrote that she was satisfied there was \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that \u201cintensive and punitive drug policing operations\u201d were increasing \u201cdrug-related risks and harm\u201d and called for a complete overhaul of government policy including the decriminalisation of possession. \u201cI am of the firm view there is sound evidence that high-visibility policing and the use of drug dogs is a harmful intervention,\u201d Grahame said at the time. The \u201cwholesale practice of strip-searching young people\u201d was of \u201cgrave concern\u201d, and its use to target people suspected of drug possession was \u201cout of line with the purposes\u201d of the legislation.

Up to 70,000 women and children are held in al-Hawl, where the Syrian winter has brought freezing temperatures, snow, flooding of the tents where families live, and widespread illness. The birth of the boy brings the number of Australians in the camp to 67, 47 of whom are children under five. As the child of an Australian citizen, the boy is entitled to citizenship, but must apply for it. The UK, US, Denmark and Germany have been repatriating their citizens from al-Hawl and other camps in north-east Syria over recent weeks. But Australia has refused to consider repatriating citizens, saying it would not risk Australian lives to rescue those held there. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has said some of the Australian women in the al-Hawl camp are \u201chardcore\u201d and \u201chave the potential and capacity to come back here and cause a mass casualty event\u201d. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it should come as a surprise when we say we\u2019re not going to send our soldiers to rescue people of this nature.\u201d Sources inside the camps say Kurdish authorities, who still control the area, have established a safe route across the Iraqi border for foreign citizens, but political will from countries such as Australia is lacking.

Turkey agreed to a ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces, after talks with the US and Russia (which backs the Assad regime). But Human Rights Watch argues the zone remains unsafe, with allegations of war crimes being committed by Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups against the Kurdish civilian population. Observers say Kurdish control of the region is tenuous, and is expected to be challenged by larger military forces in coming months: Russian-backed Syrian regime forces to the south and Turkish forces from the north. Turkey this week deported a suspected Australia Isis fighter, Agim Ajazi, who was flown to South Australia where he faced court. The 30-year-old is expected to face extradition to his home state of Queensland, where he will face charges of being an Islamist foreign fighter.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is the worst-performing country on climate change policy, according to a new international ranking of 57 countries. The report also criticises the Morrison government for being a \u201cregressive force\u201d internationally. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, prepared by a group of thinktanks comprising the NewClimate Institute, the Climate Action Network and Germanwatch, looks at national climate action across the categories of emissions, renewable energy, energy use and policy. Across all four categories, Australia was ranked as the sixth-worst performing of the 57 countries assessed. On the assessment of national and international climate policy, Australia is singled out as the worst-performing, with the report saying the re-elected Morrison government \u201chas continued to worsen performance at both national and international levels.\u201d \u201cExperts note that the new government is an increasingly regressive force in negotiations and has been criticised for its lack of ambition by several Pacific Island nations in the context of this year\u2019s Pacific Island Forum,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe dismissal of recent IPCC reports, the government not attending the UN Climate Action Summit in September, and the withdrawal from funding the Green Climate Fund (GCF) underpin the overall very low performance in the climate policy category.\u201d Australia scored the lowest possible rating of 0.0, compared with the highest-scoring country, Portugal, which was ranked best for its climate policy at 97.8%. The report praised Portugal for its ambitious target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and a 55% emissions reduction by 2030. The report says that the Australian government has also failed to clarify how it will meet the country\u2019s 2030 emission reduction target and has failed to develop a long-term mitigation strategy. \u201cWhile the government is not proposing any further targets for renewable energy beyond 2020, it continues to promote the expansion of fossil fuels and in April 2019 approved the opening of the highly controversial Adani coalmine,\u201d the report notes. The damning assessment of Australia\u2019s position comes as the energy minister, Angus Taylor, argues the case at UN climate talks for Australia to use carryover credits to meet its international emissions reduction targets against resistance from 100 other countries. The government is also facing pressure on the domestic front about its inaction on climate change policy, with the NSW Liberal environment minister, Matt Kean, the latest to call for more ambitious emissions reduction targets. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has also urged the government to do more about the national security threat of climate change, which has been thrust into the national spotlight by the early, devastating bushfire season and the prolonged drought. The CCPI report points to the bushfires and Australia\u2019s \u201cdestructive\u201d pre-summer heatwave as an example of a number of extreme weather events that have become increasingly severe in 2019, as it argues the impacts of climate change are already being felt. \u201cThe unfolding impacts of 1\u00b0C of global warming observed in 2019 emphasise the urgency required to act,\u201d the report says. Labor\u2019s shadow energy minister, Mark Butler, said the ranking showed the government\u2019s action on climate change was \u201cpathetic\u201d, and hit out at the Coalition\u2019s push to use carryover credits. \u201cWhen it comes to climate action Australia\u2019s lack of climate policy has become an international embarrassment,\u201d Butler said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cMeanwhile, to avoid real climate action all this government wants to do is use dodgy accounting tricks to cook the books and fake meeting their inadequate Paris agreement targets.\u201d When asked about Australia\u2019s climate change policy in response to the unfolding bushfire crisis, the agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, said it was \u201cmisleading\u201d to link the fires with \u201ccoal-fired power generation right now\u201d. \u201cOur government has strong action to address climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cAs an emitter of 1.7% of the globe\u2019s carbon emissions, I think Australia is really taking strong action to address that and we need to be proud of that instead of beating ourselves up about it and our regional communities. \u201cWe are taking strong action. People might not like the way we are doing it \u2026 but to say that we are not actually taking action because we don\u2019t have some sort of market mechanism that certain sides of politics prefer, we are actually getting the job done.\u201d But she said there was \u201cno question\u201d that climate change was affecting regional areas and had exacerbated the drought. The deputy prime minister Michael McCormack also defended the government\u2019s climate change position, saying the government was doing \u201cimportant things\u201d, while acknowledging there was community anxiety. \u201cAs it gets drier, the fact is that many Australians are worried, but we don\u2019t need to catastrophise things either,\u201d McCormack said.",

They are caused by mast cell activation syndrome, an immunological condition that forces Cormick to spend most of her life in a sealed \u201csafe\u201d room in her mother\u2019s Canberra house. Anyone entering Cormick\u2019s room has to go through a decontamination process, because many products derived from fossil fuels pose her serious danger. She lives in the house with her actor partner, and her safe room contains a positive-pressure air system, multiple air filtration devices and, by necessity, little furniture. Soon, Cormick will briefly journey to Sydney festival to perform her short, text-based show The Mermaid: both the story of her life and a metaphor for the poisoning of the planet. \u201cI had been treating my body as something I could exploit, without expecting to meet its needs,\u201d she recalls via Skype from her sealed room. \u201cI realised, like the world\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels and their impact on the planet, I had been treating my body with the same hyper-capitalist mindset.\u201d Cormick\u2019s performances will be staged at the Coal Loader in Waverton, a former coal plant turned into a sustainability centre on the waterfront. The Sydney trip has required detailed advanced planning. She had planned to stay in an eco-construction on a remote Blue Mountains property \u2013 the clean air of bush living is easier on her mast cells \u2013 but the bushfires sweeping through the state have presented high risks. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously in all our minds, given the current fires, but we haven\u2019t found a good back-up yet,\u201d she says, when emailed a follow-up question amid the haze this week. \u201cWe will probably have to find a less immunologically safe (but more fire-safe) location, and I would need to sleep in protective gear and my respiratory equipment and oxygen \u2013 which I\u2019ve been having to do with the smoke pollution right now anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s really painful \u2013 respirator masks are very painful to wear for long periods \u2013 but it\u2019s kept me breathing fine so far.\u201d Performing in public carries severe risks to her safety, too. At the start and end of her first performance of the premiere season of The Mermaid, in Canberra in March 2018, Cormick suffered seizures while sitting on the floor in front of her audience. \u201cIt can be really confronting, and I think not just to see these sorts of medical events; they don\u2019t always happen in the work, it is random,\u201d she says. \u201cThe audience also has to think about the way our own actions might be impacting others.\u201d The Sydney festival shows require audience members to be mindful of what they bring in with them \u2013 but the venue\u2019s naturally ventilated, outdoor harbourside location lessens the risk. \u201cThere have been times when patrons have been asked not to wear fragrance, makeup or hair products, especially indoors,\u201d says Cormick. \u201cAt other performances [such as in Sydney], they\u2019re asked to move to the back if they are wearing any of those products.\u201d Until 2015, Cormick had been enjoying a multiskilled acrobatic and acting career in Europe \u2013 including an arts residency in the south of France, working with circus in refugee camps on the Turkish-Syrian border, devising and rehearsing shows in Paris and performing with a troupe at the Edinburgh fringe festival. But she had been hiding a growing list of unexplained symptoms \u2013 weight and muscle strength loss, fainting and being out of breath \u2013 until \u201cthe crash\u201d of April that year: allergic reactions to all food, great pain and an inability to walk up a flight of stairs. Forced to return to Australia to rest and seek answers, her doctor raised the possibility Cormick was suffering a form of the debilitating genetic connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This bad news was just the beginning. This syndrome impacts not only joint mobility but, in more severe cases such as Cormick\u2019s, causes serious problems in every organ system: brain, heart, lungs, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, pelvic organs and veins. \u201cNow, my bones are coming out of their sockets many times every day,\u201d says the former contortionist, who was finally diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2017. The next year Cormick was diagnosed with \u2013 among other diseases \u2013 mast cell activation syndrome, the cause of her seizures; and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a form of orthostatic intolerance which can also cause her body to collapse. Her father has the same \u201ctrifecta\u201d, she says, and her mother has mast cell activation syndrome too. These days, when Cormick ventures outside her safe room in her wheelchair \u2013 \u201conce a week, once a fortnight, that kind of thing, usually for an hour at a time\u201d \u2013 she wears a respirator and relies on an oxygen tank to avoid seizure triggers. It is a \u201cbig operation\u201d, requiring multiple helpers, to ensure she is as safe from pollutants as possible. There is no treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but physiotherapy helps prevent deterioration. For postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, Cormick is on regular IV saline infusions and is weighing up getting a pacemaker fitted. Frequent injections of a high-dose drug, omalizumab, have decreased the frequency of Cormick\u2019s seizures, and she has the standard rescue medications for acute episodes: adrenaline, oxygen and albuterol. There are other immunotherapy medications that could help, she says, but they are restricted in Australia. \u201cSometimes it feels like you fight bureaucracy more than you fight the symptoms.\u201d Part of Cormick\u2019s motivation in creating The Mermaid was to confront her own past attitudes to disability. She says she will be forever grateful to the performer Liz Carr, who drew her attention to the concept of the \u201csocial model\u201d of disability, which holds that disability is caused by the way society is organised. \u201cThe circus industry, the dance industry are incredibly ableist spaces, and I had developed a damaging mindset that confused my values with what I could do, with my productivity, especially my physical abilities,\u201d Cormick says. \u201cThey are industries that foster the idea you can do anything if you try hard enough. Having the antidote of the social model was necessary for me to start unlearning that.\u201d \u2022 The Mermaid is at the Coal Loader from 17 to 19 January 2020. Sydney festival runs from 8 to 26 January",

She was trailed by the six House chairmen who have led the investigations into Trump since the party took control of Congress nearly one year ago. Each wore a solemn look, as if to emphasize that the gravity of the moment. </p> \n  <p>Pelosi began by thanking the chairman for their work over the last year, as the party has navigated special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference and then, later, impeachment. </p> \n  <p>Then Pelosi stepped away from the podium to welcome Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. </p> \n  <p>\u201cToday in service to our duty to the constitution and to our country the House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment, charging the President of the United States, Donald J Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Nadler said. </p> \n  <p>He outlined the two articles, which have been brought against a president only three other times in US history: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. </p> \n  <p>\u201cA president who declares himself above accountability, above the American people and above Congress\u2019 power of impeachment, which is meant to protect against threats to our democratic institutions is a president who sees himself as above the law,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe must be clear. No one, not even the president, is above the law.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Then House Intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff, who led the initial phase of the inquiry and oversaw two weeks of public hearings, stepped forward to offer the evidence underlying Democrats\u2019 charges against the president. </p> \n  <p>Schiff called impeachment an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d against presidential wrongdoing, and something he had been reluctant to support. \u201cThe actions of President Trump gave Congress no alternative.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe stand here today because the president\u2019s continuing abuse of his power has left us no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do nothing would make us ourselves complicit in the president\u2019s abuse of his high office, the public trust and our national security.\u201d </p> \n  <p>When Schiff finished speaking, the Democratic leaders filed out of the room in the same way they entered it, solemnly and without answering questions.</p> \n  <p>Less than an hour later, Pelosi is set to appear at a second press conference to announce that the US, Mexico and Canada have reached an agreement over a new trade deal (USMCA) \u2013 a top priority of the president that will give the president a major legislative victory as he runs for re-election next year. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4580d84b8cf232d9557a9164a2c8bb75a37b26b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4580d84b8cf232d9557a9164a2c8bb75a37b26b/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House Democrats announcing the articles of impeachment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">House Democrats announcing the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T14:48:22.821Z\">at 2.48pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5defacb68f08eda98155e7b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T14:37:23.469Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Trump just chose to tweet about the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, a press conference for which is slated to start at 10am.

Viz:</p> \n  <h2>House judiciary committee drafts articles of impeachment</h2> \n  <p>House Democratic leaders hold news conference Tuesday morning to announce at least two articles of impeachment against Trump.</p> \n  <h2>Judiciary committee votes on articles of impeachment</h2> \n  <p>The committee plans to vote on the articles on Thursday, each of which would have to be approved separately.<strong> </strong>The articles are expected to pass out of committee, where Democrats hold a 24-17 majority, along party lines.</p> \n  <h2>Full House debates articles of impeachment</h2> \n  <p>Upon arrival on the House floor, the articles would come in for debate. While House speaker Nancy Pelosi is in control of when debate begins and how long it lasts, the process could be delayed, temporarily, by Republican monkey-wrenching.</p> \n  <h2>Full House votes on articles of impeachment</h2> \n  <p>Each article is voted on separately, with a simple majority approval of any one article resulting in Trump\u2019s impeachment. With Democrats holding a 233-197 advantage in the House, and the one independent, former Republican Justin Amash, supporting impeachment, the articles are likely to be passed.</p> \n  <h2>Trump impeached</h2> \n  <p>If at least one article is approved by the House, Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. This could happen before a scheduled congressional holiday break beginning on 20 December.</p> \n  <h2>Senate trial</h2> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d599e9e2d1200ba90268a72d70073f10079bbc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d599e9e2d1200ba90268a72d70073f10079bbc/0_0_1024_694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from CNN on 12 February 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from CNN on 12 February 1999.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CNN/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>If Trump is impeached in the House, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial, likely to begin in January 2020.

A two-thirds majority vote to convict on any one article would be required to remove Trump from office.

The president is expected to sign an executive order to tackle anti-Semitism on college campuses that essentially defines Judaism as a nationality rather than a religion, according to the New York Times. 2020 updates: Pete Buttigieg unveiled his client list from when he worked at consulting firm McKinsey. Andrew Yang has become the first nonwhite candidate to qualify for the upcoming Democratic primary debate. Candidates have until Thursday at midnight to meet the qualifying criteria. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a \u201cblue new deal\u201d for ocean conservation. The latest Quinnipiac poll has Joe Biden leading, followed by Bernie Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg (in that order). Report: Trump plans to sign an executive order that effectively interprets Judaism as a nationality The president plans to sign an order that would withhold federal money from educational institutions that fail to combat anti-Semitism, the New York Times reports: The order will effectively interpret Judaism as a nationality, not just a religion, to trigger a federal law penalizing colleges and universities deemed to be shirking their responsibility to foster an open climate for minority students, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter before the announcement. In signing the order, Mr. Trump will use his executive power to take action where Congress has not, essentially replicating bipartisan legislation that has stalled on Capitol Hill for years. Prominent Democrats have joined Republicans in promoting such a policy change at a time of rising tension on campuses over anti-Semitism as well as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions or B.D.S. movement against Israel. The news has been met with skepticism and alarm from critics who worry the policy would interfere with free speech and cast any defense of Palestinian autonomy as anti-Semitic, among other things. In a news conference, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the Senate will vote on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) the impeachment trial concludes. House Democrats announced this morning that they had negotiated a deal with Trump to push the trade agreement forward. \u201cWe will not be doing USMCA in the Senate between now and next week,\u201d he said, adding that the pact is \u201cnot as good as I\u2019d hoped\u201d. His remarks are in stark contrast to messages from Donald Trump, his vice-president and his press secretary, who called the trade agreement \u201cthe biggest and best trade agreement in the history of the world\u201d. Relenting to pressure from critics, Buttigieg revealed the clients he worked with during his time at the consulting firm McKinsey. They include: insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield, Canadian supermarket Loblaws, technology retailer Best Buy, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the US Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, Energy Foundation, the US Postal Service and the US Department of Defense. What did he do? In an interview with The Atlantic, the South Bend, Indiana mayor said \u201c it was mostly on screens and paper. Math. Databases. PowerPoint presentations.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s work for Blue Cross Blue Shield has been especially scrutinized because the insurance company laid off hundreds of employees and increased premiums after bringing in McKinsey to identify cost-saving measures. The presidential candidate told The Atlantic that his work didn\u2019t lead to anyone losing coverage. He insisted that none of his work could have led to people\u2019s insurance changing, or being taken away. Because the Blue Cross Blue Shield work had been his first assignment, he said, he\u2019d been even more removed from any of the real substance of it, describing his work as feeding math into \u201ca PowerPoint that my manager would take and then bring to a partner who I imagine eventually presented something to a decision maker.\u201d As to whether advising on cutting costs led to people losing their jobs, Buttigieg said he\u2019d been moved off the project after three months, in 2007, years before the company made cuts that caused outcries. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the conclusions were or what it led to. So it\u2019s tough for me to say.\u201d A federal judge blocks Trump\u2019s plan to spend military funds on the border wall A US judge in El Paso, Texas, blocked Donald Trump\u2019s plan to spend $3.6bn in military funds on the border wall, ruling that the administration doesn\u2019t have the authority to reallocate funds earmarked by Congress for a different purpose. The Trump administration was planning to use the funds to build 175 miles of barrier. From the Washington Post: The Trump administration has budgeted nearly $10 billion for barrier construction to date, so the ruling affects roughly one-third of the money the president plans to spend on his signature project. Briones\u2019s decision does not apply to other money available to the administration, including reprogrammed military counter-narcotics funds. The ruling was the first instance of a local jurisdiction successfully suing to block construction of Trump\u2019s border barrier. Having reached the required threshold in a Quinnipiac poll released today, Yang qualified for the sixth primary debate on 19 December. The businessman is the only non-white candidate who has qualified at this point. He\u2019ll be joining Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren for the PBS NewsHour/Politico debate at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. There are a total of 15 Democratic candidates running for president, but only seven, including Yang, have qualified for this month\u2019s debate. Candidates have until Thursday at midnight to qualify for the debate. They have to show that they\u2019ve hit 4% in at least four national polls, or 6% in two early-state polls, and that they have 200,000 unique donors, with 800 of those from 20 different states. Trump says the articles of impeachment are \u2018very weak\u2019 Before dashing off to Pennsylvania for a rally this evening, Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House. He said the Democrats announced a deal on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in order to \u201cmuffle down\u201d their articles of impeachment. \u201cThey wanted to muffle down the impeachment because they were embarrassed by it and they couldn\u2019t get the votes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I call that the silver lining to impeachment, because without the impeachment, they would have never approved it, in my opinion.\u201d \u201cEven the Democrats, they couldn\u2019t find very much, because they put up two articles that frankly are very weak and they\u2019re very weak,\u201d he added. House Republicans accuse Democrats of ignoring their requests for a minority hearing on impeachment. In a letter to the House Judiciary chair, Jerrold Nadler, members of the conservative Freedom Caucus wrote that their requests for a minority hearing have not been addressed. \u201cWhen considering the unprecedented speed at which the majority is moving towards impeaching a duly elected president, a delay under these circumstances is tantamount to a denial of our right to a minority hearing,\u201d according to the letter, signed by 72 Republican representatives. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened this afternoon: The timeline of impeachment proceedings has become a bit clearer. The House judiciary committee said they will debate and vote on the articles of impeachment tomorrow and Thursday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the Senate will likely not touch impeachment before the holiday break, meaning that any trial in the Senate is likely to start in January. Lisa Page, a former FBI attorney, announced that she\u2019s suing the DoJ and FBI for releasing texts between herself and former FBI agent Peter Strzok. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had a press conference with Sergey Lavrov, Russian foreign minister. Pompeo said he told Lavrov that the Trump administration \u201cwill always work to protect the integrity of our elections\u201d. Lavrov said that any evidence of Russian interference in the US election is baseless. The House judiciary committee announced that they will debate and vote on the articles of impeachment tomorrow and Thursday. The Washington Post editorial board published an editorial in the wake of the release of the articles of impeachment that says there is enough evidence that the House should impeach Donald Trump, and he should get a full trial in the Senate. It is our view that more than enough proof exists for the House to impeach Mr. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, based on his own actions and the testimony of the 17 present and former administration officials who courageously appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. The Reckoning Crew, an influential, nearly all-female group of African American activists in South Carolina \u2013 a key state in the early primaries \u2013 has endorsed Joe Biden, a local South Carolina paper reported. The group had previously endorsed Kamala Harris, who dropped out of the race last week. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s support in South Carolina, particularly (among) African American voters is undeniable and unshakable,\u201d Bernice Scott, the group\u2019s leader and founder said in a statement. \u201cThroughout this race, he has taken hits from every angle and come out stronger. He has proven to us that he has exactly what it takes to beat Donald Trump next year.\u201d Donald Trump and Mike Pence will hold a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania \u2013 yes, the same as the candy \u2013 tonight. Crowds have already started to gather for the event that starts at 7pm EST. At this historic moment for America... A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. In the coming year, many vital aspects of American public life are in play \u2013 the supreme court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher \u2013 and the need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Bloomberg: \u2018Trump is just getting stronger\u2019 Billionaire and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg sat down with journalist Christiane Amanpour for an interview today and criticized his fellow Democratic candidates for not putting up a good fight against Trump. \u201cI think Trump is getting stronger and I think he\u2019d just eat alive the candidates,\u201d he said when asked why he joined the race. \u201cThey don\u2019t have plans that I think are practical, that can be implemented.\u201d Amanpour also asked Bloomberg about the tensions he may have with minority voters, especially black voters, given the controversial policies he implemented when he was mayor of New York City like \u201cstop and frisk\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in the election,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably said things that are embarrassing over the years.\u201d Bloomberg is trailing behind a few of his more liberal and fellow moderate counterparts, though he has spent over $100m on advertising since he joined the race 25 November. A poll from Monmouth University found 56% of registered voters from all parties view him as unfavorable versus 26% of voters who think he\u2019s favorable. A bit of 2020 news: The latest Quinnipiac poll was just released. Joe Biden is leading the pack and is up five percentage points since November. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg follow him in that order. Andrew Yang got 4%, meaning he qualified for December\u2019s debate. Biden still leads the pack for black voters, 51% of whom indicated their support for him in the poll. A federal judge in Georgia ruled today that Georgia governor Brian Kemp must answer questions about a comment he made on minority voter registration. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: U.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that the Republican governor will have to answer questions as part of a lawsuit filed by Fair Fight Action, an organization founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams, who unsuccessfully ran against Kemp in 2018. Prior to being elected governor last year, Kemp served as Georgia\u2019s chief election officer as secretary of state. The lawsuit accuses the secretary of state and election board members of mismanaging the 2018 election in ways that deprived some citizens, particularly low-income people and minorities, of their constitutional right to vote. It seeks substantial reforms and asks that the state be required to get a federal judge\u2019s approval before changing voting rules. ... Kemp\u2019s comments about minority voter registration happened at a Gwinnett County event in July of 2014, according to Jones\u2019 order. \u201cYou know the Democrats are working hard, and all these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines, if they can do that they can win this November. But we\u2019ve got to do the exact same thing,\u201d Kemp said at the time. He then encouraged attendees to help register more Republicans. Lawyers for the state argued that Kemp was simply pressing for greater Republican registration efforts to offset. Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page sues DOJ and FBI Lisa page, former FBI lawyer, is suing the Department of Justice and the FBI, alleging that the two agencies unlawfully shared private text messages between her and former FBI agent Peter Strzok with the media in December 2017. The lawsuit says that the justice department invited beat reporters to the DOJ to see the messages and would not allow anyone to reveal the department was their source. \u201cWhat they did in leaking my messages to the press was not only wrong, it was illegal,\u201d Page wrote on Twitter. The texts expressed fear over a Trump win during the 2016 presidential election and have been used by Trump as evidence that there is a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot against him in government agencies like the FBI. Trump has since mocked the relationship between Page and Strzok, even saying her name during a \u201cfake orgasm\u201d during a rally in October. McConnell says Senate impeachment trial before holiday break \u2018not possible\u2019 Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell just told reporters at the Capitol that a Senate trial or vote on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) before Congress breaks for the holidays is not possible. This means that an impeachment trial would have to take place after the New Year. People are still reeling from the comments attorney general William Barr made in an interview with NBC where he said the FBI investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign was done in \u201cbad faith\u201d, contradicting the report of his department\u2019s watchdog. Pompeo meets with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, is in DC today to meet with the Trump administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at joint press conference with Lavrov moments ago that he and Lavrov discussed a host of issues, including counter-terrorism, arms control between China, Russia and the United States and other foreign policy matters in Venezuela and Ukraine. He said they agreed on denuclearization of North Korea as a joint objective. Pompeo also said that he \u201cmade our expectation of Russia clear \u2013 the Trump administration will always work to protect the integrity of our elections.\u201d In his prepared remarks, Lavrov said \u201cwe have highlighted once again that all speculation about our alleged interference in domestic processes in the US are baseless. There are no facts that would support that.\u201d (Reminder that the Mueller report said that the Russian government believed they would benefit from a Trump presidency \u201cand worked to secure that outcome\u201d.) Lavrov is expected to arrive at the White House around 2.30pm this afternoon. Democracy is under attack \u2026 as are civility and truth. A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Lies infect the political discourse and hateful attacks on the media are commonplace. The US government incites fear and prejudice and undermines the judiciary. It sometimes feels like the truth is an endangered species. As we approach 2020, the need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play \u2013 the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. In 2020, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear \u2013 facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness. We\u2019re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you\u2019ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Lots has been happening on Capitol Hill today. Here\u2019s a quick catch-up on all that\u2019s been happening: House Democrats publicly released their two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, one for abuse of power and a second for obstructing Congress\u2019 investigation. Trump and co. have already responded by saying the House Dems are on a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and are trying to compensate for the 2016 election, but the House could bring impeachment to a vote as early as next week. If this all makes your head spin, here are some key takeaways from the articles brought for today. Almost an hour after the House Dems announced their article of impeachment, they scurried to another room in the Capitol to announce they made a deal with Trump on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal between the three countries. The deal includes their push for better worker and environmental protections. Attorney general William Barr told NBC News that the FBI was acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d when they were investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, directly contradicting the report that the DOJ\u2019s watchdog published yesterday that said the investigation was justified. Believe it or not, there\u2019s plenty more to come today, so stay tuned! In a just-published exclusive for NBC News, attorney general William Barr said that he believes the FBI acted in bad faith when it investigated collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, contradicting his department\u2019s watchdog. Here\u2019s more from the story: Barr essentially dismissed the findings of the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that there was no evidence of political bias in the launching of the Russia probe, saying that his hand-picked prosecutor, John Durham, will have the last word on the matter. \u201cI think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI think there were gross abuses\u2026and inexplicable behavior that is intolerable in the FBI.\u201d \u201cI think that leaves open the possibility that there was bad faith.\u201d Barr\u2019s blistering criticism of the FBI\u2019s conduct in the Russia investigation, which went well beyond the errors outlined in the inspector general report, is bound to stoke further controversy about whether the attorney general is acting in good faith, or as a political hatchet man for President Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is being asked some fun questions at an event in DC right now. On how she would describe her relationship with Trump: \u201cProfessional.\u201d On whether hearing that Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, admires her as a powerful leader surprises her: \u201cSurprise is not a word in my vocabulary.\u201d Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is at an event in DC hosted by Politico, taking the first batch of questions from Politico reporter Anna Palmer on impeachment since the articles of impeachment were announced this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day actually, a solemn day. It\u2019s something that no one comes to Congress to do, to impeach a president.\u201d Pelosi shrugged off a question of why the findings of the Mueller report weren\u2019t included in the articles of impeachment. \u201cI wish everyone just focused on what we are bringing forward because this is very serious violations of our constitution, undermining the national security of the United States, jeopardizing the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cInstead of talking about what isn\u2019t, this is what is, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d Pelosi is emphasizing that the impeachment isn\u2019t about the election, which the Republicans are arguing that it is, but instead it\u2019s about the Constitution and Congress\u2019 role in checks and balances. \u201cWe are saying goodbye to a republic... and saying hello to a king\u201d. House Republicans just wrapped up a press conference where they praised the finalization of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal while criticizing House Democrats, especially speaker Nancy Pelosi, for bringing forth articles of impeachment. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy of California delivered the usual Republican talking points about impeachment, but added that the only reason why Pelosi struck a deal over USMCA is because impeachment is unpopular. Of course public opinion on impeachment is heavily partisan, but the most recent polls show that a higher percentage of Americans support impeachment compared to the percentage of those who don\u2019t. Here\u2019s what some of Trump\u2019s friends are saying today in light of the articles of impeachment. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was at an event for the Wall Street Journal today and said that he will \u201cdo whatever the president wants us to do\u201d and is \u201cnot going to talk about the facts until the president tells me to\u201d. Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, said in a statement that \u201cthis is a sad and dangerous moment for the American political system\u201d, adding that the \u201cHouse Democrats are turning impeachment into a tool to be used when you don\u2019t like a president\u2019s policies or style. Republican US representative Jim Jordan of Ohio said the articles of impeachment are \u201cthe product of a baseless attempt to upend the will of the people less than 11 months before the election. Democrats remain in denial about the results of the 2016 election and our country\u2019s undeniable success under President Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d Next year America faces an epic choice ... and the results could define the country for a generation. A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened \u2013 democracy, civility, truth.

The text of the articles of impeachment say that Donald Trump should not only be removed from office, but should also be disqualified from holding \u201cany office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States\u201d again. While there is no mention of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the text of the articles of impeachment say that the president\u2019s actions around Ukraine were consistent with \u201cprevious invitations of foreign interference in the United States elections\u201d. The House just released the text of their two articles of impeachment. You can find them here. Back to impeachment: Trump\u2019s press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement this morning that called the articles of impeachment \u201ca baseless and partisan attempt to undermine a sitting president\u201d. Interesting point on the timing of the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal in light of questions on why the deal was announced the same day as the impeachment inquiry moves forward. Here are details of the negotiations, according to a release handed to reporters during the press conference: House speaker Nancy Pelosi was just asked whether it was a coincidence that the trade deal was announced the same day House Dems revealed their articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a coincidence, it\u2019s just as we get to the end of a session, there have to be some decisions made. The timetable for impeachment is the timetable of the committees, and that came to an end over the hearing yesterday. But for us, we didn\u2019t know what day this will be.\u201d When a reporter remarked that it must have been a long morning for House Dems, Pelosi remarked \u201cthe day is young!\u201d getting laughs from the room. An hour after House Democrats announced their articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, they are now announcing the details of the deal with Trump on his US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal between the three countries. At a press conference happening now, a group of House Dems are touting the changes they got through in USMCA, including stronger rules that will help litigate disputes and enforce worker and environmental protections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that US trade representative Robert Lighthizer is on his way to Mexico today to signed the agreement. Nearly an hour after House Democrats announced their two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Trump finally responded on Twitter. A second Tweet posted minutes after simply says \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d Trump then went off on House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff, who gave extensive justification for why the Democrats are moving forward with impeachment during the press conference. Here\u2019s a quick recap of what\u2019s happened this morning. House Democrats announced two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump: One for abuse of power and a second for obstructing Congress. Jerry Nadler, House judiciary committee, explained the articles at a press conference at the Capitol this morning. First with abuse of power: \u201cIt is an impeachable offense for the president to exercise the powers of his public office to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring or injuring the national interest. That is exactly what President Trump did when he solicited and pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election, thus damaging our national security, undermining the integrity of the next election, and violating his oath to the American people.\u201d And second with obstruction of Congress: \u201cPresident Trump engaged in unprecedented, categorical and indiscriminate defiance of the impeachment inquiry. ... A president who describes himself as above accountability, above the American people and above Congress\u2019 power of impeachment, which is meant to protect against threats to our Democratic institutions, is a president who sees himself above the law. We must be clear: No one, not even the president, is above the law.\u201d Report from the press conference Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi filed into a conference room with gold-trimmed mirrors and wood paneling. She was trailed by the six House chairmen who have led the investigations into Trump since the party took control of Congress nearly one year ago. Each wore a solemn look, as if to emphasize that the gravity of the moment. Pelosi began by thanking the chairman for their work over the last year, as the party has navigated special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference and then, later, impeachment. Then Pelosi stepped away from the podium to welcome Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cToday in service to our duty to the constitution and to our country the House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment, charging the President of the United States, Donald J Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Nadler said. He outlined the two articles, which have been brought against a president only three other times in US history: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \u201cA president who declares himself above accountability, above the American people and above Congress\u2019 power of impeachment, which is meant to protect against threats to our democratic institutions is a president who sees himself as above the law,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe must be clear. No one, not even the president, is above the law.\u201d Then House Intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff, who led the initial phase of the inquiry and oversaw two weeks of public hearings, stepped forward to offer the evidence underlying Democrats\u2019 charges against the president. Schiff called impeachment an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d against presidential wrongdoing, and something he had been reluctant to support. \u201cThe actions of President Trump gave Congress no alternative.\u201d \u201cWe stand here today because the president\u2019s continuing abuse of his power has left us no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do nothing would make us ourselves complicit in the president\u2019s abuse of his high office, the public trust and our national security.\u201d When Schiff finished speaking, the Democratic leaders filed out of the room in the same way they entered it, solemnly and without answering questions. Less than an hour later, Pelosi is set to appear at a second press conference to announce that the US, Mexico and Canada have reached an agreement over a new trade deal (USMCA) \u2013 a top priority of the president that will give the president a major legislative victory as he runs for re-election next year. Trump just chose to tweet about the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, a press conference for which is slated to start at 10am. No word from him about the articles of impeachment against him that was just announced. He is, instead, touting Democratic support for USMCA. Response from the Trump campaign \u2013 Trump himself has yet to comment on the articles of impeachment that were just announced: Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, laid out Democrats\u2019 argument for the \u201cwhy now\u201d question: Moment for the history books: House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler said at the press conference announcing the charges, \u201cWe must be clear: No one, not even the president, is above the law. \u201c House Democrats just announced two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump for committing high crimes and misdemeanors. One says that Trump abused his power by putting his political concerns over national interest, the second says he obstructed Congress\u2019 attempts to investigate. Friendly reminder that the 9am press conference is just the beginning of what will be a very busy day. Some reading from Julian Borger to pass the time before the big press conference at 9am, at which two articles of impeachment are expected, and to keep in mind later when Trump ventures once again into the world of diplomacy \u2013 what could possibly go wrong? \u2013 with a visit from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. At the time of writing, tensions are rising again with North Korea, which has been the subject of Trumpian threats, praise, handshakes and love letters but no discernible progress towards denuclearisation. Trump, Julian writes, \u201ccalled for the population of Seoul to be moved during an Oval Office meeting when tensions between the US and North Korea were at their height, according to a new book about the president\u2019s relations with the US military. In Trump and his Generals: The Cost of Chaos, the national security and counter-terrorism expert Peter Bergen also gives new details of Trump\u2019s demands that the families of US service members in South Korea be evacuated, which the North Korean regime would have interpreted as a clear move towards war. In both cases, Trump\u2019s impetuous diktats were ignored by his top officials. Bergen also recounts a familiar inspiration for one of Trump\u2019s demands: After watching a retired four-star general, Jack Keane, interviewed on Fox News in late January 2018, saying that US troops deployed to South Korea should not take their families with them, Bergen reports that Trump told his national security team: \u201cI want an evacuation of American civilians from South Korea\u201d. A senior official warned that such an evacuation would be interpreted as a signal that the US was ready to go to war, and would crash the South Korean stock market, but Trump is reported to have ignored the warning, telling his team: \u201cGo do it!\u201d Alarmed Pentagon officials ignored the order, and \u2013 according to Bergen \u2013 Trump eventually dropped the idea. It was one of a number of occasions that the defense secretary at the time, James Mattis, ignored direction from the White House. He also refused to send defense department officials to a planned Korea war game at Camp David in the autumn of 2017, or to provide military options for intercepting North Korean ships suspected of sanctions busting. Full report here: In terms of what comes next in the impeachment process, I can\u2019t think of much better to do than quote my colleague Tom McCarthy extensively. Viz: House judiciary committee drafts articles of impeachment House Democratic leaders hold news conference Tuesday morning to announce at least two articles of impeachment against Trump. Judiciary committee votes on articles of impeachment The committee plans to vote on the articles on Thursday, each of which would have to be approved separately. The articles are expected to pass out of committee, where Democrats hold a 24-17 majority, along party lines. Full House debates articles of impeachment Upon arrival on the House floor, the articles would come in for debate. While House speaker Nancy Pelosi is in control of when debate begins and how long it lasts, the process could be delayed, temporarily, by Republican monkey-wrenching. Full House votes on articles of impeachment Each article is voted on separately, with a simple majority approval of any one article resulting in Trump\u2019s impeachment. With Democrats holding a 233-197 advantage in the House, and the one independent, former Republican Justin Amash, supporting impeachment, the articles are likely to be passed. Trump impeached If at least one article is approved by the House, Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. This could happen before a scheduled congressional holiday break beginning on 20 December. Senate trial If Trump is impeached in the House, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial, likely to begin in January 2020. The only such trial to take place in modern US political history, against Bill Clinton in 1999, lasted just more than a month. A two-thirds majority vote to convict on any one article would be required to remove Trump from office. With Republicans controlling the Senate by a 53-47 majority, the defection of about 20 Republicans would be required to remove Trump. That seems unlikely. In the aftermath of the Department of Justice report about the Russia investigation Trump is also cross, oddly enough, about the FBI: I don\u2019t know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn\u2019t the one given to me. With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men &amp; women working there! As the Washington Post reports, Wray issued a statement on Monday in which he \u201csaid he had ordered more than 40 corrective steps to address the report\u2019s recommendations, adding that he would not hesitate to take \u2018appropriate disciplinary action if warranted\u2019.\u201d Trump also tweeted while apparently watching Fox News, writing: \u201cYou have to look at the 17 instances of misconduct cited in the Report, they are very bad. The FISA Court\u201d \u2013 which approved a surveillance request on Trump aide Carter Page \u2013 \u201cwas clearly taken for a ride on this, a failure of the FBI up and fown [soc] the chain of command. It\u2019s about as strong a medicine as I\u2019ve seen in a report of this kind in a very long time.\u201d Wray spoke to ABC on Monday, pushed back on the theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 election, a line being pushed by Trump supporters as impeachment continues. Wray said: \u201cWe have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d The president has fired an FBI director before \u2013 James Comey, in May 2017, in perhaps the single most consequential act of Trump\u2019s presidency, prior of course to the point when he found himself staring down the barrel of impeachment. Firing Comey didn\u2019t go well for Trump. So would he move against Wray, a man he appointed? Seems unlikely, but then so does everything in America under Trump, shortly before it happens. In his Tuesday morning tweets, Trump also took aim at some familiar characters from the Russia investigation: The FBI has had some dark day in its past, but nothing like this. This was VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE FBI.\u201d @brithume@BretBaier [both Fox News hosts] Are you listening Comey, McCabe, lovers Lisa &amp; Peter, the beautiful Ohr family, Brennan, Clapper &amp; many more? Andrew McCabe is a former deputy director of the FBI, fired by Trump. John Brennan was director of the CIA under Barack Obama, James Clapper director of national intelligence. All have become stringent critics of Trump. The \u201clovers Lisa &amp; Peter\u201d are Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer, and Peter Strzok, a former FBI agent, who had a relationship. Strzok was fired from the bureau in the fallout from the Comey firing. Page left. Here\u2019s what she said about that last week: \u2026and we have word from the president about how he feels on all of this: He has a point about the economy, which is very strong indeed if not necessarily the strongest ever but we\u2019ll let him off due to the uncharacteristic \u201cperhaps\u201d and the political point that the economy is bound to be a huge part of the election fight next year. The \u201cNOTHING wrong\u201d claim is, of course, harder to let pass. Republicans agree with their president, contending that pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a domestic electoral adversary is not wrong. In a briefing in September, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d. Here\u2019s some video of that, from CNN: On the flip side, Democrats contend that Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine \u2013 never mind the alleged obstruction of Congress \u2013 was very wrong. The lawyer Barry Berke put it this way at yesterday\u2019s hearing: If what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable. Hence the looming presser. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of another momentous day in American politics. A day after a judiciary committee hearing marked by outbursts and attempted obstruction from Republicans, House Democrats will hold a press conference on Capitol Hill at 9am, to unveil articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. Committee chairs Adam Schiff (intelligence), Jerry Nadler (judiciary), Eliot Engel (foreign affairs), Maxine Waters (financial services) and Carolyn Maloney (oversight) will attend. It\u2019s intriguing to note that they are all from either California or New York, big blue states. Expect pushback from Republicans around the idea that Trump\u2019s impeachment is a push against the \u201creal\u201d America, read red or Republican, which elected him in 2016. The articles of impeachment, which will be voted on in the House before any Senate trial, will concern abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump is being impeached over his attempts to have Ukraine investigate a political rival, Joe Biden, and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian intervention in the 2016 US election, rather than Russian. The obstruction charge relates to the White House\u2019s refusal to let senior aides to Trump testify to the impeachment inquiry. Trump began the day early, tweeting with characteristic glee about a report released on Monday by the inspector general of the justice department, into the FBI\u2019s handling of the investigation into links between Trump and Moscow and Russian election interference on his behalf. Each side of the aisle saw what it wanted to see in the report: Democrats hailed the conclusion that there was no political bias in the launching of the investigation, Republicans focused in on findings of procedural errors by the FBI. On the side of all that, Democrats seem set to give Trump a political win by agreeing to his new United States Mexico Canada trade agreement, or USMCA. Some opponents or critics of Trump wonder why he should be given a political win on this day of all days. Others suggest making a deal with the president will message well in 2020 races fought by moderate Democrats, showing that the party is not all about partisan warfare. Above all that, Trump is meeting the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, at the White House. One means to say\u2026 why not? The press conference is coming at 9am, anyway. In the meantime, here\u2019s some select reading from yesterday, a momentous day in US political history: Here\u2019s Julian Borger on the judiciary hearing: \u2026 and Tom McCarthy on what comes next: \u2026 and Luke Harding on an extraordinary part of the DoJ IG\u2019s report:",

to perform certain procedures or dispense certain drugs \u2013 such as abortion or the morning after pill \u2013 provided they refused to do so for all patients.</p> <p>Hunyor said he \u201cremains

particular groups \u2013 for example, by refusing to provide types of hormone treatment that benefit trans and gender diverse people\u201d.</p> <p>The chair of the Australian Medical Association ethics and medico-legal committee, Chris Moy, told the ABC that doctors \u201chave an obligation to the patient in front of us\u201d to treat or refer them for care and the AMA had an issue with the right to \u201cwalk away and not have anything to do with it\u201d proposed by the original bill.</p> <p>The right to conscientiously object creates \u201cinconsistency\u201d with ethical obligations \u201cwhere it\u2019s really not required\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Moy asked the government to consider scenarios such as \u201can individual needing a termination of pregnancy in a remote area with one

      "bodyText": "The St Vincent de Paul Society has asked not to be \u201cused\u201d to promote a new Coalition proposal to allow \u201cpublic benevolent institutions\u201d to discriminate against prospective staff based on religion, stating that it has no need to do so for its commercial activities. While unveiling a suite of changes to the government\u2019s religious discrimination bill on Tuesday, attorney general Christian Porter cited Vinnies \u2013 a lay Catholic organisation which runs charity op-shops \u2013 as an example of an institution that would benefit from extending exemptions to allow religious organisations to preserve their \u201creligious ethos\u201d. The new bill provoked a mixed reaction \u2013 it was praised by conservative religious groups, cautiously welcomed by employer groups which want further changes, and denounced by human rights, LGBTI groups and the Greens, which all warned it increases religious bodies\u2019 powers to discriminate. The Sydney Anglican church \u2013 which was one of the fiercest critics of the original bill among conservative churches \u2013 welcomed the bill, with archbishop Glenn Davies crediting the government for \u201c[taking] seriously the deeply-held views of people of faith\u201d \u201cIn particular, I am encouraged by a number of changes in the second exposure draft,\u201d he said. \u201cThe respect given to faith charities is an important model for the future harmony of Australian society.\u201d The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference also welcomed the second draft bill. But Claire Victory, the national president of the St Vincent de Paul Society, said that it \u201cdoes not require employees and volunteers working in the society\u2019s commercial activities to be Catholic\u201d. It had \u201cnever required this of people working in our shops\u201d nor at its secretariat, she said. \u201cCertain roles within our conferences and councils which have particular responsibility for overseeing our mission and Catholic ethos are usually filled by Catholics but may also be filled by people who share basic Catholic beliefs.\u201d The Public Interest Advocacy Centre chief executive, Jonathon Hunyor, welcomed the \u201cone positive, albeit limited change\u201d \u2013 reducing the range of professions who are able to conscientiously object to providing health services and clarifying that the provision is not meant to allow refusal to particular people or groups of people. The new bill will specify that it does not give a right to medical practitioners to discriminate against individuals based on gender or other characteristics. Nevertheless, doctors, pharmacists and other limited categories of medical practitioners could refuse to perform certain procedures or dispense certain drugs \u2013 such as abortion or the morning after pill \u2013 provided they refused to do so for all patients. Hunyor said he \u201cremains concerned that this may still allow doctors, pharmacists and others to refuse to provide specific types of services, where those services are used most commonly, or even exclusively by people from particular groups \u2013 for example, by refusing to provide types of hormone treatment that benefit trans and gender diverse people\u201d. The chair of the Australian Medical Association ethics and medico-legal committee, Chris Moy, told the ABC that doctors \u201chave an obligation to the patient in front of us\u201d to treat or refer them for care and the AMA had an issue with the right to \u201cwalk away and not have anything to do with it\u201d proposed by the original bill. The right to conscientiously object creates \u201cinconsistency\u201d with ethical obligations \u201cwhere it\u2019s really not required\u201d, he said. Moy asked the government to consider scenarios such as \u201can individual needing a termination of pregnancy in a remote area with one health provider who suddenly says they have this conscientious objection\u201d. Just Equal spokesman Rodney Croome said the government had \u201cheard the LGBTIQ community say we want the bill to allow less discrimination, and it gave us precisely the opposite\u201d. He called on Labor leader Anthony Albanese to reject the bill. Labor does not plan to elaborate on its position that the government should not \u201ccompromise existing anti-discrimination protections\u201d unless and until the bill is introduced to parliament. Hunyor said the second draft \u201cwidens the scope for religious organisations to discriminate when providing public (and publicly funded) services\u201d. \u201cReligious schools, charities and other organisations are given an almost free license to discriminate against people who do not share their religious beliefs. \u201cReligious hospitals, aged care facilities and accommodation providers are allowed to fire, or refuse to hire, people simply because of their religious beliefs.\u201d The new bill will also narrow the so-called \u201cFolau clause\u201d, so that employers are prohibited from setting a rule that indirectly discriminates on religion only where the rule is \u201cother than in the course of the employee\u2019s employment\u201d. Porter said the change was meant to prohibit rules regulating what employees said in their \u201cspare time\u201d but allow employers to continue to regulate activities connected to work, such as office Christmas parties. Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said the change \u201caddresses a key concern\u201d that it had raised in consultation but \u201cmore changes to the bill will be needed to address the genuine concerns of employers\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The decline of the British pub may be at an end, according to official figures showing that the number of pubs has increased for the first time this decade. The UK ended March 2019 with 39,135 pubs, 320 more than a year earlier, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). It is the first net increase since 2010. The rise marked a dramatic turnaround compared with the previous nine years, during which the UK pub network declined by an average of 732 each year, comparable data showed. The nascent revival could gather momentum after Tim Martin, the founder and boss of the Wetherspoon chain, announced plans to spend \u00a3200m on expansion, an investment he said would create 10,000 jobs. \u201cThe reduction of pubs over the last decade has been heart-breaking, following devastating changes to business taxes and alcohol duties, but I hope these figures signpost a reversal of fortunes,\u201d said Patrick Clover, chief executive of Leith-based hospitality industry software firm Stampede, which analysed the ONS figures. Stampede said the change may be down to pubs realising they can no longer rely on the \u201csame old regulars\u201d, instead improving their food menus, offering accommodation and events such as live music. Communities have also been exercising new powers to save their local from redevelopment, while former chancellor Philip Hammond introduced relief on business rates for some pubs, although he was criticised for exaggerating the scale of the relief. Nik Antona, chairman of real ale enthusiasts\u2019 group Camra, said: \u201cWe welcome this data that shows a slight increase in the number of open pubs nationally. \u201cUnfortunately pubs continue to close, particularly in small or rural communities. This means the loss of the social, cultural and economic benefits that come with a well run local. \u201cTo ensure pubs survive and thrive, they need a fair tax system and stability going forward.\u201d While the ONS figures showed an increase, industry trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) warned that its own statistics, which capture a higher number of pubs, showed a turning point was yet to be reached. \u201cWe would cautiously welcome any good news for pubs, however our own data suggests a higher base of pubs, and has shown higher closure rates for the last five years. \u201cIn the New Year we will be able to report 2019 pub numbers versus 2018.\u201d He added: \u201cIf people want to see pubs flourish, policymakers need to create the right environment for them to grow.\u201d The ONS estimated the total number of pubs at 39,135 in March 2019, while the BBPA published a figure of 47,600 at the end of 2018, down from 48,350 the year before. This is because government statisticians are thought to group some pubs together as single enterprises. But the BBPA has said it believed the rate of closures was slowing, while the increase charted in ONS numbers marked a dramatic reversal in a 10-year trend. The increase shown in the ONS numbers was driven almost entirely by a rise in the number of pubs in England, according to a regional breakdown of the figures. Wales ended the year with 25 fewer pubs, Scotland declined by five and Northern Ireland increased by the same amount but England recorded an increase of 345. The expansion was mainly thanks to larger pubs. Wetherspoon, which has 875 pubs, has been among the chains to capitalise by focusing on larger sites with a strong food offering. But Martin said the company\u2019s plan to invest \u00a3200m over four years would focus on investing in areas where pubs have been disappearing. \u201cWe are especially pleased that a large proportion of the investment will be in smaller towns and cities which have seen a decline in investment in recent years. The company will establish new pubs in Bourne, Waterford, Hamilton, Ely, Diss, Felixstowe, Newport Pagnell and Prestatyn, he said.",
